<p><span id="s3">Bradenton, Florida</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Today is Tuesday, June 10, 1986.</span> <span id="s5">I am at the house of Dr. Jacob Leinwand, in Bradenton, Florida.</span> <span id="s6">Dr. Leinwand has been kind enough to agree to make a taped interview of his experiences.</span> <span id="s7">He is a Holocaust survivor, and comes from Austria.</span> <span id="s8">We are going to ask Dr. Leinwand to start by telling us about his early life, his family, what his parents did for a living, if he had brothers and sisters, and other information that will help us understand him as an entire person.</span> <span id="s9">Please go ahead with your story, Dr. Leinwand.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">A: I was born September 1, 1909 in Lemberg, Austrian-Hungarian monarchy.</span> <span id="s11">It was...at that time it was the time of...of...Galicia, capital of Galicia, and at the age of three, we moved in...um...(background in a female voice...to...) we moved to...we moved to Austria, Vienna, and we lived in a district where quite a few Jews were congregated, and I stayed there...or, I lived there until...until 1938, when I had to leave Vienna because of the persecution of the Jews.</span> <span id="s12">Uh...I went to the...to all...the high schools and to the gymnasium in Vienna and I graduated in 1928 from the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s13">It was High School, sort of and was under the auspices of the Zionist organization and the founder of this Gymnasium was Zvi Peretz Chias, our Chief Rabbi of Vienna at that time.</span> <span id="s14">And...uh.</span> <span id="s15">.</span> <span id="s16">we were geared for the...later on I joined the Hashoner Hatzair, the Zionist Youth Organization, and we prepared to go...at that time, to Palestine.</span> <span id="s17">At the age of 14, my father persuaded me to stay in the High School Gymnasium, and to follow my education until 1928, when I graduated from the High School, at that time, before the Matura, and was accepted into the medical school of the university of Vienna, medical school, medical department.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: May I ask you a question?</span> <span id="s19">There were several things...were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: No, we were not...I was not an only child.</span> <span id="s21">I was the middle one.</span> <span id="s22">We were five children at home.</span> <span id="s23">I had an older brother, and then I had...I was a twin...but I had twin sisters, then came I, and then I had a younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And what did your parents do for a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Uh...in 1914...when the first World War broke out...was declared the war, my father, at the age of 39 or 40, had to go back to his kader and he was...became...unfortunately became the first prisoner of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Go back to his...what’s a kader?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What’s a kader?</span> <span id="s29">You said he had to go back to his kader...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: That’s where he had to be assembled...to go to war...</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Oh, I see...</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: That was a place...the first World War.</span> <span id="s33">And in the beginning of the war, he was taken a prisoner of war by the Russians and he was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s34">He spent about two years in Siberia and he was in the medical department...he was sort of in the laboratory division, and he got...I remember I was a very young man, about 5 or 6 years old, a child.</span> <span id="s35">And, I was very...and I was very...it was hard for me not to see my father until the age of 6 or 7.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: How did your family manage during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: At that time there was no social security or social services.</span> <span id="s38">Nothing.</span> <span id="s39">My mother took in roomers and we had some savings.</span> <span id="s40">My father had a factory before he left.</span> <span id="s41">And we struggled through it very well.</span> <span id="s42">In the post war, the situation was very terrible in Austria.</span> <span id="s43">We were deprived of all the things that young people had.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: You mention now that you got into medical school.</span> <span id="s45">Was there a problem at that point with Jewish people going into medical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: There was no problem.</span> <span id="s47">At that time it was a Socialist government in 1928 of Austria, and, once you passed your Matura examination, that means examination from the high school properly, that means you have to be admitted to any school you wanted.</span> <span id="s48">There was no...they couldn’t refuse you admission.</span> <span id="s49">To stay there was a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Well you had to earn the right to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: ...you had to earn...that’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: In your recollection, did you experience any anti-Semitism early on in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Not until there was a situation, just before Hitler came to power in 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Not even as a small child growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No, I was only 26 and was in medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Yes, but I am saying, as a small child did you experience anything that you would interpret as anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Actually not.</span> <span id="s58">Not...I don’t think...no.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did your family observe their religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: We were...yes, we went to the...for the High Holy Days.</span> <span id="s61">We had tickets.</span> <span id="s62">We went...to the...for Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s63">We had some get-together and went to the shul at that time.</span> <span id="s64">We had a Seder Passovers, just like average Jews, but we were not too religious.</span> <span id="s65">I went to the Cheder but we were...I was geared to join the Hashomer Hatzair, the Zionist Organization.</span> <span id="s66">We were geared for Palestine at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Now.</span> <span id="s69">After I went to school for over five years, I graduated in 1936 from the medical school University of Vienna.</span> <span id="s70">Now, naturally, at that time, it was already tough for Jews to get a position or a job in a hospital.</span> <span id="s71">Now, after the Anschluss, in 1938, I had to...I worked in the only hospital that was left for Jews to be treated.</span> <span id="s72">It was the Rothschild Hospital in Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Please explain briefly what the Anschluss was.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: The Anschluss was occupation and the annexation of Austria to the German Reich.</span> <span id="s75">Hitler was only in power since 1933.</span> <span id="s76">And the Anschluss came in 1938.</span> <span id="s77">The Anschluss came in 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Now, when I went...the only thing I was allowed to do was to work in this only Jewish hospital, the Rothschild Hospital, and to treat Jewish patients.</span> <span id="s80">At that time, quite a few Jews were admitted, especially in the outpatient department, with burns of the hands from acid because they had to scrub the floors under the Nazis’ direction...and monuments...different labor...and, at that time, like in every little...what do you call that?</span> <span id="s81">...let’s see...the Gauleiter...there was in every district, in every business there had to be a Nazi or the Gestapo representative in this place.</span> <span id="s82">In the hospital, in Vienna there was also a Nazi, and they had the authority to give out letters of necessity.</span> <span id="s83">For instance, like Dr. Jacob Leinwand...had...he is not...he has to work here...he is essential to our work.</span> <span id="s84">And, please, when he goes on the street, he should not be touched by anybody...and that.</span> <span id="s85">I kept on...with me...on my body...in my pocket.</span> <span id="s86">One day I was sent out to do something...to do some work.</span> <span id="s87">I went to see a patient and I had a..</span> <span id="s88">.</span> <span id="s89">I was at that time...I was in the Urology Dept..</span> <span id="s90">.</span> <span id="s91">being a physician at that time.</span> <span id="s92">I didn’t get paid, but I had to go to visit some patient and to do some work on them, like a nurse or aide, or orderly work...an assistant to the patient.</span> <span id="s93">And then, on my way home, I came to my District, but usually quite a few Jews are congregated, and the streets were completely empty.</span> <span id="s94">There was nobody there, and I was afraid to ask...the eratzia...That means, the Nazis were called SA and SS.</span> <span id="s95">They went to the houses and picked up...collected the Jews and then, in paddy wagons, and sent them to, at that time the concentration camp was Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Had that happened before?</span> <span id="s97">Before this particular time you are talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s99">Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: But you had heard of this happening elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: It was happening elsewhere.</span> <span id="s102">Most of the people were involved...like politically involved...but not those people who didn’t have any kind of connections...politics...who had lived by themselves.</span> <span id="s103">You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: After the Anschluss, and you have already described some of the changes that it made in your daily life...were the Jews forced to move into a kind of Ghetto situation, or were they allowed to remain wherever they had lived before?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: They were allowed to remain where they were before.</span> <span id="s106">There was no ghetto at that time.</span> <span id="s107">In fact, we had a small synagogue in our apartment where we used to live.</span> <span id="s108">We congregated there, and had, sometimes, there was no money anymore,...had...what you call it...soup...?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Soup kitchens?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s111">Soup kitchens, at that time.</span> <span id="s112">They were spread all over.</span> <span id="s113">Now, on my way home, as I said to you before, the streets were empty and, all of a sudden, I heard somebody patting my shoulder.</span> <span id="s114">“Can I speak a little German?</span> <span id="s115">Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s116">I said, “Yes”.</span> <span id="s117">“Are you an Austrian citizen?”</span> <span id="s118">I said, “Yes”.</span> <span id="s119">Because at that time all Austria was annexed and the Nazis, the Germans, did not want to start with any other nationality, even if they were Jews.</span> <span id="s120">Do you understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s122">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: And, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s124">I said, “Yes”.</span> <span id="s125">“Come with me.</span> <span id="s126">Come with me.”</span> <span id="s127">, he said.</span> <span id="s128">I took that letter out and showed him the letter.</span> <span id="s129">And he said to me, “Look, Doctor, I am reading your letter.</span> <span id="s130">You are all right with me.</span> <span id="s131">I will let you go.</span> <span id="s132">But, I am warning you, I cannot promise you that one of the Nazis,...” the Germans were still a distinction between the Austrians and the Germans at that time who were occupying Germany, that they will read your letter, read your advice...and I am warning you...I am really pleading with you to leave this country as soon as you can.”</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Where was your family at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: My family was all together.</span> <span id="s135">There were seven people together in one house.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: None of you had married?</span> <span id="s137">None of the children had married?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: My sister was in England at that time.</span> <span id="s141">She got a permit to be away, and my brother-in-law, at that time, was in a concentration camp at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: When this person said to you, “I advise you to leave”, did you take that as a serious warning?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Very, very, very serious.</span> <span id="s144">I know, that, at that time, quite a few people already tried to escape Austria and to go into neighboring countries.</span> <span id="s145">They went to Italy.</span> <span id="s146">They went to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s147">They went to Hungary and to Yugoslavia and to the...all the other neighboring countries...to Finland, Norwegian, Sweden.</span> <span id="s148">They went all over to try to escape Austria, but I went from one consulate to the next.</span> <span id="s149">In fact, I want to tell you something.</span> <span id="s150">I was registered at the American consulate for emigration...I was on the waiting list under the Polish quota.</span> <span id="s151">It was terrible at that time to wait.</span> <span id="s152">So I went from one consulate to the next and I couldn’t find it, except in the small...there was a small, little country, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s153">This small country, said, “Yes, you are a physician, yes...we have a population of 300,000 people.</span> <span id="s154">We can only take in 10% of our population.</span> <span id="s155">The government lets us 10% of our population to get into this country for refuge...to escape Nazis.”</span> <span id="s156">So, I went home right away, and called one of the...I didn’t take my brothers, but I took my best friend.</span> <span id="s157">We packed our rucksack.</span> <span id="s158">We left everything there.</span> <span id="s159">I said “good-bye” to my mother.</span> <span id="s160">She said, “Well how long can Hitler last?”</span> <span id="s161">Nobody would believe that Hitler will live such a..</span> <span id="s162">.</span> <span id="s163">survive...this situation and never come back...so, in the meantime...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So, they didn’t feel threatened?</span> <span id="s165">Your parents didn’t feel threatened?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: They felt threatened.</span> <span id="s167">But, you know, with older people, they were in their sixties, it is very, very hard to get yourself away, and they figured, well, maybe...in the (words missing in original transcript) meantime, they took in only the younger people in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s168">That was (words missing in original transcript) at that time.</span> <span id="s169">It was about ’38, right after the Anschluss.</span> <span id="s170">The Anschluss was March 12, 1938.</span> <span id="s171">And, now, we went back...we took the train from Vienna and we went through Germany on the train, crossing the border up to Trier, that was a border town between Luxemburg and Vienna...uh...between Luxemburg and Germany.</span> <span id="s172">And, I didn’t take my Austrian passport with me.</span> <span id="s173">I took the International Students’ Service book and...the students are very highly regarded in Europe at that time.</span> <span id="s174">They know nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s175">And, in the corridors of the trains, we saw quite a few of the Nazis, S.A. walking back and forth and looking at everybody, and asked me, “What are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s176">We are almost entering the war, and, “We are going to Luxemburg, we want to go...we have a convention there.”</span> <span id="s177">We were young at that time...and in our twenties...they said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s178">They didn’t do anything then.</span> <span id="s179">But...there was something fishy about them...about us.</span> <span id="s180">And, just before we came to Trier, which is the border line between Austria.....between Vienna......between Germany and Luxemburg, they came to us...the Nazis.</span> <span id="s181">They frisked us to find out if we had anything on us.</span> <span id="s182">They said, “Get out, you Jews.”</span> <span id="s183">Then, they found out they never saw (words missing in original transcript) Jews in their life before.</span> <span id="s184">“Get out.”</span> <span id="s185">So we went out.</span> <span id="s186">There was only one...one train from Trier to Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s187">Across the border...</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You were probably happy to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: I came.</span> <span id="s190">I fell on my knees and kissed the earth.</span> <span id="s191">Because I knew I was safe.</span> <span id="s192">But I had a terrible guilt complex because of this.</span> <span id="s193">Because I am saved and my brothers and my sister are there and my parents are there.</span> <span id="s194">How can I, how can I help them?</span> <span id="s195">So, we met with friends here and we were supported at that time by the EZRA.</span> <span id="s196">EZRA was part of the Joint Distribution Committee of the States, the United States, the Jewish, and they sent money...support...they knew what was going to happen...they know more than we did...they tried to help us.</span> <span id="s197">And, with those special funds for us, we were put up in a nice hotel.</span> <span id="s198">We had good food.</span> <span id="s199">Everything was taken care of.</span> <span id="s200">But, we were not allowed to work because the population was so small and foreigners coming in taking some jobs away that time, that they wouldn’t let us work.</span> <span id="s201">So, I couldn’t do nothing about it.</span> <span id="s202">In the meantime, I found out that, I have to...I got a letter from my parents and from my sister, that her...husband,,,husband to be...was in Dachau in a concentration camp...and the only way for him to get out was to send him tickets to leave Europe from Dachau.</span> <span id="s203">It goes off to Africa.</span> <span id="s204">So, I was running to get it.</span> <span id="s205">And I sent a ticket.</span> <span id="s206">He went to Morocco, to Niger.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: They really would let you out of a concentration camp if you had passage to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: At that time, yes.</span> <span id="s209">It was just in the beginning.</span> <span id="s210">It was not before the Crystal Night, Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s211">You have probably heard about it...</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Before that time, there was still a little bit of good...the Germans, until 1933 till 1938, they could leave Germany with all their belongings, with all their money.</span> <span id="s214">Later on, they were glad they could get out alive, you know.</span> <span id="s215">That was...</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: With the clothes on their backs...</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: The worst things happened, I guess, in 1942 when I was here already.</span> <span id="s218">So, then, it was all right for 1½ years, from 1938.</span> <span id="s219">I was there in July 1938 until 1939 I had to do something with my two brothers to save them.</span> <span id="s220">So, I went to the government there in Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s221">I told them I have two brothers and I want to save them.</span> <span id="s222">So, they said, ‘We still have open.”</span> <span id="s223">So, I got my younger brother out.</span> <span id="s224">Henry.</span> <span id="s225">And I sent him.</span> <span id="s226">I called and sent him a ticket and said, “Come right away.”</span> <span id="s227">“Come right away and come in here.”</span> <span id="s228">So, he came.</span> <span id="s229">He left his parents and he was with me, in Luxemburg.</span> <span id="s230">And, then I had an older brother, too.</span> <span id="s231">I went to the Committee, and want to save another brother.</span> <span id="s232">I have one more brother.</span> <span id="s233">It was a small country.</span> <span id="s234">They were very congenial.</span> <span id="s235">And, it was...on Yom Kippur night.</span> <span id="s236">I met some...we were invited to break the fast...by people who owned a store...a big department store...and his wife was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s237">She had even a cross...and she said, “What’s the matter, Jack why are you so sad?”</span> <span id="s238">“I am terribly upset.</span> <span id="s239">I want to get my brother out of there...how could I do it?”</span> <span id="s240">So, she told me, “Don’t worry.</span> <span id="s241">Let him come to the border in Trier, and I, as a Christian, will go over the border and bring your brother over here.”</span> <span id="s242">Now, they couldn’t remain there any more because the border...they gave a transit visa for one night to stay in Luxemburg, and then, we shipped him into Belgium, so he was safe.</span> <span id="s243">So now, my older brother was safe, and my younger brother was with me.</span> <span id="s244">We lived there until, from ’38 until September 1, 1939.</span> <span id="s245">September 1, 1939 was the date the war was declared between Austria, between Germany and England and France at that time.</span> <span id="s246">The war was on and I was in a defenseless country in Luxemburg...and I figured, “Oh, no, I will not remain in a defenseless country.”</span> <span id="s247">There was no army.</span> <span id="s248">They were a small country and my best bet would be to leave as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s249">Where to go, I did not know.</span> <span id="s250">But, my brother and I, we decided to go into France, and we would be behind the Maginot line.</span> <span id="s251">Remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Yes, they thought it was going to be a very safe place to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">I go behind the Maginot line and, we were, at that time, we went to...Nice...not Nice...it was Nancy.</span> <span id="s255">It was a little French town...small Nancy...and we figured, now we are behind the Maginot line...we will probably be safe, and we went to the prefecture...the prefecture was the police department in France.</span> <span id="s256">Have you been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: And, in France, we went to the prefecture, and told him our story, that we just came over from across the border and we wanted to join...we had both decided...we want to join the French army to fight Hitler.</span> <span id="s259">We were young at that time.</span> <span id="s260">And, the policeman commanded us “What kind of a..</span> <span id="s261">.</span> <span id="s262">what nationality are you?”</span> <span id="s263">And we said, “We are Jews.”</span> <span id="s264">‘But, what nationality are you?”</span> <span id="s265">“We are Austrians.”</span> <span id="s266">“Oh, no.</span> <span id="s267">As Austrians you are our enemy alien...and we give you a choice.</span> <span id="s268">Either you join the French Foreign Legion or you remain here as a prisoner, a civil prisoner of war...in a camp...in a what do you call it...”</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: In an internment camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: In an internment camp.</span> <span id="s271">To be in an internment camp.</span> <span id="s272">We grant you that you came with the best intentions to the...but we can’t help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: You must have been very disappointed at that response.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Well, I was disappointed...I..</span> <span id="s275">.</span> <span id="s276">uh...my brother stated, if we have to die, we are going to die in Europe, not in the French Foreign Legion.</span> <span id="s277">We can never get out.</span> <span id="s278">So, we were interned there.</span> <span id="s279">And, I met the Commander of the camp.</span> <span id="s280">I told him my story.</span> <span id="s281">“Look, I came back with the best intentions, to serve

Alsace-Lorraine at that time, they had the Maginot Line was switching over.</span> <span id="s285">Sometimes, in previous years, they were in Germany, then it belonged to France.</span> <span id="s286">So, he was bilingual.</span> <span id="s287">He understood my tensions.</span> <span id="s288">He said, “I can’t help you...” and, then there was was a....what do you call it...a sergeant...he was a real Frenchman...there were no exceptions.</span> <span id="s289">That man has to make the labor for them to put in terrible?</span> <span id="s290">floors in the fort...that was fortified, you know, because there was a borderline against Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: But they didn’t want to use your services as a doctor in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: At that time...at that time...nothing.</span> <span id="s293">But the commander was very bright and said, “Let’s wait.</span> <span id="s294">I have to wait for my superior, who was a colonel, when he comes from the bigger town, from Alsace.</span> <span id="s295">He will come and we’ll tell him your story.”</span> <span id="s296">He came into my...he came up and he introduced me as a physician to the camp commander, who was a colonel.</span> <span id="s297">He was very smart-looking, tall, highly intelligent.</span> <span id="s298">I didn’t speak his language and he didn’t speak my language.</span> <span id="s299">He spoke French and I spoke, at that time, only German.</span> <span id="s300">We had a good connection there, because the Commander spoke both languages, and, after he told him the story, he shook his head and he took off the Red Cross band and put it on my arm, and told me, “You’ll be the doctor of this internment camp.</span> <span id="s301">You’ll be the physician with al, the privileges attached.”</span> <span id="s302">So, they gave me an infirmary, and I was sleeping in the infirmary, and you know who was my assistant?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Your brother, I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Oh, you are smart.</span> <span id="s305">I made my brother my assistant here and I was eating at the officers’ mess, you know.</span> <span id="s306">For Christmas, I was given presents, and, one thing I didn’t know, I had to join them, in the morning at 10 o’clock to drink Pernod---that was a heavy drink with coffee and Pernod.</span> <span id="s307">But, I had to play the game with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: It doesn’t sound like such a bad game.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: No.</span> <span id="s310">That was already in 1939...yah, 1940,1940.</span> <span id="s311">In 1940, in the beginning, there was building a Rothschild Committee in Paris, France...and in some internment camps were all over France, because there were very few refugees there already, and they had to be assembled because they were not fighters.</span> <span id="s312">They would not let them join the French army and some had been in the French Foreign Legion actually, and some had died there.</span> <span id="s313">So they came to my camp and interviewed me and said to me, “Do you have affidavits?”</span> <span id="s314">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s315">“Where are your affidavits now?”</span> <span id="s316">The affidavits have been sent from Vienna.</span> <span id="s317">The American Consulate transferred them to Antwerp in Belgium.</span> <span id="s318">Luxemburg, itself, didn’t have a consulate.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: What were the affidavits for?</span></p> <p><span

to take my physical, and to get my visa to the United States.</span> <span id="s333">Only I got it, not my brother.</span> <span id="s334">I guess they were looking for physicians.</span> <span id="s335">Roosevelt already was preparing already was preparing for the war.</span> <span id="s336">And, but I was still a prisoner in some ways.</span> <span id="s337">I was interned.</span> <span

An escort.</span> <span id="s341">Soldier, who was (my wife is in the room).</span> <span id="s342">An escort soldier.</span> <span id="s343">He was so happy to go with me to Paris, to get away from that line there.</span> <span id="s344">I can see his radiating face yet.</span> <span id="s345">And, finally, I went to the consulate.</span> <span id="s346">That was his job (words missing in original transcript) most times.</span> <span id="s347">But he couldn’t let me off.</span> <span id="s348">I was examined.</span> <span id="s349">I got my visa but now I need transportation.</span> <span id="s350">I need transportation.</span> <span id="s351">Where shall I go?</span> <span id="s352">And I was assigned to an embarkation camp to wait for the fare, to wait for the trip...to Bordeaux, France, southern part of France, in Bordeaux.</span> <span id="s353">Now, I was again, the same thing as when I start, a prisoner.</span> <span id="s354">They didn’t select me as a physician because of the short stay.</span> <span id="s355">They were only there for embarkation and waiting for transportation.</span> <span id="s356">And I became quite ill there.</span> <span id="s357">I had either pneumonia or tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s358">I had to be admitted to the hospital.</span> <span id="s359">Admitted.</span> <span id="s360">Oh, my God!</span> <span id="s361">What am I going to do now?</span> <span id="s362">I am waiting for transportation while in the hospital.</span> <span id="s363">So, I was pleading with the chief medical officer.</span> <span id="s364">“Please.</span> <span id="s365">Let me go!</span> <span id="s366">Never mind the chart, what it says.</span> <span id="s367">I have to go, because I got to get really better.</span> <span id="s368">I was young.</span> <span id="s369">Because I am waiting for transportation.”</span> <span id="s370">And finally, I got my...uh...I was supposed to leave from St. Nazaire, France, with the S.S. Champlain.</span> <span id="s371">The boat was S.S. Champlain from St. Nazaire, France, to the United States.</span> <span id="s372">I have to be there on May 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: May 10, 1940.</span> <span id="s375">America was not at war yet.</span> <span id="s376">And, then, I came to the...In 1940, May 10, there was already something...the Panzer division of Germany.</span> <span id="s377">They were starting in...they didn’t...there was an attrition between the Maginot Line; on one side, the French, and on the other side, the Germans.</span> <span id="s378">In the meantime, Hitler had already started to rumble with the Panzer division.</span> <span id="s379">They went around the Maginot Line into...into Holland, and from Holland, down south to Belgium and from Belgium into France.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: That was something that they never anticipated.</span> <span id="s381">That they would go around the Maginot Line.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well you know the story about the Maginot Line.</span> <span id="s383">So, I got transportation with a bus.</span> <span id="s384">We were maybe 10-15 people on a vacation, going to join some people in St. Nazaire.</span> <span id="s385">We are going up North from the Southern part, and they are coming down...all the refugees are coming down from the North, down South to save themselves, because Hitler was following.</span> <span id="s386">Some of them were shaking their fists.</span> <span id="s387">Said, “What are you doing?</span> <span id="s388">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s389">Are you going to fight us?”</span> <span id="s390">In the meantime they didn’t realize that we are going to St. Nazaire to the boat dock.</span> <span id="s391">So, we boarded the S.S. Champlain.</span> <span id="s392">We were completely blacked out because the bombers were already rolling...the German bombers over France, and we boarded the boat, May 10, 1940.</span> <span id="s393">I remember it like today.</span> <span id="s394">It took us seven days, a week, to go...to arrive in New York harbor.</span> <span id="s395">May 17, 1940, we arrived in New York harbor.</span> <span id="s396">In the meantime, we were completely blacked out.</span> <span id="s397">I had the address and telephone number of my cousins, in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s398">Do you know New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Yes, I used to live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: In the Bronx.</span> <span id="s401">On the Grand Concourse.</span> <span id="s402">But I couldn’t do anything there.</span> <span id="s403">Meantime, we had the National Council of Jewish Women were there, and some other...HIAS was there...</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Hebrew International Aid Society?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s406">To give us a hand, to do something.</span> <span id="s407">So I told them I am...uh...they said, “Right, now we can do nothing.</span> <span id="s408">We will give you...you have to take a cab and go to the shelter at 425 Lafayette Street.”</span> <span id="s409">There was a shelter of the HIAS at that time.</span> <span id="s410">So, what am I going to do, I had a few shillings with me...the cab driver was so mad.</span> <span id="s411">I gave him all my money.</span> <span id="s412">He took me to the shelter at 425.</span> <span id="s413">In the meantime...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Why wouldn’t they let you make phone contact with your cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Wait a second...they had to register me first.</span> <span id="s416">When I came there, to Lafayette Street, I figured, well, I am going to call them.</span> <span id="s417">There was no answer.</span> <span id="s418">In the afternoon, no answer.</span> <span id="s419">Well I knew that this was a broken English.</span> <span id="s420">I took the subway.</span> <span id="s421">Went to the Grand Concourse.</span> <span id="s422">I went up on the seventh floor where they used to live.</span> <span id="s423">I rang the bell.</span> <span id="s424">There was nobody home.</span> <span id="s425">There were two single girls...I thought, “My God, in America--you are working.”</span> <span id="s426">I didn’t realize you have to work in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Laughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: So, I went back to Lafayette Street and I told the receptionists.</span> <span id="s429">They called and they called.</span> <span id="s430">Then they thought, “We are going to fix them.”</span> <span id="s431">They sent a night letter telegram to 1939 Grand Concourse.</span> <span id="s432">And, the next morning, I got a call from them and they picked me up and took me to their home.</span> <span id="s433">Now I was safe in America.</span> <span id="s434">Now, I got the bad feeling after what happens to you, the remorse and the terrible guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s435">I am here safe and all my family are not.</span> <span id="s436">I didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: You got out just in the nick of time, it seems.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: I was lucky.</span> <span id="s439">There were no boats anymore.</span> <span id="s440">Because Hitler invaded all of France.</span> <span id="s441">Occupied part of France and unoccupied part of France.</span> <span id="s442">The Vichy France, if you remember, and the other part.</span> <span id="s443">Now, I am here.</span> <span id="s444">What shall I do?</span> <span id="s445">I got to get a job.</span> <span id="s446">You know, in America you cannot stay.</span> <span id="s447">They are very nice to me, the Americans...they gave me a quarter to go to the movies to get some...at that time they didn’t have any air-conditioning like now.</span> <span id="s448">The only time to cool off was...it was already May.</span> <span id="s449">The first thing I noticed when I arrived in New York Harbor was the terrible humidity.</span> <span id="s450">In May, humidity!</span> <span id="s451">Coming from Europe, there is no humidity...so, in the meantime, in the next couple of weeks, two weeks, there was a resettlement of foreign physicians, to see if they can’t place some doctors as interns...not in a big...in New York City you couldn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s452">There was no places to get an internship, residency or even running the elevators in the hospital, being on an emergency crew...you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s453">So, my cousin took me (words missing in original transcript) to go to Macy’s.</span> <span id="s454">to buy a beautiful suit.</span> <span id="s455">A young man, 29 years old, you look good and you have an appointment there to meet all the Superintendents from different hospitals.</span> <span id="s456">They came from the mid-West.</span> <span id="s457">From all over, from the middle West and selected people.</span> <span id="s458">So, within two weeks, or one week I got a letter, from St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Lafayette, Indiana, “You are hereby appointed intern, as of July 1, 1940 to July 1, 1941.”</span> <span id="s459">Now that’s a good thing, already.</span> <span id="s460">I went to the middle West.</span> <span id="s461">I had a roommate there.</span> <span

different...</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: In those days, people who had medical school education in Europe were considered to have far better training than people who were trained in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: That is another story.</span> <span id="s468">I will tell you.</span> <span id="s469">When the war broke out...no, even before the war broke out, in 1940, Pearl Harbor was December 7, 1941, there was a..</span> <span id="s470">.</span> <span id="s471">and I sent a letter to the Surgeon General’s office.</span> <span id="s472">I wanted to join the American army.</span> <span id="s473">I got a beautiful letter from the Surgeon General’s office, from Washington D.C., “Dear Doctor Leinwand: Due to your recent arrival in the United states, and not being an American citizen, and not being a graduate of a Canadian or American medical school, we cannot avail ourselves of your loyal offer of services.”</span> <span id="s474">But, at that time, you had to register for the draft.</span> <span id="s475">With this letter, I went to the draft, in Lafayette, Indiana.</span> <span id="s476">They told me, “Doctor, as long as you stay in this hospital, during the wartime, we will not draft you as a private.</span> <span id="s477">You are more valuable for us to be a doctor in the hospital than a private in the Army.”</span> <span id="s478">So, I stayed there until the war was over.</span> <span id="s479">Then, in 1944, I got my license to practice medicine in New York State and then I went to different hospitals and then I married for the first time in 1947.</span> <span id="s480">I was up in Ft.
