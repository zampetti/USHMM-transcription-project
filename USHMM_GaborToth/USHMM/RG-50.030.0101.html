1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: [Born in Grodno, April 11th 1929 (phrases missing)] ...small town considering in con...in the context of American cities, it was a small town.</span> <span id="s12">But a town that had a lot of educational uh establishments and the opera would, for instance, come and perform.</span> <span id="s13">Uh I never traveled very much as a child except for the in into the immediate outskirts and I came from a family where there was a great deal of love and a great deal of concern and a great of care and that continued until our total separation which came actually in 1940... in 1941 for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Tell me a little bit about your, about your friends, growing up?</span> <span id="s15">What was school like?</span> <span id="s16">What kind of schools did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: I have attended a number of different schools, probably because my mother and father were looking at what was the best educational outlet rather than a particular school.</span> <span id="s18">I went to a Hebrew school uh which I didn't like terribly much.</span> <span id="s19">and them my sister and I spent about a year or two in Catholic school.</span> <span id="s20">There were only five or six children and we had, strangely enough for Poland at that time, uh Hebrew instructions.</span> <span id="s21">But there was an excellent private school and then after that I attended a gymnasium (ph) and my formal education per se actually was abruptly stopped in my fifth grade level.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: What about friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Well, I was - my sister was a great hot-head (ph).</span> <span id="s24">She was a champion - champion skater, champion swimmer.</span> <span id="s25">She was very musical - played a number of instruments.</span> <span id="s26">I was given piano lessons, ballet lessons.</span> <span id="s27">I was particularly interested in the theater.</span> <span id="s28">And during the Russian occupation from 1939 to 1941, uh the Russian authorities go after talent and recognize it or want to recognize it at a rather early stage.</span> <span id="s29">So they said to my parents, we're not interested in how well she will do academically.</span> <span id="s30">We have discovered that she has a very lovely voice and she's very musical and she dances well and she does very on stage - we are going to overlook her theatrical career.</span> <span id="s31">And so I sang as a soloist at the age of ten with all the major choirs.</span> <span id="s32">I designed and choreographed some ballet without knowing anything about it.</span> <span id="s33">It was just a natural outlet, you know.</span> <span id="s34">Uh I played with a lot of my friends.</span> <span id="s35">We would invent some wonderful plays.</span> <span id="s36">It wasn't a store-bought toy.</span> <span id="s37">We would play house.</span> <span id="s38">We would play uh I remember reading a great deal in addition to Pushkin and in addition to the other authors a lot of the movie magazines, and so we pretended that I was greta Garbo and my friend would be Marlena Dietrich and we would just go on that way and get some carrots and potatoes from our kitchens and pretend that we were homemakers and children and all that.</span> <span id="s39">So we really had a very kind of a free, delightful uh existence, in spite of the fact that the anti- Semitic climate was very strong, very strong, and I was, we were all rather blue-eyed, blonde, fair-hair, so that no, people who didn't know that I belonged to a synagogue, that my parents did, that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s40">But there were pogroms, quite a few of them, and I kept asking why, what's what what's going on?</span> <span id="s41">It's very hard for parents to explain because we believe in a different religion or we belong to a to a synagogue rather than a church that people don't like you.</span> <span id="s42">And so I grew up both on one level uh happily because I was loved and protected and got the best possible education that I could through my parents, and family life was very important and I imagine that kind of upbringing and that kind of rooted embedded uh understanding of my parents that they gave to both my sister and myself, probably helped me a great deal later on to have that base, that strength of knowing who you are.</span> <span id="s43">Without understanding it, without going into other philosophical discussions about that.</span> <span id="s44">And so that I grew up like I suppose like I - we did not live in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s45">We lived in a perfectly beautiful apartment near the river Niemen (ph).</span> <span id="s46">Uh my mother was more religious than my father and we were religious I suppose like everyone else without being fanatic about it.</span> <span id="s47">And my childhood was really quite free of any worries except for the fact that I started to recognize that there were stones being thrown at our windows towards 1938, 1939, and uh I was also told that on Passover which was very beautiful in our home, and my father would, I'm sure to the dismay of my mother invited half of the people who had nowheres to go to our home so they could share that special evening with us, that the Christian children were told that the Jews drink the blood of Christian children during the Passover Seder.</span> <span id="s48">And it was just something that a child, even as an adult I cannot quite comprehend.</span> <span id="s49">But that's the kink for archaic teaching that essentially, eventually with ignorance led to the disaster of the catastrophe of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s50">So when you ask me what was my childhood I can describe it in terms by saying that it was a pleasant, delightful, carefree surrounded by a lot of love and a lot of attention and the hand-writing, even as a child without understanding, were already lingering in the in the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: When did this change?</span> <span id="s52">When the Russians came, what else happened to you, to your life in addition to the special school?</span> <span id="s53">Were there any other changes from '39 to '41 that you noticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Yes, as a matter of fact not understanding what Stalin stood for, not understanding political uh politics per se, I loved being there at that time because the pogroms have stopped.</span> <span id="s55">I was indited into what they called the Pioneer, the Young Pioneers Group.</span> <span id="s56">They showered a great deal of attention on the children because that's the way they get them.</span> <span id="s57">My parents probably were dismayed and couldn't do anything about that.</span> <span id="s58">My father I believe was imprisoned for about three or four months because he must, he was, he must have said - I didn't really know why, but it was obviously for political reasons.</span> <span id="s59">He may have said something that did not please the Communist in.</span> <span id="s60">.</span> <span id="s61">uh people.</span> <span id="s62">Now you have to understand Grodno is about, I'm not sure that I'm being accurate, but it's about sixty miles from the Lithuanian border, or maybe less.</span> <span id="s63">So that entire area uh was a changeable area geographically.</span> <span id="s64">It was first, my parents were born there or close by and then it was Russia.</span> <span id="s65">When I was born it Poland, and in 1944 it was Russia again, and it is Russia now.</span> <span id="s66">So that uh I did not speak Russian until 1939.</span> <span id="s67">I speak Poli...I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s68">We did speak Yiddish but my Yiddish was not terribly good.</span> <span id="s69">We spoke basically Polish and when my mother didn't want me to understand something, my sister and I would go get furious about that, and she would speak Russian or French to each other.</span> <span id="s70">And of course at that time I still didn't speak either one of those languages.</span> <span id="s71">Well, uh Russia, the Soviet Union occupied that part of, well, Germany in 1939 as we know, Germany, Poland was divided.</span> <span id="s72">Half of it went to the Nazis and the other half, the eastern, the traditional northeastern part went to the Russians.</span> <span id="s73">And Balystok and Grodno and that entire areas became Russian.</span> <span id="s74">I went to school.</span> <span id="s75">I loved it.</span> <span id="s76">I learned White Russian because that is really Bieloruss and Russian and did a lot of dancing, a lot of uh gymnastics.</span> <span id="s77">My sister was the one who really was known gymnast and I had won quite a few competitions in singing and dancing and they encouraged that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s78">And life seemed perfectly alright.</span> <span id="s79">And then in September of 1941, uh everything broke and we were hiding in the bonders because the air the air raids were pretty severe.</span> <span id="s80">And uh very shortly the following day somebody walked up out of the compound and said we've just seen German tanks.</span> <span id="s81">Now again, you have to understand I did not understand the idea what German tanks, what kind of ominous clouds that would sweep around Europe and what it would mean, that the German tanks are in front of your door.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What did you do when you heard German tanks, when your family heard German tanks?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">What did you and your family do?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: They were very frightened.</span> <span id="s85">They recognized because we had known, we did hear terrible stories coming out from the other part of Poland, people who may, who escaped uh what was happening to the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s86">But again I must say that maybe because I was playing with dolls one day, and the next day I was asked to be a grown-up, it hadn't quite sunk in, what the tragedy of the entire period meant.</span> <span id="s87">I could only reflect today as I have post- Holocaust.</span> <span id="s88">When I was in it I didn't really know what was going on.</span> <span id="s89">I was we were in a vacuum.</span> <span id="s90">I was in a vacuum.</span> <span id="s91">I can only speak for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: That's what we want to talk about, of course, is what you did and thought then rather than now.</span> <span id="s93">Then what did you do?</span> <span id="s94">Did school continue for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s96">Not in '41.</span> <span id="s97">Right.</span> <span id="s98">In 1941 school did not continue.</span> <span id="s99">It was actually not even the beginning of the school semester.</span> <span id="s100">Very shortly after, uh we were still in our apartment, within a matter of a few months if I remember correctly, they had two ghettos in Grodno.</span> <span id="s101">The upper ghetto and the ghetto in, not very far from where we lived.</span> <span id="s102">And very shortly the entire the entire Jewish population of Grodno was being uprooted from their home and that I remember very distinctly and with great pain.</span> <span id="s103">We had some beautiful china.</span> <span id="s104">We had a very lovely home.</span> <span id="s105">Wasn't rich but it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s106">The Germans would come in and simply at the whim of a wisp, just like that (fingers snap), remove the most beautiful china and just throw it against a wall to break it, for fun, and started to taunt and tease.</span> <span id="s107">And you didn't really have to be all that young to recognize that this was the devil in the flesh.</span> <span id="s108">We were evacuated to a to the ghetto uptown, my both my father and my mother and my sister and I. Uh my mother was one of three sisters.</span> <span id="s109">One had come to this country and the other was married to a prominent professor with three children.</span> <span id="s110">One of my cousins was a uh young man who I believe was only 23 but he was considered to be a genius, so much so, electronic, that the Germans used him for two years as what they called a Einutzliger Jude (ph), a useful Jew, and when they have extracted what they needed, they killed him.</span> <span id="s111">His older sister, my other cousin, was a, completed the Warsaw Conservatoire and was a concert pianist and somehow managed to escape to uh to Alma Ata in Russia [NB: Kazakhstan].</span> <span id="s112">The younger of the three cousins uh stayed with her mother.</span> <span id="s113">Because my uncle was considered in High Intelligentsia they have, they rounded them up and they killed them.</span> <span id="s114">When were in the second ghetto, I believe my cousins, my cousin, just my aunt and my, my and her younger daughter were with us.</span> <span id="s115">We had improvised schools meaning that we still believed that the world may not have gone altogether and that we will need an education, and so we continued with our studies on an improvised basis by having the teachers who were there get the children and get them together.</span> <span id="s116">Uh I'll tell you something rather interesting.</span> <span id="s117">My father worked as a forester.</span> <span id="s118">That means that he was a specialist in wood and primarily worked with peasants.</span> <span id="s119">Poland is known for beautiful woods.</span> <span id="s120">He was extremely well liked.</span> <span id="s121">He was, I remember my father more often on a horse in a leather cap in a leather jacket and leather boots riding on either - we had two horses, a white one and a grey one.</span> <span id="s122">My father came home on day and said that some peasant families said let me have your children for you.</span> <span id="s123">They are both very light.</span> <span id="s124">They don't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s125">Why don't you let us have them.</span> <span id="s126">We will hide them for you.</span> <span id="s127">And I remember having a little conference and both my sister and I said no.</span> <span id="s128">If we cannot be together then we're not going to be without you.</span> <span id="s129">In November of 1942 the second ghetto where I was with my family got split up.</span> <span id="s130">They were obviously starting the evacuation process to the many camps that we didn't know anything about.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Can we hold it for one minute, (Sure) and I'd like you to describe the life in the first ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">What was your daily life like?</span> <span id="s133">You mentioned school.</span> <span id="s134">What else was going?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: With all due respect I cannot be absolutely clear and remember it to that extent except that it was bearable.</span> <span id="s136">It was bearable to the fact that my parents were with me.</span> <span id="s137">My sister was with me.</span> <span id="s138">We tried to improvise and play.</span> <span id="s139">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s140">I'm sure my parents felt differently because I was so young.</span> <span id="s141">And because I was so young I didn't stop to think what is going on except that somehow we were not at home.</span> <span id="s142">We shared a room with many other people.</span> <span id="s143">Uh life was no normal, but we were still a family.</span> <span id="s144">And then very abruptly, as they usually do those things, and for me - I don't know what go what went on with the with the other ghetto where they the first ghetto - as I said we were in the second ghetto - they probably started to, in fact I'm sure they started to evacuate because this was already in 1942.</span> <span id="s145">No doubt that the Jews who were in the German part of Poland had already been evacuated.</span> <span id="s146">But this is the eastern part and they you know they had to start a whole new program.</span> <span id="s147">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s148">Uh they rounded us up.</span> <span id="s149">We had no idea why.</span> <span id="s150">I had no idea why.</span> <span id="s151">Maybe the others did.</span> <span id="s152">My parents and I, my sister and I and my parents were separated.</span> <span id="s153">My sister and I were taken to, by trucks to ghetto number one.</span> <span id="s154">We had no idea what happened to our parents.</span> <span id="s155">I had subsequently learned that the transport, that was, went to Auschwitz and they were in a way entered the camp as most of them of course did not.</span> <span id="s156">My sister and I remained in the first ghetto.</span> <span id="s157">That was already very difficult.</span> <span id="s158">It was it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s159">The selections were, in other words the evacuation process began quite earnestly.</span> <span id="s160">We work in a in a tobacco factory.</span> <span id="s161">My sister and I would share a kind of little cot in somebody's house and the house the house belonged to a friend of mine who, they were no longer there, and we were, we managed to hide every time, like maybe three or four selec...uh not selections because they weren't all called selections but the raids - in other words to find the Jews to send them to wherever they were sending them - we didn't know where - we managed to escape.</span> <span id="s162">And we continued to give ourselves some kind of moral support by saying look, we'll probably leave here and I'm sure we'll be with our parents again.</span> <span id="s163">But, on January probably the 18th or 20th, somewheres around there, 1943, we hid behind very heavy snow behind the synagogue which is where they would run, round everybody up and we could no longer hide.</span> <span id="s164">We were found and walked to the to the to the station and what was so dreadful and I remember that - I did not see Shoah but the told me about that.</span> <span id="s165">The people were standing and watching as the people, as their neighbors - I don't know, I didn't recognize anyone but were being obviously dragged without too much clothes, without any necessarily private possessions, to the train station.</span> <span id="s166">And then we saw the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s167">And that's when the reality set in but I still had no idea that a place like Auschwitz existed.</span> <span id="s168">That they were still doing the actually burning people.</span> <span id="s169">We didn't know that.</span> <span id="s170">My sister gave me my mother's coat.</span> <span id="s171">A long coat, and I think that coat may have been responsible for my going into the camp rather than to the crematory right away.</span> <span id="s172">My sister was very bright.</span> <span id="s173">She was very cleaver.</span> <span id="s174">She was absolutely wonderful, tremendously liked.</span> <span id="s175">Her name was Sala (ph) and the train ride was probably one of the worst things that I can possibly remember.</span> <span id="s176">The train ride was utterly horrendous.</span> <span id="s177">People died.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">There was no water.</span> <span id="s179">There were no sanitary facilities.</span> <span id="s180">There was no food.</span> <span id="s181">Whatever was had gone very quickly.</span> <span id="s182">It was about three and a half days.</span> <span id="s183">And then we stopped and we saw Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s184">And we said I bet you we're going to meet our parents.</span> <span id="s185">Well, we were right to some extent, except that we didn't meet them.</span> <span id="s186">During the time that we were that we came down, in other words we were at disembarked or let from the train, Sala said to me, don't speak, don't move, let me think for a moment.</span> <span id="s187">We were about twenty-five hundred people.</span> <span id="s188">I have a book by the way, from somebody from Grodno who had just published the entire history of the Jews of Grodno and it's the most incredible thing is that even my number is mentioned there, so that I learned something about - I mean as I said, there are (ph) these are documentations that are there because there was a trial of the Nazis of Grodno.</span> <span id="s189">Maybe I was very dumb or just very young, but I didn't understand or knew as much as many other people did.</span> <span id="s190">When we embarked my sister noticed that the majority of the people from the train were being pushed to one side and a rather small group was being pushed to one side, both men and women.</span> <span id="s191">She said don't ask any questions, just walk over to that small group, and she followed me.</span> <span id="s192">And the guard the guard said, Genoch.</span> <span id="s193">There were eight-five women and a hundred and twenty men out of something like twenty-five hundred who were then brought into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s194">The rest went directly to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s195">Now we didn't know about that.</span> <span id="s196">But after one day you did know because the, at that time uh when I came to Auschwitz which was January, January 24th, 1943, the chimneys were very high and the smell of flesh was very prominent, and you no longer could pretent that this is the place where we're going to meet our parents.</span> <span id="s197">So this was my introduction to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s198">And I suppose you want to know what happened and I will tell you briefly...</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Let's slow down a little.</span> <span id="s200">(Alright.)</span> <span id="s201">Uh tell me when you arrived into the camp, where were you taken and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was taken, we were taken to a block, I don't know exactly where.</span> <span id="s203">We then were asked to undress completely.</span> <span id="s204">Naked.</span> <span id="s205">I had some photographs of my family which were torn to shreds.</span> <span id="s206">Hair was completely shaved.</span> <span id="s207">And a rather painful tatoo was put on my left forearm.</span> <span id="s208">My sister knew my terrible fear of doctors as a child, I don't know why, and she kept whispering to me, be brave.</span> <span id="s209">And my number was 31386, and her number was 31387 and in those days they gave the numbers smack in the front of the left forearm, not inside.</span> <span id="s210">I think they ran out of space or ran out of numbers or maybe they recognized that perhaps it is not such a good idea to be quite so prominent about that.</span> <span id="s211">For your information I had it plasmically removed uh in London.</span> <span id="s212">Not because I don't want to remember but because I don't always wish to talk about it, or to talk about it perhaps in an interview such as this where it has meaning and it has a realistic archival uh value for the future.</span> <span id="s213">Alright so we were stripped and the hair was shaven and the number was tattooed and we were given clothing of uh dead prison...uh Russian prisoners of war and taken to some block and that was the beginning of two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Tell me, who was...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s216">They were speaking all different languages.</span> <span id="s217">I did not know German.</span> <span id="s218">I did not know Hungarian.</span> <span id="s219">Actually the Hungarians came later.</span> <span id="s220">Mainly I think the people at that time were from Poland.</span> <span id="s221">Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s222">Uh possibly Czechoslovakian but I really am not totally sure so I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s223">Of course later on you know, day and night became, time had no meaning at that point.</span> <span id="s224">But it was dreadfully hard because the winters are very difficult.</span> <span id="s225">Uh the mud - when it rained it was just muddy.</span> <span id="s226">Uh food was unbearable if you were - you eventually learned to eat that but it was uneatable really.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: What did you have to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I think, you know the fact is and I, my sister and I used to joke because my mother and my father would make me eat like so many parents you know, drink your milk.</span> <span id="s229">You know, here's a piece of chocolate.</span> <span id="s230">Uh I'll take you here.</span> <span id="s231">The bribery aspects because I was very thin.</span> <span id="s232">In fact I was the youngest of everyone and the mo..</span> <span id="s233">the sickliest of everyone.</span> <span id="s234">Finally they thought I had some kind of a heart condition which may not have been true but my parents were very protective of my health so I wasn't allowed to plant trees which I wanted to do and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s235">And this is the irony that I am the one who survived and my sister who was never sick in her life died three months later.</span> <span id="s236">Uh and I was glad that she died.</span> <span id="s237">And I will tell you in a minute why I say that in such candor.</span> <span id="s238">Uh we were going to work - these were probably the most horrendously difficult months, the first three months.</span> <span id="s239">If you survived the first day, maybe you survived a second.</span> <span id="s240">If you made it through the week, chances are you might make it to the second week.</span> <span id="s241">Time had no meaning.</span> <span id="s242">We were very shortly put to work outside the camp, carrying very heavy stones.</span> <span id="s243">But the most horrendous part of it all, there was a man in Auschwitz who name was Tauber (ph) and I eventually asked uh Wiesenthal whether he knew what happened to this pretention of a man.</span> <span id="s244">And finally he was caught and or he died anyway.</span> <span id="s245">But I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s246">He was in charge of the selections as people would come back from a very long and a very difficult and a very hungry day.</span> <span id="s247">You were made to jump five feet over a ditch if you, and many didn't.</span> <span id="s248">It you made, if you were able to jump across, about five feet or maybe more, I don't know, then you were OK.</span> <span id="s249">If you didn't then you never went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s250">I mean this was a little play.</span> <span id="s251">Cruelty in its most perfect form.</span> <span id="s252">And that went on for quite some time.</span> <span id="s253">During that time my sister once put her hand in her pocket because it was freezing, and I never will forget that.</span> <span id="s254">I heard the tremendous slam of a whip on her back.</span> <span id="s255">Uh the officer, uh one of the guards said don't you every do that again.</span> <span id="s256">In other words you're not allowed to put you hands because you were frozen to death in your packet.</span> <span id="s257">Uh Sala one day complained of not feeling very well, and she says I don't think I can get out.</span> <span id="s258">It was a Friday, and I said I don't care whether you can get up - you've got to get up, because if you don't they will take you to Block 25.</span> <span id="s259">You know, you become very wise very quickly and you learn to know what Black 25 is because when you would pass by you would see dead bodies.</span> <span id="s260">That was a daily sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Nobody you know, you don't even cry anymore.</span> <span id="s262">There are no tears left.</span> <span id="s263">(Cough) Excuse me.</span> <span id="s264">But Sala couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s265">She probably had typhoid.</span> <span id="s266">We don't know.</span> <span id="s267">I mean it took - Sunday night she was dead.</span> <span id="s268">She didn't go to work on Friday.</span> <span id="s269">I went to see her in this Block 25 or hospital - whatever that was, sad as it was - on Saturday.</span> <span id="s270">On Sunday I came to see her.</span> <span id="s271">That was April the 10th.</span> <span id="s272">So here is a beautiful, brilliant, talented, healthy, athletic eighteen year old girl, delirious...with fever looking at me and she says I have to get up because tomorrow is the birthday of my sister and I didn't get her anything and I held her in my arms and she died in my arms.</span> <span id="s273">Watching this incredible drama was I woman that I did not know she...came up to me and she said in German, which I did not understand very well then - she said I don't have any children.</span> <span id="s274">I'm not married, but if I had a little girl, I would like her to look just like you and be just like you.</span> <span id="s275">Come.</span> <span id="s276">Martha had been in Auschwitz three months before we had arrived there.</span> <span id="s277">She was a nurse by profession, an operating room nurse, but in Auschwitz at that time she was carrying dead corpses which was - she witnessed this incredible little drama and she said (ph) - don't worry little girl.</span> <span id="s278">I will take care of you.</span> <span id="s279">Martha was about twenty years older than I was.</span> <span id="s280">And take care of me she did.</span> <span id="s281">She saved my life about four or five times.</span> <span id="s282">Four from the crematoria and others when I was deathly ill with typhoid or God knows that else, and she would steal injections and save me that way.</span> <span id="s283">So Sala died and I cried very bitterly that day.</span> <span id="s284">And then years came and went by before I cried again.</span> <span id="s285">I just did not cry.</span> <span id="s286">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s287">Once you let your defenses down, you're done.</span> <span id="s288">People say you know, you're very strong and I said that's bull.</span> <span id="s289">What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">How do you practice the art of survival anyway?</span> <span id="s291">It's not a question of strength.</span> <span id="s292">You don't even know what's happening to you.</span> <span id="s293">What it is a sort of self, self-discipline by saying if I'm going to make it, I'm going to retreat from all that and emerge in a way into my own fantasy world.</span> <span id="s294">And it's very healthy.</span> <span id="s295">I have subsequently done quite a bit of reading in my studies, in my undergraduate and master's programs in various psychology books, a lot of which by the way I do not agree with, and Bruno Betelheim idea was something that I really could not agree with.</span> <span id="s296">The survival, the guilt of survivors - I don't have guilt for surviving.</span> <span id="s297">I was guilty - I said why am I the only one but can one question God or nature or fate?</span> <span id="s298">I don't know but this whole idea that one is guilty because one survived - it's not guilt - it is something else, and I don't think it's guilt at all.</span> <span id="s299">But the idea of fantasy is a very healthy idea, even today when things become a bit difficult and I am alone - I am at home everywhere, and I'm home nowheres.</span> <span id="s300">It's my, my life has been so totally uprooted at such an early stage that I have never been able to say this is the only place I feel home.</span> <span id="s301">I can feel home everywhere, or make my home anywhere and be perfectly comfortable about it.</span> <span id="s302">But to come back to your original question, uh Sala's death was very painful because she was a tremendous moral support for me.</span> <span id="s303">She was my older sister.</span> <span id="s304">She and I recognized that we will never see our parents again and I knew exactly what happened to my parents and I still am to this day don't want to know or think that hopefully they were not conscious when they were thrown into the crematoria.</span> <span id="s305">And I had worked there for three months uh sorting the clothes of those who went there.</span> <span id="s306">Uh I continued to work and then eventually uh I don't know how - I really can't tell you - I transferred to another camp.</span> <span id="s307">It was, this was Birkenau.</span> <span id="s308">When I talked about Auschwitz, Auschwitz is Birkenau the way we know it.</span> <span id="s309">Auschwitz is a town where some of the medical experimentations were done etc. but the camp where or where, I don't know, I think two and one half million Jews were slaughtered, some were Christians, but for different reasons - and that's just as terrible.</span> <span id="s310">I was transferred I think to Lager C and then I was made what they call an .</span> <span id="s311">There were no children in Auschwitz by the way when I was there.</span> <span id="s312">There were I think five children because they only took the healthy, like say from eighteen to about thirty-five and so on, and I was really not.</span> <span id="s313">As again how I made it I don't know.</span> <span id="s314">That's something I can never understand.</span> <span id="s315">When I was in selections, which were all the time, and Mengele looked at me because I was so very fair, but anyone who came from the north whether you were Swedish or whether you were Norwegian or Polish, if you just happened to be light then you were light whether you were Jewish, Christian or anything else.</span> <span id="s316">He looked at me and I remember his face.</span> <span id="s317">He ways are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s318">And I said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">What, first of all, not only my number but I had a little triangle that indicated that was even, you know, put salt on the open would.</span> <span id="s320">Were your parents Jewish?</span> <span id="s321">Yes.</span> <span id="s322">I says Umeglish (ph).</span> <span id="s323">Someone said shut up.</span> <span id="s324">Don't you know this guy conducts experimentation of all kinds, experiments of all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s325">He may want to do something to find out what, whether your blood is different from that of a Christian child.</span> <span id="s326">I didn't ... but I was exposed to a great many and again without having any kind of understanding whatsoever why I was spared, I don't know.</span> <span id="s327">On on four occasions I was not.</span> <span id="s328">But I was very very ill.</span> <span id="s329">I couldn't walk and I was hidden.</span> <span id="s330">And again uh Martha uh smuggled me into the Christian hospital - when I say hospital I mean the block where only the Christians were - the Jews and the Christians were often not together.</span> <span id="s331">And put about seventy-five different dresses on me because they all worked in the cre...you know in the crematoria where you could get those things.</span> <span id="s332">But I couldn't walk because I had probably typhoid or whatever, and they would inject me with glucose or whatever else they could their hands on to keep my strength up.</span> <span id="s333">I was fourteen by then, look like ten, and one day kline (ph), Dr. Kliner or whoever else was there came in, took down my number.</span> <span id="s334">Now we knew, we knew that once your number had been taken - that's the kiss of death.</span> <span id="s335">And there wasn't even a question of crying - you sort of accepted the fact that you are going to die.</span> <span id="s336">And you lived with that death.</span> <span id="s337">I have to interject something right here.</span> <span id="s338">Later on in my professional life as a singer, I studied for one of my concerts a beautiful song by Franz Schubert (ph) to the poetry by (ph) Klaudius called (ph), death and the girl.</span> <span id="s339">When death appears as friend, he says come, give me your hand, you sweet and lovely maiden - don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s340">I am your friend and I will take care of you.</span> <span id="s341">Well, later on when I studied that song it became extremely meaningful because I was praying for that kind of a friend.</span> <span id="s342">During one of these, during that time when I knew that I was not going to be here tomorrow, the woman who was in the next bed was a student of Sigmund Fraud, somebody who was a well-known psychiatrist and she was also a she died...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s344">This is now in the Christian hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: This is now in the Christian hospital.</span> <span id="s346">(Thank you.)</span> <span id="s347">Alright.</span> <span id="s348">And I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s349">And I dreamt something quite incredible.</span> <span id="s350">And I told her about that later.</span> <span id="s351">I dreamt that I was walking on a very high precipice.</span> <span id="s352">I had very long blonde hair that mother used to do like you know Shirley Temple style and I was wearing a white and pink dress that was that was like a it was purely, it was a dream - I was walking and it was kind of moving around and I knew I knew that when I would that I was walking towards the end and there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s353">I would have to fall and die.</span> <span id="s354">And I kept going anyway.</span> <span id="s355">Now I couldn't walk in those days mind you, but I was sort of running.</span> <span id="s356">And as I approached that enormously steep precipice somebody jolted me and I woke up and there was Martha standing in front of me with tears in her eyes and she said my Kindchen (ph), little girl - a miracle just happened.</span> <span id="s357">We have been able to erase your number from Kline's list and you are not going to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s358">I told it I mean I didn't understand what psychology was.</span> <span id="s359">I had no idea who Freud was you know I mean.</span> <span id="s360">Uh I thought reading Anna Karenina under the table was something forbidden you know because uh and she said that was a very revealing dream.</span> <span id="s361">She says you are you have predicted your own future without even knowing it at that time.</span> <span id="s362">That happened a few times.</span> <span id="s363">I was made meaning messenger.</span> <span id="s364">And because of that, because I was young and because at that point you sort of I don't know - they just accepted me there I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: We are now back in Lager C..</span> <span id="s366">.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh, we were in Lager C all the time, but there were different aspects of the "life", quote, unquote, in Lager C.</span> <span id="s368">During Lager C times there was a woman by the name of Irma Grese who was very frightening to be around.</span> <span id="s369">She was extremely beautiful, dressed as cleanly as you can possibly, you can see you could see your face in her boots.</span> <span id="s370">She was always with an enormous German Shepherd and a whip.</span> <span id="s371">And I was really very frightened of her.</span> <span id="s372">Everybody was.</span> <span id="s373">She would sick her dog on a poor inmate for no reason at all.</span> <span id="s374">And the dog would just about demolish that person.</span> <span id="s375">Very peculiar things kept happening to me.</span> <span id="s376">One evening, well evening - I don't know - one late afternoon after, we were never allowed you know we had our great big meal - stale bread and maybe a piece of salami and some horrible smelling coffee, then you could not go out.</span> <span id="s377">That was curfew.</span> <span id="s378">Someone, the head of the block of the woman who was in charge of our barrack who was always an inmate, came up and she said uh Grese wants to see you.</span> <span id="s379">Now I did not know that and I didn't even know what homosexuality was but apparently she was a lesbian and because almost everyone there was five or six or seven years older than I was, and she and people said, oh boy, shall we kiss you goodbye you know.</span> <span id="s380">God knows what is what it is that she wants to do.</span> <span id="s381">I walked into the that little office and there was this Irma Grese standing in civilian clothes and I must tell you she looked like a vision out of another world.</span> <span id="s382">She was wearing a yellow coat.</span> <span id="s383">Her hair was blonde and usually she was it was always very tightly pulled back.</span> <span id="s384">Her hair was long, let loose.</span> <span id="s385">She wore perhaps a little lipstick - I don't remember.</span> <span id="s386">But she was wearing a yellow coat and she smiled at me.</span> <span id="s387">Imagine!</span> <span id="s388">I was frightened to death, and she looked at me and she said, I'll never forget that conversation - you know, I have forgotten a great deal purposefully because you can't live with all the memories, but there are some things that kind of stand out - and she said uh, come her, come here.</span> <span id="s389">She took my little cheek and she said, ah ha.</span> <span id="s390">She said they tell me that you look a lot like I, and I wanted to be sure that was really true.</span> <span id="s391">And I in my total naivest said, oh I said, I don't think there's any, I've never seen anyone more beautiful, and I meant it.</span> <span id="s392">I mean she was like a vision.</span> <span id="s393">You know, you have to understand we haven't seen anything like that.</span> <span id="s394">The woman took a liking to me.</span> <span id="s395">Thank God she never did abuse me, but she made me stand guard in front of the barracks while she would make love to the most beautiful Jewish girls there.</span> <span id="s396">She also gave me an extra piece of salami and made me uh do her boots or something like that.</span> <span id="s397">In other words, she sort of took a slight liking.</span> <span id="s398">I then found out to my horror when I was already in London and bought the book called "The Belsen Trials," which is really the Auschwitz trials, Kramer and Hoess, that she was one of the five people who were actually executed for her crimes.</span> <span id="s399">She was twenty-three years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: What did you know of her role in the barracks?</span> <span id="s401">She was SS...</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh no, she was (or did yu know?)</span> <span id="s403">she was more, yes, I don't know whether SS - I don't know - she probably were.</span> <span id="s404">This was a, the concentration camp guards, such as Grese and a commandant like uh Kramer (ph), they were of a different breed of people.</span> <span id="s405">They looked human, but these were not human beings.</span> <span id="s406">They, you, people, humanity as we know it, even in the worst possible way, cannot behave that way.</span> <span id="s407">There's a predisposition, there's a pre- election to the kind of evil.</span> <span id="s408">They must have been chosen for the very fundamental and the mental qualities that these people possessed to be able to perform and do what these people did, because "normal", quote and unquote, people who are, who have sensitivities and uh and human qualities per se in the smallest quality cannot possibly behave in that manner.</span> <span id="s409">She was one of the those.</span> <span id="s410">Now she could be perfectly lovely.</span> <span id="s411">She was nice to me.</span> <span id="s412">But it may have been a little toy to her.</span> <span id="s413">I mean you know, that I didn't have a relationship with her.</span> <span id="s414">Uh she was in charge of Lager C.</span> <span id="s415">She was, she had total power.</span> <span id="s416">She could do anything she wanted to anybody at anytime because she was the, I forget the German word, ober... something or other.</span> <span id="s417">Head, head guard person, and that's all documented, and I as I said I bought the "The Trials" after the war when I was in London and read it studiously in horror - to read my own my own history so to speak, because I lived in a in a little vacuum, not really knowing that in another camp other things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What did standing guard for Irma Grese?</span> <span id="s419">A: I beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: What did standing guard for Irma Grese?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: You mean as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s422">Well I was told that she that she was a lesbian.</span> <span id="s423">I did not know in those days what that meant.</span> <span id="s424">And that she was making love to another woman and would I stay guard to see that maybe other Germans would be coming or other guards of her caliber would be coming along and she wanted to be alerted.</span> <span id="s425">That's what it meant.</span> <span id="s426">Not all the time - sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: To your knowledge, did she injure or kill the women that she made love to?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: That I don't know, but she injured and killed an awful lot of women period.</span> <span id="s429">She had close to - I mean thousands of people that she had tortured, but I don't know whether that was done during her uh tryst or not.</span> <span id="s430">I doubt it but I don't know.</span> <span id="s431">That I can't I can't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Did you, can you describe any other indicates with Irma Grese, her behavior with other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s434">Yes I can.</span> <span id="s435">When we would have what the called the Zel (ph) appell, that means that in the morning the roll call would take place, and because I was (ph), that means that I would be there to deliver messages to the central off...to the central block, to the commandment, or to anybody and bring it back to the people in the camp.</span> <span id="s436">Uh she would make us stand for hours at a time in freezing horrible weather or very hot, depending I was one of the - I still don't understand - I was there for two years.</span> <span id="s437">Uh I have told people when the they used to ask me what my educational background is, I said I have a Ph.D. from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s438">That covers a lot of ground doesn't it.</span> <span id="s439">Not really.</span> <span id="s440">The world really doesn't, the world is not really that interested from the human end.</span> <span id="s441">There are always those who are.</span> <span id="s442">The majority still have really no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s443">It's too painful to grasp and they can't be bothered.</span> <span id="s444">But Irma Grese would let us stand for hours.</span> <span id="s445">People would faint.</span> <span id="s446">She would trod on them.</span> <span id="s447">She would beat them.</span> <span id="s448">She would sick her dog.</span> <span id="s449">She would punish people very badly.</span> <span id="s450">She was very cruel.</span> <span id="s451">She was extremely cruel.</span> <span id="s452">They did not execute, Nuremberg did not execute many people.</span> <span id="s453">A great many people were put into many different sentences, prison sentences, but they executed her, so they must have had far more evidence than I'm giving you here today, documented but from my own personal experience that is precisely my recollection, except that she was, I didn't realize that she was twenty-three.</span> <span id="s454">I don't know.</span> <span id="s455">Age at that point didn't really mean terribly much, but she was twenty-three years old which seems pretty extraordinary to have reached the power of such depth of degradation at such an early age and so she was executed Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s456">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: You have mentioned that you were in selection with Mengele.</span> <span id="s458">Can you describe one of those selections for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s460">What was so striking and in fact everything that I'm saying to you today is sort of in retrospect how weird those events were.</span> <span id="s461">Mengele never raised his voice.</span> <span id="s462">He would simply stand there with this finger, and this meant one thing and this meant another thing, and he says, you know you've really lived long enough.</span> <span id="s463">I think its time to go on.</span> <span id="s464">In that kind of a manner.</span> <span id="s465">I never heard him raise his voice.</span> <span id="s466">He didn't have to.</span> <span id="s467">He relished and enjoyed every moment of his glorious power.</span> <span id="s468">So you see, when you think of Mengele, which is unbelievable, this is a monster.</span> <span id="s469">This is a medical doctor.</span> <span id="s470">When you think of Kline (ph), when yu think of the great minds in a sense, educated people, the crematoria as I've mentioned in some of my speeches when I, the few times that I do speak subjectively, and this is one of the few times that I do, the crematoria were built, were designed and built not by idiots, not by people who didn't know what they were doing.</span> <span id="s471">But by highly educated, trained Ph.D.'s who knew exactly what they were doing.</span> <span id="s472">And they designed that whole "Dant'es Inferno" - you know, there's a line in "Dante's Inferno" that says Lachate Oni Speranze Voiche (ph), that means abandon hope all ye who enter here.</span> <span id="s473">Now when Dante wrote this in his inferno, he must have been thinking about Auschwitz or places like Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s474">Or people like Mengele or like Kramer, like Hoess, like Grese and like so many other whose names I don't exactly remember - we were not formally introduced.</span> <span id="s475">The other thing about Auschwitz that I remember that helped me is to have a sense of humor.</span> <span id="s476">Some people say how can you do that?</span> <span id="s477">If you cannot laugh at yourself, you die.</span> <span id="s478">By the way, that's true of today too.</span> <span id="s479">People who take themselves very seriously are bores (ph), but when you have to, when you do not have a sense of humor during that time, and you really recognize the depth of the tragedy around you, you can't make it.</span> <span id="s480">You see the mind can still function.</span> <span id="s481">It can overcome all kinds of extraordinary circumstances.</span> <span id="s482">So say, he, I'll see you tomorrow on the soap board.</span> <span id="s483">And that sounds horrible doesn't it?</span> <span id="s484">But the truth is that as you know, they would make all kinds of, I mean the Germans, the Nazis I should say, were very cleaver as to what they were doing.</span> <span id="s485">They wast...wasted nothing.</span> <span id="s486">Everything was a must for fortunes of war, and the fat would be used for certain productions including soap.</span> <span id="s487">Now it sounds horrible today.</span> <span id="s488">It sounds depraved.</span> <span id="s489">But at that time it was a way of saying we know what's going to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">There's nothing we can do about it.</span> <span id="s491">So let's laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: On that note, let's hold it for a minute.</span> <span id="s493">Let them change tapes.</span> <span id="s494">A: Good.</span> <span id="s495">I need a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Tape #2 (Tape snag - technical conversation)</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Uh you had described several times that Martha helped you a great deal.</span> <span id="s498">Can you describe other incidents uh other than the one in the Christian hospital where she helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">Well I was first in the Jewish hospital.</span> <span id="s501">Well, I, the hos...the word hospital is incorrect.</span> <span id="s502">It's fallacious.</span> <span id="s503">There were no hospitals.</span> <span id="s504">There was a block where you went if you were sick and if you were Jewish which that means you never came out of there.</span> <span id="s505">Martha worked with the doctors because she was a nurse and somehow she was able to man...to get medicine, injections which she uh was able to administer to me which kept me alive.</span> <span id="s506">Uh the Christian inmates in the in the Christian hospital were allowed to get packages from home and would share some of the goodies from home with me because I was the child you see.</span> <span id="s507">I was that little girls.</span> <span id="s508">Uh and then on a few occasions Martha actually was able with the help of someone else to remove the number that was written down for me to go pastures is the only way you can put it.</span> <span id="s509">Uh something that the normal mind and I say, when I say normal mind I mean people who thank goodness, thank God have not experienced my adolescent years, would find it extremely difficult to grasp.</span> <span id="s510">Maybe people who were in Viet Nam might to some extent understand that when you walked out in the morning for the roll call, you would literally see hundreds of emaciated bodies still warm, piled up in front of the barracks, and you didn't cry.</span> <span id="s511">That was it.</span> <span id="s512">It was like you are in hell, and that's part of hell.</span> <span id="s513">When I think about it today I said how is it possible.</span> <span id="s514">It's beyond me.</span> <span id="s515">It is a question, when people say how did you survive, I haven't got the foggiest idea.</span> <span id="s516">There is no earthly reason in the world why I was chosen to talk to you today.</span> <span id="s517">I don't know.</span> <span id="s518">Maybe there is some plan that the heavens, God, whatever, that I'm here.</span> <span id="s519">Maybe to bear witness, and that is why I have set my own feelings aside, which is not easy, to uh to share with you some of my own remembrances so that perhaps those, the people or the children or whoever is going to perhaps hear what I have to say today, will recognize that the madness that is in our society today Neo-Nazis who say that the Holocaust never happened, that this is the pure imagination of the Jewish community, will know that uh theirs is a dangerous pack, and the Holocaust did not only happen but it's a very living reality.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: I there anything else about Auschwitz, before we move on, anything more Auschwitz, that you want to add or to tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: The only way I can describe Auschwitz is it wa the de...de...de...deepest dissension of what we considered in our wildest imagination, for hell to be.</span> <span id="s522">Auschwitz was the final the final apocalypse.</span> <span id="s523">It cannot be described really.</span> <span id="s524">Even I who was there for twenty-four months, have difficulty, and I'm sure that I have deliberately forgotten quite a great deal.</span> <span id="s525">I don't think I could function as a as a human being and be as an accomplished in many way and continue on with life if I had to live and remember what happened to me there.</span> <span id="s526">And I think again here the mind works some miracles.</span> <span id="s527">It was, you remember what is essential, but you sort of forget all the other - it's like having a baby - you remember the beauty but you don't remember the pain, because other wise no woman would ever have a baby.</span> <span id="s528">Uh and Auschwitz was something, it was the cradle of death.</span> <span id="s529">It gave people who were deranged the absolute perfect opportunity to exercise their wildest macabre behavior.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Actually I didn't leave Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s532">I was evacuated.</span> <span id="s533">I was there until the last bitter moment, excuse me (cough).</span> <span id="s534">Before I answer you that question I just want to say something which I find very important.</span> <span id="s535">Yes, there were many other people in Auschwitz, Christians, political prisoners, uh prostitutes, homosexuals, uh murderers, but I want people to understand one very important thing - it was primarily an extermination camp of the Jews of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Because the Christian inmates were not subjected to the same treatment.</span> <span id="s537">They were not subjected to uh to crematoria.</span> <span id="s538">If they "sinned" (quote, unquote) according to them, they were hanged.</span> <span id="s539">I don't know that there were any selections for the Christians.</span> <span id="s540">They were there were any selections for the Christians.</span> <span id="s541">They were there as criminals and treated as such as though it was a prison.</span> <span id="s542">A terrible prison for them.</span> <span id="s543">But Auschwitz and the concentration camps of Europe were made for one reason and one reason alone and that is to - I don't want to use exterminate - it was, you exterminate cock roaches - for the murder of Jews.</span> <span id="s544">And six million died, not just in Auschwitz - in others.</span> <span id="s545">I think that's very important to understand.</span> <span id="s546">(Thank you.)</span> <span id="s547">And I have primarily spoken to Christian groups in my short few years that I have decided that I had a responsibility.</span> <span id="s548">I wanted to speak to the Christian community, to make them understand that.</span> <span id="s549">Now, I left, or I would say I didn't leave - I was evacuated from Auschwitz on January 24th, - I came to Auschwitz, excuse me, I came to Auschwitz on January 24th, 1941, and evacuated on January 18th, 1945.</span> <span id="s550">That was another terrible time.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">We actually went through Berlin and saw a leveled city.</span> <span id="s552">By that time I spoke fluent German, fluent -you see I did go to school there - fluent German, fluent Hungarian, fluent Czechoslovakian, and fluent Italian I mean - there were so many people from all over the world, and I wound up in a dreadful place called Ravensbruck.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: How did you get from Auschwitz to Ravensbruck?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: By train, I don't know how many days it took but counting was not one of those things that we did there.</span> <span id="s555">It was by that time the end of January, maybe two weeks later, maybe ten days after - I really don't know, but it was in January.</span> <span id="s556">Ravensbruck was built for x amount, like maybe thirty-five hundred people, and at that time we were there were something like fifteen thousand people.</span> <span id="s557">It was dreadful, horrible, and extraordinarily - I met Martha there, and she said to me at that time, if anything happens and either one of us is alive, I want you to meet me in such and such a city after the war.</span> <span id="s558">And she's still alive.</span> <span id="s559">She's in Brazil, and I went to see her in Brazil.</span> <span id="s560">She's quite ill.</span> <span id="s561">She has never recovered from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s562">I guess she must be about seventy-five now perhaps - I don't really know.</span> <span id="s563">Uh but anyway after Ravensbruck of which I have a blur because it was terrible, and like typical Martha, she shared her slice of bread with me and still reprimanded me because I, I mean she sort of imagined herself that I was her little girl, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Do, don't don't go by Ravensbruck even if its a blur quite so quickly.</span> <span id="s565">How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I would say about three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What, through the blur, can you remember, of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Masses of people, death, terrible starvation, no work.</span> <span id="s569">We didn't work there.</span> <span id="s570">It was, there was there was some chaos at that point, and don't forget this is January '45 and I think Auschwitz in fact had already been liberated by the Russians, and we were just, kept going on.</span> <span id="s571">I can't tell you too much about it because as I said I remember being uh praying let's get this out, I don't want to live anymore.</span> <span id="s572">I mean, you know, you can't go on like that.</span> <span id="s573">I knew there was no one left as far as my family was concerned.</span> <span id="s574">I knew there was no way.</span> <span id="s575">Uh I don't know what happened to Martha after that because we were separated.</span> <span id="s576">And then again we were put on trains and ridden further into what was still the remaining of the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s577">And I wound up in a camp called Retzof-am-Richlin (ph), which was apparently not originally a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s578">It was a camp that was built for the men or the women who worked adjoining uh there was a very large factory where they I was told they manufacture the uh the missiles that eventually devastated London, and so that it was a much more relaxed camp.</span> <span id="s579">There were no crematoria.</span> <span id="s580">Uh it was already confusion.</span> <span id="s581">I mean this was already like you know beginning of February, end of January, February, March, April - I was there actually until, perhaps I was in Ravensbruck longer than that because I think I was in Retzof for about three and a half months.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: Can you describe the camp for us?</span> <span id="s583">Where were you taken first?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s585">It was not the same procedure that was both either at Auschwitz or Ravensbruck.</span> <span id="s586">Uh we were brought on trucks in fact, not on a train, to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s587">We were on trucks and we were quite sure they were going to shoot us because Retzof is surrounded by many woods.</span> <span id="s588">Uh what struck me about that camp was that it was relatively nice, meaning that it was not, the barracks were different.</span> <span id="s589">They were much more, they were much bigger.</span> <span id="s590">Uh it was smaller.</span> <span id="s591">There may have been maybe two thousand, twenty-five hundred people, mainly women.</span> <span id="s592">I don't remember seeing men there.</span> <span id="s593">It was much looser in discipline.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s595">How did that manifest itself?</span> <span id="s596">A: How do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: You say it was looser in discipline.</span> <span id="s598">What did that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: It meant that uh they'd fill up, the behavior of the guards was not as obnoxious and as scary.</span> <span id="s600">They were primarily men, German soldiers, rather than women.</span> <span id="s601">Women could be terrible, by the way.</span> <span id="s602">The women in Auschwitz were horrendous, the German women.</span> <span id="s603">There were to my recollection no women.</span> <span id="s604">There was a women's camp, but there were mainly men who were the guards.</span> <span id="s605">The commandant was not as scary as I remember say Hoess Ora Kramer.</span> <span id="s606">The majority of the pe...the workforce, we worked in the woods where we would uh chop wood for the war production because again this was around the woods and we never felt by the way that we would get out of there.</span> <span id="s607">Never.</span> <span id="s608">We were quite sure that we were going to be shot, that they could not let, not everyone had a number - not that many were out of Auschwitz, but some of us were.</span> <span id="s609">In fact the majority really.</span> <span id="s610">There really are not that many who have that kind of a number as I do because uh - don't ask me why.</span> <span id="s611">Providence.</span> <span id="s612">Je ne sais pas.</span> <span id="s613">I don't know.</span> <span id="s614">So that Retzof particularly after Ravensbruck was heaven.</span> <span id="s615">I mean you could, and again they asked me what did I do - I mean what, everybody sort of did something if you survived that long, my God, you know, what did you do?</span> <span id="s616">Said I was a loifering (ph).</span> <span id="s617">Oh good, we need a loifering (ph) here.</span> <span id="s618">So immediately they gave me that bandanna with the gothic letters and I became a loifering (ph).</span> <span id="s619">That means that I could go to the kitchen and sometimes they, the German woman in charge would throw me an extra piece of bread.</span> <span id="s620">I didn't need very much in those days.</span> <span id="s621">I think that may have also, I really think that may have contributed somewhat to my survival.</span> <span id="s622">As a child I didn't need much food.</span> <span id="s623">I didn't, I did not eat very much there, and so much so that when I eventually came to this country and my aunt was very concerned because I could go three days without eating, and she took me to the Valley Hospital for some tests.</span> <span id="s624">They found that my stomach had shrunk very considerably.</span> <span id="s625">I simply was not accustomed to sitting down and eating a normal meal.</span> <span id="s626">I still can't do seven courses in on in one evening.</span> <span id="s627">I have tried to justified, to justify why I and why not somebody else, and it's not the guilt in me.</span> <span id="s628">It's the questioning, why, and I have no idea.</span> <span id="s629">I don't know.</span> <span id="s630">It is absolutely against all odds.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Can you tell me, what did you do in Retzof?</span> <span id="s632">Did you work and what was your work in addition to being a loifering?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Primarily I was a loifering which means that I stood in front, inside the gates of the camp, and be ready to be at any body's beck and call from the main Block Fuhrerstube (ph) or the guards who needed something, or bring their supper or whatever.</span> <span id="s634">And then I worked for a while in the woods with the other kommando chopping woods which was a little heavy work, and that's basically what was going on there.</span> <span id="s635">There was, there were other things there.</span> <span id="s636">There were mis...uh seamstress who were doing some clothes correction I remember.</span> <span id="s637">As I said this camp had different things but you have to understand again, I wish I could be more descriptive to you as to what, how and when, but I really can't because I can only tell you from my memory what I did when.</span> <span id="s638">I really don't know - there were so many other aspects.</span> <span id="s639">And we didn't exactly share the information on what was going on five blocks away, so that a great deal of my information about, not about my own subjective experience, but about the entire tragedy of the catastrophe I learned by reading about other peoples' accounts and by reading historical and documentation of that nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: We of course are going to focus here on you.</span> <span id="s641">(Right.)</span> <span id="s642">Uh, can you tell us of uh, do certain things that went on in the camp or in your experience, stand out in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes, It does.</span> <span id="s644">In fact, what stands out in my memory even in Auschwitz, was that humanity was not lost among the among the survivors, among - I shouldn't say survivors, among the inmates.</span> <span id="s645">People did care for each other.</span> <span id="s646">People did give each other moral support.</span> <span id="s647">People did commensurate with each other and tried to help.</span> <span id="s648">There was very little because people were dying and the suffering was so intense that it was very difficult to give strength to someone else, but Martha is a perfect example.</span> <span id="s649">There were a few others who extended a helping hand.</span> <span id="s650">But the one incident that comes about me is a very unusual one.</span> <span id="s651">and a very far-out sort of an incident because it came from a German soldier in Retzof-am-Richlin.</span> <span id="s652">There was a young nineteen year old guard who very shortly after I arrived there, started look at me very differently, and I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s653">He, eventually we spoke, we met.</span> <span id="s654">He was actually from Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s655">He was a medical student.</span> <span id="s656">He was brought in there.</span> <span id="s657">He said to me, what are you doing here, the first time I saw him.</span> <span id="s658">He was a guard standing on this scaffold with a gun, and I was down here standing and he started to sing me a little, a little German song.</span> <span id="s659">And I thought boy, this guy has a real sense of humor, you know.</span> <span id="s660">And he said listen, what are you going here?</span> <span id="s661">And he didn't say it in an angry way.</span> <span id="s662">And I thought to myself, he's crazy.</span> <span id="s663">I said, well, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s664">And he apologized and he said, he was obviously very green.</span> <span id="s665">He didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s666">He said look, I knew what was going to the, I knew what was going on in Germany with the Jewish community, but I am, I was a medical student until just a few months ago, and I had no idea to what extent the brutality went on.</span> <span id="s667">I am only now learning from the older guards who talk about it with relish, and I go out and I vomit.</span> <span id="s668">This young nineteen year old medical student, SS guard because they needed new people to they brought anyone in, Rumanians, Bulgarians, eventually within a few months, was willing to risk his life by saying to me, you are not going to survive because they will kill you.</span> <span id="s669">This, the rumor goes around that they will shoot everybody here.</span> <span id="s670">They can't, they don't want to whatever is left, they can't let, leave that much evidence.</span> <span id="s671">I have contacted a woman in the village who lost her husband and two sons and is very bitter, told her about you.</span> <span id="s672">She says she will give me civilian clothes and I will take you there when there is a break.</span> <span id="s673">I promise you.</span> <span id="s674">And I said why are you doing it.</span> <span id="s675">He said because I love you.</span> <span id="s676">Now you have to understand that here was a Jewish girl, sixteen years old, speaking to a German, to a man wearing a German uniform saying I love you and I'm not going to let you die.</span> <span id="s677">I'm going to help you.</span> <span id="s678">I said we can both hang for it.</span> <span id="s679">Don't say a word to anyone.</span> <span id="s680">It's a long story which I will not go into now, but I was very...</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Please, do go into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Well he was very, well, he was very, he was incredibly tender.</span> <span id="s683">He asked me to join the kommando because he wanted to tell me more about it and the he says, speak to the commandant.</span> <span id="s684">Everybody eventually winds up going to the woods and working there, and he'll let you, which I did.</span> <span id="s685">I was scared to death, but the commandant knew me and he said OK.</span> <span id="s686">You can rotate with other girls.</span> <span id="s687">As I said, this was a little more human.</span> <span id="s688">You simply didn't go to a commandant and stay, do you mind if I go work some place else.</span> <span id="s689">This is just not the way it was.</span> <span id="s690">And Lucien had all the plans.</span> <span id="s691">He was incredibly tender.</span> <span id="s692">He was incredibly beautiful, and I said what is going on with me.</span> <span id="s693">What is happening here?</span> <span id="s694">How, you mean there is still a heart beating under somebody who is wearing a German uniform?</span> <span id="s695">Here was a Christian boy and a Jewish girl caught up in hell, and this, and I must admit I didn't know, I mean I knew that nature was beginning to play havoc with me, but I didn't know what the word love is or anything.</span> <span id="s696">I mean I didn't know that one does, that there are normal emotions which nature was letting me know were happening.</span> <span id="s697">One night he said, very abruptly and very angrily, while he was there, he says I want my supper in my in my Block Fuhrerstobe tonight.</span> <span id="s698">Bring it to me.</span> <span id="s699">So I brought the tray, and I knew there was something wrong, and I walked into the Block Fuhrerstobe.</span> <span id="s700">There was bedlam there.</span> <span id="s701">This was already April - I don't know maybe April 20th, maybe April 25th.</span> <span id="s702">And uh I opened the door and there he was standing without a gun and without a tie, the white shirt opened slightly, without his cap and I knew something was terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s703">He said put down the tray.</span> <span id="s704">He said we've just got we've just got word that we have to evacuate like immediately.</span> <span id="s705">Tomorrow morning.</span> <span id="s706">I cannot help you.</span> <span id="s707">I cannot bring you out of here.</span> <span id="s708">But I pray to God that you're going to live, because I'm going to find you.</span> <span id="s709">And he gave me a magnificent poem and a photograph of himself in civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s710">It was the most bizarre thing - it was like a like a like icing on a on a cake of some kind that was just, what's going on here.</span> <span id="s711">Well, to cut a long story short, we were evacuated, and then I found out that he was killed in action on the Russian front.</span> <span id="s712">But he made an impact on me.</span> <span id="s713">He made an enormous impact on me because he, people say to me, I have been asked, do you hate the Germans?</span> <span id="s714">No.</span> <span id="s715">I don't like to hate anybody.</span> <span id="s716">I hate the Nazis.</span> <span id="s717">I hate the people who have perpetrated that disaster on people.</span> <span id="s718">But you cannot simply say everybody is rotten.</span> <span id="s719">No.</span> <span id="s720">They're not.</span> <span id="s721">People are people.</span> <span id="s722">There are rotten people everywhere.</span> <span id="s723">But this incident, having just spent forty-five months in camps and ghettos, to have a, somebody in a German uniform with a gun supposedly guarding me say to me I'm going to risk my life for you.</span> <span id="s724">I'm going to let you escape (ph) will kill you.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">And I may be killed with it but I love you, was an inkling that maybe there is after all another world of which I knew nothing about.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Quite a story.</span> <span id="s727">What happened to you next?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: We were evacuated in the middle of the night, just as Lucien had predicted, and we were quite sure that we were going to be killed.</span> <span id="s729">And we were not put on trucks.</span> <span id="s730">We were walking.</span> <span id="s731">No idea where we were walking.</span> <span id="s732">That was May the 2nd.</span> <span id="s733">Mind you I'm really coming to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s734">Everything, or at this point here, Germany was combined of a tiny little spot where the Americans and the English and the Russians and the French on all sides.</span> <span id="s735">They kept going with us.</span> <span id="s736">Of course, they the guards were much more relaxed.</span> <span id="s737">They knew that this is the end.</span> <span id="s738">There was just no way, but they kept walking us, for week...for what seemed like endless...a lot of people couldn't make it and want by the wayside.</span> <span id="s739">In fact that's when I asked one of the older guards, I said by the way, you know that young fellow, Lucien, who was at the gate, whatever happened to him?</span> <span id="s740">And he looked at me.</span> <span id="s741">He said, ah Buby (ph), we got word that he was killed in uh at the Russian front two weeks ago.</span> <span id="s742">Well I thought, I'm the one, he didn't feel anything, I did.</span> <span id="s743">We went on and on and on finally we couldn't really walk anymore and this was already like May the 4th and I say May the 4th, because May the 5th I was liberated, so I knew that it had to be.</span> <span id="s744">We hi...there was a terrible bombardment.</span> <span id="s745">I mean we heard and we to see planes, hear the Americans...what I don't know whether they were American but they were certainly Al..</span> <span id="s746">.</span> <span id="s747">uh Allied planes and tremendous uh fires from tanks and stuff, and we hid during one of those terrible raids in a bunker and never went out.</span> <span id="s748">Nobody looked for us anymore.</span> <span id="s749">And that was it.</span> <span id="s750">The next day, we slept in a, that night we slept in a barn we found with the cows and the pigs on the bottom, and the next morning very early - the sun was still shining - I liked through a crack and I saw a Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s751">And I jumped out, woke everybody - there were about twelve of us out of the girls who were with me or I was with - and he must have thought I came from another world.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Well, I did.</span> <span id="s753">I did.</span> <span id="s754">And I spoke fluent Russian, so I recognized, and I'm very sorry to tell you that eventually when we went to another town, we wanted to be repatriated so that we could find out, because we were completely isolated - this is now East Germany - the Russian commandant, who whoever he was, who was repatriated, and I mean people had no idea yet what was going on.</span> <span id="s755">People did not digest the horror.</span> <span id="s756">Maybe the Russians did because of uh because they liberated Auschwitz, but the generally speaking the May the 5th was not yet a day that people knew what was going on, even Dachau which was liberated by the by the by the Americans, and Buchenwald and all that, the general public so to speak didn't yet know including some of the Russians, and uh he says you mean to tell me that there are some Jews still left through all that.</span> <span id="s757">But he said it in a way and I thought here I was in all the Pioneer as a child you know, being taught about the greatness of Russia - I believed that garbage - and here is somebody throwing that anti-Semitic remark to me right back in my face when I haven't even gotten out from the stained, blood-stained clothing.</span> <span id="s758">That was quite an awakening to me.</span> <span id="s759">That was an I was jolted into another kind of reality from which I never quite recovered meaning that, and this is why I have contributed some of my time - what had happened then can happen again.</span> <span id="s760">And unless you and I, people like you and many like you and the Holocaust Memorial Committee and the Museum, do not keep an absolutely alert vigilant eye, we may all be in trouble again, and it may not necessarily be the Jew.</span> <span id="s761">It can be anybody who has green eyes and dark hair.</span> <span id="s762">Anything can happen.</span> <span id="s763">I hope I have answered some of the questions you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Tell me how you got, very briefly, from there to here.</span> <span id="s765">Uh what happened after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Very briefly, I will try to do it, but as briefly as I can, because I want I was in the I was first in the repatriation camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s768">Uh since Martha told me to meet her in a place called _ilina which is Slovakia, not Czechoslovakia but Slovakia, and I spoke fluent Slovakian and fluent uh fluent Hungarian which everyone apparently does there, and I knew that I had absolutely no one left in Grodno and I mean there was nothing to go back to - I had been completely alone.</span> <span id="s769">That was a reality that hit me very quickly in the face.</span> <span id="s770">Now what?</span> <span id="s771">Uh, I told them that I was born in _ilina, and that I was going to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s772">The only trouble I had to convince them is that I really was sixteen, because I looked like ten, and they were going to put me with the orphans uh program and I didn't want to be with the children's program.</span> <span id="s773">I wanted to go on my own.</span> <span id="s774">And so I convinced them and told them I was two years older than I really was, which they didn't really believe me, but somehow I managed.</span> <span id="s775">Uh and I went to Prague.</span> <span id="s776">That's another story, not for today - that's quite an incredible story all by itself...</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Encapsulate .</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Encapsulated is that I was supposed to, I came, I went on a four-day bus from Breslau (ph) to Prague and most of the people on that bus were people... (phrase missing)</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Tape #3 ...and completely alone in this world.</span> <span id="s780">That hit me as if to say, now what.</span> <span id="s781">But I didn't, I mean if you go through an experience like Auschwitz you sort of don't become philosophical and say well now what.</span> <span id="s782">And I was determined to go to _ilina and I was given, I had no money of course - they gave us a ticket.</span> <span id="s783">They told us where to go.</span> <span id="s784">Said get a ticket - you don't have to pay for it, and then you will sleep at the Jan Maszaryk House, so I went to the thing and I got a ticket but on the way back I didn't know who Jan Maszaryk was and I forgot where I was supposed to be and I couldn't remember the name of the house.</span> <span id="s785">So I sat down and (ph) where all that stuff was just going on there, and I sat down on a bench and I said OK, I will sleep here tonight.</span> <span id="s786">It was a lovely night, it was July.</span> <span id="s787">Had a little tiny white sweater and a little tiny bag like that - that was my whole belongings.</span> <span id="s788">And I said I'll wait here until tomorrow.</span> <span id="s789">I didn't know what I was supposed to do.</span> <span id="s790">I was alone but a young man comes up and sits next to me - starts talking to me in German.</span> <span id="s791">My German was very good at the time.</span> <span id="s792">He says what are you doing here, and I explained the story.</span> <span id="s793">Her says well do you know your friend is in _ilina?</span> <span id="s794">No.</span> <span id="s795">Do you have any relatives?</span> <span id="s796">I have an aunt in New York.</span> <span id="s797">Well, I could help you maybe write to her or do something, but I can't help you if you are there.</span> <span id="s798">Why don't you let met help you?</span> <span id="s799">OK.</span> <span id="s800">It was like (snap fingers) - life and death decisions made at the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s801">He could have raped me, he could have done anything, right?</span> <span id="s802">Took me to a Catholic convent and I stayed there for three months, and his father worked for a rather famous typewriter company called Schvetka, and I worked - he got me a job there and I learned Czechoslovakian, not Slovakian - I spoke Slovakian you know - within a very short time I was earning a little money and living in a in the convent, and he was quite a remarkable man, and I have just given you a little tiny medallion which he gave me at that time.</span> <span id="s803">And eventually uh the American Joint Distribution Committee found me, through my aunt I suppose.</span> <span id="s804">I wrote by the way - that might interest you - I wrote five letters in Russian, identical letters to my aunt, and I wrote on each letter on the bottom, if you should get all of these letters, please don't think I've lost my mind.</span> <span id="s805">I'm fine.</span> <span id="s806">I'm giving it to an American soldier, and I don't know which one of them will forward directly to you, and she got all five, and she said thank God you wrote that because I would have said poor child is really not right.</span> <span id="s807">Then I went to London, and instead of being...</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Through the American Joint Distribution Committee the with the with the orphans uh program, and I uh instead of spending a year in London or six months which they told me you don't know English - I think it's a good idea that yu go there before you go to the States because you're under Polish visa or quota uh, why don't you go to London and you can at least learn a little bit of English.</span> <span id="s810">And I said well, very well and I knew three words in English at that time, thank you and peace.</span> <span id="s811">And it turned out to e four years.</span> <span id="s812">And I loved it.</span> <span id="s813">Uh and so I came from Breslau to Prague, from Prague to London, from London to New York, etc. etc. and now I'm in Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Nina, is there anything that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes, I would like to add by saying that the archives that are being collected and documented for posterity, articles, video-taping, lectures, books, are of unbelievable importance.</span> <span id="s816">Not, the Holocaust you see I never looked at the at the Jewish issue - it's not.</span> <span id="s817">It's an universal issue that affects each and every one of us and the more the American public, the European people, anyone, the Arab world, the black community, the children who feel very slighted for many good reasons, understand the historical, the soci...sociological, the philosophical aspect of the Holocaust, the better off we all are because this is the greatest lesson that we can learn about humanity in any form or shape that you want.</span> <span id="s818">And I think that this kind of a preservation of history, not those that are that write their own to change their own times, is what might save the world so that we do not repeat that.</span> <span id="s819">Because history has an ugly way of repeating itself and we cannot allow that to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s821">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s822">A: You are very welcome.</span></p></body></html>
