So, I went to the army and I came to Leningrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Before we talk about Leningrad –</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Let’s talk about Vilnius, where you also lived, in the 1930s.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: What can you tell us about your life in Vilnius then?</span> <span

id="s323">It is very old.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Today 60 years, it is nothing special.</span> <span id="s326">So, this material side was –</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s329">So, we went to different small cities and I was the geographer, very responsible for my job, so we went to Landvaroof(ph), Kujainietz(ph), Iwje, Sobotniki and what, may – maybe 15 different places, and usually the technique was such that my mother wrote to the pharmacist, and the pharmacist answered that there is no dentist, and a second, very important question, is there a forest?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And why is that?</span> <span id="s331">Why would be a forest important?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: The forest is important, who is living in a forest, especially in a pine forest, we’ll have excellent lungs.</span> <span id="s333">And until now I have excellent lungs.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: How wonderful.</span> <span id="s335">How wonderful.</span> <span id="s336">There are beautiful pine forests in that part of the world.</span></p> <p><span

course.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: And my friends in the army said they never saw such big animals with such good food.</span> <span id="s354">And everything stopped.</span> <span id="s355">The lit – the lit – Italians came to Vilnius, and they knew that Vilnius had a second name, Jerusalem of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s356">So they began to destroy absolutely the Jewish population in Vilnius.</span> <span id="s357">And one of my friends, Jergus(ph) Kowalski(ph) was immediately killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: One of your friends, Jergus(ph) Kowalski(ph) was immediately killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Jergus(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: It is Grigory.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

id="s376">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Because in Iwje she had enough patients, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: It was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: – it was easier than in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: She was killed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s382">I received a letter from a Jewish doctor Melamed(ph) from Iwje, and he wrote, kill the Germans, kill the Germans.</span> <span id="s383">Your mother, together with other intelligentsia went to someplace – I don’t remember what is the name of the place – and was executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Where were you when you got this letter?</span> <span id="s385">Where were you when you got this letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: In the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: I know, but what ci – what place?</span> <span id="s388">What place?</span> <span id="s389">Were you in Leningrad?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: In Leningrad all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: In aw – in Leningrad the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yeah, all the time.</span> <span id="s393">All the time of the blockade.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: So were – this was – you got the letter before the blockade?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: It was already the blockade, because when the Reds came to Iwje, they came to eastern Poland.</span> <span id="s396">And when they came to eastern Poland, the western part of Soviet Russia became –</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s398">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: – it got ex – yeah, it got extended.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Finished, miss Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Now, here’s a question.</span> <span id="s403">You mentioned your father was the head of the Zionists in Vilnius.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: As you were growing up, in your childhood, in your – in your teenage years, did you have any political interests at all?</span> <span id="s406">Were you interested in politics?</span> <span id="s407">Did you identify yourself to any particular group?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: My beloved organization was Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s409">From Hashomer Hatzair, most of the Shomerim took part in every fight against Hitler.</span> <span id="s410">And how you see on many of the photographs, I am with the Hashomer.</span> <span id="s411">This is my political organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Tell us – tell us a little bit more about these organizations, so that people who are listening to this in the future would understand what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Hashomer Hatzair was beloved by my father because he was a Zionist, and this was the most developed youth organization for Zionists.</span> <span id="s414">So he loved Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s415">And he told my mother that it is a good place for your son to be a Shomer.</span> <span id="s416">First she said, ah, I don’t know what kind of youth is there, that is different youth, good and bad and all that.</span> <span id="s417">But when he told her, she took it –</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Seriously.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s420">And I was very close to Hashomer Hatzair because my father was the head of the Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Did you have any other close relatives as you were growing up, with you?</span> <span id="s422">To me, I get the impression that it was only your mother and yourself, as a team.</span> <span id="s423">You’re the geographer, she’s the dentist.</span> <span id="s424">Were there any other people who were close to you at those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: I will tell you, there is, in my biography a lot of details.</span> <span id="s426">But I will repeat the most important.</span> <span id="s427">My mother’s sister, Mina(ph) was a massage-ist in the Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s428">That’s why almost every year I am coming to the Druskininkai for two weeks, and I see some of the forest there, and for me is a great, tragic pleasure to see it.</span> <span id="s429">So, I went to the cemetery of people who were killed in Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s430">Most of the people were Russians, and there was written their military –</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Rank.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s433">And they saw that some other man is going on the same cemetery and is – he reads the inscriptions on the monuments.</span> <span id="s434">Well, I began to speak with him and he said that yes, I am from Druskininkai.</span> <span id="s435">I was a partisan against Hitler.</span> <span id="s436">All the Jews from Druskininkai were taken to Grodno and executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: That would mean your aunt as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: And among them was my mother’s sister, the massage-ist, Mina(ph).</span> <span id="s439">In Nesvizh my mother had a brother, Zahar(ph).</span> <span id="s440">Zahar(ph) was killed in Nesvizh very fast, because the Germans had the impression that his son has sympathies for leftist.</span> <span id="s441">So he was executed almost immediately, maybe the second or third day in Nesvizh.</span> <span id="s442">He was a composer, and I have probably here some notes that he composed.</span> <span id="s443">And some of his songs, I know from my memory, and I would want to – to – to make some – some use of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Could you sing something?</span> <span id="s445">Would you mind singing one of those songs?</span> <span id="s446">Do you mind singing one of them right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Please?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Not the easiest songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: The texts are Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: It’s understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Now, I am a very small singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: It’s okay, it’s okay.</span> <span id="s457">For us it’s very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Atango(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Atango(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Atango(ph).</span> <span id="s461">[sings]</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Thank you, thank you, I know it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s463">But we care very much about the music that people created.</span> <span id="s464">And when – this is the music of the boy who was killed, then, almost immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: It was the [indecipherable] killed.</span> <span id="s466">His name is Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes, Salomone(ph) Zarhe(ph).</span> <span id="s469">Salomone(ph), we called him Moniek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Moniek(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Moniek(ph) Zarhe(ph).</span> <span id="s472">Everybody knew him, because in Nesvizh he was the director of a dancing and singing ensemble.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: When did you – when you found – do you remember when you found out about these different things?</span> <span id="s474">Was it when you were in Leningrad, or after the war?</span> <span id="s475">What happened to your Aunt Mina(ph), what happened to Moniek(ph), what happened to your mother.</span> <span id="s476">I mean, your mother is, you got the letter, but the other people who were close to you and dear to you, when did you find out about their fate?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Something I found from letters, like Dr. Melamud’s(ph) son from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s478">Somebody I found in Druskininkai already lately –</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Mm-hm, recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Yes, that they saw that all the Jews were executed in Grodno.</span> <span id="s481">From many people, I know who survived Nesvizh.</span> <span id="s482">For instance, I write to Israel, to a very old friend.</span> <span id="s483">The old friend fought with me under Leningrad, against Hitler, but I didn’t know about it, because under Leningrad you had a half million soldiers, wh-wh-who knows?</span> <span id="s484">And this was the photograph of the Radziwells.</span> <span id="s485">His father was photographing everything what happens in the palace of the Radziwells.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And the Radziwells was not simple youks, but they had people in the royal family of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So it was a very special family.</span> <span id="s490">For instance, around Nesvizh they had over a million hectares of ground, except the palace, with the park, with everything.</span> <span id="s491">Now, from Nesvizh – so, I receive letters until now from the friend from Israel.</span> <span id="s492">He was very hard –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Wounded, or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Wounded, was he wounded, did he have injuries?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: He – he – he couldn’t walk, al-al-al-almost – almost he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s497">His wife died a short time ago, she was a survivor from Romania.</span> <span id="s498">So, from him I know a lot.</span> <span id="s499">A lot I know from the book, from Dr. Shalom Cholawsky.</span> <span id="s500">Dr. Shalom Cholawsky wrote about Jewish partisans who fought against Hitler.</span> <span id="s501">And he was one of the heads of the Jewish partisans.</span> <span id="s502">And he’s – here is his photograph with his rifle.</span> <span id="s503">Dr. Shalom Cholawsky.</span> <span id="s504">So, from such –</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: Sources.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: – sources, I know something.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: So, let’s go back now to Leningrad.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And tell us – tell me about what was your experience there.</span> <span id="s510">What was it like to be in the siege of Leningrad?</span> <span id="s511">What kind of fighting happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: You have to take [indecipherable] something, that’s my mother finished a Russian high school, and a Russian university in Kharkov, in Ukraine.</span> <span id="s513">And Russian, she said to everybody that Russia is my homeland.</span> <span id="s514">So I had some sentiments to Russian culture, to Tolstoy, to – to Chekhov.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: It is under-understandable.</span> <span id="s517">So, when I came to the Russian army, I found people who speak almost so well, how I am speaking Russian.</span> <span id="s518">And born in Nikopol’, so it is Russia.</span> <span id="s519">So, to en – together I am theirs, you know.</span> <span id="s520">So I have very strong sentiments to Russian culture, to the Russian people, but not to the Russian [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Because politics are very different, with a lot of facts, subjective facts.</span> <span id="s523">The Polish look different today, different they looked 15 years ago, so I try to be very neutral, and my politics is the politics of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: But in Leningrad in 1941, that’s the story I want to capture.</span> <span id="s525">Of a young man who’s 20 years old, or 19 years old, who’s in the Soviet army, and li – and you know, it’s hard time.</span> <span id="s526">I want to learn about what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s528">In the gymnasium of Slovatski(ph) in Vilnius was a legya(ph), legya(ph), a legion of young people who had a military training.</span> <span id="s529">But not all the Jews were there.</span> <span id="s530">Some, if they were [indecipherable] but if they were young [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s531">When they came to the Red Army, it was a training shooting.</span> <span id="s532">And I shot three times and I make 29 points.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Is that good or bad?</span> <span id="s534">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: It is a very high result.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So that means you’re a good marksman.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s538">A man who speaks Russian, and who shoots 29 from 30 possible theoretically –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Points.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s541">It was another training, who will put his gasmask faster than any other.</span> <span id="s542">So many made it in five seconds, in seven seconds.</span> <span id="s543">I made in one second and four.</span> <span id="s544">Ay.</span> <span id="s545">So they gave me on a good artillery position, thanks which I don’t hear you too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: If you had gotten 20, and not 30 - 29, maybe you’d hear me better, is that what you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Probably, probably.</span> <span id="s548">Or not –</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: – or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You never, never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So, you were in the artillery, so that means front line, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: So, it was artillery against German bombers.</span> <span id="s555">And sometimes we shoot well, and sometimes we shoot very badly.</span> <span id="s556">The first day, we shoot in – in – in a Russian plane by mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: It happens.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: It is different, you know.</span> <span id="s559">And when the Russians, at whom we shoot, found themselves a piece of a forest and were hiding, so we gave a commander to – to – to shot better.</span> <span id="s560">And they came to the [indecipherable] to our battery, and they said, no more planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Good that they survived.</span> <span id="s562">At least that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: So, was th-the – the begin of our great training.</span> <span id="s564">But, because we shot bombers, the head of our unit said, we anti-aviation artillery-ists, we are living a long time, so he said.</span> <span id="s565">Because, you know, they bombard a factory, and they don’t look on the battery of artilleries, they don’t need a battery of artilleries, they need a – to destroy the factory, or to destroy the civilian population in this city, on the market or something.</span> <span id="s566">So, the – the head of the unit told the truth.</span> <span id="s567">I think that he is still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Did you eat well during the siege?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: This was the most terrible thing.</span> <span id="s570">At home I weighted 66 kilograms.</span> <span id="s571">In the army, I weighted 39 - 37.</span> <span id="s572">I looked more like a dead man.</span> <span id="s573">The hunger was terrible.</span> <span id="s574">It is terrible.</span> <span id="s575">It is weeks and weeks and months and months, almost nothing eating.</span> <span id="s576">I have an excellent book, he has the book, where the author wrote the true face of the blockade of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s577">It is the one book where there is no subjective to – to much moments.</span> <span id="s578">He wrote how it was, everything.</span> <span id="s579">It is – it is terrible.</span> <span id="s580">You are walking through the streets and you are seeing dozens of dying people.</span> <span id="s581">This author said that in the hunger in Leningrad died one million population.</span> <span id="s582">One million; not military, civil population.</span> <span id="s583">And he said that the history doesn’t know a second such case that 900 days you don’t give up, and Hitler can’t take Leningrad.</span> <span id="s584">The marshals of Hitler came close the gates of the city, and they brought even stones to build a monument for Hitler, for their fuehrer.</span> <span id="s585">And we did, 20 years old guys, we said no.</span> <span id="s586">No.</span> <span id="s587">Ended.</span> <span id="s588">No was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: No stones for – yes.</span> <span id="s590">So what was it that you did eat?</span> <span id="s591">What was it that you did eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: This author wrote exactly, I will tell you for an example.</span> <span id="s593">15 grams sugar, it is not a full teaspoon.</span> <span id="s594">Around 20 pounds fat, but who knows what kind of fat it is?</span> <span id="s595">From a dog, or from a – from a cow?</span> <span id="s596">Who – who – who knows what it is?</span> <span id="s597">No bread, but instead of bread, sukardi(ph).</span> <span id="s598">It’s made – it means pieces of bread baked on – on – on fire, you know.</span> <span id="s599">So people said that the material for the – for the bread is the rest from food for horses, for cavalry.</span> <span id="s600">But the horses died from hunger a long time ago, and they make – made bread for the population.</span> <span id="s601">What is there more?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: I’m tal – but you, is there something you remember eating?</span> <span id="s603">This is the same thing –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: This is – this was my – my eating, but it came a better time, as they send my unit to the lake of Ladoga.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Ladoga is the largest lake in Europe.</span> <span id="s607">It is between Finland and between Russia.</span> <span id="s608">The Finnish said that all Ladoga has to belong to them, and the Russians say that all Ladoga has to belong to the Russians.</span> <span id="s609">On the Ladoga were points where trucks winter were going through the snow and the ice, through the Ladoga, through the – with some food.</span> <span id="s610">And we didn’t have a lot work to fight to the Germans, so we had enough time to help the civil population.</span> <span id="s611">So, we could –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Get some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: – something what fell on the – on the ground, or something to – but to take something from a truck, dead.</span> <span id="s614">Everybody knew, don’t touch it.</span> <span id="s615">The Ladoga has 42 kilometers, such trees were from a – one side were the Finns, and on the other side the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: And were you shooting at each other at that time, the Finns and the Russians, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: At that time, when you were in Ladoga, were the Finns shooting at the Russians or not, and the Russians shooting at the Finns?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I would say that the Finns wanted to look more gentlemen than the Germans.</span> <span id="s620">I feel so, that they threw less shells on the Russian territora – territory than the Germans.</span> <span id="s621">I have a such feeling, because in Leningrad was inscriptions on the walls, where is safer to – to walk.</span> <span id="s622">So, if you look what is written, it is written so, like most of the shells would come from the dort – from the Finns.</span> <span id="s623">Less from the Finns and more from the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: From the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: From the Germans.</span> <span id="s626">I have a such impression.</span> <span id="s627">And the author of the book writes that the dictator of Finland was a administered by the tsar in Russia.</span> <span id="s628">So, he even told – maybe it is a fantasy, but he told the Finnish army that he was the dictator, but don’t touch [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: So, it was some easier situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: How long were you there, at Lake Ladoga?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: A winter of minus 40 Celsius, minus 47.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Oh yay, oh yay.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: That’s why I pray from – for Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s635">He gave us warm shoes.</span> <span id="s636">It was more important than anything else.</span> <span id="s637">Churchill didn’t do it, but Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s638">So, with the good shoes, we ate a little more, and someday I was taken, together with 15 – 16 other Polish Jews, and sent back to the city to – sent to the city of Leningrad back.</span> <span id="s639">I came back, it was after a winter of Ladoga, I came back to a reserve unit, and the reserve unit, some people who didn’t like too much amho – too much Jewish people.</span> <span id="s640">Ah, they are all Polish, send them to Poland back.</span> <span id="s641">We’re organizing a Polish army, a leftist army.</span> <span id="s642">So, in the reserve unit I was taken to, after a winter of Ladoga, and I came to the Polish army, and in the Polish army I fought in many places.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Such as?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: In such places like – I didn’t sleep too much.</span> <span id="s645">Schneidemühl.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Was that already east Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Schneidemühl, it is in western Pomerania.</span> <span id="s648">It is the western part of today’s Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: On the Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s651">So, the Germans, when we was closer to Berlin, being stronger and stronger, and they took already all the people to the army an-and – and too young, and too old, and too – everybody understood that the end will come.</span> <span id="s652">Now, and with the Polish army, I took part in the fight for Warsaw, until ’45, May two, I fought in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: What are your memories from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: What can you tell us about your experience there?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: The Germans had a very strong discipline in the army.</span> <span id="s659">Very strong discipline.</span> <span id="s660">And the Hitler youth organization elevated them, the young people was tigers.</span> <span id="s661">Young girls 14 years old, were standing in the windows and shooting into the Soviet tanks.</span> <span id="s662">But Zhukov had this time more force, more planes, more artillery.</span> <span id="s663">I was an inspector over in the – in the army, so I was sent to different units, and among the units were such shells and artillery, that when you s – closing to the – to the gun, it was a hundred thun-thunders, not one thunder, a hundred thunders.</span> <span id="s664">That’s why my hearing is a such one, but when I was still young, it was okay.</span> <span id="s665">When I became very old, is not okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Tell me, the Soviet army – you were in the Polish army, not the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s667">But the Soviet army did not have the best reputation as it went westwards, dif – firing on the retreating Germans.</span> <span id="s668">And the bad reputation was generally borne by the female civilian population.</span> <span id="s669">The Soviet army had a reputation of raping its way westwards to Berlin.</span> <span id="s670">Do you know, did you see any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: I saw many such cases.</span> <span id="s672">In comparison with what Hitler did in one White Russia, can you forget about everything else?</span> <span id="s673">Because they didn’t leave White Russia at all.</span> <span id="s674">No one house was in – in a normal shape.</span> <span id="s675">Nothing was.</span> <span id="s676">It – it was Sahara.</span> <span id="s677">So, to – to compare if a young Russian tried something, yes, it is very bad, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s678">And Zhukov gave very hard penalties for such things, very hard penalties.</span> <span id="s679">The head of our unit and Soviet chemical specialist had something to do in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s680">In Poland the – they behaved a lot better than in other places.</span> <span id="s681">So he got three months in a – i-i-in a special –</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: In a special unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Where the unit was all the times sent on the front, you know.</span> <span id="s686">And he came – came alive.</span> <span id="s687">It i – it is – it is a – a very big problem, but every war brings true crimes.</span> <span id="s688">Every war.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Did you, as you were – before you went into the Polish army, or as you were going westwards, did you go through Belarus, did you see Nesvizh?</span> <span id="s690">Did you see anything of your former life while you were still in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: When I was in the army, I didn’t see exactly the places where I was before, because w-we went around Warsaw and from Warsaw in Pomerania, close to the Baltic Sea, I was never there before.</span> <span id="s692">So, I can tell only like about this author of the book, and about Russian people, who told me what there was.</span> <span id="s693">In – in White Russia, if a Jewish partisan was caught, they killed all the village, burned all the village, and their pro-pro-pro-pro-pro acquaintance were killed.</span> <span id="s694">It is impossible to d – to describe.</span> <span id="s695">One word, and you perished, you know.</span> <span id="s696">And I saw in White Russia [indecipherable] I didn’t leave any, but [indecipherable] didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s697">Didn’t exist absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Yeah, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: And, when after the discipline, the German discipline finished, oh, we like every [indecipherable] I wa – I was one moment the commander of the first Polish army, send me to find Greek prisoners.</span> <span id="s700">Where to look for them?</span> <span id="s701">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s702">Okay, bu-bu-but –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Where were you – where were you?</span> <span id="s704">Were you in Warsaw then, or in –</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: It finished the war, maybe a week after finishing the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: And you were in Berlin?</span> <span id="s707">The week after you finished the war, where were you located?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: I forgot the name.</span> <span id="s709">A small town maybe 20 kilometers from Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay, you were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: So I want to – to turn back and to tell you about all the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Oh, let’s – oh, but – but if you were in the – you – let’s do it the Greek prisoners.</span> <span id="s713">I was just trying to get a sense of where they were.</span> <span id="s714">You were se-sent to find Greek prisoners, around this small town in – near Berlin, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Na – here is Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Yeah, yes, I know.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t have Berlin.</span> <span id="s718">So, did you find them?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s720">The commander gave me an excellent new Austrian car with fashion.</span> <span id="s721">And, look for the Greeks.</span> <span id="s722">I look on this route, on this route, 20 kilometers farther, 60 kilometers farther, no Greeks.</span> <span id="s723">In one place I see a German lady, an old lady.</span> <span id="s724">I thought, maybe you know something about the Greek prisoners.</span> <span id="s725">I don’t know, but I saw prisoners in strange –</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: – uniforms.</span> <span id="s728">Maybe they are the Greeks.</span> <span id="s729">Where are they?</span> <span id="s730">La – three kilometers from here.</span> <span id="s731">I took her to my car, and we brought to the place that she – around there were Greeks.</span> <span id="s732">So I begin to tell them that I am from a classic gymnasium and that I know ancient Greek.</span> <span id="s733">Ohh, excellent, excellent.</span> <span id="s734">And they began in Latin [speaks Latin here].</span> <span id="s735">This is Latin.</span> <span id="s736">That – that is taken from Greek, okay.</span> <span id="s737">Or – or Homer.</span> <span id="s738">And I began in Greek, wh-who is your head here?</span> <span id="s739">The head, we will call him, but he doesn’t like to – to – to – to, you know.</span> <span id="s740">Who is it?</span> <span id="s741">He says, General Mitalas.</span> <span id="s742">He was the former Greek Minister of Defense.</span> <span id="s743">How he came to the Germans?</span> <span id="s744">The Italians, who couldn’t take Greece, took him.</span> <span id="s745">Was a prisoner.</span> <span id="s746">And when they, under the pressure of the Americans, they had to go out from – from Italy, they left Mitalas there.</span> <span id="s747">Okay.</span> <span id="s748">So I told in Greek to Mitalas a big part of “The Iliad” and I asked him, do you understood what I said?</span> <span id="s749">He said, no.</span> <span id="s750">How is it possible?</span> <span id="s751">A former minister doesn’t know Greek?</span> <span id="s752">Homer?</span> <span id="s753">He said, now is a big difference in the Greek pronunciation and Greek spelling, and I don’t know it, he said.</span> <span id="s754">Ancient Greek, who knows – knows?</span> <span id="s755">Only a great aristocrat.</span> <span id="s756">So I am the great aristocrat.</span> <span id="s757">And I took him with my excellent car.</span> <span id="s758">Ah-hah, first the car came to Berlin, to the gates of the city.</span> <span id="s759">Berlin looked very well, not destroyed anything, well, what is it?</span> <span id="s760">But when I went inside the city, closer to the center, was more and more and more, and close to the Reichstag –</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s763">Okay.</span> <span id="s764">So, one of the soldiers, of the Soviet soldiers, “Stop!”</span> <span id="s765">Why?</span> <span id="s766">Nobody can enter here.</span> <span id="s767">Okay, but look whom I have here in car.</span> <span id="s768">He looked in car and stood immediately like he would see God, because the Greeks had on their uniforms, the same things like the Russians, with the gold, and all that.</span> <span id="s769">And he allowed us to enter the city.</span> <span id="s770">So I enter to the city, and I went to the Reichstag.</span> <span id="s771">Went to the Reichstag and I saw Goebbels lying on the – on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: – sidewalk.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: How did you know it was Goebbels?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Because he was burned, and people told already that he was thrown away.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: I thought Goebbels was burned together with his wife and seven children?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Yes, he killed six children, he killed his wife, and he killed himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: But only he – you only saw his corpse, you didn’t see the – the rest?</span> <span id="s779">You didn’t see the wife and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No, I saw only him.</span> <span id="s781">Probably the children and the wife were somewhere else.</span> <span id="s782">The Greek former minister said, what kind of language do you know?</span> <span id="s783">I told, I know several languages.</span> <span id="s784">French do you know?</span> <span id="s785">Yes, I know.</span> <span id="s786">And from this moment on, we spoke with Mitalas –</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: In French.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: – French.</span> <span id="s789">And I brought Mitalas to the forest, where he was with 900 other Greeks.</span> <span id="s790">And he said about me, I don’t know why [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s791">And he was very glad that I showed him Berlin.</span> <span id="s792">And Berlin was, the center city was destroyed, because the Metro in Berlin, Hitler burned.</span> <span id="s793">And in the Metro were thousands and thousands of Germans who died there, because he thought that the Red Army –</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: – will go through the Metro too.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So these – you found Mitalas and you found a few Greeks around him, but not the 900.</span> <span id="s797">These were soldiers, these were – who were the other Greeks who were with the –</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: From a colonel up.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So these were high officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: High officers, and a Soviet delegation came to my Polish unit and took them away to Odessa.</span> <span id="s801">And all the Greeks, how the author of the book, and how it is true, came to Odessa do – to Greek back.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: I see, I see.</span> <span id="s803">What a – I mean, but what an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: What an adventure.</span> <span id="s806">So how long did you stay in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: In Berlin, maybe two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: And what happened to you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: After Berlin, the first Polish army became the fourth Silesian army, and we went to Katowice.</span> <span id="s810">And we came to the biggest city in Silesia, where there is coal, where th –</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s813">And the army number four begin to stay in Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Were you still an inspector at that time, or were you – have some of the</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: No, tha-that was – n-n-no inspector, because it was not a job.</span> <span id="s816">Something from the generals who knew me send him.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: What was your rank in the army, in the Polish army, what was your rank?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: I was one step from a colonel.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: How do say that in Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Podpułkownik.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Podpułkownik.</span> <span id="s822">Lieutenant Colonel, in other words.</span> <span id="s823">Does that mean lieutenant colonel in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: The lieutenant colonel.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: But I was already a full colonel.</span> <span id="s827">I was a full colonel, but my father was a Zionist, and they took back.</span> <span id="s828">Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: And some friend explained that, what do you want, in Poland is a different situation, and the [indecipherable] yes, some of them have sympathies to Marx or – or something, but not typical for them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: No.</span> <span id="s833">Zionist, it was like toothache to – to tell something that you have a – you’re a criminalist.</span> <span id="s834">Zionist.</span> <span id="s835">And they took it back.</span> <span id="s836">And the guy died probably, a long time ago.</span> <span id="s837">He had a – a charming wife, a wife of a Polish general, but a Russian Polish general.</span> <span id="s838">In tsarist time, when the Russians back east – back, they took factories and workers together.</span> <span id="s839">And among the workers was her father.</span> <span id="s840">Charming wife, but he, Zionist, he pronounced it so, that – that I would – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And what was his job, what was his rank?</span> <span id="s842">I mean, what was hi – what power did he have that he could take this away?</span> <span

things?</span> <span id="s856">That Stalin –</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: No-o-o-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: He was – pronounced differently the word

after?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: After being in Katowice, I was not demobilized, but some of people were already demobilized.</span> <span id="s864">But th-the blockade of Leningrad and everything, some authority, you know, said to me, find seven girls who can write on the type – ty-typewriter.</span> <span id="s865">Okay.</span> <span id="s866">I found seven girls, and out of the seven girls is my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: And that was in Katowice?</span> <span id="s868">That was in Katowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: In Katowice.</span></p> <p><span

go back to any of the places, whether it was Wilno, whether it was Nesvizh, whether it was the various towns you had been with your mother, after the war, to see what they looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: In general, not.</span> <span id="s879">But I was close to Ponary, and Ponary is a station close to Landwarów.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Lentvaris.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Ponary is from Vilnius nine kilometers, and Landwarów, 18.</span> <span id="s882">How they say in rail line.</span> <span id="s883">So, in Ponary, the most – you can’t imagine what talents were destroyed.</span> <span id="s884">Poets and writers, and – and – and – and – it i – it is impossible to – to – to – to – to imagine.</span> <span id="s885">It is the – the grain of the

<p><span id="s891">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s892">But this is not the – the – the clue, you know.</span> <span id="s893">So, I came to Vilnius six, seven years ago, Chernikowski’s(ph) monument, hoo, and another monument is there.</span> <span id="s894">I go [indecipherable] but what is – what kind of ornament is it?</span> <span id="s895">On the street Mickiewicza is – on the wall of the court before the war in – in Vilnius, the Polish court, are names of young people who were killed.</span> <span id="s896">By whom they were killed, what is it?</span> <span id="s897">And the Jewish guy explained me, that the Lithuanians said that the Jews were criminals.</span> <span id="s898">That they killed the Lithuanians because the Lithuanians were Soviet spies.</span> <span id="s899">But I imagine that when the Polish Jewish Jews in Vilnius came back to their houses, and they knew from the population, from – from many other sources, who was the real spies for Hitler, they came to the Soviets, and the Soviets do what with the young, what they could do with somebody else.</span> <span id="s900">Or they could do with – with Russians, who were under such suspicion, you know.</span> <span id="s901">So, in Vilnius in [indecipherable] city on the street Mickiewicza is a such monument.</span> <span id="s902">So, you know, how controversial all – all that is, you know.</span> <span id="s903">How –</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: When did you find out – you see, when you were talking to me before about how Belarus was no more, that it was a Sahara, that could be – that – that shows German brutality, Nazi brutality, collaborator brutality in wartime.</span> <span id="s905">When did you learn that there was something particular?</span> <span id="s906">When did you learn of the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s907">When did you first see the results that this was against the Jews, that this was a genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Okay, I am very glad that you are asking about that.</span> <span id="s909">I’m very glad.</span> <span id="s910">The Holocaust was in several acts.</span> <span id="s911">Sometimes very late, and sometimes immediate.</span> <span id="s912">The immediate are Ponary, the Jerusalem of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s913">The immediate was Nesvizh, because in Nesvizh was a very hard Jewish community.</span> <span id="s914">An intelligent Jewish community in Nesvizh.</span> <span id="s915">And in Nesvizh they collected all the population on the market, maybe two weeks after [indecipherable] Nesvizh, and they killed everybody.</span> <span id="s916">There is maybe – maybe 10 people were –</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Survived.</span> <span id="s919">And the White Russian peasantry was a lot more sympathetic to Jews than Polish.</span> <span id="s920">So, is it – so they destroyed almost all the Nesvizh community.</span> <span id="s921">And in one entry of a – of a very poor house in Nesvizh, stood a lady and took a girl from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Line?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: – from the thousands who were pushed like animals to [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s924">And the girl was saved by the lady who took her.</span> <span id="s925">And she was married by my friend who is Yad Vashem, who is working there.</span> <span id="s926">And thanks her, he is still alive.</span> <span id="s927">He is over 90.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Oh my, oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: But my question is again, a personal question.</span> <span id="s931">When did you personally, where were you when you realized that this was a genocide against the Jews?</span> <span id="s932">When did you find out, when did you realize this was not just war, and horrible war, but this was also a genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: First I have small signals.</span> <span id="s934">In the Soviet press, in the military Soviet press, a little about.</span> <span id="s935">And I slept with a Jewish guy, Schlitzer(ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s936">And Schlitzer shed – said, do you know that the Germans are killing all the Jews?</span> <span id="s937">I was very careful.</span> <span id="s938">All the Jews?</span> <span id="s939">Yes, all the Jews.</span> <span id="s940">Yes, I believe.</span> <span id="s941">I believe that they could it do, because I am from a classical gymnasium, and I know that the Latin poets said, horror Germanicus(ph).</span> <span id="s942">That the main feelings in Germany is horror Germanicus(ph).</span> <span id="s943">The Belgians are very nice people, but the Germans are a horror.</span> <span id="s944">Two thousand years write a Latin words that the main characteristic of Germans is horror.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Why were you careful around him, or why were you careful when he said that?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: I told you yes, it is possible.</span> <span id="s947">It is possible.</span> <span id="s948">And it was finished, the dispute.</span> <span id="s949">If he was a schmekel, so he told somebody else about speaking with me.</span> <span id="s950">He was not a schmekel, so I told him the truth.</span> <span id="s951">It was the first klagator(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Yeah, the first notes.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: But when I heard more and more about that, and people are – are writing full pages and all that?</span> <span id="s954">Hey.</span> <span id="s955">So it is absolutely true.</span> <span id="s956">And when I ber – began to get news from Dr. Cholawsky, and news from the guy whose wife saves him, his life, and all that.</span> <span id="s957">So naturally it is absolutely true, and the news were brighter and brighter and brighter.</span> <span id="s958">And I came to Druskininkai, and from Nesvizh people told me that 6,000 Jews in Nesvizh were killed.</span> <span id="s959">It means hundred percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Again, you learned that recently, you say, and I’m interested in after the war.</span> <span id="s961">Did you, in Katowice, when you met your future wife, did you already have an idea that this – that this was complete, that this was a full genocide?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: In time of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Right after the war, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Or – immediately after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Immediately after the war, I was in the [indecipherable] lagers.</span> <span id="s967">Oh, I so close to Berlin, in Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s968">Sachsenhausen was a big – I came to the Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s969">It stinks everything, well, what is it?</span> <span id="s970">There are two – two – no –</span></p> <p><span id="s971">pietra.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q2: Two floors, two stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Yes, and one man is sitting and holding his leg so.</span> <span id="s974">I told him, Et tu Francais?</span> <span id="s975">No.</span> <span id="s976">Zin sie deutsche?</span> <span id="s977">Nein.</span> <span id="s978">All right.</span> <span id="s979">[speaks foreign language here]</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Tell me what in – translate.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s982">I – I am asking him.</span> <span id="s983">He said, they made a conference of all the Polish intelligentsia.</span> <span id="s984">And all the professors of Jagiellonian University was on the conference, and immediately after the conference, they were to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s985">And he is sitting there because he was –</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: At the conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: O-O-O-On the – on the conference.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: That’s the scene, I don’t know if you seen the movie, “Katyn.”</span> <span id="s989">You should see this movie.</span> <span id="s990">It’s done by Andrzej Wajda.</span> <span id="s991">It’s about Katyn, but there is also a scene in the film of professors from Jagiellonian University going to this conference and then being arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen.</span> <span id="s992">So I – when I saw it, I did not know whether this was based on a factual story, or part of, let’s say, a narrative that you introduced into a film.</span> <span id="s993">And your grandfather just confirmed, you know, that it was based on a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: And after – a little after the war, when I received the letters from Melanid(ph) son, from the Dr. [indecipherable], I knew already a lot.</span> <span id="s995">I know already a lot.</span> <span id="s996">Oh, my – my mother’s brother was shot.</span> <span id="s997">His wife Julia was shot, their daughter was shot.</span> <span id="s998">Moniek the composer was shot.</span> <span id="s999">So, this is the most terrible memories, when has come the moment and I see my mother was executed, for what?</span> <span id="s1000">You know?</span> <span id="s1001">Well, a patient was coming to her, and the patient was a poor man.</span> <span id="s1002">I [indecipherable] pay tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1003">And she didn’t have any – any money.</span> <span id="s1004">But Minsk was the only big White Russian city that I saw destroyed like Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1005">When we came the 17th September ’44, to – to – to Warsaw, people who lived in Warsaw couldn’t find their street, their street.</span> <span id="s1006">They didn’t find not only the houses, but they didn’t find the pavement.</span> <span id="s1007">And in Wilno, in Wilno on the street Rudziczka, I don’t know how it is, but like [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1008">You don’t know

Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1012">I know the street [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: From right side of the Rudziczka is the house where it was born my mother.</span></p> <p><span

have to – I – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1020">But with – with a – a trees around, before the war it looked a lot worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Let’s go back to Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: How did you go – get from Katowice to the University of Pennsylvania?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1025">I went to my head in the army.</span> <span id="s1026">I was on the third year, I told him, in the University of Stefan Batory.</span> <span id="s1027">I want to finish my studies.</span> <span id="s1028">This is a hard thing, a hard thing, but I will ask very high in military.</span> <span id="s1029">Maybe he himself didn’t ask, maybe some of his friend asked the Ragsowski(ph), because a – a veteran with a [indecipherable] all that, is not so easy.</span> <span id="s1030">And they allowed me to study further my philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Is that what you were studying at Stefan Batory, is philosophy?</span> <span id="s1032">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1033">Not only philosophy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: First I studied

<span id="s1052">Come here, come here.</span> <span id="s1053">I came to Professor Czezowski, and he has a tic.</span> <span id="s1054">So I was still in uniform.</span> <span id="s1055">I told him about Wilno University, what exams are ahead, with the names of the professors and everything.</span> <span id="s1056">He listened and he said, I don’t have any suspicion that there is something untrue.</span> <span id="s1057">But wait a little.</span> <span id="s1058">I am waiting, and he brought all the papers with my inscriptions when I came, when I did came, didn’t came.</span> <span id="s1059">And Kowalski(ph), the – the killed Jergus(ph) Kowalski(ph) was there in the – the many, many – everything.</span> <span id="s1060">A-All my studies are there.</span> <span id="s1061">And he

me, please repeat the – your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: How did you get from Poland to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: It came a time – but I don’t want – want to tell something bad about Poland.</span> <span id="s1103">I don’t want, because in Poland especially, the intelligentsia were God’s people.</span> <span id="s1104">God’s people.</span> <span id="s1105">But among the gods, Bolesław Prus, a big Polish writer was a great anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s1106">But Stefan Jaronski was a great friend of the Jewish population.</span> <span
