NOTES:</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: I am talking with Mrs. Frieda Wolff, who is born in Berlin, Germany, and who spent the war years in Shanghai, coming to Shanghai in 1939, where she lived for 10 years until 1949, and who then went by boat which I think took 56 days, because you couldn’t go through the Suez Canal, to Israel, where conditions were very primitive, and very, very difficult and who then went to Germany in 1953, so that she could establish herself on the German quota, and who came to America in 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: Do you remember anything about your first impressions when you sailed into New York Harbor, what it was like?</span> <span id="s36">What you were thinking about.</span> <span id="s37">You came with your husband, you have children - .</span></p> <p><span id="s38">FW: Two children, son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s39">I tell you the truth, we just came through the immigration inside.</span> <span id="s40">You know, we never saw the outside.</span> <span id="s41">And when we came through immigration, they say, “Welcome to America.”</span> <span id="s42">You know, they welcomed us to America because we had affidavit,, and passport, and we went legal to America.</span> <span id="s43">Not illegal.</span> <span id="s44">Legal.</span> <span id="s45">And they welcomed us very nice to America.</span> <span id="s46">And in New York, my husband had a cousin, and she greeted us when we came off-through from the immigration.</span> <span id="s47">They greeted us, and from New York, we stayed a few days in New York, with a cousin of my husband, and then we boarded the train to Oklahoma City.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">WH: And, what was it like in New York?</span> <span id="s49">Do you remember what happened when you first saw the people?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">FW: Yah, it was very crowded, you know, and a cousin of my husband, she showed us around, with her car, but she say we are better off going by train or subway because the parking was very bad.</span> <span id="s51">And the first thing we saw was the theatre...Radio City.</span> <span id="s52">We were very impressed.</span> <span id="s53">And, in nighttime everything was illuminated, you know, the streets on Broadway.</span> <span id="s54">And she showed us around.</span> <span id="s55">But she didn’t live close by.</span> <span id="s56">She drove us to her apartment which was a little further away.</span> <span id="s57">I think it was in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: You left Israel because life there was very difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">FW: Yah, but like I say, it was difficult, but we always wanted to come to America.</span> <span id="s60">We already had papers from my brother and cousin and it was just a waiting time.</span> <span id="s61">We waited for the visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: Why not stay in Israel?</span> <span id="s63">You wrote then, that it was a Jewish country and you always felt good about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">FW: It was very hard at this time.</span> <span id="s65">We barely could make a living.</span> <span id="s66">My husband worked with a cousin, who was - he passed away in the meantime - who was a brother of Otto Hartz’ in Jerusalem, and he was a contractor on construction, and he had a lot of work, and my husband got a job by him at his company.</span> <span id="s67">They built houses and other things., It was very hard, and physical work.</span> <span id="s68">And Richard’s late brother who died in Germany later on, he couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s69">It was too hard for him.</span> <span id="s70">And he went to Germany earlier than we did.</span> <span id="s71">But, we were not unhappy in Israel.</span> <span id="s72">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s73">Everything was rationed, and we didn’t have enough money to buy black market, so we had to make do what we could afford.</span> <span id="s74">We raised a few chickens, and we had some eggs...Richard’s late brother, he raised...rabbits...we had rabbit meat but I never liked it...Richard’s parents there with us too.</span> <span id="s75">And we all lived together in one house.</span> <span id="s76">Richard’s parents, my husband and I and Richard’s brother and wife and family.</span> <span id="s77">So we were nine people in one house,.</span> <span id="s78">But, we always wanted to come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">WH: So, you came to the States, you came to Oklahoma City, you spent a few days in New York, what was the train ride like?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">FW: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">FW: We were sitting in the train for 36 hours.</span> <span id="s83">There was no sleeping facilities.</span> <span id="s84">We just sitting all the time in the train and I remember when I got up, my feet were swollen.</span> <span id="s85">You know, you have to put up your feet.</span> <span id="s86">But, we made it.</span> <span id="s87">It was a long ride, but we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: You stopped in many places.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">FW: Ya, we stopped in St. Louis.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: What did you think of America when you looked out, when you compared it to Germany, and Israel, and to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">FW: It was a good feeling, because we hoped to have a better life and finally settle down, because all the years, we really didn’t settle down because we were just waiting for things to happen.</span> <span id="s92">The same in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s93">We didn’t want to stay there that long, but there was no other way to go any other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: Didn’t you feel that you were going to be refugees the rest of your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">FW: Ya, we were called Displaced People.</span> <span id="s96">And we have a passport to prove it.</span> <span id="s97">And finally, after a long waiting we came here, and my husband has a profession.</span> <span id="s98">He is a butcher.</span> <span id="s99">And, my brother found a job for him in just two weeks.</span> <span id="s100">And he worked 17 years at Smart?</span> <span id="s101">Meat Company.</span> <span id="s102">It’s a big company here.</span> <span id="s103">And he worked until he retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: But that’s 17 years, but you’ve been here 34 years, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">FW: Yah, we came in 1955.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">WH: So he retired in1972?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">FW: Ya, he retired a little earlier, because he has bronchitis, and arthritis, and he worked in a cooler, so he retired by 64 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: Going back to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s109">What were conditions like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">FW: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WH: Cold?</span> <span id="s112">Damp?</span> <span id="s113">It was hot in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">FW: (inaudible-no screen doors, no screen windows?)</span> <span id="s115">we were bitten up from the mosquitos...you had no protection from mosquitos coming in the room, and the flies were all over, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">WH: Did you have any idea what was going on with the Jews in Europe during this time that you were in Shanghai, or were you cut off from the rest of the world?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">FW: No, we knew about it.</span> <span id="s118">In 1940, Richard’s brother came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s119">He came a little later because he didn’t want to leave Germany that quick, and he was almost the last people who could get out in 1940.</span> <span id="s120">After 1940 nobody could leave Germany anymore.</span> <span id="s121">And, they were all picked up and thrown in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s122">And, Richard’s late brother, and his wife and they had a little baby 6 months old.</span> <span id="s123">They came to Shanghai over Moscow by train...and they made it.</span> <span id="s124">But there were a lot of people behind and we heard that they all got picked up and killed in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">WH: How did you get the visas in Shanghai, to go to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">FW: The Jewish community, the Heibsbein?</span> <span id="s127">helped us.</span> <span id="s128">And they chartered the ships, for us in Italy.</span> <span id="s129">And we were four weeks on a ship.</span> <span id="s130">On an Italian ship...from Italy...to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: Of course, only later you knew how lucky you were that you didn’t stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s132">I’m sure it was terrible in Shanghai, but compared to what could have happened, at least you lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">FW: Yah, that was what I was writing - the speaker too, he said, “We are the lucky ones who survived.”</span> <span id="s134">And my parents got picked up in 1938, October.</span> <span id="s135">My father and my brother got picked up.</span> <span id="s136">My mother, she left later, and they were picked up from the Gestapo and sent to Poland, Cracow, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">FW: 1916.</span> <span id="s139">I was 23 years old when we left Germany.</span> <span id="s140">In ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WH: So you remember what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s142">You remember the anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">FW: Oh, yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">WH: ‘35, ‘36, ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">FW: You know, I wrote it down, because over the years you might forget.</span> <span id="s146">But, our children wanted to know too, you know.</span> <span id="s147">And, when I was thinking about it, I wrote it down, and I worked in a Jewish company, and in the beginning of 1939, - I think it was ready 1938 - they had to give up their company, (inaudible-needs translation?)</span> <span id="s148">...(WH: “appropriated it.”)</span> <span id="s149">and they took the companies away, and gave the owners just a little value of the company, and we employees, we have lost our job and we got nothing out of it.</span> <span id="s150">You know, sometimes people give you a little bonus, you know, because you lose your job, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">WH: How is it, in your view, that Germany which was so friendly and welcoming to the Jews, could do what it did to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">FW: That was the Hitler regime, you know.</span> <span id="s153">He was so powerful, that the people around, said that they had to obey what he wanted to do.</span> <span id="s154">And if the people didn’t do it, they were killed too.</span> <span id="s155">The German people who didn’t want to go with the Hitler regime.</span> <span id="s156">And many Christian people and many church leaders, they were thrown in the concentration camp too, and they were killed, too.</span> <span id="s157">It was not only Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">There were a lot of - Germans, you k now.</span> <span id="s159">When you saw the film, “Sound of Music,” you know, the Austrian people, they they were not for Hitler.</span> <span id="s160">But if they didn’t do what they wanted to do, they were shot down.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">WH: Do you ever have nightmares about what (?</span> <span id="s162">you left there?)</span> <span id="s163">?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">FW: I think at the beginning, but luckily, we were a family.</span> <span id="s165">You know, my husband and my husband’s parents.</span> <span id="s166">They were very good to me.</span> <span id="s167">But I was good to them, too, you know I did everything I could.</span> <span id="s168">We were surrounded by family.</span> <span id="s169">Not only Richard’s parents, there was Richard’s sister and husband, and Richard’s brother and wife, so we were never too much alone.</span> <span id="s170">And we did the best we could, and we survived better than people who were more spoiled.</span> <span id="s171">There were many - you know, when we came by ship to Israel, for 56 days, we were not that spoiled, but some rich women you know, rich people, they just lost everything.</span> <span id="s172">They almost lost their mind, too.</span> <span id="s173">You know, they looked terrible when they came off the ship because they couldn’t take the hardship.</span> <span id="s174">But somehow - .</span></p> <p><span id="s175">WH: Was that your impression that in Shanghai, also, that only the toughest ones survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">FW: Ya, there were many many people who were suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">WH: Why do you think you were able to make it through?</span> <span id="s178">If someone asked you, now do you explain your survival compared to that of other people, what would you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">FW: I don’t want to brag, but I was always a good person, I was good to my parents, when I was a little girl, when I started working.</span> <span id="s180">I didn’t keep my money like the people keep it here, I gave my parents all the money what I earned, and I just kept a little spending money, and they were waiting for my monthly pay check that they could make a living.</span> <span id="s181">You know, my parents, I was, I was poor.</span> <span id="s182">But I was always a good person, and I did good, and I was good to Richard’s parents, so maybe - like my mother said, “If you do good, it somehow it comes back to you in some other way.”</span></p> <p><span id="s183">WH: Was there anything that you, yourself did in terms of your response, when you were living in Shanghai that was different than the response of other people.</span> <span id="s184">Were you able to adjust more easily because you weren’t spoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">FW: Yah, I worked, too.</span> <span id="s186">I worked 6 years in Shanghai because the men couldn’t find jobs, so slow by slow, the Jewish people opened businesses.</span> <span id="s187">At the beginning, we got help from the ?</span> <span id="s188">Unrah?</span> <span id="s189">and we got food.</span> <span id="s190">You know, they had a kitchen, and we could get food, free food.</span> <span id="s191">Every day my husband went and picked up a meal, a home meal, and slow by slow, the people opened businesses, because the Chinese people didn’t take the foreigners in.</span> <span id="s192">You know, they are very family oriented.</span> <span id="s193">And they didn’t take anybody in, and slow by slow, people started opening up their own business...people sold all their valuables to make a living...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">I remember Richard’s mother had so nice hand knit tablecloth, you know hand-stitched and everything, and when we didn’t have anything to eat, we had to sell it.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">WH: When you came here, did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">FW: No.</span> <span id="s197">I didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">WH: How old were your children then?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">FW: Our

President of USY.</span> <span id="s287">And, he got a lot out of USY.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">And our daughter also.</span> <span id="s289">But our daughter was not that interested, but she got the same education like my son.</span> <span id="s290">Our son became bar mitzvah here, and our daughter, you know, at this time they didn’t push the Bat Mitzvahs that much.</span> <span id="s291">She didn’t became a Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s292">But they know Hebrew, and they had a good education.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">WH: ...Did you observe holidays and things at home?</span></p>

Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">WH: How do you think that being a survivor may have affected your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">FW: I don’t think it affected them at all.</span> <span id="s312">Because, when we came here, they were very young, and they got to school, and to college, and to Hebrew School, and everything, they really didn’t know about the hardship that we had.</span> <span id="s313">And we tried to give them a good education, and whatever things came up, they went to things, you know, they were not affected.</span> <span id="s314">In fact, that’s why I wrote this down.</span> <span id="s315">They always ask us.</span> <span id="s316">“Why you come, you came here,” and everything.</span> <span id="s317">So, finally I wrote it down, and I told them everything.</span> <span id="s318">But we never really pushed it on them.</span> <span id="s319">You know, that they children of immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">WH: You felt that it would not be helpful to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">FW: Yah.</span> <span id="s322">And, we spoke a little German at home, because at one time Richard’s mother lived with us, and she just spoke German.</span> <span id="s323">But we tried to speak English, that our children learn the English language.</span> <span id="s324">Perfect English language.</span> <span id="s325">And they understand German, but they are not too good in German.</span> <span id="s326">But they understand words.</span> <span id="s327">But they don’t speak fluently German, like I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">WH:

smart girl.</span> <span id="s333">But, you know, you have to - have zits fleich, that’s right.</span> <span id="s334">So after one year, she was not interested and she started to find jobs.</span> <span id="s335">And then she found out, without education, you cannot find good paying jobs.</span> <span id="s336">So, therefore she learned a trade.</span> <span id="s337">As a barber - but she’s a very smart girl.</span> <span id="s338">She has the life smartness, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">WH: Street smarts.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">FW: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">WH:

id="s351">FW: I cannot explain it.</span> <span id="s352">Because that was a very bad regime who hated Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">WH: Do you ever ask yourself, why, if G-d exists, He would allow that to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">FW: It happened.</span> <span id="s355">I, I think, I really think the people didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s356">Many people didn’t believe what happened in concentration camps and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">WH: But G-d knew it was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">FW: Yah, but He let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">WH: Do you ask yourself, “why?”</span></p> <p><span id="s360">FW: I don’t know, I had a wonderful mother, my mother was such a good person, and, my father, they-they had to die?</span> <span id="s361">For no reason.</span> <span id="s362">Because they were just Jewish people.</span> <span id="s363">And, my brother, luckily, he survived, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">WH: You think that G-d should have saved them, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">FW: Yah, he saved him, but, he had a lot of problems later on, you know.</span> <span id="s366">He had a nervous stomach, and his heart was damaged (inaudible).</span> <span id="s367">You know, he could have lived til now, like I could have lived - it was not meant for him.</span> <span id="s368">He died with 57 years old.</span> <span id="s369">But it was the hardship he went through, you know (needs translation).</span> <span id="s370">So, I think from the concentration camp, he died too young - he had nightmares.</span> <span id="s371">He had a lot of nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">WH: Did he ever go to anybody for counseling?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">FW: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s374">I don’t think - but maybe he didn’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s375">And he kept it to himself, I don’t think he went to counseling.</span> <span id="s376">But I heard from his wife, that he had a lot of nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">WH: Do you belong to any organizations, yourself?</span></p> <p><span
