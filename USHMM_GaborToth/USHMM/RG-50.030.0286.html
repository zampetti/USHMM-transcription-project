<p><span id="s11">Q: Will you just begin by telling me your name during the war and date of birth and where you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: Okay, well my name during the war was -- I had several names, but the name I was born to was Annaliza and I was born in Antwerp Belgium in December 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Q: So you were very young at the time before the war.</span> <span id="s14">You probably don't have too much memory about what was happening prior to the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: No, only very sporadic memories of my father and memories that perhaps are based on stories more than memories but I do think I have very clear pictures of going to the park with my dad and playing with him and doing things that normally you would expect a boy to do with a father rather than a little girl and I thought that people usually ask me why I chose a profession that I chose and although my father was a very orthodox Jewish man and certainly would have never admitted to that feeling I think that I was his first born and I think he considered me in some ways his son.</span> <span id="s16">I remember the feeling of going to the park and playing with him and him being perhaps more involved with a child, particularly a man of his generation than you'd expect him to be particularly with a girl.</span> <span id="s17">That's what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: You had a comfortable family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s20">I remember having two dear little friends who lived with us in the same house, and my grandfather and just pictures mostly not -- I remember I had a little friend who's exactly my age a few months older and his sister who was two years younger and we lived in the same house and we were constantly fighting cats and dogs.</span> <span id="s21">We couldn't be without one another.</span> <span id="s22">So, we almost really always be together and I also remember that I didn't like dolls and I used to get dolls and I used to give them to my little girlfriend.</span> <span id="s23">She loved the dolls.</span> <span id="s24">That's what I remember.</span> <span id="s25">I remember being very comfortable.</span> <span id="s26">I'm sure we were not comfortable I mean financially but I had a very nice feeling about the family.</span> <span id="s27">I mean just my grandfather was a very sweet old man.</span> <span id="s28">He used to tell me stories.</span> <span id="s29">That's basically all I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Now what kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s32">I think he started out delivering milk and learning how to be a diamond cutter or something of the sort.</span> <span id="s33">He was very, very religious.</span> <span id="s34">I remember that.</span> <span id="s35">He was always going to synagogue, coming from synagogue and praying an awful lot.</span> <span id="s36">In my head it seemed like too much.</span> <span id="s37">It seemed like not a very tense life.</span> <span id="s38">He was going to work and coming home and we observed the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s39">We would always go for walks in the park and things of that sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends as well, or were you mostly in a Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I was strictly Jewish community before the war and to my knowledge, I don't think my parents knew anyone that wasn't Jewish except in an official capacity.</span> <span id="s42">I don't know, postman, policeman, -- no social interaction with non-Jews at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Your neighbors were Jewish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s45">The ones I knew.</span> <span id="s46">I mean I was a kid so I don't remember everybody who lived there but I would say the majority were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Now, your mother spoke of a lot anti-semitism in Belgium before the war.</span> <span id="s48">Do you have any images of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: The only one is a story that my mom told me and that sort of became an indication of my early rebellion and that was at some point during these --right either at the beginning of the war or the pre-war period my grandfather was beaten up on the way back from synagogue or threatened or harassed and he I think people were pulling at his beard and he hid his beard in his coat.</span> <span id="s50">When he came home, he looked really terrible and very upset and he had told me that this was a Friday night that Friday night when men used to go to the synagogue they had a couple of angels who were watching over them and walking with them to and from synagogue.</span> <span id="s51">So, when he came back beaten and so on, I asked him Grandfather where were your angels then.</span> <span id="s52">So, that picture remained with me, his frightened look and the statement that I made then, I don't remember having made it, but it fits with the way I think.</span> <span id="s53">So, and several people that I have met, in fact recently, very recently just about three months ago when I was last in Belgium said you are this little girl who said that.</span> <span id="s54">They remember that statement.</span> <span id="s55">That's the only evidence I have of anti-semitism that touched us directly but before I really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Do you remember what your grandfather's response was to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I don't think he said anything.</span> <span id="s58">He didn't say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Did you ever have to wear the Star of David?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s61">Both my mother and I wore it I think after the men, -- the husband of this neighbor and my dad were taken I think to go to a work camp, and we had to wear the star.</span> <span id="s62">One picture I have of that is that she used to always carry me over her should to hide her star so that we would travel in the trolley or something and she would carry me so that her star and mine were essentially hidden to avoid being harassed in the streets.</span> <span id="s63">She'd always do that, carry me.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Do you remember, and I assume we'll be getting into things that I think you probably have a very clear memory of -- do you remember when Belgium was occupied by Germany?</span> <span id="s65">Do you remember seeing troops or hearing noise?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I remember having to leave in the middle of the night and walking through woods and being petrified and having German shepherds, hearing German shepherds barking in the distance and dragging and running through woods.</span> <span id="s67">I remember that, so I remember the German voices and the dogs, particularly the dogs and until maybe ten years ago I had to run if I saw any dog or heard a dog.</span> <span id="s68">So, I've overcome that too, but I really was very shaken by a dog.</span> <span id="s69">I couldn't go in a room -- and particularly a German shepherd, I would just freeze.</span> <span id="s70">I would completely decompensate so I remember that.</span> <span id="s71">I don't remember the streets of Belgium per se.</span> <span id="s72">I remember the terror of what appeared -- I saw my mother being frightened and I became completely petrified.</span> <span id="s73">I remember that march through the woods and ending up in some abandoned home somewhere and being there with a lot, a lot of people.</span> <span id="s74">I don't remember who these people were except for those friends that we were living with basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So you were running to hide from the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, we were running to try and escape because at some point after the two husbands had gone to work, during that period some people came into the house and they weren't really Nazis, but they pretended to be Gestapo and they beat up everyone in the house.</span> <span id="s77">My mother and my grandfather and me and they were really beating us and I remember screaming and my mother screaming.</span> <span id="s78">They finally left.</span> <span id="s79">They ransacked the place and they were looking for money and so on.</span> <span id="s80">They got in on the pretense of being Gestapo and --</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: These were just Belgium police?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, they were just Belgium police or Belgium hoodlums, not necessarily in any kind of official capacity.</span> <span id="s83">They might have just done that.</span> <span id="s84">This was a good time to do that.</span> <span id="s85">I mean it was perfectly acceptable.</span> <span id="s86">So, at that time my mother I think and her friend decided to leave and try to join the husbands and I think that this is when we went to France with the idea of trying to get to Switzerland because Switzerland was a safe place.</span> <span id="s87">If I remember when we got to the rondeveax essentially of where we were supposed to meet our fathers and someone to take us across the border, someone had betrayed and so that's when my parents went to the camps, the French camps ________________, was one of the camps that they went to.</span> <span id="s88">I'm not exactly sure how we got out of there and they went to another camp and that period my friends and I went to that home that we were hidden in.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: I just want to backtrack a second so I don't get confused.</span> <span id="s90">Now you had mentioned that your father and his friend your neighbor were sent to a work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: In France.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: This was before you went out into hiding into the woods?</span> <span id="s93">I'm trying to get the sequence here.</span> <span id="s94">If you remember, through researching any dates, maybe that would help me too.</span> <span id="s95">I mean that I know that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: I think the first time we left, because we left twice.</span> <span id="s97">The first time we might have gone all of us together to __________ in France, and that must have been '40, '41 somewhere around there.</span> <span id="s98">And then we came back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s99">I think subsequently the men went to work again to that place in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Which was called?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: ________________ or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: This was near ____________ I think?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes, in the north of France somewhere.</span> <span id="s104">And during the period that they were away that's when we had the incident of people breaking into our home and then we left I think that's when we went through the woods and were supposed to meet up with the fathers and then supposed to meet up with someone who was going to take us across the border to Switzerland, but we didn't make it.</span> <span id="s105">So, and we got caught that time.</span> <span id="s106">The first time we were simply sent back home.</span> <span id="s107">The second time we got caught by the French police who then put us into these sort of transient camps which are really deportation but I certainly didn't know.</span> <span id="s108">I don't know how much my parents knew of what these places were going to lead to.</span> <span id="s109">I'm not sure they really knew.</span> <span id="s110">At some point they heard that people who left there never got back.</span> <span id="s111">I mean that through the grapevine that sort of information started to filter through and so they found that out and that's when I was in the children's home they were at a camp and that's when they decided to run out of the camp before they were sent to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Now, as I understand it, the second camp they went to was ________________?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Were you in that at all with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No, I think that when they were transferred to ___________ they had made some arrangements to take the children away and try to hide them, and that's when we were, my friends and I in that camp in that home near ______________.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Tell me a little bit about the home, who was there, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, the children ranged from about four of five years of age, somewhere around there until they looked very big to me, but actually they were 16.</span> <span id="s118">I think the oldest were 16 to 17.</span> <span id="s119">There was a mixture.</span> <span id="s120">They were all refugee children.</span> <span id="s121">Many of them were not Jewish and many were actually refugees from the Spanish civil war because this place was very close to Spain.</span> <span id="s122">It's in the part of France that borders on Spain almost so the catholic archdiocese of that area had taken in some children from that war and kept all of them together in that home.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: So, this was a catholic home?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: It was a catholic run home but it ha connection to Jewish organization who was able to channel some of their kids into that particular home.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Now you were about how old then?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: At that time I must have been about seven, six or seven because I was born in '36 and that must have been '42, '43 somewhere around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How long were you in this home?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: In this home I was approximately eight to nine months and that part I remember quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, things that stand out hunger, real, real hunger.</span> <span id="s131">Nothing to eat, but that didn't bother me because I really didn't like to eat but I remember my little girlfriend, food was her thing.</span> <span id="s132">She was this plump little thing and you could always shut her up by giving her food.</span> <span id="s133">So, I used to run to the kitchen at night and steal whatever I could find and feed her because she was crying all night.</span> <span id="s134">She was crying because she was hungry, and I was crying because I wanted my mother.</span> <span id="s135">So, we were quite a pair.</span> <span id="s136">So, hunger -- and I knew there was nothing to eat and whatever there was I couldn't swallow.</span> <span id="s137">I just couldn't swallow any food there.</span> <span id="s138">The other thing I remember is lice and the worst incident which may look ridiculous now but was when you had lice they shaved your head, and I was very proud of my hair.</span> <span id="s139">I had really beautiful long hair and when I found out that I had lice and I could tell, because I was really itching.</span> <span id="s140">I hid in the outhouse.</span> <span id="s141">There was no indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s142">There was indoor cold water to wash but no toilet.</span> <span id="s143">I hid in the outhouse for a couple of days and nobody could get me out of there because I knew as soon as they found out they would shave my head.</span> <span id="s144">So, but they eventually did.</span> <span id="s145">I had to get out.</span> <span id="s146">They shaved my head, and it was absolutely horrible, just horrible.</span> <span id="s147">Now, it looks kind of silly but and it wasn't just lice it was scabies, you know the things that crawl under your skin, so we were not really in very good shape.</span> <span id="s148">And there was always a feeling of fear and just terrible -- feeling terrible.</span> <span id="s149">First of all, not understanding at all why you were there what was happening, missing your family and just the terror basically.</span> <span id="s150">I think I acted irrationally on many occasions where I would just run out of the window in the middle of the night in the nightgown and just try to run away and being caught.</span> <span id="s151">You know, brought back to this, so we had songs but I don't know if they made them up or the older children probably did which referred to us having to wake up at 7:00 in the morning and having to wash with cold water and the son reflected that there was no food only some kind of vegetable, something like a sweet potatoes.</span> <span id="s152">That's why when people serve me sweet potato at Thanksgiving I say thanks but no thanks.</span> <span id="s153">I can't even look at the stuff.</span> <span id="s154">I don't know if it's the same, but it's so similar that it's enough to turn me off.</span> <span id="s155">That's all we had.</span> <span id="s156">SO, there was a song that reflected the realities of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What was a normal day like in this home?</span> <span id="s158">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: As little as possible.</span> <span id="s160">I mean I'm not a psychologist but if I look at myself back then I must have been -- I would qualify myself as a really depressed child, entirely depressed.</span> <span id="s161">I couldn't do much of anything.</span> <span id="s162">We were very regimented so we had to get up at 7:00 and we lined up.</span> <span id="s163">I don't know if you saw the several films about children's homes, catholic homes _________________ I think is one of them where children just line up and they wash and then they go to breakfast and then they go to prayer.</span> <span id="s164">They used to pray but we sort of didn't pray along.</span> <span id="s165">I believe that there were some kind of organized games, like playing ball or something like that and there were various levels of instructions, but I don't think I learned a tremendous amount.</span> <span id="s166">I just don't remember anything that was organized.</span> <span id="s167">There was some instruction but I'm sure the way I feel when I think about it I was just there, but I wasn't there basically.</span> <span id="s168">That was that.</span> <span id="s169">We had to make our rooms and we had to help in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s170">We had to peel the few potatoes there were, the sweet potatoes, whatever this vegetable was.</span> <span id="s171">We had to help clean up and that was it.</span> <span id="s172">There was nothing else going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Was it crowded?</span> <span id="s174">Did you sleep in the same area with a lot of other kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s176">There were two areas, there as a female area and there was a male area, boys and girls.</span> <span id="s177">We were lined up like in the old hospital wards, a number of beds together one next to another.</span> <span id="s178">We had essentially no possessions.</span> <span id="s179">We didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s180">We just had our beds and I don't remember if I had any change of clothes.</span> <span id="s181">I mean I don't think I had anything.</span> <span id="s182">Maybe they provided us with some old clothes, but we didn't have -- I don't remember having a cubicle I could call my own you know with my stuff.</span> <span id="s183">I had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: How many kids were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: I really don't know.</span> <span id="s186">I'd say 100 or so, not more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Were the people who took care of you nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, I don't think so, but it's hard to tell.</span> <span id="s189">I was just so unhappy.</span> <span id="s190">I don't have good feelings about anybody there, but it may not be them.</span> <span id="s191">I don't remember-- for instance, this incident with the hair, I thought they were barbarians when they did this.</span> <span id="s192">I felt that this was a middle age torture but in retrospect maybe that was the only way to deal with the lice.</span> <span id="s193">SO, I Thought they were mean, but maybe they weren't.</span> <span id="s194">I don't remember anybody being particularly kind to me or particularly paying attention to me but then they probably were understaffed and lots of kids and all of us were miserable and unhappy.</span> <span id="s195">I know for a fact that I was extremely rebellious and did exactly the opposite of what I was told.</span> <span id="s196">It didn't matter what it was, I would just fight it.</span> <span id="s197">I would continuously argue and fight scream run a way.</span> <span id="s198">So, you really would have to be a very well trained professional to handle a child of that condition and they weren't.</span> <span id="s199">I assume they were volunteers from the church or from other relief organizations and I guess they did the best they could but I can't say that there was somebody there that was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: You said you were there about eight or nine months, how did you get out of there?</span> <span id="s201">What were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Well, the circumstances are a little bit muddled but apparently my parents send someone to pick us up from there because they were escaping to Nice to the part of France that was occupied by the Italians as to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: How did your parents get out of _____________?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: From what they told me is that they were told that they were going to be sent somewhere else and they sort of smelled a rat and they asked for one day off to come in and say goodbye to their children or visit their children and then of course they ran away to Nice during that supposed trip, but they didn't come to pick us up because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s205">So, they apparently sent some lady to pick us up, but my friend whom I spoke to yesterday, said that this person was afraid to travel with three children, so she gave us the money and left and told us how to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Were you the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: He and I were the oldest.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: At age seven or eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s210">And I do remember parts of that trip like getting on trains and getting off trains and somehow getting to Nice, but I cannot recall the details of that but I know we made it.</span> <span id="s211">My recollection is that there was no adult with us and he confirmed that that this lady had at least given us the money, she didn't take it and run, but she was afraid to travel with three children.</span> <span id="s212">She thought -- the way we looked with our shaven heads and with the lice and the scabs.</span> <span id="s213">We really looked awful so she decided to just tell us how to get there.</span> <span id="s214">We had grown up pretty quickly, and we got there.</span> <span id="s215">We simply made the rondevoux with our parents in Nice.</span> <span id="s216">That was --that's why I say it sounds like it's not true and just like a dream, but it is true.</span> <span id="s217">We did get there and we did find our parents.</span> <span id="s218">But I then in Nice it actually was a very happy period.</span> <span id="s219">It sounds also crazy but we were living in a hotel and in the same hotel we had Italian soldiers and they were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s220">They were not too interested in what the directives were from the Nazi government.</span> <span id="s221">I remember them giving me chocolate and I used to go up with them and play with them.</span> <span id="s222">I mean they were just very lovely people.</span> <span id="s223">And we were together but the remnants of that previous experience were there with me and so by that time I was eight or so and I was wetting my bed and I was screaming, having nightmares every night and waking up and screaming even though the days were fairly happy, the nights were just terrible, really terrible.</span> <span id="s224">But that stands out as a nice time in Nice because we were all together and we would go to the beach and I wasn't at the time fully realizing -- we lived pretty much for the present.</span> <span id="s225">As a child in general you don't anticipate much in the future, you know, at that age.</span> <span id="s226">We were together and we were having a good time.</span> <span id="s227">I could not imagine that first of all things would get worse again and that was not a temporary arrangement, that it wasn't a full time solution to the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: I don't understand Nice was under Italian occupation, Italian German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Right.</span> <span id="s230">But Italian, not German.</span> <span id="s231">The Germans came in later, so it really was strictly Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Did you have total freedom as Jews at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Officially no because the official party line of the Italian Nazi government with Mussolini was also that Jews had to be deported and rounded up, but the orders were not quite as effective and there was very little discipline in the Italian army, and those people who were in the army just couldn't care less whether we were Jews or something else.</span> <span id="s234">They simply couldn't care less so we were supposed to officially hide that we were Jews, but they knew fully well we were and I think we were fairly free to go and do as we pleased.</span> <span id="s235">I'm not sure, I think that the order of deportation sort of depended on your nationality and so my parents at the time might have become Czechoslovakian or something like that and giving me a different name and that name I don't remember.</span> <span id="s236">If you had Czechoslovakian papers it really didn't matter at the time whether you were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s237">For a short period of time the authorities respected the nationality versus your ethnic background.</span> <span id="s238">That didn't last, but for a short period of time it was that way and the soldiers who were supposed to execute the orders couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s239">I mean they just did not round up people.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: So, you were in Nice leading what you felt was a pretty nice life in the daytime anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Do you remember about how long you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I would say also about ten months or so approximately and then when Italy capitulated and the Germans came marching in through the part of France that had previously been occupied by the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: The end of --must have been the beginning of '44 or somewhere around there, I think.</span> <span id="s246">The war was over in '45 and we were in ____________ for perhaps a year, so I'd say'44 or so, but maybe you can check the accuracy of that.</span> <span id="s247">At that point the news spread rather quickly that -- well they already knew what the Germans were doing to various people in various other places, so when they heard that Germans were coming they decided to run and again try to get to Switzerland the second time around.</span> <span id="s248">Things moved very quickly so it also became known that entire families were subject to being arrested and they would be preferable for women and children were still sort of led through without being bothered or had a better chance.</span> <span id="s249">So, my mother and her friend and neighbor and my two little friends, we decided to leave from these to a border town Switzerland and to leave the men behind and they were going to try and find someway to get there, not by public transportation but try to arrange some kind of private way to join us.</span> <span id="s250">From there we were going to try and get through to Switzerland together.</span> <span id="s251">So, the train trip was uneventful, I mean my mother and myself and her friend and her two little children went along and we got to a place where I don't know if we stayed in a hotel or I don't know where we stayed exactly.</span> <span id="s252">In the meantime my father and his friend was going to come by ambulance.</span> <span id="s253">They had found someone who was going to drive an ambulance and take them as being ill.</span> <span id="s254">So, they established a point of meeting which was a block from the hotel where we had stayed.</span> <span id="s255">My father for some really stupid reason decided to go back to his hotel room because he had forgotten his prayer shawl and his ______________, and when he got to the hotel the Germans were there.</span> <span id="s256">So, he didn't make it.</span> <span id="s257">They arrested him.</span> <span id="s258">Apparently Mr. ______________ waited until the evening and then the ambulance driver says I'm not going to stay any longer because we're going to get picked up.</span> <span id="s259">So, they left and they came and dropped off Mr. Shimmer wherever we were.</span> <span id="s260">And then I remember this most horrendous scene of my mother collapsing when she saw him come in alone.</span> <span id="s261">She immediately knew that something was very, very wrong.</span> <span id="s262">I just remember her just totally going completely hysterical and screaming and pulling out her hair and to me this was just the most frightening because I just came out from something that was relatively safe, and it just was everything fell apart.</span> <span id="s263">We stayed together for a while with those people and the family had their parents at least.</span> <span id="s264">The woman had her parents in Switzerland and so they decided to really push on and try to get to Switzerland and my mother at that point said she didn't care anymore.</span> <span id="s265">She just didn't care, and she decided to stay put in _____________, which was the town where we were at.</span> <span id="s266">At that point we got papers from people who proceeded us and who we paid a lot of money to get those fake papers.</span> <span id="s267">So, we changed our name again.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: To a French name?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: A French name so my name was __________________.</span> <span id="s270">I had one or two names in between but I just don't remember and that was a terrible thing because they tell you you are no longer such and such but you are such and such, and you keep repeating it to yourself until you actually believe that you are this other person.</span> <span id="s271">It gets extremely confusing.</span> <span id="s272">At that point, I must have been around eight or so, eight and half, and I mean I was very angry.</span> <span id="s273">At that point I just became very, very angry about everything and we moved into an apartment in a private house where they were -- actually it was owned by the people who lived downstairs and there were two floors above.</span> <span id="s274">The first floor was inhabited by a Jewish family who were German Jews.</span> <span id="s275">They had become French, but they were German Jews originally, and then we had an apartment which was not really a real apartment but just under the roof where the roof actually meets the floor.</span> <span id="s276">It's called _______________, like an attic apartment essentially.</span> <span id="s277">I don't know if we had three or four rooms there, but really two rooms maybe, just two room, one which was an everything room and one which was a bedroom.</span> <span id="s278">We stayed there pretty much to the end of the war with the false identity and at that time, my mother became involved with the resistance not officially part of it but harboring people who were in the resistance and also harboring a lot of people who were in transient trying to get to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s279">She would provide them with hiding place and with food and when they left they left their papers behind and we'd get their ration cards for food.</span> <span id="s280">So, at that point, we were really wealthy in terms of food availability.</span> <span id="s281">It was a time for me where I was pretty much like a street child.</span> <span id="s282">I did whatever I wanted.</span> <span id="s283">I was supposed to go to school but I never did.</span> <span id="s284">I mean I said I was going but I played hookey and I was hanging out with sort of the worst characters of the town, but compared to what worst characters are now, I guess they were pretty mild.</span> <span id="s285">But we just would go and hide and play.</span> <span id="s286">We'd play three musketeers and we'd play all these fighting games.</span> <span id="s287">I didn't go to school, I just never showed up, and when I was there I was so disruptive that they used to throw me out, so it really didn't matter.</span> <span id="s288">But I learned how to read by myself.</span> <span id="s289">Two things I was doing.</span> <span id="s290">I was reading voraciously.</span> <span id="s291">I didn't understand a thing of what I was reading.</span> <span id="s292">I just simply didn't understand.</span> <span id="s293">I was just reading books and books.</span> <span id="s294">Whatever it was, it didn't matter what it was.</span> <span id="s295">It could have been the phone book.</span> <span id="s296">It didn't matter.</span> <span id="s297">It was an escape, you know, and I could just not be in the present.</span> <span id="s298">It was away from everything.</span> <span id="s299">I had another friend then who lived nearby.</span> <span id="s300">I was friends with all the village kids, basically.</span> <span id="s301">Then, the people who were renting us the place were very, very nice.</span> <span id="s302">They were French, but they pretended not to know, but they knew of course that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s303">They never questioned anything, but they knew and I used to go to church with them on Sundays because it was kind of accepted and would be better that I would show up.</span> <span id="s304">And my mother's French was not great.</span> <span id="s305">It still has a very foreign accent, whereas I as a child had really become completely fluent from that time in Nice and in that home I was perfectly fluent so I could pass for French kid easily.</span> <span id="s306">They thought it would be a good idea for me to go to church, so at least the child goes even if the mother doesn't show up.</span> <span id="s307">I was quite taken by that service.</span> <span id="s308">As much as I had been anti-religious to my own religion, there was something very comforting about the church and the priests and there was a very safe feeling in that big building and the way the voices resounded.</span> <span id="s309">That I remember that feeling for the church.</span> <span id="s310">Now, I hate the catholic church, but I really felt very comforted by that whole atmosphere.</span> <span id="s311">The daughter of the people who were renting the place to us had her solemn communion as they call it, and I was very envious.</span> <span id="s312">They wore this white dress and this white veil and to me this was like I don't know, utopia, to be able to do all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Do you think unconsciously anyway that you knew these people were not being annihilated the way Jews were.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Oh, I knew that going to church was a safe thing that once you belonged to that group you were okay.</span> <span id="s315">So, I guess it was wanting to be safe and wanting to be part of another group.</span> <span id="s316">I mean I knew that I couldn't tell who I was.</span> <span id="s317">And, as I said, I was really very angry and I was very nasty.</span> <span id="s318">One of the people that my mother had taken in in the meantime until they got someone to take them to Switzerland was extremely fearful for good reasons and was not leaving the apartment at all.</span> <span id="s319">I mean it was just really sequestered and would not go out.</span> <span id="s320">My mother was circulating freely with her fake papers.</span> <span id="s321">I mean if they would really look into it they would have found that her French was not great and she would have been picked up, but she braved it so to speak.</span> <span id="s322">I certainly could pass for a French kid, but this man and his wife were there and they were absolutely petrified.</span> <span id="s323">He, in particular was just I mean, he wouldn't leave and we had curfews where we had all the windows and so on, and I used to come home supposedly from school, but from wherever I was hanging out and I would scream at the top of my lungs for him to come down and I used to tell him that he had to carry my bookcase up.</span> <span id="s324">I had this little thing, and if he didn't I was going to give him away to the Germans.</span> <span id="s325">You could see the warped feelings that in some way I could pass for not being Jewish.</span> <span id="s326">I convinced myself that I was catholic and I was going to be find.</span> <span id="s327">I also knew this wasn't true, but somehow I took it out on this poor guy who was really terribly frightened.</span> <span id="s328">I mean I can still see myself standing at the foot of those stairs and screaming, you come there and pick up my bag and if you don't I'm going to tell on you.</span> <span id="s329">He would come, you know, he would just come.</span> <span id="s330">He didn't know what to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: You were trying to exercise some sort of control?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes, like I could go out and he couldn't.</span> <span id="s333">But deep inside I knew this was just really not true, but somehow we managed to fake him out a little longer and he didn't have papers and he did nothing and he didn't know French, and he looked real Jewish.</span> <span id="s334">He would have been picked up very quickly.</span> <span id="s335">In incidents like that where I was just doing really nasty, very nasty things.</span> <span id="s336">They were really a way of saying, you know, I can do what I want basically.</span> <span id="s337">I'm not going to school.</span> <span id="s338">I can just do whatever.</span> <span id="s339">Nobody can tell me what to do.</span> <span id="s340">There were some terrible moments for me because my mother was frequently gone, and I never knew if she was going to come back, and there were nights where there were alarms for bomb raids, and those were really horrible.</span> <span id="s341">They were just just horrible.</span> <span id="s342">I would be totally, totally petrified and I had to run to the shelter by myself.</span> <span id="s343">I was afraid to get out of bed let alone -- it was all in the dark-- let alone go down the stairs and go to the shelter by myself.</span> <span id="s344">I usually managed to somehow make it to the people below and we'd go together.</span> <span id="s345">So, when she wasn't home, but then to go back to my place.</span> <span id="s346">I mean she didn't want to always say that she was leaving, you know, to the other people.</span> <span id="s347">You don't know.</span> <span id="s348">They could put a trace on her.</span> <span id="s349">She was going to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s350">She was getting watches and she was then going to Paris and she was selling them.</span> <span id="s351">She was doing all sorts of weird things just to get some money to survive, and she was helping people get across the border, so she really never wanted to say what she was doing and she didn't tell me either.</span> <span id="s352">She would just tell me I'll be back as soon as I can, but to an eight year old, that's not that reassuring particularly having been separation where I didn't know if I ever was going to see her again having seen her reaction to my father's disappearance and knowing that that certainly was not really good.</span> <span id="s353">I was really scared, I mean really, really scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Was the bomb shelter in your building or in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: It was not in the building, it was somewhere further away.</span> <span id="s356">I don't exactly know where it was, but we had to go walk in the dark, run basically and to this day I must say that I'm still afraid of the dark.</span> <span id="s357">If I'm in the house alone, I'll have every light on.</span> <span id="s358">I just won't be -- I really have to talk to myself to be able to turn off all the lights and say nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s359">We were in the dark because of curfew to begin with and then you weren't going to start taking flashlights going to a shelter.</span> <span id="s360">That was really better.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: The Jewish family on the first floor, did people know they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Well, they looked awfully Jewish, but they were French citizens and so they thought -- I don't remember, or I don't think that papers in France said that you were Jewish.</span> <span id="s363">The French documents, I don't think that they mentioned religion but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s364">They looked awfully Jewish, because she had a wig, but he was a lawyer and he was a very distinguished gentleman, German origin, and perhaps he thought that was going to save them.</span> <span id="s365">It turned out that he was picked up a day or two before the liberation and he never made it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Did you help your mom with any of these activities in small ways or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Well, I'm sure I helped just with housekeeping things.</span> <span id="s368">I'm sure I did some of the shopping where she'd send me to buy food.</span> <span id="s369">I remember going to the grocery store and doing all of that stuff.</span> <span id="s370">In a more concrete way in terms of I mean I remember seeing all these people, being upset because sometimes we had ten twelve people sleeping in one room.</span> <span id="s371">We had five or six people in one bed, so I was not thrilled and I did sort of threaten some of these people, but for the most part I was probably helping her as much as I could.</span> <span id="s372">I know that as I said I'm sure I did the shopping and I brought food home and I helped her with cleaning up and that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s373">I didn't go to Paris with her to sell watches.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: It's interesting that your mother, as you described it, really fell apart when she didn't see your father, and yet it sounds like she was pretty courageous.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: She was extremely courageous but she was courageous throughout but that first impact, that first shock and this is what I remember.</span> <span id="s376">Now, I think there's nothing worse for a child than to see the mother fall apart.</span> <span id="s377">As long as the mother is still in tact then they know they have somebody to lean on.</span> <span id="s378">I realize at that moment that something terrible had happened to my father but I didn't realize exactly what but when I saw her, it just hit me like a sledge hammer.</span> <span id="s379">She was really gone.</span> <span id="s380">I mean she was just not -- I don't know that it lasted a few hours and maybe the next day she sort of composed herself and she certainly picked up the pieces and went on and survived, and not only survived but helped me survive.</span> <span id="s381">There is no question about it, I would not survive without her.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: When you think back on the kind of person your mother is, do you think it was predictable that she would get so involved in illicit activities like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s384">But one thing about her is that even though she came from this small village from this very orthodox background, she was quite somewhat of a maverick within her generation.</span> <span id="s385">She was orphaned very early, I don't know if she told you that, but she was about six years old when her mother passed away, mother and one brother went with the Russian flu, so she was very young at the time.</span> <span id="s386">She became really the housekeeper for her father for a short period of time, his mother came and took care of the household, and then she got killed in some stupid accident.</span> <span id="s387">She got kicked in the belly by a horse.</span> <span id="s388">She went to market, so she lost her grandmother maybe a year after that.</span> <span id="s389">So, she really became the woman of the house at age eight or nine or something, so she was quite independent.</span> <span id="s390">She had to be.</span> <span id="s391">She's a really intelligent person and she was always interested in a lot of things so she became interested in zionism, and so she took Hebrew lessons secretly because it certainly was considered inappropriate for a girl to do that.</span> <span id="s392">So let's say that it's not totally out of character to do things which one would not have expected of a woman of that generation and that background.</span> <span id="s393">She adapted.</span> <span id="s394">She learned Hebrew, she learned French.</span> <span id="s395">She even learned English at that point on her own.</span> <span id="s396">She didn't have any formal schooling, and she's really a very educated person and it's all self made.</span> <span id="s397">I think that she had no inclinations to be a delinquent let's say but certainly to take charge of herself when needed, and so she did.</span> <span id="s398">This was the only thing that was opened to her, so she did that.</span> <span id="s399">I mean the smuggling of the watches with the resistance that was really self preservation.</span> <span id="s400">I think to some extent she I don't know that she really cared that much about herself at that point.</span> <span id="s401">I think she just forgot about herself.</span> <span id="s402">She just did things for the wider picture if you wish, but she was no longer afraid for herself.</span> <span id="s403">She sort of thought well, you know the worst has happened as far as her husband is concerned.</span> <span id="s404">She had to leave her father behind in Belgium.</span> <span id="s405">She couldn't take him because he wouldn't come.</span> <span id="s406">He had to cut his beard off and he wouldn't do that so he stayed behind.</span> <span id="s407">She already had lost her mother and a brother so somehow she felt it doesn't matter anymore.</span> <span id="s408">There was her child, and so I think she did a lot for me, for my sake.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Even though the people like your landlord who probably looked the other way and knew you were Jewish and was very kind, he must have had some concerns about all the people coming in and out of your attic apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: He might have, but I wasn't aware of any frictions.</span> <span id="s411">That she could tell you much better.</span> <span id="s412">I was very welcome in their household.</span> <span id="s413">These people were -- he had been a fighter in World War I and he had actually lost a leg or suffered a severe injury so he was limping or had a wooden leg.</span> <span id="s414">I just remember him limping rather heavily, and she was just a very sweet lady and they could not have children.</span> <span id="s415">In fact their daughter was a adopted one.</span> <span id="s416">She was one of 14.</span> <span id="s417">The woman's sister had 14 children so she adopted her youngest.</span> <span id="s418">Then I was sort of a welcome addition in a sense because she had hoped to have a large household with a lot of children, and she didn't.</span> <span id="s419">I felt so good in that household.</span> <span id="s420">It was very warm and just normal.</span> <span id="s421">Basically it was just normal.</span> <span id="s422">So, that I really always felt very good there, and my mother still writes to them every Christmas.</span> <span id="s423">Every Christmas she sends them a box of chocolates.</span> <span id="s424">The older couple is now gone, but the one girl, the one whose communion I envied so much is now a grandmother.</span> <span id="s425">She's in her 60s.</span> <span id="s426">I don't think there could have been too much antagonism.</span> <span id="s427">Like I said, he fought in World War I and he was not very fond of the Germans at all, and he was a really strong French patriot and this invasion did not sit too well with him, and he was sort of in a way sorry that he was too old to fight.</span> <span id="s428">So, I think in that sense, he knew we were Jewish, but he wasn't quite too sure and all that activity to him sort of looked like a good thing in the sense of being resisting the occupation.</span> <span id="s429">Although he wasn't personally involved in my knowledge, he sort of turned away.</span> <span id="s430">They were in their 60s at the time I think.</span> <span id="s431">They looked very old to me, but again, now that I'm going to 58, it doesn't look that old.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: How did you hear about the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I'm not sure how, but I remember that we all were dancing in the streets of _____________.</span> <span id="s434">The entire town was there and there was really a jubilation and I didn't fully -- so I guess it came over the radio and all the people from the resistance knew that the end was near.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: It was May 8 of '45, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: This area wasn't liberated until then?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: No, I don't think so.</span> <span id="s439">It was the final -- it was when they gave up.</span> <span id="s440">There was no liberation there in France.</span> <span id="s441">I mean they were there until the very last, because they picked up this gentleman, my neighbor, a few days before, literally a few days before.</span> <span id="s442">She had a baby right then after he was gone and something really very moving.</span> <span id="s443">My mother went to the maternity with her, for the delivery, and he turned 50, this young man just recently and his mother lives in Israel and so does he and the mother called up my mother from Israel to remind her of the night when she gave birth that she had been present at that time.</span> <span id="s444">That was 40 years ago, so that '44, the end of '44 beginning of '45.</span> <span id="s445">I don't think it was liberated before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: When we went back to Belgium on that final trip back, we stopped again, me and my complete negative and angry nasty self, we stopped several times on the road to drink and at one point the only thing that was available was beer and I said I would rather die than drink beer.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Which might have been the choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: A person told me well, maybe you're just going to have to do that.</span> <span id="s451">Maybe you're just going to have to die because that's all we had.</span> <span id="s452">Telling me, a nasty kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Okay, just to backtrack a bit from where we stopped the tape, upon liberation your first memory is everyone dancing in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s455">I remember just elation.</span> <span id="s456">That's the feeling for everybody and sadness.</span> <span id="s457">My neighbor because she had no trace of her husband, and I remember that and I remember my mother leaving and going back to Belgium and telling me that she was going to find my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: You were all alone then?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: At that point I remained with the landlords.</span> <span id="s460">I was in the apartment, but in the same house.</span> <span id="s461">I had been pretty much alone for a long time, so at that point I wasn't even all that scared because it sounded good.</span> <span id="s462">So, as I said my mother came back.</span> <span id="s463">I don't know how long she was gone, whether it was a week or a month.</span> <span id="s464">I don't know.</span> <span id="s465">She said we are going back.</span> <span id="s466">She had found my dad and that was that.</span> <span id="s467">So, we went back and finding him was the real disappointment, because he had changed from the memories.</span> <span id="s468">I mean I had this illusion you know as a four year old child your father and the way he was involved with me and he was really -- he was not the same person and by then I was nine years old and I could see things very differently.</span> <span id="s469">He came back.</span> <span id="s470">I saw him, he had no hair.</span> <span id="s471">His teeth were shaking.</span> <span id="s472">He looked like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s473">He just looked frightening to me, very frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Where had he been?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: He had been in Auschwitz mostly.</span> <span id="s476">And, he was extremely -- he had become very impatient and irritable and I just wanted to cling to him and it was broken.</span> <span id="s477">It just wasn't there anymore.</span> <span id="s478">We were just coming from different places all together, and he had become even more religious and rigid about it.</span> <span id="s479">I had at that point completely rejected.</span> <span id="s480">I mean I just couldn't deal with that at all.</span> <span id="s481">I was doing whatever I wanted during the war.</span> <span id="s482">Certainly not observing the Sabbath, and all of a sudden we're back to not turning on lights, and not going to the movies on Saturday and all that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s483">I just couldn't deal with that at all.</span> <span id="s484">I mean I just couldn't deal with that.</span> <span id="s485">So, we had lots of fights, really a big arguments and right after we came back we lived in a place that belonged to one of the people that we had met in ____________, a Jewish lady whose husband did not come back and who had owned a house with her husband and so we lived in that place and I remember the three of us, my mom, my dad, and I sleeping in the bed and he was having the worse nightmares and he would scream int he middle of the night and of course I would just relive all my terrors.</span> <span id="s486">It was just not what I had hoped for or what my fantasies had about how it was going to be when my dad came back.</span> <span id="s487">The reality was very, very different.</span> <span id="s488">Not only that, we pretty much had no money so we had very cheap bed and the bed would collapse every so often so between the screaming and the collapsing bed I mean it was really terrible and we didn't have any warm water.</span> <span id="s489">We just had a pump in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s490">It really was very primitive.</span> <span id="s491">And then in my view what really made things completely disastrous was when my father found out about his surviving relatives in Russia.</span> <span id="s492">He sent for them, and where I was really craving just my mom and my dad, all of a sudden these people descended upon us.</span> <span id="s493">There were two brothers, a sister and a grandfather, and we all lived together.</span> <span id="s494">There were ten people every day, all the time without any space for anybody.</span> <span id="s495">It was literally a nightmare.</span> <span id="s496">To me, this was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s497">I resented them for a long time.</span> <span id="s498">I mean there was nothing else to do but I really couldn't say I was very thrilled with that whole set up and then to top it off, my brother was born.</span> <span id="s499">My mother couldn't handle it.</span> <span id="s500">She simply couldn't handle the food for all these people, so I essentially was trusted as the permanent babysitter for my brother.</span> <span id="s501">I was in charge of him basically.</span> <span id="s502">I had nothing to say about it.</span> <span id="s503">I had to feed him and dress him and just take care of him, except for going to school.</span> <span id="s504">Things were just not great.</span> <span id="s505">Then, at that point, all my fears came through.</span> <span id="s506">I could not stay alone.</span> <span id="s507">I tried, I remember that my parents wanted to go for a walk on a Friday night after dinner and I would say sure I'll stay, and as soon as they walked out I was just overcome by such fear that I would just scream by myself in the house and my neighbor upstairs would come and get me.</span> <span id="s508">I was trying.</span> <span id="s509">I always said, sure you can go.</span> <span id="s510">I'm fine.</span> <span id="s511">I'm great, no problem.</span> <span id="s512">As soon as maybe five minutes after they walked it would just come and engulf me and I couldn't really function very well.</span> <span id="s513">Then school was another nightmare because we were people of all ages put into the same class.</span> <span id="s514">Now, I was put in the right grade for my age, but I really knew nothing.</span> <span id="s515">I just knew how to read because I had read -- and I spoke French beautifully because finally I began to understand what I was reading and I developed a very nice vocabulary.</span> <span id="s516">So, on account of that they decided to put me in the proper grade for my age.</span> <span id="s517">I knew nothing, so I was in school feeling like I was among -- just what am I doing here.</span> <span id="s518">I don't know, but I made it.</span> <span id="s519">I don't know how I made it.</span> <span id="s520">I just picked up whatever had to picked up and there were people there who were speaking Polish and there were people speaking Yiddish and there were those who were speaking German and I was speaking French.</span> <span id="s521">The teachers were themselves, they came from concentration camps or other places.</span> <span id="s522">They didn't know anything about anything except they had sticks and when they misbehaved they hit us.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: This was the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: They just rounded up whom they could find as teachers and there were no one that you could really call a teacher.</span> <span id="s526">But I don't know, I just somehow started to click and I became their prize student, so that was another thing that I always had this thing of taking out this anger in some way, so they had these donors, these potential donors and they were trying to raise funds.</span> <span id="s527">It was a private school, so they would parade the bright kids around and they didn't have that many.</span> <span id="s528">This was like an ape in the circus, do this trick and do this trick.</span> <span id="s529">I would recite, they would ask me a question and I would always know the answers.</span> <span id="s530">Then, after that, there was nothing in terms of discipline that I would obey.</span> <span id="s531">We had these individual benches you know, and I would just run across on top of the benches and teachers would run after me with a ruler.</span> <span id="s532">I mean some of these teachers are still alive and when they see me they say all this grey hair is from you.</span> <span id="s533">I mean, I was just impossible.</span> <span id="s534">When I think about it now, really I under normal circumstances would have gone to a reform school or something.</span> <span id="s535">It sort of calmed down and at that point, somewhere around the age of nine or so or ten I said I'm going to do something with me life.</span> <span id="s536">I'm not just going to be a housewife and sit here passively and have some guy tell me what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: At age 10?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s539">I had a big argument with my mother's friends who told me I should think of getting married when I'm 18.</span> <span id="s540">I said no way, not ever, and I decided to get there I had to get to a better school, and so I was in that school for two years.</span> <span id="s541">This time in Belgium it's divided into six and six.</span> <span id="s542">Elementary and then high school is six years, and I decided to go to the public high school.</span> <span id="s543">The public high school which was at the time considered the top high school because from that one you could go straight to university without having to take special entrance examinations.</span> <span id="s544">So, after two years I applied to that high school which was unfortunately in Flemish and that was a language I didn't know at all.</span> <span id="s545">So, the only Flemish I knew was from talking to the cleaning woman who used to come once a week and that was the extent of it.</span> <span id="s546">But I made it.</span> <span id="s547">I mean I got in somehow.</span> <span id="s548">I guess I faked it.</span> <span id="s549">Whenever I think about it objectively I should have never gotten in there because my knowledge of everything was completely sporadic and having big gaps in various places.</span> <span id="s550">I never learned how to do multiplication, things like that.</span> <span id="s551">Big, big gaps, but I got into high school, because it wasn't automatic.</span> <span id="s552">You had to apply to get into that particular school.</span> <span id="s553">So, but there was anti-semitism in the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: After the war, quite a bit, and there was only two Jewish girls in that whole school, another one and myself.</span> <span id="s556">We really had a tough time.</span> <span id="s557">It took us years to be accepted and to make friends only a few friends we made on the whole the atmosphere was not welcoming at all, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Were you blamed for the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: No, but for instance my dad was religious at the time there was school on Saturdays, and he didn't allow me to go.</span> <span id="s560">It was a horror show.</span> <span id="s561">I already had missed so much school throughout my life and of course they put Latin and Greek and math and whatnot on Saturday.</span> <span id="s562">This really is not easy, and the teachers refused to help.</span> <span id="s563">I mean I would have to go every Saturday night -- I mean that's why I became even less attracted to the religion.</span> <span id="s564">I had to go and beg from some girl who really didn't want to give me her notes for all the lectures that had been given that day and then try to work it out on my own because my father didn't know anything and my mother didn't know anything about that stuff.</span> <span id="s565">The teachers just said, her statement was, "Well, you Jewish girls don't want to come to school on Saturday, you just work it out.</span> <span id="s566">It's not my problem."</span> <span id="s567">It makes you feel that after all that hearing this business about Jewish girls -- it was a secular school, it wasn't a school that was under any kind of religious aegis or directives.</span> <span id="s568">That's what the public school was.</span> <span id="s569">It was a secular school where there was religion given according to what you wanted so there was one hour you could choose either religion or ethics so you didn't have to attend -- because there was a catholic school system just as there is one here an official catholic school system.</span> <span id="s570">So, the people who were there, weren't even observant, but they still had a feeling that we were foreigners.</span> <span id="s571">Essentially the feeling was that we were foreigners.</span> <span id="s572">We were different and foreign.</span> <span id="s573">We did not feel very well there, really not, and then later they opened a Jewish high school and most Jewish kids now go to the Jewish high school, which is now fully accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s576">They go to a Jewish high school, which the Jewish high school is accepted.</span> <span id="s577">It's a completely official school and they can get from there to the university, again without entrance examinations, so and that's what I had wanted but there wasn't anything at the time.</span> <span id="s578">We were, as I said, in fifth grade, everybody was together, all ages, all languages.</span> <span id="s579">This high school developed just a few years after I started high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: What happened to your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: My grandfather I think was essentially beaten to death.</span> <span id="s582">My mother's father, the one who's picture is there.</span> <span id="s583">He refused his son, my mother's brother, left I believe it was the last boat that left Antwerp and they went to Brazil and then somehow got to the states, and he didn't want to go because you had to cut your beard to get on that boat.</span> <span id="s584">I think when we fled, he refused to come for the same reason and so apparently my mother had asked a neighbor, a non Jewish neighbor to take care of him and she said she would but she heard when she came back to Belgium that he had essentially been beaten to death on the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: What other aspects to your life during these years do you think are real important to remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: You mean during the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: In what sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: I don't know if I have all the right questions.</span> <span id="s590">I think that we covered the areas that I had some idea about, and if there's anything else that you think would be useful to record that I haven't asked you, I want you to feel free to say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: In terms of who I am today, I would have liked all this activity around survivors of the war whatever events took part in their own lives to happen earlier because even as I tell these things and some of these things bring tears to my eyes so that i know that I still feel them, but they're not -- I think I'm now perhaps able and it hasn't been that long -- able to associate my reactions to trauma and whatever from the past.</span> <span id="s592">So, it's hard for me to say now.</span> <span id="s593">The worst part of it was the fear, you know the absolute terror that I can still invoke certain times thinking back particularly --the salient points were in that home where I just didn't know where anybody was.</span> <span id="s594">And then when my dad was taken.</span> <span id="s595">These were just terrible, terrible moments.</span> <span id="s596">I know that until he died, my father -- I had many, many nightmares about anticipating his death that they were just really terrible and I was acting irrationally during many years in relation to him in terms of being so afraid that he would die that I could not even enjoy when I was near him.</span> <span id="s597">He wasn't a well man, although he pulled together and rebuilt a life for himself and helped his brothers build their own lives, so he did a tremendous job.</span> <span id="s598">I couldn't even appreciate any of this.</span> <span id="s599">I was just always afraid of losing him so that was sort of something that marred my life for a long time.</span> <span id="s600">In fact, I think I was liberated from that feeling only when he died.</span> <span id="s601">When he finally died, I sort of gained some peace which seems sort of crazy, but that's what happened.</span> <span id="s602">When he died, I said okay that's over.</span> <span id="s603">He's really gone and he's not coming back.</span> <span id="s604">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Are you at all religious today?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No, I'm not, but I observe the traditions because I think they're pretty and perhaps only recently I have trouble with dogma in general.</span> <span id="s607">I have trouble with authority, but there is sort of a deeper philosophy which guides the lives of those who are truly religious and I really don't refer to people who are shut off from the outside world like __________ or that type of think.</span> <span id="s608">I'm thinking of my brother who is really an exceptional human being in that he lives his religion.</span> <span id="s609">This is who he is in terms of his interaction with his wife and his children, his family.</span> <span id="s610">He lives in Jerusalem because that's the only place where he can be the full Jew in his view, but he's politically left wing so -- and when I see him, there's a deep meaning to the rituals that is not the superficial type of thing that many people see and rebel against which is the things that I rebel against.</span> <span id="s611">You can't go here, things that look totally idiotic to me.</span> <span id="s612">It's a lot easier to take an elevator let's say for a person my mother's age and condition than to walk upstairs.</span> <span id="s613">That kind of thing, but when you go deeper and you make it part of an entire frame work and what it means, then I'm beginning to appreciate it although I think I live my life in a certain way in that sense, in terms of how I relate to my mother and to my family and I'm really a very good friend.</span> <span id="s614">People know that I'm really a loyal friend, that you couldn't have a more loyal friend.</span> <span id="s615">But I have no inclination to do the ritual, but I do like to go to synagogue on high holidays only because I identify with the group, because I like to be identified with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s616">I'm proud of them.</span> <span id="s617">But not in terms of observing the things that I consider interfering with the conduct of modern life.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: The obvious reason I asked that was clearly during the war years you appeared to be a little bit resentful of it and sort of embraced the security of the catholic church and all these other things and I think people certain people after the Holocaust felt stronger about their Judaism, some felt irrelevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: I don't want any part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Or they had been abandoned by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: I think those that felt abandoned by it I felt abandoned by it, but as I said the story about my grandfather and the angels, I was maybe four years old when I asked him that, which I mean this is a logical question to ask.</span> <span id="s622">Where are your angels, and there's no logical answer to that.</span> <span id="s623">So, then of course there was no time to practice the religion after that whole incident because we weren't supposed to be Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s624">That's one of the things I resented when my dad came back.</span> <span id="s625">I embraced catholicism only because it represented a safe haven and not because of anything that had to do with Jesus or anything like that, didn't appeal to me very much.</span> <span id="s626">What appealed to me really was the ritual and not the content.</span> <span id="s627">What appeals to me in Judaism really is more the content and not the ritual.</span> <span id="s628">The ethics behind it and so I think I'm a very Jewish person and I don't hide that anywhere.</span> <span id="s629">Perhaps if I were in a place where nobody observed anything I would do it just to express my Judaism to the rest of the world that way, but I don't feel that I have to do that.</span> <span id="s630">But as I said, I do identify with the group, so --my mother says that after the war my little girlfriend, the one that I had spent all this time with in the home and so on and we stayed friends for a while after.</span> <span id="s631">She became religious and I wasn't, but a certain point in time we were going to synagogue for the high holidays and our mothers would try and make us pray and we would just giggle.</span> <span id="s632">I mean that's all we'd do, we'd giggle.</span> <span id="s633">We could just not do pray or do anything.</span> <span id="s634">Then when I went to study, I left home and I went to Switzerland and the very first Rosh Hoshana Eve I went to synagogue.</span> <span id="s635">I didn't even go inside.</span> <span id="s636">I stayed outside the entire time, but I was there.</span> <span id="s637">You know, I just felt that I had to express that I was part of that group but I wasn't going to pray because the prayers meant nothing to me.</span> <span id="s638">The prayers are sometimes very pretty if you look at them in terms of poetry, but I really don't believe in God.</span> <span id="s639">I really don't believe in that at all.</span> <span id="s640">So, my religion would be expressed in terms of how people should relate to one another and nothing to do with some superior being.</span> <span id="s641">I'm a scientist and I don't believe in that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Well, the only thing is that you can overcome anything.</span> <span id="s644">You at some point have to take responsibility for your own life, no matter how bad.</span> <span id="s645">If you do that, you won't be alone.</span> <span id="s646">If you persist in living in the past and saying that you can't do anything and nothing is going to work out because you went through this terrible thing, then you will remain stagnate and people will shy away from you and you'll just be a very lonely person.</span> <span id="s647">I like to be with people.</span> <span id="s648">I don't like to be alone.</span> <span id="s649">That's all I have to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">(Viewing pictures)</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: This is my mom and dad's wedding picture and I think that occurred in 1934 something like that, in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s654">These are my fraternal grandparents, grandfather, grandmother, uncles, aunts.</span> <span id="s655">That was taken in Poland.</span> <span id="s656">It must have been around '34 or '35 because my father is no longer on that picture.</span> <span id="s657">He had moved to Belgium by then.</span> <span id="s658">This is my maternal grandfather, my mom and dad, my mom's brother and his wife.</span> <span id="s659">The baby on the old man's lap is myself and the three children that are standing are my cousins.</span> <span id="s660">They are my mother's brother's children.</span> <span id="s661">I assume, I was born in '36, it had to be, I was close to six months to a year.</span> <span id="s662">That's the town in France where we stayed when we didn't make it to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s663">That was the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Weren't there a couple pictures on here?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: This is _____________ which is on the Belgium coast and it must have been very shortly before.</span> <span id="s666">The one on the right is in _____________ which is a town where my mother and I spent the last year of the war approximately.</span> <span id="s667">This picture is the center is my grandfather and it's essentially many of the same people that appeared in that previous picture.</span>
