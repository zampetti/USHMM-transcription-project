how, when they disappeared.</span> <span id="s447">Maybe a few people left.</span> <span id="s448">I don't know.</span> <span id="s449">And then came the--I don't know--not the Haganah, maybe another organization, you know, from Israel.</span> <span id="s450">And they taught us how to shoot, how to go and--to jump from a window out, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So this is when you were already back in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Hamburg, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: So let's back up just a minute.</span> <span id="s454">How did it feel when you--you get

away, you know, we (?</span> <span id="s469">should?)</span> <span id="s470">go someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And did they tell you, when you were coming off the boat, where they were taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: They said, "We going to take you back from where you came."</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: And where did you end up going to?</span></p> <p><span

you--when you get off the boat in Hamburg, where do you go in Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s486">We stayed in Hamburg.</span> <span id="s487">We didn't go no place.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: So were you in a displaced persons camp?</span> <span id="s489">Where were you being held?</span> <span id="s490">Were you allowed--could you leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: I don't remember if we stayed in the city or we--we--or they took us--I don't remember.</span> <span id="s492">I think we stayed in the city some or--I don't

States?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s668">We had a friend.</span> <span id="s669">He came before us, and he said, "You come to America.</span> <span id="s670">Your husband is going to make a lot of money" and you this-and-that.</span> <span id="s671">And we came, and I'm sorry to the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: You wish you would have stayed in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did you--after the journey on the Exodus, were you--did you stay in touch with people that you had gone through that experience with?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: That we went together to--on the Exodus?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Well, if they were on the Exodus with you, this was the same group of people when you went back to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s678">You know what?</span> <span id="s679">When we came back to Hamburg, we--everybody--every girl has to wash clothes for three guys, you know, because the men didn't know how to wash clothes.</span> <span id="s680">So everybody had to--every girl had three boys to wash for them clothes.</span> <span id="s681">And we did that, you know.</span> <span id="s682">We were very close, one with each other, but not, you know--we were always together.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: And did you stay in touch with them when you lived in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s685">Yes.</span> <span id="s686">They--even one of them, too, wanted to marry me.</span> <span

id="s690">We didn't have our home.</span> <span id="s691">We didn't have nothing.</span> <span id="s692">So that's why everybody lived for himself, to see from what we can live.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: And looking at the Exodus experience, sort of as a whole, how did you feel when you were experiencing that as a concentration camp survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s695">Very bad.</span> <span id="s696">We thought that's it.</span> <span id="s697">We finished in concentration camp because I saw when they burned my--my parents, my brother.</span> <span id="s698">And the other brother two weeks before the war was over, they killed him.</span> <span id="s699">They shoot him.</span> <span id="s700">So I know that's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: But--my question is when--because of what you had experienced in the camps, when you were on the Exodus, did you--how did--I mean how did you feel having this experience, as a Holocaust survivor, after what you had already survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: ___+.</span> <span id="s703">But we were happy that we going to a land that was going to be ours.</span> <span id="s704">We were going to fight for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Did you think of the British in the same way as you thought of your European captors, or what were your feelings on--on the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, we--we didn't got to know them.</span> <span id="s707">We--we didn't see nothing.</span> <span id="s708">We didn't know about the British.</span> <span id="s709">We didn't know--we didn't know, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s711">Are there--are there any other details from that experience and being on the boat that you can think of that we haven't covered?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No, I don't know.</span> <span id="s713">I really don't know no more.</span> <span id="s714">I don't--I don't.</span> <span id="s715">It was--it was terrible, a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s716">And even when--when we were in Israel already was very hard and--because we didn't have no homes, no nothing.</span> <span id="s717">We had to go--not only me, even people married.</span> <span id="s718">They didn't have--you know, they lived in other ____ houses that they found, you know, they find something empty.</span> <span id="s719">It was very hard.</span> <span id="s720">Very, very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: When you went on the kibbutz in Israel--</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A:

id="s736">I don't--I lost the--the--lost touch with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: But she was with you on the Exodus and at the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: She wasn't in touch with me anymore, but we found each other in Brooklyn.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: What was her name,

was with children.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: And did you talk about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s761">We always used to talk about it.</span> <span id="s762">Some people didn't believe that the English did that to us.</span> <span id="s763">Even now they don't believe there was an Exodus.</span> <span id="s764">A lot of people.</span> <span id="s765">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: So you--you--you--actually--you talked about your specific experience on the Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span

you feel about that, as a survivor who had already survived so much, then participating in fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: They said they have to fight.</span> <span id="s778">They have to fight because we suffered so much and they killed our--our parents, our families.</span> <span id="s779">So we had to fight.</span> <span id="s780">And the Haganah told us, it's going to be ours, you know.</span> <span id="s781">So we going to have a home here and we going to live here and that's what we felt.</span> <span id="s782">And everybody who didn't go, we worked hard, you know.</span> <span id="s783">Because--the men mostly.</span> <span id="s784">In every kibbutz and in every moshav, they went to war.</span> <span id="s785">So whoever could went to help them, you know.</span> <span id="s786">I didn't go because for one purpose because they told me I was going to have a baby, you know.</span> <span id="s787">So I said ____+ what am I going to do.</span> <span id="s788">So I

help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s820">I think that covers--I'm trying to think if there's anything else that we didn't cover because you've already done another oral history where I think we have all the information.</span> <span id="s821">We just didn't get everything about your experience on the Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Yes.</span> <span
