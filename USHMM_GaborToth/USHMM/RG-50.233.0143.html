now from marriage, Eva Young.</span> <span id="s37">I was born in Poland, Lipsko---(3), K---.</span> <span id="s38">I was born on October 27, 1926.</span> <span id="s39">I had a sister, whose name was Tina Miodelska, and two brothers, Moshe, Vanhil.</span> <span id="s40">My father's name was Israel Miodelska and my mother's name was Zelda Miodelska.</span> <span id="s41">My father was a businessman and my mother was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">What kind of business was he involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Well, we had leather goods and some kind of a factory.</span> <span id="s44">We bought wood in the forest and we made like thin, like sheets, thin sheets--- Like kindling or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Thin sheets from wood.</span> <span id="s46">They were used for shoes.</span> <span id="s47">In 1942, there was a ghetto in Lipsko.</span> <span id="s48">It was a small town.</span> <span id="s49">I was taken to a concentration camp in 1942.</span> <span id="s50">I was taken by force, of course.</span> <span id="s51">They came in with big cars and they threw us in like cattle.</span> <span id="s52">They took us to the concentration camp at Skarzysko-Kamienna which is near Radom.</span> <span id="s53">It was an ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s54">They were bringing people from Warsaw and places nearby.</span> <span id="s55">We worked there in very, very terrible conditions.</span> <span id="s56">There were about 1500, or between 1200 and 1500 people in one room which was called “augrin” (21).</span> <span id="s57">There was a lot of typhus, a lot of terrible things going on and every time they came and they put us in the line in the roll count, they took out people to kill.</span> <span id="s58">Nobody knew if he would survive the following day.</span> <span id="s59">But they picked us out.</span> <span id="s60">Certain people went to work for all kind of factories, all kind of parts in the factory’s sections.</span> <span id="s61">I was working, but I ran away from there.</span> <span id="s62">That time I went back to my little town, my hometown, because my father had told me that we had a neighbor, a Polish family, who would help me.</span> <span id="s63">They probably would be gone; they were talking that they would be evacuated and taken to concentration camps or killed.</span> <span id="s64">I should be aware of the fact that they left money, gold, quilts, linen, for me.</span> <span id="s65">In case I survive, I should have where to go and the neighbor would take care of me because it was a close friend of his.</span> <span id="s66">So it was constantly on my mind that I had where to go, in case my parents would be--with the brother and sister--would be evacuated.</span> <span id="s67">So one day, I ran away from there and I went back to my hometown after the evacuation of my parents.</span> <span id="s68">I didn't hear from them.</span> <span id="s69">But when I was in Skarzysko, we saw people in the railroads, on the trains, taking them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s70">From this part of Poland, they took them to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s71">We saw them when we were crying, they were crying and we were--we knew that they were going somehow to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s72">But after we saw the transport, that was in September, close to September, I didn't hear from my parents any more.</span> <span id="s73">I knew that they probably went to Treblinka with the transports we saw them bringing--passing by with the trains.</span> <span id="s74">I ran away from the concentration camp, from Skarzysko and I went back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">How did you arrange that?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">I just walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Just walked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">I was a child; I walked out.</span> <span id="s79">It was toward the evening and I walked.</span> <span id="s80">I had some money with me because--.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Was it a camp that was heavily guarded?</span> <span id="s82">Or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">It was guarded but not as heavily, not as heavily guarded.</span> <span id="s84">I had some money because my brother, my younger brother--he was at that time, ten years old.</span> <span id="s85">His name was Moshe.</span> <span id="s86">When the war broke out, there were bombs.</span> <span id="s87">In the city, they threw bombs, the Germans.</span> <span id="s88">They ruined, there were a lot of broken houses.</span> <span id="s89">So it was a fire; the whole city was like in fire.</span> <span id="s90">He was, after that, the following day was quiet, or a few days later, I don't recall exactly the dates but it was approximately that time.</span> <span id="s91">He cleaned up the bricks and put them together and put them like--stored them.</span> <span id="s92">Later on, the people--he was sitting and doing that instead of playing and running around, he was doing this kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s93">When it quieted down, people started to build their houses from the ruins, so he sold them the bricks.</span> <span id="s94">He was in business being ten years old.</span> <span id="s95">He was a very smart boy.</span> <span id="s96">When they took me to the concentration camp, he was running after me.</span> <span id="s97">He said, “Here is my money from the bricks I sold.</span> <span id="s98">Maybe this money would help you to survive.”</span> <span id="s99">I didn't want to take it but he insisted that I should take it and he threw it in the car where I was.</span> <span id="s100">He was a child; they did not take him but they beat him up and he went home.</span> <span id="s101">So I had some money from him and I decided to go home to look for the Polish guy which my father wrote and told me would guard me and be like my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">This was after you left the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">I had it constantly in my mind.</span> <span id="s104">So I left the concentration camp, escaped, with the money to my little town.</span> <span id="s105">When I got there, my parents were not there, but I went to this Polish family which was right next to us.</span> <span id="s106">He kissed me and he hugged me and they said, “Oh my child, I will take care.</span> <span id="s107">There's no problem, I promised your father I will take care of you.”</span> <span id="s108">I was very happy--they gave me food to eat, they put me to sleep.</span> <span id="s109">I did not tell them where I came from but I just--here I am.</span> <span id="s110">The following day, he said in the evening he's going to take me someplace, so I was very happy.</span> <span id="s111">I didn't care where he was going to take me as long as I knew somebody was going to take care of me.</span> <span id="s112">In the evening, he put me in a buggy, a horse and buggy and he took me to a forest.</span> <span id="s113">He went in a little bit, maybe 10, 15 minutes deep to the forest.</span> <span id="s114">He left me there.</span> <span id="s115">He said, “My child, you sit here.</span> <span id="s116">I have to go someplace.</span> <span id="s117">I will be back in about half hour or so.”</span> <span id="s118">He never came back.</span> <span id="s119">I was traveling; I was walking through the forest at night until the morning.</span> <span id="s120">It was like six, seven o'clock in the morning, I found myself on a road.</span> <span id="s121">The German buses were passing by, loaded with German soldiers.</span> <span id="s122">[Male voice: in trucks].</span> <span id="s123">In trucks, big trucks, open trucks, like for the military.</span> <span id="s124">One, they stopped, one car stopped and they went on and they said to me, “What are you doing here; are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s125">I said, “No, I'm not Jewish.”</span> <span id="s126">I was speaking fluent Polish so there was no sign that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s127">But one said, “I think she's Jewish,” and they started beating me up.</span> <span id="s128">One German said, “Well, don't beat her up.</span> <span id="s129">Take her with us and we’ll bring her over to the people from the Warsaw ghetto resistance.”</span> <span id="s130">That time I went with them.</span> <span id="s131">They started to joke around but I made believe that I didn't understand what they were saying.</span> <span id="s132">When we got there, to a concentration place, where they concentrate all these people from Warsaw ghetto, that was in April, probably in the beginning, must be the tenth of April or the--must be before, about the 8th or the 9th- Sometime in April then?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">That's right because the 15th of April, I found myself in Majdanek with the transport.</span> <span id="s134">There where I was in Majdanek for ten weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Do you remember, just to go back just a little bit--.</span> <span id="s136">When you left the concentration camp and you went to this person's house, you left for the forest.</span> <span id="s137">Do you remember about what time that was?</span> <span id="s138">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Well, I do remember because in the concentration camp, I mean in Majdanek, I went in '43 in April.</span> <span id="s140">That was probably--[September '42]--by the end of '42.</span> <span id="s141">(unclear whether April 1943 or September 1942.)</span> <span id="s142">The end of '42, you were in that --- (93)?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">They were taking, in September, they were taking the parents.</span> <span id="s144">That was before Rosh Hashonah, before the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s145">That time--I'm still lighting a candle in the memory of my parents before Rosh Hashonah because that was the time when I saw them taking them on the railroad with the trains.</span> <span id="s146">The railroad was right next to the camp at Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s147">We could see the faces; it wasn't that far.</span> <span id="s148">We had a gate, we couldn't go over the other side; it was on the other side of the gate.</span> <span id="s149">But right behind the gate, there was the train, the railroad.</span> <span id="s150">That time I was in Majdanek for ten weeks.</span> <span id="s151">They started to select us every day.</span> <span id="s152">There was, of course, waiting for the dead because they were putting us on a count-row (102).</span> <span id="s153">Every day they were counting us; this day we're out every fifth one; the following day, people were afraid to stay in the fifth place because maybe they would take you.</span> <span id="s154">But we knew that the one who was going to be the fifth would be dead.</span> <span id="s155">Then they picked the seventh or the eighth.</span> <span id="s156">One never knew when would be his time to get killed.</span> <span id="s157">We were at that time, about 15,000 people, survived by 150.</span> <span id="s158">From my particular camp, place, there were more people.</span> <span id="s159">But our people, they started selecting us and taking us to all kinds of camps, all kinds of different concentration camps.</span> <span id="s160">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s161">They sent me to Skarzysko; they sent me back to Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s162">That time I fell into a very difficult job.</span> <span id="s163">I had a very difficult job.</span> <span id="s164">I was working at ovens where they used to lacquer the capsules from the bullets.</span> <span id="s165">The reason they lacquered them was because they used to make the capsules from aluminum, from copper.</span> <span id="s166">But they ran out of copper--they couldn't get any more copper so they started doing it with aluminum.</span> <span id="s167">In order not to get rusted or wet from the rain or from the snow, they had to lacquer them to prevent them from getting rusted.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">From corroding, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">That's right.</span> <span id="s170">I was working by the ovens--it was a very tough job and a very difficult job because it was constantly staying eight hours in one spot, taking off the capsules.</span> <span id="s171">We had to pick them up like in a comb, a big, long comb.</span> <span id="s172">They were falling down.</span> <span id="s173">They were made like a board which they folded down.</span> <span id="s174">Every capsule folded down this way and we had to pick them up.</span> <span id="s175">They had to be full.</span> <span id="s176">In order not to do any sabotage, not to erase the little teeth, they had to be all picked up at the same time.</span> <span id="s177">That was about--over 200 degrees.</span> <span id="s178">We had to stay there and face the heat.</span> <span id="s179">In the beginning, in the morning they used to give us gloves in order, not to protect our hands, but to protect the waffen (128), to protect the capsules.</span> <span id="s180">But they got burned in no time so we still had to work without anything, with hot hands.</span> <span id="s181">Even today, I can take fire in my hand and it wouldn't burn me because I'm so used to the hot things.</span> <span id="s182">It was a very terrible thing to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Can I ask you a question?</span> <span id="s184">Can we go back just a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">When you were on the train to Majdanek, did you go by train to Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">No, they throw us in --.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">They threw you in the trucks; that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">In the trucks, they threw us in the trucks.</span> <span id="s190">They took out horses or cattle and they threw us in there.</span> <span id="s191">And straw, there was straw on the floor.</span> <span id="s192">We were sitting on the straw, one on the other, on top of the other because there were hundreds of people in a wagon, in one wagon like that.</span> <span id="s193">[Male voice: No, it was a railroad car.]</span> <span id="s194">Railroad?</span> <span id="s195">[No, it was not a truck, it was a railroad car].</span> <span id="s196">The railroad cars.</span> <span id="s197">They took us in the railroad cars.</span> <span id="s198">It's like a train, right.</span> <span id="s199">They took the horses out and the cattle--like a freight truck.</span> <span id="s200">Like the freight, that's right, the freight trucks.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Can you tell me your first impressions of seeing Majdanek when you got off the train, what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">We were so confused that we were happy to get out from there.</span> <span id="s203">Being there for a few hours or a day, we were cramped up, one against the other.</span> <span id="s204">When we got out, that was April, we smelled the fresh air.</span> <span id="s205">We didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s206">We only thought that they're going to take us to better places if they let us out.</span> <span id="s207">But they started selecting.</span> <span id="s208">Put us all in one barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">That selection happened right after you got off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Well, the following day.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">The following day?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">The following day, yeah.</span> <span id="s213">They gave each of us a piece of bread and the following day, they told us to stay on the roll call and they started selecting people right away to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s214">They gave us work to do.</span> <span id="s215">The ones who were not selected, they had to clean up, to carry stones from one place to another.</span> <span id="s216">Stones from this place to another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">To keep them busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">To keep us busy, right, right.</span> <span id="s219">And to clean, to work and maneuver to work in anything.</span> <span id="s220">They didn't know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s221">They were beating us.</span> <span id="s222">The people--we were very happy that we could do something--not to stay and wait for the dead.</span> <span id="s223">A few days later, it didn't take too long to find out that we were there to face the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s224">Like every day, every hour, whoever was close to each other, we made friends with strangers.</span> <span id="s225">We didn't know each other but we became, in no time, we became like one family.</span> <span id="s226">We were kissing each other; we'll be alive tomorrow, maybe we'll see you tomorrow maybe not.</span> <span id="s227">If not, go and pray for us, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Can you describe to me a little bit about Majdanek?</span> <span id="s229">About how it was guarded?</span> <span id="s230">Was it a large camp, how it was situated?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">It was a large camp because there were hundreds, thousands of people there.</span> <span id="s232">Yes.</span> <span id="s233">It was very heavily guarded, very heavily guarded.</span> <span id="s234">There were two barracks, two small barracks; with the barracks was the crematorium.</span> <span id="s235">First they said to the people that you going in to take a shower.</span> <span id="s236">They didn't tell them they're going to gas them.</span> <span id="s237">You had to leave the clothes here.</span> <span id="s238">I wasn't inside because if I would be inside, I wouldn't come out.</span> <span id="s239">So I don't know how it was inside.</span> <span id="s240">The people who were inside never came out.</span> <span id="s241">We just assumed that that was going on.</span> <span id="s242">We had witnesses.</span> <span id="s243">I had witnesses in different camps when we went in.</span> <span id="s244">In Leipzig, for example, they said we should go in, take a shower and leave everything here.</span> <span id="s245">When we finished taking the shower, they told us to go out one other door.</span> <span id="s246">When we got out from the other door, we had to pick the striped clothing with a number on us to go in and register and get a number on the sleeve.</span> <span id="s247">My number was 804 in Leipzig, which I called out.</span> <span id="s248">We never went back and we never had anything.</span> <span id="s249">That's all we had because several people had hidden gold, money whatever they brought from home.</span> <span id="s250">But we couldn't get back, we came out from a different door and we got different clothes.</span> <span id="s251">We never saw the same door.</span> <span id="s252">That was -- in Majdanek, was heavily guarded, very heavily guarded.</span> <span id="s253">When they took us, they said that they would bring us--transfer us to a different camp, they could only--.</span> <span id="s254">Everybody was very happy because it could only be better.</span> <span id="s255">It couldn't be any worse.</span> <span id="s256">Here we were sitting and waiting to die and over there, either they will take you there and die right away or we'll survive.</span> <span id="s257">There was only one question.</span> <span id="s258">Either they will kill us the same day, there will be no pain any more so we were happy, we were very happy that they took us out from there.</span> <span id="s259">Where we went, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s260">But later on, we find ourselves in Skarzysko, where we saw a lot of people.</span> <span id="s261">It was a big camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">They took you there by train?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Yes, that's right, by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Were you working there?</span> <span id="s265">Is that why they took you, for labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">That's right, the labor, sure.</span> <span id="s267">It was a very, very tough job.</span> <span id="s268">My boss was a Volks German.</span> <span id="s269">His name was Maiefski (190).</span></p> <p><span id="s270">He was Polish though?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Polish, a German; he used to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s272">He beat us up to death.</span> <span id="s273">He was beating us, blood was pouring from us every day.</span> <span id="s274">No reason, just no reason.</span> <span id="s275">He came in and he knew that he had to do his job.</span> <span id="s276">We had a very hard job.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">This is the place where you working at the lacquer, the ovens?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">That's right, in Skarzysko where I was working.</span> <span id="s279">They call the place Lacquerna (195).</span> <span id="s280">I was on Work R, Work A. Because there were three works, three camps, three camps.</span> <span id="s281">In Skarzysko, there were three camps.</span> <span id="s282">One was A, the second B, and C. C was the worst.</span> <span id="s283">C, people were working in a nicotine or quas (200) like acid, where people got yellow and green.</span> <span id="s284">There was no way of surviving.</span> <span id="s285">It happened that this winter I was in a--get-together from Skarzysko and I found over there two men, who said they were in Work C. I looked at them and I started crying.</span> <span id="s286">I said, “I don't believe you.”</span> <span id="s287">He said, “Yeah, I was there.”</span> <span id="s288">I said, “How did you survive?</span> <span id="s289">How did you get out alive?”</span> <span id="s290">He said, “Well nobody believes it but we are alive.”</span> <span id="s291">I went over to the wives and I said to them, “You don't even know what your husband's been through because I was in the concentration camp and I saw them passing every day to work.”</span> <span id="s292">I was crying constantly, that time I was crying.</span> <span id="s293">When we got together, looking just at the two men.</span> <span id="s294">Everyone has a different—we were hard at work.</span> <span id="s295">I had a diamond in my tooth.</span> <span id="s296">I took out the diamond and I sold it to a lady who was, her name was Plachowska.</span> <span id="s297">She used to work with me in the lacquer room.</span> <span id="s298">She was sitting there, and she got paid.</span> <span id="s299">She was an outsider because there were Polish people-- This was at Skarzysko?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">At Skarzysko-Kamienna.</span> <span id="s301">She was from Skarzysko.</span> <span id="s302">She was working for a Jewish family and she had a sentiment--they left her everything.</span> <span id="s303">But she came into work, she got paid.</span> <span id="s304">This lady, I told her, she was the only person I could have talked to and trusted to get me some money for the diamond, was her.</span> <span id="s305">I had no way, access to anybody.</span> <span id="s306">I was talking to her and I said I have a diamond in my tooth and I know I'm going to die here because I was beaten constantly.</span> <span id="s307">Throwing the empty shells on my face, because I fell asleep because the hot, the heat from the oven staying for twelve hours working.</span> <span id="s308">I fell asleep while I was standing.</span> <span id="s309">They couldn't work because if I didn't pick up the shells, they couldn't put it in to come down.</span> <span id="s310">So the machine got broken.</span> <span id="s311">They got punished so they threw this, the empty shells in my head; they were sharp to wake me up.</span> <span id="s312">I was bleeding constantly, every day like that.</span> <span id="s313">I had a lady there.</span> <span id="s314">She said, “You know what?</span> <span id="s315">I will work here for you on two machines.”</span> <span id="s316">Later on she married my uncle because she said she liked me so much, she wanted to be in the family.</span> <span id="s317">She wanted to adopt me as her child.</span> <span id="s318">She died of cancer.</span> <span id="s319">She helped me a lot, at least five minutes, ten minutes, to relieve me to go and wash my face from the blood.</span> <span id="s320">That was going on for a long time until one day I decided there's no use to keep a diamond in the tooth.</span> <span id="s321">I will have to sell it.</span> <span id="s322">Who's going to sell it for me?</span> <span id="s323">What am I going to do with the money?</span> <span id="s324">Where am I going to go?</span> <span id="s325">I found out, nobody told me but I just was thinking that the best place for me would be the kitchen.</span> <span id="s326">In the kitchen I would have food, I would work twice a day, two shifts, for the day shifts to cook and then for the evening shift to cook.</span> <span id="s327">But at least it would keep me alive.</span> <span id="s328">I don't know if they wouldn't kill me but I would have something to eat.</span> <span id="s329">The lady, I told her, there was a doctor from Pieotrokow a dentist.</span> <span id="s330">He took, pulled my tooth out.</span> <span id="s331">Of course, it was out without anesthesia, without anything.</span> <span id="s332">He took out the diamond and I sold it.</span> <span id="s333">I got 1500 zlotys the lady gave me for the tooth.</span> <span id="s334">There were two sisters.</span> <span id="s335">I was washing clothing for them.</span> <span id="s336">They were working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s337">They were dressmakers and they were doing the dress-- They weren't part of the camp, were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">They were a part of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">They were a part of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">But they worked in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s341">They knew from hometown, they came from Wierzbinek, a little small town.</span> <span id="s342">These two sisters were sewing, clothing for the wife of their German boss.</span> <span id="s343">He was an SA, he wasn't an SS; he was SA.</span> <span id="s344">They told her that they have a cousin and they would like very much that I should work with them.</span> <span id="s345">But they got the money; the girls got the money from me.</span> <span id="s346">She said okay, I like you very much because you're two nice girls so you bring your cousin in.</span> <span id="s347">I went in.</span> <span id="s348">They told me that something is going to be worked out.</span> <span id="s349">When I sold the diamond, I got the money, I gave the girls the money and they said that I can come in to work in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s350">But the boss from the kitchen said that I have to have a permit to come; that he's releasing me from the lacquer room.</span> <span id="s351">The other guy said why, Eva?</span> <span id="s352">She must pay you off.</span> <span id="s353">That's what he was thinking.</span> <span id="s354">He was very much afraid.</span> <span id="s355">He didn't want to ask for me, he didn't want; he wouldn't want to let me go.</span> <span id="s356">I said either way, one or the other, I will die.</span> <span id="s357">I picked myself up and I came into work one day to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s358">I left the lacquer room and the boss was searching, looking for me.</span> <span id="s359">The first day, he didn't know what happened to me.</span> <span id="s360">He thought I got killed.</span> <span id="s361">They put somebody else in my place.</span> <span id="s362">The following day, he found out that I was there because he requested to check.</span> <span id="s363">He knew which barrack I was in.</span> <span id="s364">They said I was there.</span> <span id="s365">He came in and I start crying and I told him, “That's all I have is these two cousins and I want to be with them.</span> <span id="s366">I know I'm going to die sooner or later.”</span> <span id="s367">The boss said, “Don't worry; she's not going to survive.</span> <span id="s368">You don't have to worry; they will die, sooner or later.”</span> <span id="s369">I went in and I started working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s370">That was very good.</span> <span id="s371">At least I had food.</span> <span id="s372">I worked twice a day.</span> <span id="s373">In the morning we had to cook, like I said before, for the daily shift and in the evening, for the night shift but I was very happy.</span> <span id="s374">I was there, working very hard.</span> <span id="s375">I helped a lot of people with food, with this, with that.</span> <span id="s376">But in 1944, they transferred us to Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">So you were in Skarzysko--?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">From Skarzysko-Kamienna to Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">So you were there for almost--well into the--you said you went to-?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Yeah, I was in--.</span> <span id="s381">They brought us, I don't know what time--.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">You said you went to Majdanek in April, April 15.</span> <span id="s383">Then you--?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Of 1943.</span> <span id="s385">In 1944, they transferred us to Germany, to Leipzig.</span> <span id="s386">Krups factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">I know the name, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">So I worked in Krups factory.</span> <span id="s389">A few friends of mine survived.</span> <span id="s390">Then from Krups factory, that was in April again.</span> <span id="s391">Beginning of April, they took---.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">What did you do in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Working by ammunition.</span> <span id="s394">Controlling anti-aircraft, for anti-aircraft.</span> <span id="s395">In 1943, 1944, I was working there in very difficult conditions, because we had to get up at four o'clock in the morning, sometimes barefoot, to walk to work for two hours and two hours back.</span> <span id="s396">It was winter, snow, rain, shine, we walked.</span> <span id="s397">During the night, they bombed Leipzig.</span> <span id="s398">England and the Americans, they bombed.</span> <span id="s399">We were constantly running back and forth the whole night and four o'clock in the morning we had to go to work.</span> <span id="s400">At work, we had to constantly be aware, in the wake of everything.</span> <span id="s401">We didn't have food; they gave us very little when we got back from work in the barracks.</span> <span id="s402">There was no time of resting whatever.</span> <span id="s403">Like a constant machine, working back and forth.</span> <span id="s404">Then on the 15th April, yeah, April 15, everything happened on April the 15th, it looks like.</span> <span id="s405">They put us together and they said we had to run.</span> <span id="s406">In Poland, in Ch---(302), there were, the people from Skarzysko, they emptied out the camps, Skarzysko, they closed up the camp.</span> <span id="s407">I was the last one.</span> <span id="s408">They sent me to Leipzig because we were cooking for the people who were working with the transport, transferring the machinery to Germany.</span> <span id="s409">We were the last ones, but the whole camp, everyone went to Czestochowa (?)</span> <span id="s410">(307).</span> <span id="s411">They were liberated in January in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">In 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Or 1945.</span> <span id="s414">We, in Leipzig, they put us on the death march.</span> <span id="s415">In April 1945, 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">That was April 15th of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">It was the 14th because ten days was the death march and I was liberated in 1924, I mean in April of 1945, April 24, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Oh, so you were evacuated from--you were sent on a death march in April of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">April 1945 I was on the death march.</span> <span id="s420">They took us about April 14 because ten days was the death march on the Elba.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Just from one place to another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">People were dying-- You were always marching or were you--?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Always marching, without food, without anything.</span> <span id="s425">We had--I don't know where they got food but somehow ten days without food, you can’t survive walking.</span> <span id="s426">But people were dying and they were throwing them in the valleys.</span> <span id="s427">There were valleys where we were going by the forest.</span> <span id="s428">They were pushing in the valleys like throwing them down.</span> <span id="s429">I was--my feet were swollen and I was young.</span> <span id="s430">I could walk.</span> <span id="s431">But my feet were swollen and blood was from rubbing one foot against the other.</span> <span id="s432">There was bleeding and I couldn't even walk.</span> <span id="s433">I decided, we were resting in a forest--.</span> <span id="s434">The Germans, there were very, very many German people, they ran away too.</span> <span id="s435">So we were very much under strict control.</span> <span id="s436">They were watching us, very much so.</span> <span id="s437">The German women took off, when they saw probably the news and they heard what was going on, they took off their dresses and they put on them, like make-believe, they are the ones that come from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s438">They threw away their clothing in the forest.</span> <span id="s439">I said to a friend of mine who was standing right next to me, I said, “I'm not going any further.</span> <span id="s440">I'm staying in the forest resting.</span> <span id="s441">When everybody will leave, I will stay there.</span> <span id="s442">Either they will kill me because either way, I'm not surviving.</span> <span id="s443">It doesn't make any difference to me.”</span> <span id="s444">She said, “I'm staying with you.”</span> <span id="s445">We were staying for a few hours by ourselves until everybody left for the march again by the Elba (340).</span> <span id="s446">There was a death march going, back and forth, all around.</span> <span id="s447">They didn't have any specific place where to take us.</span> <span id="s448">Just walk without any reason, without any place to go.</span> <span id="s449">That time, when we were left in the forest and everybody left, I said, “Now we are free.</span> <span id="s450">Not exactly free but at least not on the march.”</span> <span id="s451">There was a little river.</span> <span id="s452">I couldn't swim.</span> <span id="s453">My friend could swim so she jumped in the river, pulled me by my hair and she pulled me over to the other side.</span> <span id="s454">In the water, she said, “You hold on to me.”</span> <span id="s455">That was Clara (K349).</span> <span id="s456">I got out on the other side.</span> <span id="s457">My dress was full with water and it was a heavy dress so I had to wrinkle it out from the water and it was April, it was very cold.</span> <span id="s458">We were shivering, we had nothing underneath, just the dress.</span> <span id="s459">But we survived; it looks like we survived.</span> <span id="s460">I am here.</span> <span id="s461">We went there; we were walking and we got into a little village.</span> <span id="s462">We came upon a German family.</span> <span id="s463">We asked for pity, maybe they could help us.</span> <span id="s464">We escaped.</span> <span id="s465">We didn't say we are Jewish, that we just escaped from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s466">Because we had the dresses on, we couldn’t say that we didn’t come from the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">You speak German or--?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">We speak German good, yes.</span> <span id="s469">Not as fluently as Polish but we spoke.</span> <span id="s470">We said that we know Jewish, but we are Polish.</span> <span id="s471">By the way, we made the sign of the cross, we crossed ourselves.</span> <span id="s472">We made the prayers and said God sent us to you and you should save us.</span> <span id="s473">In German, he said, “Well children, it's okay.</span> <span id="s474">Don't be afraid.</span> <span id="s475">I have some more people upstairs in my attic.</span> <span id="s476">Go upstairs and you will find some more people like you.”</span> <span id="s477">We came up and we found over there three Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s478">They were Ruth Charlon (368) and her two sisters, who later went to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">He was hiding all of them, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">He was hiding them.</span> <span id="s481">No, he wasn't hiding them all the time.</span> <span id="s482">They had run away too, because they were in the concentration camp too.</span> <span id="s483">Somehow, we were five already.</span> <span id="s484">He said that we will go to work--.</span> <span id="s485">But they had run away a few days earlier because they'd been going to work, to the field, to work with the Germans.</span> <span id="s486">He gave them sandwiches and they were happy.</span> <span id="s487">In the evening, he gave them food.</span> <span id="s488">We got in the same category like the three other girls.</span> <span id="s489">In the morning, he gave us a sandwich and he sent us; we went with them to work on the field.</span> <span id="s490">They must have given us different clothing because we couldn't go with the same clothing with the stripes.</span> <span id="s491">I don't remember what happened but I must have gotten clothing from them.</span> <span id="s492">She must have given me a dress or whatever and my friend, too.</span> <span id="s493">Anyhow, now we were free, not exactly free but we were free.</span> <span id="s494">We had no striped clothing on and we were working in the field.</span> <span id="s495">But when we heard an airplane, we ran away.</span> <span id="s496">We were so scared because in Leipzig, all the time, the planes, they were bombing.</span> <span id="s497">There was no day, they shouldn't bomb and we shouldn't--.</span> <span id="s498">In the evening, most of it was in the evening time when we were scared.</span> <span id="s499">In the factories, we didn't hear so much because they were running with us together.</span> <span id="s500">That time, we worked a few days in the field.</span> <span id="s501">One day, as we were going home from work towards the evening, Russian soldiers came across us.</span> <span id="s502">A friend of ours, one of the girls, was running away.</span> <span id="s503">She knew Russian because she was from Kovel’ (Ukraine) (394), and she spoke Russian very well.</span> <span id="s504">She started talking to the Russians.</span> <span id="s505">They thought that she was a spy, a Russian spy in Germany so they wanted to kill her.</span> <span id="s506">I started screaming, “We are Jewish.</span> <span id="s507">We just took off the striped dresses.”</span> <span id="s508">She happened to know a little bit of Russian, but we were in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s509">They believed me more than her.</span> <span id="s510">They felt sorry and asked if there were more Jewish people.</span> <span id="s511">I said, “Yes, there are three more.”</span> <span id="s512">They came with us.</span> <span id="s513">They wanted to rape us but we started screaming.</span> <span id="s514">There was one Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s515">I said ‘Sh'ma Israel’ (402) or whatever.</span> <span id="s516">He was one Jewish man, soldier and he said, “Leave them alone.</span> <span id="s517">Leave them alone and let's go someplace else.”</span> <span id="s518">They left us.</span> <span id="s519">The following day or two, we were afraid to go in the field any more.</span> <span id="s520">He didn't let us because when we got back there were white flags on his house hanging outside.</span> <span id="s521">So we said, “We are safe.</span> <span id="s522">Now we are saved.”</span> <span id="s523">He said that the guy, the German guy told us that he heard, maybe he had a radio or whatever, that in Leipzig, they are concentrating the survivors.</span> <span id="s524">They would send them to different parts of the world, whoever wants to go, wherever they want to go.</span> <span id="s525">We went there, we walked.</span> <span id="s526">I don't know how many hours we walked there.</span> <span id="s527">We got to the camp.</span> <span id="s528">We registered ourselves.</span> <span id="s529">Over there in the camp, there were already American soldiers.</span> <span id="s530">They registered us and they asked us where we wanted to go.</span> <span id="s531">I was thinking of going to Argentina because my father was, before the war, in Argentina, in Buenos Aires.</span> <span id="s532">I didn't want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s533">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s534">It was still in my mind that the guy who had brought me to forest, left me there, I would find him if I went to the city.</span> <span id="s535">I was afraid to go there.</span> <span id="s536">I was afraid to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s537">I didn't trust the Polish people because they were working together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s538">I came from a small town and they all -- the whole town, was working with the German people.</span> <span id="s539">I wasn't going back.</span> <span id="s540">I figured I had an uncle in Argentina.</span> <span id="s541">My father had been there and he came back before the war.</span> <span id="s542">I remembered his address and I wrote him a letter.</span> <span id="s543">Because I remembered my father used to send us letters so I had the address, I remembered the address.</span> <span id="s544">I wrote him a letter and he answered me.</span> <span id="s545">But in the meantime, I started working.</span> <span id="s546">It was a few days later when I was liberated, the 24th of April and I went to register in Germany, in Leipzig, two days later, they asked me where I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s547">I said that I didn't want to go to Poland and I didn't want to go to Russia.</span> <span id="s548">They said there was a transport with soldiers with prisoners of war going back to Holland, if I wanted to go to Holland.</span> <span id="s549">Two other girls and I said yes, we wanted to go to Holland.</span> <span id="s550">Three of us came to Holland.</span> <span id="s551">May the 1st, we arrived in Rotterdam, Holland.</span> <span id="s552">The Queen Wilhelmina came to greet us.</span> <span id="s553">Not us, they came to greet the soldiers but we happened to be in the same bus.</span> <span id="s554">We were the first survivors in Holland.</span> <span id="s555">They looked at us; they had posters made up of the three of us.</span> <span id="s556">Put on the walls all over.</span> <span id="s557">Over there I was a year.</span> <span id="s558">One year, and then I started working with the brigade, with the Berihah (450).</span> <span id="s559">This was the Jewish brigade, the soldiers from England.</span> <span id="s560">They were working, the Jewish soldiers, the Berihah, and I started working with them.</span> <span id="s561">They sent me in different places.</span> <span id="s562">I was in a kibbutz like, sending people through the organized groups and sending them to Israel.</span> <span id="s563">I was working with children, getting together the children- This was all in Holland, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">No, that was--in Holland I was a year working with them but they sent me out later to France.</span> <span id="s565">I was in a kibbutz in Ville-Seger near the Pyrenees.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Oh, in southern France?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">In southern France, near Spain over there.</span> <span id="s568">We had our concentration, kibbutzim from the people because it wasn't far from Toulouse (463), from Marseille.</span> <span id="s569">There were transports from the people concentrated over there, sending them through Marseille with the boats to Israel.</span> <span id="s570">That was with the children too.</span> <span id="s571">A lot of children we sent to Nahalal Kibbutz.</span> <span id="s572">Nahalal accepted a lot of children.</span> <span id="s573">I was working that time with them.</span> <span id="s574">Then I decided to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s575">I changed my mind; I didn’t want to go anymore to Argentina.</span> <span id="s576">I wrote my uncle a letter that I belonged in Israel and I wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s577">I suffered so much as a Jew and I didn't want to go any place else.</span> <span id="s578">I was working with them in 194-.</span> <span id="s579">Was liberated in 1945 and that was 1946, in March, beginning of March.</span> <span id="s580">I came with the boat to Haifa, right after Exodus, the first boat after Exodus.</span> <span id="s581">The English soldiers picked us up.</span> <span id="s582">On the boat they caught us, and they-- in order to subtract affidavits for us because there was a quota, they put us in a camp in Alit (484) near Haifa.</span> <span id="s583">We were there ten days.</span> <span id="s584">Later on, everyone who had a family wherever they wanted to go, to a kibbutz, they were transferred.</span> <span id="s585">But England captured us for ten days in the concentration--like it's a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">The English?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">The Englishmen.</span> <span id="s588">The English soldiers, the English government, whatever.</span> <span id="s589">They probably got orders from the government.</span> <span id="s590">They didn't do it on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">At that time, they were in control of Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">That's exactly.</span> <span id="s593">There was Palestine.</span> <span id="s594">There was not the mandate.</span> <span id="s595">There was a mandate, it was Palestine.</span> <span id="s596">It wasn't Israel yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">So you arrived in Israel in 1946 in March?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">In March, I arrived to Israel, in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Spent ten days in a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">In Alit, near Haifa, in a camp.</span> <span id="s601">I thought, here I am again in a camp.</span> <span id="s602">I just got out from a camp and I am again in a camp.</span> <span id="s603">In Israel I was working--.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">After the ten days, they let you out though?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">They let us out.</span> <span id="s606">Then I met there, I met a gentleman and I married.</span> <span id="s607">I had two children.</span> <span id="s608">That was in Haifa.</span> <span id="s609">I stayed in Haifa but in 1948, the war broke out.</span> <span id="s610">I was working with my child.</span> <span id="s611">I had only my oldest son, who was nine months old.</span> <span id="s612">He was born in 1947 in May.</span> <span id="s613">I was working and I met two men.</span> <span id="s614">They looking at me and they said, “Oh, that was in Haifa.</span> <span id="s615">I used to live in K ____ (512).</span> <span id="s616">They said, “Eva, we're looking for you.</span> <span id="s617">Where have you been?”</span> <span id="s618">I said, “Why are you looking for me, what did I do?”</span> <span id="s619">I didn't recognize them.</span> <span id="s620">They were in their uniforms and here they were in civilian clothes so they looked different to me.</span> <span id="s621">I got scared.</span> <span id="s622">They said, “We need you because we are desperate for people like you.</span> <span id="s623">We have to work with ammunition and we don't have people like you.</span> <span id="s624">We need people like you.”</span> <span id="s625">They almost forced me to go to work and I was working in the factory Vulcan (522) in Israel.</span> <span id="s626">That was the war in 1948.</span> <span id="s627">There was, that time there was a kibbutz Yagur (?)</span> <span id="s628">(525) who used to produce, manufacturing weapons.</span> <span id="s629">But somebody, it was a Jewish guy from Czechoslovakia who told the English government or whoever was in charge that there was a factory with ammunition.</span> <span id="s630">He got paid a lot of money and they took over everything and they broke everything.</span> <span id="s631">So they did not have any weapons to work with, to fight with.</span> <span id="s632">I was that time working in Wulcan, by Molotov bottles in the whiskeys.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Molotov cocktails.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Cocktail bottles, right.</span> <span id="s635">I was working there.</span> <span id="s636">I made the forms for the casting.</span> <span id="s637">With sand, with the sand imported from Belgium.</span> <span id="s638">It was like silky sand, special sand.</span> <span id="s639">I was working making 350 pieces a day and I was teaching how to do it.</span> <span id="s640">That time I was very much involved in it.</span> <span id="s641">It was very--.</span> <span id="s642">I had people bringing me home and picking me up.</span> <span id="s643">Nobody knew what I was doing because we were very much afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">In secret?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">In secret, was very secret.</span> <span id="s646">I was trusted with a lot of things.</span> <span id="s647">Later on when the war was finished, thank God, we won the war, so I stopped working.</span> <span id="s648">I was a housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">When did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">To this country, I came in 1959, October 2nd.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">And you settled in New York?</span> <span id="s652">You lived in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">I settled in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s654">I mean in New York, right, I'm sorry, in New York and my husband passed away.</span> <span id="s655">He passed away, then I remarried.</span> <span id="s656">Twelve years later, I remarried.</span> <span id="s657">I married Mr. Young.</span> <span id="s658">He's a nice gentleman and a happy person.</span> <span id="s659">He survived too from a concentration camp in Russia.</span> <span id="s660">My husband has two children so we have four altogether.</span> <span id="s661">My oldest son is an engineer by profession but he is in business, he is not practicing that.</span> <span id="s662">My youngest son Bruce (569) is a doctor, an M.D. My daughter-in-law is here.</span> <span id="s663">He's practicing in Maryland; he has a practice.</span> <span id="s664">My husband's daughter, she's a director of research in advertising and the son is working with the customs.</span> <span id="s665">A custom broker, yes.</span> <span id="s666">He is married, has a family.</span> <span id="s667">The only one who is not married is the daughter but we hope soon she's going to get married because she's going out with somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">We live in Manhattan and it's one happy family.</span> <span id="s670">That's the story of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Let me--can I ask you?</span> <span id="s672">I know that you just started off and you got going and I couldn't stop you.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">No, it's not your fault.</span> <span id="s675">That's fine, it's perfect.</span> <span id="s676">But I want to ask you a few questions about your childhood.</span> <span id="s677">Can we go back to that part?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">You said--you talked about your brothers and sisters.</span> <span id="s680">You talked about your parents.</span> <span id="s681">Can you tell me a little bit about the town that you grew up in?</span> <span id="s682">What it was like and where it was situated?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s684">The town was Lipsko.</span> <span id="s685">My mother came from Zwolen.</span> <span id="s686">It's a bigger town.</span> <span id="s687">Lipsko.</span> <span id="s688">(594).</span> <span id="s689">Lipsko, my father came from… Can you--I wanted to have you spell these out for me so I can find them on the map, if that's--if we can do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">L-a-p-s-k-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">[You said L-a]</span></p> <p><span id="s692">L-i, I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Okay, Lipsko.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">That's where your father was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">That's right.</span> <span id="s696">Yes, my father was from Lipsko and my mother was from Zwolen.</span> <span id="s697">Z-v-o-I-e-n.</span> <span id="s698">Poland.</span> <span id="s699">It was…</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Side B …that it was my fault that something was wrong with me.</span> <span id="s701">When I start telling some people what I've been through, they didn't believe me.</span> <span id="s702">They said, “How can a young child like that make up a story like this?”</span> <span id="s703">Nobody believed me, so I stopped talking about it.</span> <span id="s704">As years passed, I had nightmares and I just didn't want to talk about it at all.</span> <span id="s705">I made up my mind that I wanted to forget the past.</span> <span id="s706">I don't want to think about it, I don't want to talk about it, I don't want to mention.</span> <span id="s707">Even today, I don't go--I cannot see a movie which involves concentration camps, German soldiers, German uniforms or anything what has to do with the war, with the Germans.</span> <span id="s708">I can still not face it and I will never watch a movie.</span> <span id="s709">I said my children should watch it; my children should know it.</span> <span id="s710">I don't have to go and torture myself to see it again and again to bring back the memories.</span> <span id="s711">The children, the grandchildren who have never seen that and they don't know what, all about it, just reading it and they're learning now; I would like them very much to see and to know about it.</span> <span id="s712">But recently, I don't know what got to me, that I decided to bring it out--to tell the story because as the time goes by and I'm getting older, I don't know how long I will be living.</span> <span id="s713">When I am gone, I would like very much for them to know; not only them.</span> <span id="s714">In general, people should know what children could go through.</span> <span id="s715">But children growing up without parents and being alone in the world and suffering so much--.</span> <span id="s716">By the way, when I went to Holland, after the war, I went to high school.</span> <span id="s717">When I got to Israel, I went to graduate seminar.</span> <span id="s718">When I came to America, I went for business administration even though I had the two children.</span> <span id="s719">I constantly, I was hungry for knowledge and for education.</span> <span id="s720">But now I stopped.</span> <span id="s721">I'm already in my sixties and I don't know how long I will be here so I decided to tell my story.</span> <span id="s722">In the beginning, I wanted to write a book because I had more information, I remembered more--the German, the names and the places and every little thing.</span> <span id="s723">But every day I remember less and less and less.</span> <span id="s724">I am very happy that I can bring out what I still remember.</span> <span id="s725">It's not too much but whatever it is, it's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Let me ask you about your town where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">It's Lipsko.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Lipsko, your father was born there and you were also born there, in Lipsko?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">I was born in Lipsko.</span> <span id="s730">My father was born in Lipsko.</span> <span id="s731">My mother was born in Zwolen.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">L-i-p-s-k-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">What area of Poland was Lipsko?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Lipsko was near Radom, Warsaw, around.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Around there.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">So it was in central Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Center, what I said, center Poland.</span> <span id="s738">They called it congress (32) Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Can you tell me a little bit about the town?</span> <span id="s740">How big it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Yeah, the town was a little--a small town.</span> <span id="s742">It was a historical town.</span> <span id="s743">It was a very interesting town.</span> <span id="s744">It was located, the little town, it was like a--there were mountains, forest, and the water.</span> <span id="s745">It was a historic town because in Poland, was once a bottle which the name was Kashimirtz (36).</span> <span id="s746">The king was Kashmir.</span> <span id="s747">He married a Jewish woman by the name of Esther.</span> <span id="s748">The crown is still there in Kashimirtz, in the synagogue, till today.</span> <span id="s749">That he was fighting in Lipsko, it was a historic city.</span> <span id="s750">A very little tiny city but a historical city and a very beautiful city.</span> <span id="s751">There were about 10,000, not even, I don't think 10,000 people, but there were a few thousand Jews.</span> <span id="s752">The Jews were located like in a--I would say, a ghetto.</span> <span id="s753">They were living all together in one place.</span> <span id="s754">They were not spread out there and here but just living in the center of the city.</span> <span id="s755">A lot of people were, most of the people were business people.</span> <span id="s756">The city, in general, the business people, the rich people, were poor too.</span> <span id="s757">If they owned a house, a little house and they could survive every day and they had money to marry off a daughter, which you have to pay a dowry and prepare her clothing and everything else, so--he was already rich.</span> <span id="s758">There was just elementary school.</span> <span id="s759">There was no high school but most of the children attended Jewish schools, like private Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s760">A cheder; they used to call it a cheder.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Cheders are usually for males?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">The cheders were for males but there were for girls, Beit Yaacov, the House of Jacob.</span> <span id="s763">In Zwolen, I went to school in Zwolen as I grew a little older, when my father was in Argentina.</span> <span id="s764">My mother went from Lipsko to live in Zwolen with her parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">When did your father go to Argentina?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">He came back a year before the war broke out, 1938.</span> <span id="s767">He was two years there, 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">So he left in 1936?</span> <span id="s769">Did he go there on business?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">He went there actually it was business.</span> <span id="s771">He went, a sister--his sister died.</span> <span id="s772">He was in charge of the money.</span> <span id="s773">She left $100,000.</span> <span id="s774">There were sisters and brothers, the government took some money, a lawyer took some money and he went there to settle.</span> <span id="s775">When he came back, he brought $10,000.</span> <span id="s776">Before the war, $10,000 was like a capitalist – was very rich.</span> <span id="s777">So we were not that poor.</span> <span id="s778">We were quite comfortable.</span> <span id="s779">But people were not talking about it.</span> <span id="s780">People were afraid to say anything, whatever it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">You said you had a brother – I had two brothers and one sister, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Were you the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s784">At that time, I was 14 years old, my sister was 12, my brother was 10, and my younger one was 8.</span> <span id="s785">They were two years apart from each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">You said that your father had a leather business and also the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A factory from wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">They were separate?</span> <span id="s789">They weren’t together?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Yeah, because in the factory from the wood, to make the little cork, I would say, right, there were gentile people working there.</span> <span id="s791">They were cutting the trees and doing it.</span> <span id="s792">We bought it all from somebody and that was already a running business; not in a big scale, in a small scale.</span> <span id="s793">But it brought in some income.</span> <span id="s794">Later on this was legal, but the leather wasn’t legal.</span> <span id="s795">We had to give up the leather thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Oh, later on when the war started?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">When the war, during the war, the leather was not legal but the wood was legal.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Did your mother help also with the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">No, she didn't help.</span> <span id="s800">She was a housewife, having four children.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">That's plenty of work in itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">There were no maids, they couldn't--maybe we could afford it but we were not supposed to have anybody working for us.</span> <span id="s803">We used to live in one room.</span> <span id="s804">There was everything, the bedroom and everything was in one room.</span> <span id="s805">When we were in Lipsko, when we got back from Zwolen, our house was burned (---?)</span> <span id="s806">(79).</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Let's see, you lived in Lipsko until--?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Until 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Then you moved to Zwolen?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Then in 1939, when the war broke out, we went back to Lipsko because the house was burned in Zwolen.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Over there, we had a house.</span> <span id="s813">My father was there.</span> <span id="s814">My aunt, my father's sister, used to live in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">So you moved in 1938--?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">We moved in with them.</span> <span id="s817">They took us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">So in 1938, you moved to Zwolen and then when the war broke out--?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">We got back.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">You went back to Lipsko?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Okay.</span> <span id="s823">And you moved in with relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Right.</span> <span id="s825">With my aunt.</span> <span id="s826">That was our house but she occupied the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">I see.</span> <span id="s828">The house in Lipsko, do you remember what street it was on?</span> <span id="s829">Do you remember the name of the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">The number was 12.</span> <span id="s831">I think it was Kashmirzka (87), if I'm not mistaken.</span> <span id="s832">Kashmirzka 12.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Were you involved in any youth organizations or that kind of thing when you were younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Well, I was, as a child.</span> <span id="s835">As a matter of fact I was involved in Betar.</span> <span id="s836">It's like Girl Scouts.</span> <span id="s837">I went to Hebrew School, by the way, to Tarboot (92) and I went to Beit Yaacob.</span> <span id="s838">Well, I was still young so it didn't mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s839">It was a scout thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Can you tell me a little bit about when the war broke out in 1939?</span> <span id="s841">What you did and what your family did when--and what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Well, when the war broke out, there was nothing to do.</span> <span id="s843">The Germans came in right away, a few days later, the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s844">First they started out with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s845">They are not supposed to have this, they were beating us up, going into stores, emptying out the stores, looting the stores, taking away everything, coming into Jewish families.</span> <span id="s846">Then they said this is a-…you are not supposed to go out---a curfew.</span> <span id="s847">That's right, it's a curfew.</span> <span id="s848">You're not supposed to go out after a certain hour; you're not supposed to go out.</span> <span id="s849">Not supposed to cross the bridge, not supposed to go there, not supposed to go here and they started looting and coming into the houses and taking out, beating.</span> <span id="s850">They took the nicest, and they said, “Who are the most religious people in the city?”</span> <span id="s851">They took them, they put them against--in the center of the city; they put against a wall and they shot them all.</span> <span id="s852">Rabbis and the children, whole families, they shot.</span> <span id="s853">Not women and children, just the men first.</span> <span id="s854">Then they started shooting other people, killing other people, taking others to transport.</span> <span id="s855">It didn't take too long, they were beating up and---.</span> <span id="s856">There was a ghetto.</span> <span id="s857">There was no access, you couldn’t go in and out.</span> <span id="s858">So whatever we had, we had to live on.</span> <span id="s859">.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">So the ghetto was sealed, and there was no access?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">It wasn't sealed; it was an open ghetto but it was--there were the guards, there were guards there watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Was it a large ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Well, the whole town was small so it wasn't---.</span> <span id="s864">They didn't have to say anything, they just said from this part of the city up to this street and this side of the city---.</span> <span id="s865">They just gave us the streets which we could go up to.</span> <span id="s866">They didn't have to make any bars around, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Was the ghetto there that they set up basically the Jewish part of the town anyway?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Just for the Jewish people, yes.</span> <span id="s869">They took out the Jewish people from other places and they put them in there.</span> <span id="s870">There were no gentile people mixed in, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s871">Because people who used to live a little farther, they had to leave their houses and come in to live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Did--do you remember when the ghetto was set up in the town?</span> <span id="s873">About how long after the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">I would say, the war broke out in September 1939, was it so, yes, September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">September 1st was when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">That's right.</span> <span id="s877">Of 1939, that's what I know, September, I remember that.</span> <span id="s878">Therefore, I set the candle for September.</span> <span id="s879">Maybe the ghetto they started doing about two or three months later.</span> <span id="s880">I would say about 1940.</span> <span id="s881">So difficult to remember all these dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">I know.</span> <span id="s883">Do you remember how long you were in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s884">How long you remained there?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Well, about two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">You stayed there until 1942, until you were sent--?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Until I was taken to the concentration camp, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">That first concentration camp that you talked about, that you said that you walked away from?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Yeah, I ran away from.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Was Skarzysko.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">That was Skarzysko and then they ended up sending you back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Do you remember when you were originally sent to that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">To Skarzysko.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">That was in July…that was in July of 1942.</span> <span id="s897">I know we had vacation.</span> <span id="s898">There was no school.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">I meant to ask you to spell this before, but can you spell Skarzysko?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Yes.</span> <span id="s901">S-k-a-r-z-y-s-k-o.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Great, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Now--and then you were sent--you walked away from there in sometime early April in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">So you stayed in Skarzysko for about a year?</span> <span id="s907">You said you came in July, almost a year, maybe about ten months?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Can you describe Skarzysko for me a little bit?</span> <span id="s910">The camp and how it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">The camp wasn't too big.</span> <span id="s912">But where we went to the camp, it wasn't huge, no, it wasn't.</span> <span id="s913">But we were walking to the factory.</span> <span id="s914">The factories were quite--we walked to the factories about a half hour walk or maybe longer.</span> <span id="s915">There were different factories.</span> <span id="s916">The factories were huge, they were very big.</span> <span id="s917">But the camp by itself was not too big.</span> <span id="s918">There was a gate around the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">So basically, it was a labor camp and then they took you out from there to go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Every day in the morning and then when we walked back, they counted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">To make sure you were

belt was missing.</span> <span id="s928">They took him and they hanged him in front of us.</span> <span id="s929">Everybody had to go--they called us an appel and everybody had to…they called us on a roll-count and… Yeah, I know what an appel is.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">You know what an appel is.</span> <span id="s931">They stood--everybody had to face the guy and--</span></p> <p><span
