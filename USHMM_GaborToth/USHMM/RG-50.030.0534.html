2009</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview conducted by Peggy Frankston, with Joyce Mizrachi on July 23rd, 2009, in New York City, and it’s for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you for coming today.</span> <span id="s13">Would you introduce yourself, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s15">My name is Joyce Saltz Mizrachi, and I was born May 13th, 1941.</span> <span id="s16">We’re not quite sure; my mother says I was born May 11th, but she wanted me to have my own birthday, so it became the 13th.</span> <span id="s17">My name was then given as Josefina(ph).</span> <span id="s18">Why, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s19">I was – never was explained, except my mother did tell my father to tell them that my name was Judith.</span> <span id="s20">He did what he wanted, and I became Josefina(ph) for nine years of my life.</span> <span id="s21">I don’t remember Rivesaltes.</span> <span id="s22">I was born in Rivesaltes, but I do not remember anything about it, of course.</span> <span id="s23">I know my mother left Rivesaltes, and I stayed.</span> <span id="s24">I was the excuse for her to leave, and she always told me that I’m the one who saved them.</span> <span id="s25">The ta – I don’t know how long I stayed – can you stop it?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s27">Do you want us to put your glasses on the table?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, I need a prop.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I don’t know how long it took for her to get me back, but I know I must have been about one – one and a half?</span> <span id="s31">One?</span> <span id="s32">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s33">I have been trying to get information, but I haven’t gotten anything so far.</span> <span id="s34">I do have a booklet that was given to my mother when they brought her – when they brought me to her, and it has the pictures of the women who – the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red Cross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have.</span> <span id="s35">We – after ri – Rivesaltes, we went to Tres, and there I have very few memories.</span> <span id="s36">The first memory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going back and forth.</span> <span id="s37">I think it’s my mother.</span> <span id="s38">And there must have been a little mirror, because I remem – that’s the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young.</span> <span id="s39">And then I do remember Tres.</span> <span id="s40">Not Tres, Marseilles.</span> <span id="s41">We went to Marseilles, it was the end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to shelters.</span> <span id="s42">The one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the room, and the air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break open the door.</span> <span id="s43">I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember we did go to the shelters.</span> <span id="s44">The shelters were very frightening, because they were very dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold.</span> <span id="s45">And I always cried.</span> <span id="s46">So there was a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see.</span> <span id="s47">His wife was blind.</span> <span id="s48">That I still remember.</span> <span id="s49">And he taught me how to – taught me different songs.</span> <span id="s50">And that, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else.</span> <span id="s51">I remember that.</span> <span id="s52">And I remember the different things.</span> <span id="s53">I remember being very spoiled by a lot of very different people.</span> <span id="s54">And I never had what my sister and brother had.</span> <span id="s55">I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry.</span> <span id="s56">I was frightened because no matter how young you are, people’s emotions do – do penetrate, and fear is very, very noticeable and affective.</span> <span id="s57">It affects you.</span> <span id="s58">So I was always frightened of that.</span> <span id="s59">I was always afraid of being taken away.</span> <span id="s60">The other thing I remember is that I guess it was – it was a big Catholic organization, and in France the nuns had very big headdresses.</span> <span id="s61">I don’t know the order, but I remember we used to get hot chocolate there, or something like it.</span> <span id="s62">And my mother – I was so s – very afraid of my mother leaving me, and being very – screaming very badly.</span> <span id="s63">Those are the things I remember, being very frightened.</span> <span id="s64">So remember being in back of a woman, because Marseilles was a very, very rough city, at that time especially, because it was near the waterfront.</span> <span id="s65">And walking – and we were walking behind a couple, and she had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off.</span> <span id="s66">And she stood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind.</span> <span id="s67">I don’t know if my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody who was – had to be caught.</span> <span id="s68">And that always, always stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s69">There was a couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way.</span> <span id="s70">It was a friend of theirs, I – I don’t know, they just figured my mother had two children and they had none, and times were very bad.</span> <span id="s71">And she said, probably, I don’t know who they were.</span> <span id="s72">I know my friend – friends of ours that still live in Brussels told Lucie about it when she was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s73">I don’t know who it was, someday I’ll go, in the near future, because they’re rather old, and I have to go and see what they know.</span> <span id="s74">Then I remember coming to Belgium after the war, going to school.</span> <span id="s75">Things were very tough in Belgium after the war.</span> <span id="s76">Work was very difficult.</span> <span id="s77">The anti-Semitism was horrible, very, very strong.</span> <span id="s78">I went to school in yeshiva, but because I was very rambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn’t care less, and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s79">There was an orphanage nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during the war, and they were sent to France and from France they were going to be sent to Israel, eventually, or some other place, or stay in France.</span> <span id="s80">And that made me very frightened.</span> <span id="s81">And ultimately my mother was asked to find another school for me, because I was such a wonderful child.</span> <span id="s82">They were thrilled to see me go, and I was thrilled to get out.</span> <span id="s83">And the next school I went to was an all-girls school.</span> <span id="s84">It was not a Hebrew school, it was very – it was mixed.</span> <span id="s85">Very few Jews, and I was one of them.</span> <span id="s86">And the antisis – anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it’s a shame that they didn’t get you too.</span> <span id="s87">And I didn’t know what they were talking about, because my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me.</span> <span id="s88">My father never spoke about it til the day he died, til he had Alzheimer’s, then he went back through everything.</span> <span id="s89">So he never spoke about anything.</span> <span id="s90">But I never understood what she was talking about.</span> <span id="s91">It was – it was tough.</span> <span id="s92">Then we came and what we did for entertainment was we went to the movies.</span> <span id="s93">And I decided that, since I entertained everybody anyway – I used to put on accents – I had to do that, I felt, because everybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh.</span> <span id="s94">So I entertained.</span> <span id="s95">And coming to this country meant that I wanted to know where Hollywood was.</span> <span id="s96">I was nine on the boat, and it was – I was thrilled.</span> <span id="s97">I was thrilled to come, til I came and I didn’t particularly care for it.</span> <span id="s98">I was very homesick, I missed my friends.</span> <span id="s99">My parents did not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me.</span> <span id="s100">It was all kept very quietly.</span> <span id="s101">We came to this country, and my father, who did not want to come, only wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s102">My mother refused.</span> <span id="s103">She said that she was not going to have us taken away any more, and he had a choice.</span> <span id="s104">He either could come – because she had one sister left, that lived here – he had a choice; either he came with us, and she was going and she was taking us, or th – he could go and he’d never see us again.</span> <span id="s105">So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn’t really the best thing for him, because he could never adjust very well to this country.</span> <span id="s106">She loved it.</span> <span id="s107">And every day I thank her.</span> <span id="s108">She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever spoke about it.</span> <span id="s109">I never knew he was in the resistance.</span> <span id="s110">I never knew that he had gotten people out of the camp, because he was a plumber, and he knew the underground works, where he had to fix things, and that’s how he got people out.</span> <span id="s111">I never knew all these things.</span> <span id="s112">Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a wonderful father.</span> <span id="s113">He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to play with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us.</span> <span id="s114">She – my mother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma – young.</span> <span id="s115">I remember her crying a lot.</span> <span id="s116">I remember her when her niece’s birthday and her nephews, or whoever, always having – we didn’t have very much money, but she always managed to get flowers next to their picture.</span> <span id="s117">And I always think – I always thought, I don’t get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that.</span> <span id="s118">Why do they?</span> <span id="s119">I always had a feeling – well, it’s my own insecurity, but I was always afraid that she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you – she got me out when I was one or two, how did she know it was me?</span> <span id="s120">Who told her it was me?</span> <span id="s121">Children change.</span> <span id="s122">How did she know?</span> <span id="s123">We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was really a shelter.</span> <span id="s124">It was a lot of different people from a lot of different places, and it was very much like a shelter, today, I would imagine.</span> <span id="s125">There were cots.</span> <span id="s126">And my aunt felt that that really wasn’t proper for me, and I stayed with her.</span> <span id="s127">And I was – as I said, I was always very – my sister and brother do not want to think that I experienced anything.</span> <span id="s128">If I say I remember something, they’re very fast to either say, no you can’t, you’re too young.</span> <span id="s129">They – it’s a form of protecting me, but it’s the way they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Sorry, that’s my phone, sorry about that.</span> <span id="s131">I’ll shut it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Shall I wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different.</span> <span id="s135">And I thought, oh, what a different place, what a different world.</span> <span id="s136">But I soon – and then we moved to Riverside Drive and I went to school.</span> <span id="s137">But there were always things lingering, there was always this heaviness that I remember.</span> <span id="s138">When I went to school, high school, there were a lot of – which was Washington Heights, there were a lot of refugees there, and it’s funny how you click.</span> <span id="s139">And that’s what you do.</span> <span id="s140">Even later on you do.</span> <span id="s141">And the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that that was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s142">She was put up as a child.</span> <span id="s143">And that reinforced my feeling that, oh I – I know she’s not my mother.</span> <span id="s144">And I remember thinking – and I know, because I was such a difficult child.</span> <span id="s145">I was difficult also because she was 43 when she had me.</span> <span id="s146">I was not exactly what you call a planned child.</span> <span id="s147">And I remember thinking, yeah, if I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna have somebody like you.</span> <span id="s148">Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I look just like her.</span> <span id="s149">But that could be with adopted child as well.</span> <span id="s150">I am ju – I am very much like her, and I know, I know that who – that I’m not.</span> <span id="s151">Not that it would matter anyway, after a certain age.</span> <span id="s152">As a mother she was a fantastic mother.</span> <span id="s153">She let me live and be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of – who are survive – children of survivors.</span> <span id="s154">Because they burden – there is a burden on you.</span> <span id="s155">There is a – a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it comes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too much, because they were upset enough.</span> <span id="s156">But all in all they were – she really did a phenomenal job.</span> <span id="s157">She is the reason why we’re alive.</span> <span id="s158">She is the one who masterminded everything.</span> <span id="s159">But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was stopped by Gestapo, and she was – and he looked at her and he said, I will let you go this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive.</span> <span id="s160">So things like that did happen.</span> <span id="s161">She did not – one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for anything that happened before.</span> <span id="s162">And that I’m thrilled about, because I do have friends that are everything different.</span> <span id="s163">As I said, she didn’t put all the ugliness on me, but unfortunately we do that ourselves.</span> <span id="s164">I don’t – I’m very careful who I speak to about it.</span> <span id="s165">I don’t watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s166">And you get your own things that you have to live through and work through, but I didn’t have the hardship that they had.</span> <span id="s167">For that, I’m lucky too.</span> <span id="s168">Okay.</span> <span id="s169">And that’s my story.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s171">You are happy that came to the United States, and you have a life here.</span> <span id="s172">What you talked about, talent for entertaining, and – that might have come from the need to –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Can you tell me one of the things you – what your career was, what – what you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician like my sister, because my mother wanted me to do that.</span> <span id="s176">But when I – as soon as I made a little money, I went to tech – I went – decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along.</span> <span id="s177">So I went to – had a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him?</span> <span id="s178">Anthony Menino?</span> <span id="s179">And then I went to Herbert Berghof studios, and I studied with Bill Hickey(ph).</span> <span id="s180">And I did plays.</span> <span id="s181">I did different things, nothing major.</span> <span id="s182">Then I got married and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them, which was stupid.</span> <span id="s183">But I also didn’t have the need that I had before.</span> <span id="s184">I’m sorry I didn’t pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did.</span> <span id="s185">My brother, I remember telling my father, you have to do something.</span> <span id="s186">She can’t go to acting school.</span> <span id="s187">You know what’s in acting schools, they’re all sick.</span> <span id="s188">And a few other things.</span> <span id="s189">And my father smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want.</span> <span id="s190">And I did, and it was wonderful, I loved it.</span> <span id="s191">I really enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s192">And I always said someday I’ll do it again, and I just – I’ve done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do.</span> <span id="s193">That’s my fault, no one stopped me except me.</span> <span id="s194">But I found that it’s a great thing to do, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable.</span> <span id="s195">I used to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing.</span> <span id="s196">The only thing that I remember that really I’m thrilled about, when my father was in the hospital, when he was – had Alzheimer’s, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you know who I am?</span> <span id="s197">And he said yes – and this didn’t happen very often – you’re my child.</span> <span id="s198">I remember how you – and I – I remember all the accents you used to do.</span> <span id="s199">And one of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s200">So it was an imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny.</span> <span id="s201">And strange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his shoes, because he’d have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide.</span> <span id="s202">But that was – you know, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and there is some nice things that you can remember.</span> <span id="s203">For the longest time I couldn’t think of my father because I didn’t want to think of him that way.</span> <span id="s204">Took a long time, and now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer parts.</span> <span id="s205">For someone who did so much good, sad to think that that had to happen.</span> <span id="s206">But, you know, we’re not privileged.</span> <span id="s207">The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in California who was really – who’s like my third cousin or second cousin.</span> <span id="s208">And she knew all about his grandmother and his – and my grandfather.</span> <span id="s209">I had no idea about them.</span> <span id="s210">I had no idea about anything.</span> <span id="s211">I found out that my great-grandmother had a school for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure.</span> <span id="s212">But I never knew all these things.</span> <span id="s213">I never knew anything.</span> <span id="s214">It’s almost like being adopted, when you don’t know who your grandparents are really.</span> <span id="s215">You don’t know – you don’t have any aunts and uncles, you don’t have any cousins.</span> <span id="s216">There’s no one there.</span> <span id="s217">The reason we’re so close is because that’s it, that was what we had.</span> <span id="s218">That’s who we had to rely on, that was it.</span> <span id="s219">There was no one else.</span> <span id="s220">And then we came to this country and I had an aunt, and she had – but her children were much older than – because she was my mother’s oldest sister.</span> <span id="s221">And she decided that we were too European, she really didn’t want too much of us.</span> <span id="s222">She was a little mentally deranged.</span> <span id="s223">And we didn’t see her that much.</span> <span id="s224">So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very large family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always had cousins and friends and – and the whole thing.</span> <span id="s225">And it was lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: You’re welcome.</span> <span id="s228">Very three different personalities though.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Conclusion of
