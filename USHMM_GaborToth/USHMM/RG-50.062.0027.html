I was young and working.</span> <span id="s62">In 1943, we celebrated the first night of Passover at my uncle's, my mother's brother, place.</span> <span id="s63">He baked bread for the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s64">Some cousins from my father's side were there.</span> <span id="s65">I used to come with a friend for weekends.</span> <span id="s66">We paid the Jewish policemen in order to go with a group of working people to where the bakery was.</span> <span id="s67">After the weekend, we returned with another group with supplies from relatives.</span> <span id="s68">The second night of Passover was not celebrated in 1943.</span> <span id="s69">We had to go into bunkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">On April 23, 1943, I arrived at the Majdanek concentration camp, near Lublin.</span> <span id="s71">The men and women were separated.</span> <span id="s72">I was there for three months.</span> <span id="s73">A group of SS officers selected a number of women, who were nude.</span> <span id="s74">We went to work in an ammunition factory, to produce bullets for ourselves.</span> <span id="s75">In 1944, the Russian Army was moving west.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">They moved us from Skarzysko-Kamienna to an ammunition factory in</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">I worked there until January 15, 1945, when the Russian Army liberated us.</span> <span id="s79">We were to be deported to Germany on that day.</span> <span id="s80">We heard noises from the far distance.</span> <span id="s81">The Russian Army surrounded the place, so trains that were supposed to come in and take us, could not.</span> <span id="s82">The Germans fled and the Russians came in the next morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">That day, we were taken to roll call at the ammunition warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">We stayed there all day until dark, without food or facilities; it was freezing and we were barely clothed.</span> <span id="s85">The Germans were standing in their white furs and we marched through back to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Then the Germans fled.</span> <span id="s87">We didn't see anyone in the watch towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Hirayama We saw those white furs.</span> <span id="s89">I noticed that each [German] farm family had one foreign farm hand.</span> <span id="s90">Most of them were Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Rozenberg Me and my Lagerschwesters, there were 13 of us, feel we were treated all right by the Germans, in a way, as well as the Russians.</span> <span id="s92">We weren't raped or killed.</span> <span id="s93">We were beaten by the Jewish policemen.</span> <span id="s94">We made sure our work was done, and always clean and in order.</span> <span id="s95">The factory had hot water, there was no hot water in the barracks.</span> <span id="s96">We had to steal a special soap used for the machines, and washed our hair during the midnight shifts when the SS officers were on their break, so we wouldn't get lice.</span> <span id="s97">When Jewish policemen saw us with wet hair, this was when we were beaten.</span> <span id="s98">One of them was tried and convicted in Israel and received a well deserved punishment.</span> <span id="s99">They didn't shave our heads because of the uprising in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s100">We were considered political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">They shaved the heads of the Greek Jewish women.</span> <span id="s102">There were others in Majdanek too, prostitutes, Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Hirayama In France, women who collaborated had their heads shaved after the</span></p> <p><span id="s104">war.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Rozenberg The Germans used to close up the courtyard and look for men to work, almost on a daily basis - to polish their boots, clean their rooms, sweep the streets.</span> <span id="s106">I didn't want my father to go.</span> <span id="s107">When they closed the courtyard, I hid my father in a closet and put a lot of clothes in it.</span> <span id="s108">They closed the courtyard one Friday, late afternoon.</span> <span id="s109">The Germans took whatever they wanted from people.</span> <span id="s110">But when they came into our house, there were Shabbas candlelight.</span> <span id="s111">My mother's sister was moved from outside the Ghetto and was living with us; both sets of candles were lit.</span> <span id="s112">We couldn't put on the electricity too often because the Germans were still bombing Poland even in those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">When the Germans came in, they asked what the candles were for.</span> <span id="s114">The Volksdeutch, who was with them, told them we were observant Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">So they didn't touch anything in our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Hirayama How did you cope with sickness in the Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Rozenberg You tried to stay away from hospitals, in the camps and the Ghetto, because that was the first place the Germans looked for people to deport to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Hirayama Were there gas chambers in the camp you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Rozenberg Yes.</span> <span id="s120">Majdanek was a destruction camp.</span> <span id="s121">Only a handful of people survived - the women and men chosen to work in the ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s122">There was no work in Majdanek itself, except in the fields a little bit, and the kitchens.</span> <span id="s123">There was a roll call every day and those chosen went to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Hirayama Did they strip everybody naked, take their clothes and shoes, when they sent people to the gas chamber?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Rozenberg They claimed everything from us when we first entered the camp, and sent to the showers.</span> <span id="s126">Some went to showers with water, some went to showers with gas.</span> <span id="s127">Gray and navy blue striped clothing was given to us.</span> <span id="s128">You didn't know which way you were going, to the water showers or gas showers.</span> <span id="s129">We didn't know we were going to the ammunition factory either, when they chose us.</span> <span id="s130">There were three tables set up in a row, and you went to a table and put your name and number down.</span> <span id="s131">Would you believe, I don't remember my number; I'm not tattooed.</span> <span id="s132">It was not necessary because Majdanek was a destruction</span></p> <p><span id="s133">camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Hirayama At Dachau, they had gas chambers, all kinds.</span> <span id="s135">Also, because there were too many people, they put people in Haberstein (ph) castle and then sent them to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Rozenberg We didn't know the other shower was gas at first.</span> <span id="s137">But after a while, we knew the building ahead of us was the crematorium "the Office."</span> <span id="s138">I was not yet 20 years at the time, I didn't know these things.</span> <span id="s139">When they took people out of the Ghetto under different pretexts, we believed they were going to work.</span> <span id="s140">For example, they had a tailoring factory; people making coats for the army.</span> <span id="s141">They told people they would be taken to this place, in a little town outside of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s142">Some got there, but others were taken to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s143">They couldn't tell you you were going to Treblinka, there probably would have been an uprising sooner.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">We didn't have ammunition in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s145">The Poles didn't supply us.</span> <span id="s146">We had to use Molotov cocktails.</span> <span id="s147">I wasn't part of it, but I lived through part of it.</span> <span id="s148">That was the breaking point.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">I was in my uncle's bakery.</span> <span id="s150">Flour had to be brought into the Ghetto by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s151">We sent three people instead of one - supposedly to handle the bags of flour.</span> <span id="s152">There was a Jewish underground, inside and outside the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s153">We smuggled out people, distinguished writers, people who contributed to the community throughout Poland.</span> <span id="s154">At a certain spot, people were waiting for them with false passports, non-Jewish names, and hidden in places in the country.</span> <span id="s155">The driver came back through a different gate, so the German that gave him the pass at one gate for three, didn't see him come back.</span> <span id="s156">In April 1943, the air was heavy in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s157">People being smuggled out:, ammunition being smuggled in.</span> <span id="s158">The uprising was</span></p> <p><span id="s159">planned very carefully.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Hirayama How did people who escaped manage, because many people on the</span></p> <p><span id="s161">outside were hostile.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Rozenberg People didn't escape.</span> <span id="s163">They were taken out of the Ghetto and met by sympathetic people, and then put into certain places; monasteries, churches, in the country, in somebody's attic.</span> <span id="s164">When they discovered our bunker, our hiding place, they marched us to the train station and took us in cattle cars to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">It was easy for the Germans to build destruction camps because the Poles collaborated with them.</span> <span id="s166">They wanted to get rid of the Jews even more than the Germans.</span> <span id="s167">It was the Poles that found the Jew that was hidden, because the Germans couldn't distinguish.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Salzberg My sister lived in Warsaw, but not in the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s169">She was a very determined young woman.</span> <span id="s170">She lost her husband in Galicia right away, he was taken by the SS and killed.</span> <span id="s171">She made up her mind to go to Warsaw, but she lived on the outside.</span> <span id="s172">She worked for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">They called her a "Russka," no one knew she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s174">She said there was 101 or 107 days straight when they bombed Warsaw, after the Polish uprising [in 1944].</span> <span id="s175">They bombed right over the roof tops, because people were hiding in the sewers.</span> <span id="s176">She lost all her possessions in the fires.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">On Sunday mornings, if she didn't go to church, they would point her out.</span> <span id="s178">One day, she didn't go and the Gestapo took her to the priest.</span> <span id="s179">My sister was raised in the southern part of Poland by a family, who also saved my brother's life.</span> <span id="s180">So she used to go to church sometimes; she spoke perfect Polish.</span> <span id="s181">So when the priest asked her questions, she answered them, and he told the Germans she was Polish.</span> <span id="s182">She believed the priest knew she was Jewish, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Later, when there was the uprising, they rounded them up and put them in cattle cars to be sent to Germany.</span> <span id="s184">But outside of Warsaw, there was an air attack, and when the guards ran away, my sister escaped back into Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">My brother was hiding with a young Polish man, who put him to work in a soda factory.</span> <span id="s186">Finally they got wise to him; he ran into the woods and joined the partisans, and marched all the way to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">He's in America now, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and he's a millionaire.</span> <span id="s188">I brought him here in 1947.</span> <span id="s189">What you said before about Pearl Harbor; as a Jew, I can feel for your people.</span> <span id="s190">You come from the Japanese culture but born here.</span> <span id="s191">It's the same with us.</span> <span id="s192">When something happens in Israel, I feel bad even though I'm in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Hirayama You can't change yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Rozenberg We are here to tell the future generations about our experiences so it will never happen to anybody.</span> <span id="s195">We could all live in peace and harmony if it wasn't for prejudice and people who instigate differences between you and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Salzberg Would you like to hear how my sister's second husband was saved?</span> <span id="s197">He was in Lemberg in southeast Poland.</span> <span id="s198">The population was Ukrainian very hateful towards the Jews.</span> <span id="s199">They rounded up all the Jews by the thousands, marched them outside the city and shot them.</span> <span id="s200">My brother- in-law was one of them.</span> <span id="s201">The Germans gave the Ukrainians weapons; they used the Ukrainians against the Poles.</span> <span id="s202">A German officer in a command car pointed at a boy who used to clean his uniform and called him over.</span> <span id="s203">My brother-in-law walked away too and escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Weichtman What do you want your children to know about the Holocaust so it will not happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Kuba The best way to educate is to have a video in your home of a good movie about it so you can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Rozenberg Schools should have a subject included in the curriculum about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s207">It's being done in Edmonton Alberta.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Carla Chotzen I feel we have a responsibility to quit making arms and find things we have in common.</span> <span id="s209">Decrease nationalism and increase human</span></p> <p><span id="s210">commonality.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">.</span> <span id="s212">END.</span></p></body></html>
