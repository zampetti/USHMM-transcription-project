A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: . . . mingle with the Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: . . . with the surrounding peasantry, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Did you experience any Antisemitism or you . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Not in the beginning, only as war winds drew closer, that they became more aggressive.</span> <span id="s47">At my level, my friends, my age group, that before that they would be just friends, and playmates, but in the late 30's became much more aggressive and inimical.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you're saying that you actually had Christians who were playmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Oh, yes, because in the back of our house we could mingle with the Christian kids and we be . . . beyond their place was a large field where everybody send their animals to pasture.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">01:07:36 In addition to all the establishments I mentioned, the synagogues of course, we had four, five synagogues and they were all divided by the occupation, the tailors synagogue, the cobblers synagogue and so forth, which probably was a social place of the same kind, and the youth that did not, was not impressed with the synagogues organized into Zionist movements, of which not the . . . all parents agreed because it meant that it was a preparation for leaving home and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s51">But events caught up with us.</span> <span id="s52">In 1939, the Russians and the Germans made an agreement to divide the eastern parts of Europeand the Russians moved 1 August 23, 1939 Germany and the USSR sign non-aggression pact in Moscow, which granted control of Bessarabia to Russia.</span> <span id="s53">Charles Messenger, Chronological Atlas of World War Two (New York: Macmillan, 1989) 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">up to the river Prut so that the border became half a mile or less from our village and because of doubts by the Rumanians, as to our nationalism, they asked the Jews to leave Ro . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Bivolari and concentrate in larger cities and that's when we left Bivolari, with everything that we could take and moved to Iasi, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: You mentioned the Zionist group movements, were you personally involved?</span> <span id="s57">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: And what did that involvement mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: It meant just education and sports activities.</span> <span id="s60">Preparation for kibbutz life in Israel, and even that we had three or four different outlooks, religious wing and a socialist wing and a right wing and so forth, as Churchill would say, three Jews have four opinions.</span> <span id="s61">But it was nicely .</span></p> <p><span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">.</span> <span id="s64">treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">01:10:23</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What motivated you to get involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Motivated?</span> <span id="s68">My brothers, my sisters were involved in the same organization and by various Hebrew names they belonged to, to more advanced groups, but basically it was educational in the Zionist, in general sense.</span> <span id="s69">We had to, all the ones, lecturers and subjects that we could not encounter in any schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s72">We belonged to a synagogue behind our house, but instead of going out through the back Saturday all three, four -- three sons and the father would dress up and walk through the main street, about quarter of a mile instead of going right out from the back part of the house and walked to the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How much were you aware, before 1939, of Hitler and Nazism and what was going on . . . A: Germany . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: . . . in Poland, Germany and Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s76">Parents knew about it and that's when they softened up in their control of these Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s77">Such that starting in 1932, one by not too many, one a year maybe, one person, one youngster would leave the village to go to Palestine, to join a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s78">And the whole village would walk him to the end of the other place where he would take off on a bus or a horse and buggy, to go to Iasi, from there to Constanta, and to there by boat to</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">01:12:50</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Up until this point, were there any restrictions on Jewish people in Bivolari up until '39?</span> <span id="s82">In terms of school, or business or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s84">The Jewish community operated an abattoir, a slaughterhouse for kosher food, for kosher meat and poultry and for that and other services paid high taxes that supported the leadership of the village, and they depended on that so they had to support it, encourage it, all this activities that the Jewish community organized.</span> <span id="s85">Every family had his own Christian family friends or vice versa.</span> <span id="s86">A few Christians had one good Jew that they encouraged and they supported.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So it sounds like you had a fairly nice, comfortable time until 19 . . . A: '39, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: So you packed up?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: We packed up and, the big trucks, sat on top and we moved to Iasi.</span> <span id="s90">And in a few days we found an apartment on a corner street that, a five street corner, very central and my parents and the older brothers immediately went to, back to the same occupation as we left in Bivolari, and rented a store and started all over again, in the yard good trade.</span> <span id="s91">I would work in the store and also catch up on my schooling that I had to neglect before, and there was the Jewish, larger Jewish community, a larger school, with all grades up to the 12th grade and there they had special programs for such students that missed the regular grades and we were able to graduate two classes in one year.</span> <span id="s92">Fifth and sixth, and seventh and eighth, so that by 1944, '43, I finished high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">01:16:21</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Okay now, I'm trying to get a sense of what it felt like to pick up and move and then maybe you can tell me a little bit about the Jewish community in Iasi and how you . . . again whether it was self-contained or whether it was part of a larger community, and just how it felt to pick up and leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes, oh Iasi, it was part of a large community and the Jewish community, the town approached 100,000.</span> <span id="s96">Here we come from a place with 900 people, from Bivolari.</span> <span id="s97">In many other small places, the Jewish moved to Iasi.</span> <span id="s98">Not by order, but that was the natural choice.</span> <span id="s99">That's where we always traveled to do things that were missing in Bivolari.</span> <span id="s100">Even to go to theater or to movies, we would drive or ride to Iasi.</span> <span id="s101">Antisemitism, in Iasi it was already open, and we arrived in '39, time went by, until June 21, 1941, when Hitler invaded Russia and of course that was 50 miles from Iasi, where we used to live, in Bivolari, they crossed the Prut.</span> <span id="s102">We were shaking at the sight of tanks and soldiers and this tense situation and sure enough, within a week, on June 29th, there was a big pogrom in Iasi.</span> <span id="s103">The authorities, the Rumanian authorities, issued an order that all Jews must come to the city place, city hall to obtain identification cards or exchange any that they might have had.</span> <span id="s104">My brothers went and my father and myself stayed home, he said, "No, we will wait until everybody else got their cards and then we'll go.”</span> <span id="s105">And sure enough when the people arrived there for cards they were surrounded and enclosed in a large yard, an outdoor movie house all walled in by stone walls, and shooting started.</span> <span id="s106">My brothers were among the first to come so they were settled by the wall and they were able to jump the wall and start looking for shelter.</span> <span id="s107">They found it in a shed of wood, firewood piled all the way to the ceiling, but they were able to remove the top level, crawl in and replace the front so that whenever soldiers came by, they could see wood, firewood.</span> <span id="s108">Myself and father at home in this apartment lived about 30, 40 Jewish families.</span> <span id="s109">A large building with a large basement, but unfinished, just a cellar, and that cellar had five, six exits or entries, such that when they came to look for us in one entrance, mothers, female, women, were able to send them away that we already went to the city hall and send us to the other corner of the basement and vice versa, wherever they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">They came to see that everybody went to get their ID cards and this way we ran through and could see what's going on outside, but we escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">01:21:23</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: I have a couple questions, so they were only demanding that the men and boys?</span> <span id="s113">A: Yes, go.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And who was doing this action, was it Romania police only, was it Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Both.</span> <span id="s116">The Rumanians were rounding up the people, the Germans were doing the killing, the shooting.</span> <span id="s117">They stopped shooting in the morning and about 11,000 people were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">They marched them to the train station and packed them into cattle cars and started traveling them from Iasi to Podu Iloaiei again and again, back and forth.</span> <span id="s119">And every now and then they would pour lime, which give off the fumes that killed of the 12,000 about half or three- quarters of them, died on the pogrom.</span> <span id="s120">My uncle was one of them.</span> <span id="s121">Some of our friends were in the trains.</span> <span id="s122">And the others came out completely disoriented, they didn't know where they were, what they were and it took some doing to find them.</span> <span id="s123">In the meantime it quieted down 2 June 22, 1941.</span> <span id="s124">Hitler launches operation "Barbarossa.”</span> <span id="s125">Messenger, Atlas of World War Two, 63.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">3 Four thousand three hundred and thirty Jews who survived the shooting were loaded into the trains, and of those 2,650 perished.</span> <span id="s127">All told, roughly 10,000 Jews were killed in Iasi on that day.</span> <span id="s128">Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, s.v. "Iasi."</span> <span id="s129">(add year) in a few days and my mother and sisters went to look for the brothers because we knew they weren't in the trains and they weren't in the . . . in that courtyard.</span> <span id="s130">So, when really things quieted down, five days later, our brothers sent somebody home to notify where they were and mother went and brought them home.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">01:23:46</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: And you and your father were basically hiding?</span> <span id="s133">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Throughout this?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Oh, of course.</span> <span id="s136">We had little windows where we could look out and see the round-ups.</span> <span id="s137">And my most vivid impression is that a block or two down the street, one of the streets was a famous temple and a rabbi and him I saw being dragged, beaten and killed.</span> <span id="s138">But then the Germans went on to Russia and we remained to reorganize.</span> <span id="s139">Now the Rumanians asked all the Jewish families to supply one person for volunteer hard labor.</span> <span id="s140">In my family, I was the volunteer.</span> <span id="s141">Why?</span> <span id="s142">Because in a round-up of such, they ask for a bookkeeper, anybody knows how to keep books.</span> <span id="s143">My brother raised his hand, but he meant to send me and so I worked as a volunteer on hard, or forced labor in a military hospital, formerly a Jewish hospital, but at this time they took it over.</span> <span id="s144">In the offices of course, the officer in charge of bookkeeping had difficulties staying sober or keeping books and so he found me, his savior.</span> <span id="s145">He could pick me out because at this point we had curfew at six, seven o'clock, in evening or early in the morning, so he would come and pick me up, keep me until late hours and take me home.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">01:26:06</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Had you any bookkeeping experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: When I mentioned that in, starting in Bivolari, that we had to prepare for exams to be taken in Iasi.</span> <span id="s149">And then in Iasi, the Romania system of high school you had a choice to pursue engineering or physical sciences or the other, literary and such.</span> <span id="s150">I was in that section of bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s151">Simple mathematics, except that the officer in charge had to cover up a lot of stealing and losses.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Was there anything frightening about working there, this forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: It was.</span> <span id="s154">But I wouldn't venture out of the office, because most of the wounded were both Romania soldiers and some German.</span> <span id="s155">As I mentioned at this point, Jewish kids were kicked out of school and the community had organized it's own schools.</span> <span id="s156">High school was down the street from us and looking back, I could just . . . the incongruity of it that under such circumstances, every Jewish child studied music.</span> <span id="s157">Kept, every day you could see them walk down to school with their instruments.</span> <span id="s158">I studied the violin and it kept us indoors and we had no radio or television or any other entertainment.</span> <span id="s159">This was something other than book . . . books.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">01:28:27</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What other restrictions were there at this point in the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Again, they conducted all the, most of the business, most of the commerce in the city.</span> <span id="s163">Again, the peasants that used to bring their produce to Bivolari would now come to Iasi.</span> <span id="s164">In fact, the peasantry multiplied because the border now was opened to Bessarabia, part of Russia, and they too would bring their goods and their . . . .</span> <span id="s165">And many of them became merchants themselves, so they would come to us buy wholesale and take it back to the old Bivolari, that was now occupied, all the houses, by some of the peasantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">01:29:36</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: So the Jews were allowed to continue business?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Yes, except those that were forced to be taken to first labor.</span> <span id="s169">Or, you could even pay instead of going to the forced labor.</span> <span id="s170">So, both of my brothers were paying, my father was considered too old.</span> <span id="s171">I was young enough to go but as I said, I went to the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Were there any other restrictions on the community in terms of what you could and couldn't do?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well, we started earlier wearing the yellow star.</span> <span id="s174">We starting avoiding the Germans walking on the streets.</span> <span id="s175">We could not go to any entertainment unless one took off the star and acted and looked very much like a Rumanian, which we all did, and took chances.</span> <span id="s176">Not at night, but matinees of course, we all tried that.</span> <span id="s177">Some were punished, were caught and others just knew how to get through the maze.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">01:31:13</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: You mentioned that the people were, Jewish people were caught disobeying whatever decrees were enforced that they would be punished, what does that mean punished?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: There was a curfew and people would take chances, take, remove their yellow star, identity card and venture out beyond, or after curfew.</span> <span id="s181">Those who did not succeed were caught and detained and the punishment was that they were detained for several days without parents or family knowing about them.</span> <span id="s182">No telephone, no announcement where they are and for that parents were strict and controlled the family from breaking the curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Now, you said people, what about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I did, many times, the same thing and I looked more Italian than Jewish or Romania and attended many plays, movies and nothing happened to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: You didn't consider it rather risky?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: In the daytime not as much and at night we knew how to go through buildings or alleyways where we would not encounter anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Now, I've got to assume at this time, this point in time, you didn't have too much contact with the Christian community, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: No, not at all, absolutely.</span> <span id="s189">Except as customers in the store and those were the peasants that came from outside and they knew us and we knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: And they remained cordial?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s192">They needed our instruction, our guidance, how to merchandise things, problems.</span> <span id="s193">Not too often that we needed to purchase and bring in large amounts of goods and those came from manufacturers that were formally Jewish owned, now they were turned over to non- Jews, ownership.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: But the business relationships?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes, were mutually beneficial, so to speak.</span> <span id="s196">01:34:05</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: The job that you had, the forced labor as a bookkeeper, sounds like that would be a fairly privileged position.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes, I paid, we paid for that, too and it was arranged that when they asked for a bookkeeper, our hand will be picked, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: What advantage did you have that other forced laborers didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Well, I stayed in the city even though I didn't venture out of the hospital.</span> <span id="s201">I was there, picked up in the morning and returned at night and one day I was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And you were fed, you were safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And your brothers, what were they doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: They were in the business, conducting the business I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: During this time, did you continue to observe Jewish holidays, the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s208">Everything was transmuted from the original village through the larger community.</span> <span id="s209">Iasi had a population of 70,000 Jews, so originally the ones that came like us, in '39, '40, maybe added another 45-50,000, but there were already the, not ghettos, but communities where Jews lived and could not live any other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: So all synagogues were opened, people were allowed to . . . ?</span> <span id="s211">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Okay, I'm just

organization.</span> <span id="s407">By now we were organized with representatives from Israel and we were called the Haganah, and with contacts with these Greeks that like us in Israel, were trying to get rid of the British control of the island.</span> <span id="s408">So in exchange of their help for our escapees, for every one of us, they received a gun that the Israelis brought from Israel.</span> <span id="s409">That's the curiosity of arms tradings, the Israelis would buy them from the British and give them to the Greeks, so they can fight the British.</span> <span id="s410">That's how armaments travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">02:11:07 But we engaged in, first of all, observations of their movements.</span> <span id="s412">The camps were surrounded by two fences of barbed wire and in between, this concertina barbed wire rows.</span> <span id="s413">And we began to escape through the barbed wire.</span> <span id="s414">My specialty was to crawl into the concertina, so that when we split it, it doesn't start running away, because every 50 meters there were guards posted on towers.</span> <span id="s415">So this is where we started taking out youngsters of military age, every week, every night, eight to 10 people, bringing back the wires and tying up the fence back so that nothing can be suspected.</span> <span id="s416">As the youngsters left the fence, they would walk to a road where the Greeks would pick them up and take them to an orange grove, many orange groves around there, and house them for a time, when we had 40, 50 escapees collected together.</span> <span id="s417">At that point, Israeli fisherman would come, with permits to fish in Turkish waters and by pre-arrangement with lights and signs, we were able to board them and take them on little fishing boats, to Israel.</span> <span id="s418">Many times we were caught by the British and the punishment for that was to interrogate you, for which they always got the same response, that nobody organizes us, we just get together and decide to leave.</span> <span id="s419">The punishment was to transfer you to the other camps.</span> <span id="s420">We thought we would be strangers there, but there we were waited for and after a month or so we would do the same thing there, so that in punishment we would be returned.</span> <span id="s421">After several times and many funny exploits, it turned out that the safest place to escape was through their camps.</span> <span id="s422">They would be sleeping in tents the British and we would pass through there and get out of the camps.</span> <span id="s423">Right through the fence, just the fence that bordered to their encampment.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">02:14:44</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: You'd go through the British tents?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s427">Sometimes, that was one of my escapes, that we could not make the contact with the Greeks and the arrangement was that we find a grotto, a big hole in the ground and hide there.</span> <span id="s428">Except that one patrol, British patrol was playing soccer on their patrol and their ball wound up in our hole.</span> <span id="s429">When they came to a tree, they found 20 youngsters.</span> <span id="s430">And other escapades, we dug a tunnel.</span> <span id="s431">We lived in tents and a few, some British huts, metal huts, but they were for tables and for mess halls and half of them we filled with the soil that we dug out from the tunnels.</span> <span id="s432">And we took out about 1000 youngsters this way and one night I indicated that I'm not coming back and I tied up that fence from the outside and joined the 10 people that we left.</span> <span id="s433">After a few nights there, stayed locked up in these orange groves during the day and at night they let us out, roam around if we wanted.</span> <span id="s434">After a few nights they had 60 people and a boat, I remember it's name, Karish (ph), came, and we waded into the water and boarded the boat.</span> <span id="s435">All blankets, wrapped up in blankets, quietly moving on to Israel.</span> <span id="s436">But I had time to look at the watch and it was exactly a year since I came in, so I couldn't, since I came into Cyprus.</span> <span id="s437">Cyprus was again very well organized with all the professions and

at some point I became the camp director or commander and the most difficult task was to keep the Bulgarian Jews from the Rumanian Jews, and everyone wanted to be in the kitchen to cook their kind of foods, so we had committees and rotations so everybody tasted the other persons food.</span> <span id="s442">The British were still in Palestine when we came and we couldn't come into port, so we tried various places until they found one spot in Netanya, which we climbed a hill and landed on our faces to kiss the ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">02:19:53</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Must have been quite a feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Beautiful.</span> <span id="s446">Buses were waiting for us and we were transported to military recruiting camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: I want to stop you here, because I really don't want to interrupt the story, but I have a few questions about Cyprus, because you were there close to a year.</span></p> <p><span

in Cyprus probably wasn't burdensome for you maybe as for . . . ?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: No, because I was so busy days and nights and I knew it cannot last forever and I knew that I could

involved in camp life, in the administration of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Hmm-mm.</span> <span id="s455">(indicates yes) There were opposing organizations and there were fierce

where you could go and find your clothes, American clothes.</span> <span id="s466">Food was abundant.</span> <span id="s467">Our place was on the sea, so that three times a week, the British would open gates and let us go into the water.</span> <span id="s468">Not so in the other camps.</span> <span id="s469">As I said, we had an orchestra, 60, 70 players, we had a theater.</span> <span id="s470">Houses of prayer, whoever wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Were there displaced people there from areas other than Romania terri . . . ?</span> <span id="s472">A: Yes.</span></p>

id="s508">We had so many lawyers and doctors and pharmacists and artists, that turned back to paint, sculpt.</span> <span id="s509">It was nostalgic to leave the place, it was really.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Even though we were incarcerated, we were free to do what we needed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">02:28:39</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: I think one other question I have about Cyprus is, you were helping all these basically young people get out who were being trained for future work in Palestine or in Israel.</span> <span id="s513">Were girls among those people who got out, or was it mostly just boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Boys.</span> <span id="s515">Even though girls were training by their own volition and, but the coming out, that in danger, engendered risks and again the British would subject us to interrogations, how and where and when, and some of them were not so peaceful.</span> <span id="s516">That's where I realized or I learned to laugh and sing, that when, after an interrogation I started singing and the interrogator couldn't believe, "You bloody Jew, you love life.</span> <span id="s517">You must be full of it, full of life.”</span> <span id="s518">So, he was very nice to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: What did you sing?</span> <span id="s520">A: "Am Israel Chai."</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you make close friends at that time, who worked with you?</span> <span id="s522">A: In the camps, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Anything else that you want to say about Cyprus or that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: It's a beautiful island, we roamed around it, as I said, but once we got lost or we didn't make contact and we had to find our way or wait over one night, oh, one day and at night go back to the point of contact and be picked up but instead the British picked us up, British patrols.</span> <span id="s525">So I learned that the Angora cat originates in Cyprus and you could see them all over and they have orange groves and all the fruits that we lived on.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">02:31:36</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: So you arrived in Netanya?</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Netanya and there buses took us to Beit Lid.</span> <span id="s529">It's right across Netanya about 10 miles eastward and there we were dressed in military outfits and became soldiers in the Israeli army.</span> <span id="s530">But first job was again because I was enlisted as one of the camp commanders, a command in the recruiting camp, introduce newcomers with various language problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: You spoke good Hebrew at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: I spoke Hebrew, I spoke Rumanian, French, Yiddish and I had to learn Spanish quickly, because we had many Spanish-speaking.</span> <span id="s533">But a lot of Moroccan and North African immigrants that spoke French and Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: So what was life like in, this was actually now Israel?</span> <span id="s535">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: What was life like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: I spent three months in this recruiting camp and then they had to assign us to units and I already wanted to study medicine, so they assign me to the military hospital.</span> <span id="s538">And Tel ha Shomer, and there I served for 2, 24, 30 month, and left first to the University in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s539">They had no medical school, but you could start with biological sciences or other sciences and in the meantime I started inquiring about coming out here.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: To study?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Coming to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: It must have been a fairly exciting time to be in Israel, right after it became a state.</span> <span id="s543">A: Oh yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">02:34:29</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: I'm just trying to get a sense of what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Well, where I landed and where I was, I had a taste of the negative part because I had young kids hands and without legs and every time they wanted to get better so they can go back to the front and fight again.</span> <span id="s547">And, oh, that was a joyous and a sad condition that I stayed on.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Some of my dearest friends are still those that I made there.</span> <span id="s549">Some of them very prominent conditions now, positions.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: What do you think, after having grown up in Europe, went through the greatest difficulties or challenges in living in Israel or just the biggest adjustments you had to make?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well for 30 months I had the best of everything; food, clothing and anything we needed for 10, 11 hours of work in the hospital.</span> <span id="s552">I was supposed to make rounds two month in every specialty, every ward, but I started at the orthopedics and the paraplegics and I stayed there for 30 months.</span> <span id="s553">I couldn't leave that.</span> <span id="s554">I didn't want anything else.</span> <span id="s555">In the meantime the family came.</span> <span id="s556">Nineteen forty nine my sisters came and '51 my parents came, only one more brother who then stayed there until 1959, in Romania.</span> <span id="s557">I left Israel in 1952, November, when my sister had a daughter and I came to say good-bye to her and she asked me, when are we going to see you, and I said, I will come to your daughter's wedding.</span> <span id="s558">And I did.</span> <span id="s559">Many times I was there, but I came to the wedding too, and there I met my wife.</span> <span id="s560">It was in 1970, and have been happily married since, to another Rumanian girl, Malva.</span> <span id="s561">She's a physician and works for the Veterans Administration here and we have two sons, Ethan and Sofer, or Steven, and they are both at the University of Maryland.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">02:37:56</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: And your specialty?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: My specialty, I have been working for the Food and Drug Administration for the last 30 years with a specialty in botulism, a very poisonous bacteria when found in food and that's my specialty.</span> <span id="s565">The Food and Drug Administration has drugs and foods, I am in the food section, protecting the American consumers from any problems that might arise.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: When you came to the United States in 1952, was life difficult for you at all, what were your first impressions, was there any culture shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Culture shock is correct, because language was difficult and in my first year I had professors who allowed me, maybe to show off their ability to do so, to take exams in French.</span> <span id="s568">And classes that I took in history, government, they wanted to test I . . . maybe they didn't know what I wrote there, but I . . . first year was difficult.</span> <span id="s569">But then my advisor, who was a student of Weitzman's (ph), took me under her wing.</span> <span id="s570">And in another class, in history, my professor asked me to stay after class and he was amazed with, fascinated with my name.</span> <span id="s571">Because Washington had a friend by this name, Haym Salomon and when things got bad and troops deserted because they had no blankets and no shoes, Haym Salomon in Philadelphia went out to the Jewish community and collected $600,000 and bought blankets and shoes for Washington.</span> <span id="s572">I didn't know that, but this history professor kept me really in his palm.</span> <span id="s573">He couldn't believe that I would bring back to him all the situ . . . conditions of the Washington struggles in Washington armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">02:40:40</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: What school were you at?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I landed in Detroit and attended the Wayne State University.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Now did you . . . was all this organized before you came over here, did your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Oh yes, I had a brother here already in Detroit, Henry.</span> <span id="s579">Q: So that made the transition a little easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Easier, much easier.</span> <span id="s581">Although if I had the money I, if I could muster the money I would have gone back.</span> <span id="s582">It's just that I didn't have enough money to go back.</span> <span id="s583">I mean the period of adjustment was such that, overwhelming, could never do it, could never make it, so would be better to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Why was it so overwhelming?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Number one, to live on their back, was a question of they were, my brother was already married, he had two children and here I came in to a . . . not such abundance or prosperous situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Was the lifestyle different here?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Not the lifestyle, just the financial difficulties of staying here.</span> <span id="s588">As a student I was not allowed to work, so I was a burden to them for a year or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Were you . . . did you ever feel conflicted about leaving Israel after struggling so much to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: No, no, no, no, because in the hospital they all recommended me, all the big doctors, they recommended me because they saw in me a good doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">02:42:47</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: You never thought about moving back?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: No.</span> <span id="s594">I do more here than I would have done there.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: When you sort of look back at this earlier period in your life, 50 years ago. . . A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Do you think that you had certain qualities that kind of gave you the courage and the strength to get through bad times?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s598">And it's with me even today.</span> <span id="s599">I could spot danger and avoid it.</span> <span id="s600">I could take the last chance, complete avoidances going backwards so you measure the danger, you measure the difficulty, and chance and dare to overcome it, and you never stop growing or facing unknown situations that need solutions and such.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Was there something in your upbringing, in your family life that gave you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Maybe being the youngest is enough to overcome everybody's indulgence, everybody had pity on me, everybody did things for me and it makes you feel helpless, and it's nice when you are six years old, but when you're a grown up you want to prove your own worth.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: How important was religion to you throughout all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Tradition, not so much as religion.</span> <span id="s605">As a youngster you have no time or . . . for religion, although before and after Israel I became a scholar of archaeology and Bible and all the aspects of religion.</span> <span id="s606">For 12 years in Detroit I taught Hebrew.</span> <span id="s607">And as such, I became a certified Hebrew teacher, but I needed some scientific outlet for healing the world, for healing people through biology, microbiology or medicine, or other ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">02:46:11</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: That's really, that's quite a statement, that you needed some way to heal people.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s611">I saw People hurt and no one could help them.</span> <span id="s612">And mostly what I did in that camp where we received all the outsiders, the various origin people that needed direction and instruction, et cetera, somehow part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Are there other aspects to your life today, and the way you live it that you feel are a result of these early experiences and disruptions?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Well, I lost 10 years of my life and so, during that period, so I'd tried to compensate somehow.</span> <span id="s615">I need to extend life, my own, by exercise, by mental exercise.</span> <span id="s616">But in the meantime, and in Washington, as well as Detroit, I became totally immersed and engaged in organizations, like I was on the executive board of the Jewish National Fund, Zionist Organization of America, the Jewish Community Council.</span> <span id="s617">I was the first chairman of the Jewish Community Centers Coffeehouse and a co-founder of the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry.</span> <span id="s618">We learned to experience that it doesn't need an army of people to move projects and to move causes, but just a few good men, a few determined people and wherever there was a fire we ran to put it out.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">02:48:48</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Are there are certain images, when you look back that will always be with you, that still haunt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: In Iasi, that scene of the Stefanesti, the rabbi from the temple called Stefanesti, frail and scared, beaten to death.</span> <span id="s622">Or in Cyprus, various scenes when we crawled into the boat that took us away to Israel.</span> <span id="s623">And traveling throughout the land in Israel, getting to know every tree and every stone and studying the places.</span> <span id="s624">And when you get married and then start a family, your thoughts turn to the future and so we raised two boys.</span> <span id="s625">There is a reference in the bible to the generation of the desert, those Israelites that left Egypt and were not supposed to get into the promised land, and supposed to die in the desert and so we thought, I thought that I'm part of the generation of the desert, but I did come back and I'm alive and fulfilled reserved and happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">02:51:06</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Thank you for sharing.</span></p></body></html>
