are your earliest memories from Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: You know, I have absolutely no memories of Berlin.</span> <span id="s51">I – we left there in ’35.</span> <span id="s52">My father thought we would be safer in Vienna, in Austria, where he was from, he was Austrian.</span> <span id="s53">So he had us – he had my mother and me moved from Berlin to Prague, Czechoslovakia –</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: From Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: – for nine months, so that he might have a chance to sell the movie theaters, which he did, but he got very little for the movie theater.</span> <span id="s56">And then he came to Prague and we all went to Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: In ’35?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: In 30 – yeah, ’35.</span> <span id="s59">I’m not sure whether it was ’35 or ’36.</span> <span id="s60">He died in – he died in ’36, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s62">So, do you remember anything of the trip?</span> <span id="s63">You – you said you have no memories from Berlin, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, you know, I have none – no memories from – I – you know, it’s very diffi – I’ve written a book, and the book is up – up on the – on your desk upstairs.</span> <span id="s65">It’s very hard sometimes to distinguish what my experiences were, as against what my mother told me, what I’ve read, what I’ve – you know sometimes you pick up things and then you think you’ve lived them.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: That’s always [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah, it’s always that –</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: There is also the child’s mem-memories from the childhood –</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: – sometimes you have flashes, so like –</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: Yeah, the only thing I remember of my father are two really crazy things, and one was how he washed his hands, and how he dried his back.</span> <span id="s72">And this is – this is so weird and my mother couldn’t understand why I didn’t remember he – cause he said he, you know, he loved me so much and he was with me as much as he could be, but I remembered nothing.</span> <span id="s73">So, the – the only thing I remember of before we were in Vienna was my going into a store in Prague, Czechoslovakia and saying [speaks Czech here].</span> <span id="s74">That’s the only thing I remember.</span> <span id="s75">So whenever I meet somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: It actually means, can I have a quart of butter, or a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s78">My mother sent me to the store for some butter.</span> <span id="s79">And that’s the only thing I remember [speaks Czech]</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: So, did you learn any Czech, or that was the sentence that you learned to –</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Did I what?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you learn Czech?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: No, well that’s the – no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s84">We were only there nine months, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: But th – I remember that and I – I – it’s weird.</span> <span id="s87">So when I meet a Czech person, then I say that and they sort of look at me and say, you want some butter?</span> <span id="s88">And I say oh, you understood what I said [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s90">Do you know why he first send you to pra – to Prague before going – why not directly to Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: That I don’t know why – oh, I – yes, I do know, I do know.</span> <span id="s92">We stored – we had to store whatever f – we could bring out, which was some fur – lot of furniture, and – and personal papers.</span> <span id="s93">We had to store them in Prague.</span> <span id="s94">And I don’t know why we had to store them in Prague, but we did.</span> <span id="s95">And they were stored there all during the war, and when I was in England already, and my mother was too, she paid for storage, all during the war she kept up the payment through – through an aunt we had in – in Zurich, in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s96">We – the aunt forwarded the money to – to –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Oh, so it was still being stored in –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: It was still being stored.</span> <span id="s99">And in 1946, when my mother wrote to – to bring it over, they wrote back and said it’s not there anymore.</span> <span id="s100">The – you know, first it was the Nazis and then it was the Russians.</span> <span id="s101">And they had no idea what happened to it, so – there was a lot of – all our personal stuff was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: So did you have a big house back in Berlin with all –</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: No, we – well, it was a – I-I guess a big apartment.</span> <span id="s104">But it was personal papers, cause my – all my father’s stuff, I wish I could have had access to that, cause photographs and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: But you have no idea what happened to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: No idea.</span> <span id="s107">I wrote afterwards, I wrote to the company.</span> <span id="s108">Was a big – it’s a big moving company.</span> <span id="s109">I wrote to them and I researched it, I Googled it, I did everything I could, re – nobody – they said that from during the war years it was just totally cut off and the company now is a different comp – with the same name, but it’s a totally different company.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s111">So when you went home to Vienna, you didn’t bring – you didn’t bring your belongings with you there –</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: No, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: – so you had just [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: – we – we had very little in – in Vienna and certainly no money, because both parents were so young at the time.</span> <span id="s115">We had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And so what did your father do in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: He died.</span> <span id="s118">That was – sorry to laugh about that, but that’s pretty much –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Yeah – as – when he arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Well, it’s – you know, what happened was he apparently had some money on him when he was in Berlin.</span> <span id="s121">He had tried to sell the movie theaters.</span> <span id="s122">And he – there was a robber, he was going through the forest, and there was a robber, and he was shot very badly, and managed to get to the hospital in Berlin.</span> <span id="s123">[phone ringing] So he was shot – oh – he was shot in the forest, he got – he went to – he got – dragged himself to the hospital in – in Berlin.</span> <span id="s124">And so he had – when he came to Austria he was – still had some problems with that, and then he got peritonitis, which is a – you know, a burst appendix, a-and the two interacted and h-he died, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: So when he arrived he was already very sick and –</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, he really – he was a very strong man, he was very sporty.</span> <span id="s127">He was an amateur soccer player for Czechoslovakia, actually, and all the photographs from the newspaper and that were in – in Prague and – which were lost.</span> <span id="s128">But he was very strong man, and I don’t – he – appar – we-well, the story from my mother was that they – at the hospital, when he was hospitalized they told her, after a while, that she could come and pick him up the next day.</span> <span id="s129">He had – he had had tubes in his stomach.</span> <span id="s130">And so when she went the next day with his clothes, he wasn’t there, and they said he had died in the night.</span> <span id="s131">She went sort of crazy for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Do you remember that period, or only from your mother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: That is from what my mother told me.</span> <span id="s134">I – I know that I was not with her.</span> <span id="s135">She was wandering around Vienna in a daze, and she told me later that she actually went to the soup kitchens to eat.</span> <span id="s136">And sh – I was with some fr-friends that they had made, she played bridge a lot my mother, and these were bridge friends from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: From Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, they were from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: So you met – they met –</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: She met them in Vienna, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And your father was from Vienna, right?</span> <span id="s142">He wa – from aus –</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: He was actually from Brataslavia(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s145">Bratis – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Bratis –</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Bratislava?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: But he – his – his father was Viennese.</span> <span id="s151">Bratislava became –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: So – so you did have family in Vienna when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: So the –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: There was no –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: They had all left?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: There – I never met anybody, so – I think his father – I think his father, from what I hear, died in the concentration camp in ’42 or so.</span> <span id="s158">But I never – I – I don’t remember meeting him.</span> <span id="s159">[phone ringing] Yeah, i-it was many, many years later, in California that I, by accident, met another member of my father’s family, and actually a second cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Second –</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Second cousin, and I heard some history from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And he was from Bratislava too, or from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, he was Viennese, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s165">So you did learn about the family from –</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Well, this person wrote a biography, and in fact, I was just reading through it, I was trying to find something about my father.</span> <span id="s167">But it’s not a lot.</span> <span id="s168">What he said was that there was a split in the family between those that had some money, and those that didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s169">The ones that didn’t have money were sort of artists.</span> <span id="s170">Artists kind of were black sheep of the family, and he would b – he belonged to the black sheep of the family, but I-I didn’t learn anything very much [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: But he did remember your father?</span> <span id="s172">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So your father died soon after –</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: He died – right, he died in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: In 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: And left my mother and me without any resources, because they – there was no mon – had no money, so my mother had to – my mother was a perfectionist, and whatever she did, she did perfectly.</span> <span id="s178">So she learned how to make leather flowers, and she bought a – the equipment for it and then she made the flowers and went up and down stairs in Vienna trying to sell it.</span> <span id="s179">And I think this was the – this – well, I’ll get onto that later on.</span> <span id="s180">Because of the ec – our economic conditions was – helped to put me on the Kindertransport, because they tried to get chil – people – children out from – well, both those that were well connected and those that were in need.</span> <span id="s181">So, I guess [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: And where did you live in Vienna?</span> <span id="s183">With the family friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: We lived eve – no, we lived in an apartment right in – in the first [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s185">And I went to school, to the Volksschule.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So, did you rent an apartment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Yeah, I ki – I – I don’t know how much help my mother got from these friends, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s188">You know, there are all these questions that I wish I would have asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: My mother lived long enough, to 93, and she did tell me, I mean, I – I know a lot of it, but there, the questions like this –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Yeah, you never asked.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: – I don’t know where did the money come from, that she – but – but knowing my mother, she probably worked night and day and made enough money, I don’t know, made enough money to pay for the apartment.</span> <span id="s193">But it was not for very long, cause you know, ’36, I was [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So, what do you remember from Vienna?</span> <span id="s195">You say you went to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yes, I [coughing] excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: The things I remember from Vienna are not happy memories.</span> <span id="s199">They’re probably the worst memories I have of the war.</span> <span id="s200">And that’s why it’s so ironic that my father said we should go to Vienna because it’ll be safer in Vienna, because as far as I’m concerned, if anything could have been worse than Germany, it was Austria.</span> <span id="s201">I’m sure you’ve heard that a lot.</span> <span id="s202">My memories are of people – well, of ki – Kristallnacht, of people marching in the streets, with the boots, and the heil Hitlers, and what have you –</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Yeah, we’ll get –</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Yeah, we’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: We need first, like what would you remember before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s206">Do yo – do you – do you have any good memories, like any memories?</span> <span id="s207">Wha – you started going to school, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: I had a – I have all my report cards and I remember one of the teachers who had to tell me that I couldn’t go back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Thirty – I think I went until early ’38.</span> <span id="s211">And I – I’ve tried to research that, I wrote to the school, and I – I have the report cards and I have her name.</span> <span id="s212">And I’ve asked people to – when they go to Vienna to see if they can find her name.</span> <span id="s213">But she was very, very nice, and she was – she had tears in her eyes, I remember that, she had tears in her eyes when she told me I couldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s214">And I remember being stoned – having stones thrown at me in Vienna.</span> <span id="s215">A-And I have – I have no good memories of Vienna whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did you have any friends at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: I had one friend called Litzie(ph) Barotti(ph), and she came over to England too but I – not on the Kindertransport I don’t think.</span> <span id="s218">I’d lost touch with her once she moved to – to England.</span> <span id="s219">But otherwise I have –</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: – I have no memories, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s222">Or fortunately.</span> <span id="s223">I think it’s probably fortunately.</span> <span id="s224">And I – oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Go ahe –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No, I was going to say one of the memories I have is – this was Kristallnacht, but you don’t want to come to that yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Oh, I first wanted to learn more about – cause you did spend like – it was two years, you came in ’36 and there was ’38, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I think yeah – I think probably my lack of memory there is due to the fact that we moved from Berlin to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s229">This is, you know, as a six year old child, or a seven year old child at that time.</span> <span id="s230">And then my father died, and then, you know, we were – I was pretty much alone in Vienna cause my mother went sort of crazy for a while.</span> <span id="s231">And I think, you know, psychologically, if I probably went under hypnosis it would come back, but it could well be that I’ve just – as a child it was too much.</span> <span id="s232">And I was very protective of my mother, so I subdued any fears and feelings that I had that were – that were probably pretty ghastly.</span> <span id="s233">I didn’t want to worry my mother anymore, because I knew she was, you know, very –</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So she had a breakdown –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I think it was a – probably a breakdown, yes, she just – I think it was three days that she was gone, just wandering around Vienna, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: And you were all by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I was with these friends of hers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: What about your parents, were – were they religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: They were not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: They were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: They were like – yes, Jewish, but they were like most German Jews, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Would they go to the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: – they considered themselves German first, and then Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Yeah, I – I think we had Christmas trees –</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: – and I – I never – I don’t ever remember going to temple.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s251">So now let’s go to the Kristallnacht and your memories from –</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Okay, my memories of that –</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Was that the first time that you experienced the anti-Semitism, or was it before that that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Well, the – at school I wa – when this – this [phone ringing] Cut it out.</span> <span id="s255">It’s okay.</span> <span id="s256">When I was being – when I had stones thrown at me, I don’t know now whether I realized that that was anti-Semitism, that it was because I was Jewish, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s257">I just – I was very, very feisty, very – and I would throw stones back.</span> <span id="s258">And I was – you know, I defended myself.</span> <span id="s259">I was always very independent, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Was it other children at school were –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: There weren’t many – as far as I remember, there were only – in my class, I think there were three of us, and I do remember having to sit at the back of the class with two or three rows e-empty between us and then the non-Jewish children were at the front.</span> <span id="s262">Now again, I don’t – I can’t honestly say that I knew why I was there, why I was in the back.</span> <span id="s263">I obviously knew there was something wrong with me, oh – I was having to sit at the back, but that it was anti-Semitism, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s264">It’s very – I wish I could sort that out in my mind, whether I knew or not, but it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Do you remember when you first realized that you were being discriminated because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Probably in England, which is interesting.</span> <span id="s267">Where I was being called German Jewish refugee, and then I – oh, how I hated those – being called a German Jewish refugee.</span> <span id="s268">But I – I can’t be honest with that and say yes, I remember that, I – I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So Kristallnacht, the memories –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Okay, the memories of that, what really stands out is I – I ha – must have had some friends that I played with at the central synagogue in Vienna.</span> <span id="s271">It was the big one, apparently.</span> <span id="s272">We played inside or just outside and Kristallnacht, I remember coming out of the temple, and seeing on either side of the temple were Nazis in uniform with their guns.</span> <span id="s273">I came out, and there was a cobblestone – all cobblestones in front of the synagogue, and there were the old people on their knees, scrubbing with toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s274">And I remember kickings to go faster, a-and – and people laughing.</span> <span id="s275">I remember people laughing.</span> <span id="s276">You know [indecipherable] sort of like if you saw it on the film they were just sort of like, you know, pieces of – of memory that – th-that are photographic in my mind.</span> <span id="s277">You know, th-the boots, the laughing of the – the people there, the kicks that they got, and the cobblestones with – with toothbrushes.</span> <span id="s278">And then I remember the – the fear I had of going home to the apartment and not knowing whether I could get in or not, because apartments and houses were being sealed, they had seals on them, and if they had seals on them that means you couldn’t go in any more.</span> <span id="s279">And I remember that fear, am-am-am – am I going to be able to get in or not?</span> <span id="s280">And of course all the – the glass, and seeing all the – the damage.</span> <span id="s281">And the people, the friends that my mother had, that she used to play bridge with, and that really helped us during this time, that took me in.</span> <span id="s282">They had a – a tie shop, men’s tie shop at the bottom of the building, of the apartment building, and na – seeing all of that glass and broken, and I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Do you remember their names, the people who ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Klempner(ph), yes, Polly and Julius Klempner(ph), uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Did they have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: They had children that they had a boy and a girl who were probably – I was eight, 18 – who were probably 12 years older than I was.</span> <span id="s287">And – and I – we kept in contact, they also came to England and we ke – did keep in contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s289">So you went home, was it – did you manage to get in to the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes, our place was not – as far as I remember, was n-not locked – sealed.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And was your mother home?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: And – yes.</span> <span id="s293">I don’t ever remember my mother talking with me about what was going on.</span> <span id="s294">I-I think she was probably in such a psychological turmoil that I don’t know whether she was even able to talk about it.</span> <span id="s295">She did play bridge, so she must have had – it’s very confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: So you did not understand what was going on, or did you learn from other –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I don’t remember that it was a religious thing that was going on.</span> <span id="s298">I just remember turmoil, you know, dreadful turmoil.</span> <span id="s299">But because we were not religious, and I never went to temple, I don’t know if – how I probably was able to relate that to religion, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s300">And I never actually had to wear the Star of David.</span> <span id="s301">I never wore it.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: And – so by that time, were you already expelled from school, or was it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The last report card I had, where it said that I had been terminated was the s – the spring of 1938, was like May ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And were you given reasons why you were being expelled?</span> <span id="s305">Why – why you couldn’t come back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: I’m sorry to be so vague, but I – I – you know, I – I – I must have asked questions and I must have been given some answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: But I – I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s309">I remember being very sad that I couldn’t go to school any more, but I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Why did you feel sad, cause –</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Because I wanted to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Because you liked studying, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah, well, going to school, I guess, with other children [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Yeah, so what happened then?</span> <span id="s315">You couldn’t go to school any more, what – what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Well, that was spring of ’38, and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s317">I know I – I was in the store, this – this tie shop down below, with these friends of ours.</span> <span id="s318">I know I was in the store a lot.</span> <span id="s319">So I think I probably – that’s how I spent my days, with them, while my mother was trying to sell her leather flowers.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: And did she manage to sell –</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yeah, she – she became, I gather, I say she was a perfectionist, she became really good at that.</span> <span id="s322">And she took that hobby, by then, to England with her and continued making leather flowers over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And do you remember your mother – when did the decision come up to – of you leaving?</span> <span id="s324">Do you – do you remember when it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: De-Decision to?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: For you to leave Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s328">Well, that – that came – again, I was playing around the temple.</span> <span id="s329">I came out of the temple and saw a long line of adults and children.</span> <span id="s330">They were lined up and they were slowly moving forward to a desk.</span> <span id="s331">And I joined the line, but I had no idea why I was joining.</span> <span id="s332">And when I got to the front of the line, I signed something.</span> <span id="s333">And three or four days later, my mother got a – a letter from this group, whatever they were, as-asking –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: [indecipherable] So were – you were standing in a line and you signed something.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Standing in the line – yeah, and my moth – my mother got this letter from this committee, refugee committee, I – I guess it was.</span> <span id="s336">A-And she went sort of crazy again, cause she turned to me and said, what are the – what have you done?</span> <span id="s337">And I said, ah – I signed something.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: So you just signed [indecipherable] you had no idea what you signed?</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And a – it – no i – no idea.</span> <span id="s340">And it turns out, as I ask around, that I appear to be the only person who signed themselves up for the transport.</span> <span id="s341">So my mother, having just lost my father, and – and having no means of income except her, you know, what she was doing, the flowers, apparently had to make up her mind within, I think it was 13 days, 12 days, whether to send me on a Kindertransport or not.</span> <span id="s342">And I’m an only child, so she must have gone through hell making that decision.</span> <span id="s343">Cause she was in a foreign country to her, you know, Austria was not her – her country.</span> <span id="s344">And so I now understand why she was a very nervous person, I – I un –understand so much now of why she was who she was because of what she went through.</span> <span id="s345">And I wish I would have, you know, I really wish I would have understood that better while she was alive.</span> <span id="s346">But anyway, she did make the decision to send me, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Do you remember, did you talk to her, did you have conversations about it, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Again, I was trying to protect my mother, and I remember saying – I remember pretending to be very excited about this.</span> <span id="s349">I’m going to – I’m gonna travel, I’m going over to England and it’ll be fine because then you will come and everything’ll be fine.</span> <span id="s350">I was just trying to cover up.</span> <span id="s351">I think what I did was I took my fa – tried to take my father’s role.</span> <span id="s352">And – and anyway, so she had s – I think it was12 days to – to get everything ready for me, so she had to go out and buy clothes for me, and sew in nametags onto everything.</span> <span id="s353">And I, you know, I don’t know whether she ever realized that she might not see me again.</span> <span id="s354">I don’t think I realized that.</span> <span id="s355">I don’t think that entered my thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Of course you don’t think that.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: No.</span> <span id="s358">So that’s how I did, I signed myself up for the Kindertransport.</span> <span id="s359">And actually, in the book that I wrote, I – I – I wrote that I really unconsciously, subconsciously saved both our lives, because by my going over there, I was able to also get the Quaker family to finally get her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So the day came for you to leave, do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Yes, I remember that.</span> <span id="s362">I remember the night, I remember going to the – to the station, where I come –</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: What were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: What were your thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Of protecting my mother.</span> <span id="s367">So I was the, you know, that eight year old child sort of laughing and smiling, and don’t worry about it, I mean, it’ll be fine.</span> <span id="s368">Everybody was crying – or, a lot of people were crying around me.</span> <span id="s369">The – the families, the parents and the children, and here was this brave little kid, suppressing everything, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Did your mother cry?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s372">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s373">And quite honestly, we never really talked about it.</span> <span id="s374">You know, there was so much that wasn’t talked about.</span> <span id="s375">One of the things was my father’s death.</span> <span id="s376">It’s – my mother never, ever talked about my father afterwards, after he – he died, and nobody explained to me what happened to him.</span> <span id="s377">But in my protective mode, I removed everything from the apartment that could possibly remind my mother of my father, and I hid it somewhere.</span> <span id="s378">And it was – I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: When did you leave Vienna?</span> <span id="s380">What – what day was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: December 10th, ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: December 10th.</span> <span id="s383">And the train was heading to – where did it go?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Well, a lot of this was from research afterwards –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: – th-the route.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: Did you know where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: All I we – her – knew is I was going to engla – England.</span> <span id="s389">And again, my memory is, I didn’t know anybody there on the train.</span> <span id="s390">And I was alone, and being an only child – there were several people who had brothers, or siblings on the train, or friends.</span> <span id="s391">But I was – I was alone and I remember the – th-the fear.</span> <span id="s392">Every time we stopped there was tremendous fear because these Nazis would come on board and – and go through luggage, the little luggage that we had, and would throw things around and would take stuff, like dolls and bears and things, you know, from the children.</span> <span id="s393">I remember – I just remember my internal fears there.</span> <span id="s394">[indecipherable] And then really – and I remember crossing into Holland like you know, I read now the stories, how everybody – for everybody going into Holland was just such a relief, and ho-how nice the people were there, by contrast, so – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Is that true?</span> <span id="s396">Is that how you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s398">Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s399">I have a wonderful feeling for Dutch people, although I know that there were a lot of Dutch who also were not that nice.</span> <span id="s400">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And your arrival in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: My arrival in England was freezing cold, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: It was December.</span> <span id="s404">It was –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Well, it was apparently the coldest – the coldest winter in living memory in – in – in eng – in England.</span> <span id="s406">It was snowing and we went to this place that had some cabins, Dovercourt.</span> <span id="s407">But it was snowing and the snow was coming inside the building and it was freezing cold, but we were all very happy, and we were – everybody was – was happy t-to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: And did you have parents – foster parents already, or – cause I know that some people went to the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Well, th – it was a huge dining room, that had in one corner of it there was an area where we could play darts, we could play games, table tennis and darts.</span> <span id="s410">Another corner was where people gathered to learn English.</span> <span id="s411">Then there was somewhere where we could write letters to our parents, or postcards.</span> <span id="s412">And then there was this big dining area.</span> <span id="s413">And in the dining area, every few days, I don’t know, or every once a week or whenever it was, people would come and stare at us, and some children would be taken out, would be picked out.</span> <span id="s414">And I have a memory there of thinking, why is nobody picking me out?</span> <span id="s415">Cause I was still sitting there and then children were sort of being taken away.</span> <span id="s416">Why is nobody picking me out?</span> <span id="s417">And when I did my research – I thought it was – I thought I’d been there for ages.</span> <span id="s418">When I did my research I was actually there for nine days, I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Dovercourt, Harwich, in England.</span> <span id="s421">It was a – a family holiday camp that had been converted to receive the children and be the reception area.</span> <span id="s422">And then finally some –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did you write to your mother from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: I did, and I have – I have my letters.</span> <span id="s425">And th-that’s amazing, how my mother saved those.</span> <span id="s426">I wish I had the lett – I do have a few letters from my mother too, not too many, but their mostly – I have a pack like this of my letters to her.</span> <span id="s427">And that is so interesting, because it shows the progression of the language.</span> <span id="s428">How, you know, all German at first, and then less and less German and then no German, and – and I was, I guess, having a good time in England, and I wrote very little about it.</span> <span id="s429">I was thinking – you know, as I was reading them I was thinking, oh my goodness, my mother probably wanted all this information, and I just wrote three or four lines, you know, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: So you spent nine days at the child shelter?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: And then I was taken by a Quaker family up to York, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: So it was one of those families who came to pick children [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yeah, somebody came on their behalf from the Quaker meeting in York.</span> <span id="s436">They picked me up, they – and I went by train up to – to York, and it was just before Christmas.</span> <span id="s437">And I got there and it was a – a – I-I was so lucky, a wonderful family with – it was a couple, Quaker couple –</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: And what are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Jessie(ph) and Walter Robson.</span> <span id="s440">And they had no children, and so they sort of treated me as their own child.</span> <span id="s441">And next door to them was – Jessie’s(ph) mother lived next door, Jessie’s(ph) mother and father lived next door on one side, and then the other side was Jessie’s(ph) sister.</span> <span id="s442">So it was like a family compound almost, and [inaudible] And they, you know, there were two, four – four or five cousins there.</span> <span id="s443">There were – four of them I’m still in touch with.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did they speak any German?</span> <span id="s445">How did you communicate?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: So my mother arrived – every day I would – I would badger my foster parents to get my mother – to bring my mother over.</span> <span id="s447">And I would badger and I would badger and I would badger.</span> <span id="s448">And eventually the Quaker meeting in that area, in York, managed to get her a domestic servant permit, and so she got out three weeks before the war started.</span> <span id="s449">And th – which was nine months after I had arrived.</span> <span id="s450">And when she came, I couldn’t – I couldn’t speak any German, she couldn’t speak any English and we couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s451">So she –</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: That was fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: That was fast, nine months?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yeah, well I – you know, I didn’t hear any German around me, it was all English.</span> <span id="s456">And so she got a dictionary, and she followed me around with this dicti – when she finally left her job down s – south of England, she came up north, she followed me around with this dictionary.</span> <span id="s457">She used it so much that it became all loose-leaved.</span> <span id="s458">And after she died, which was just 14 years ago, my – we were going through her things and my son, who is the sentimental child o-of the three of them, said he – oh, he want – that’s – he wants that dictionary, and it meant a lot to him, so he had it rebound, and he has it, so that was very –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So, how did you learn engl – did you go to school there?</span> <span id="s460">Did you start going to school there immediately, in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: Did I go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes, I went to a – was sort of an unusual place, it was – I don’t know whether you’ve heard of Rowntree’s Chocolates, have you?</span> <span id="s464">Okay.</span> <span id="s465">It’s now been taken over by Cadbury’s, but there was a chocolate cocoa – cocoa chocolate factory in York, and it was started by Joseph Rowntree, and he was a very well-known Quaker, who started the first village – wh-what do you call it, new – a new village.</span> <span id="s466">He had a – he had such a social conscience that he was able to build a – a village which actually became a small city, one of the first – what do you call – designed cities that kept wi – which – I’m getting fuzzy here.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: So that’s where you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yeah, I went to that – to the – it was a local community school, where I really became the – for the first time conscious of anti-Semitism, which is interesting, because there were a lot of English people who really resented, I guess, us coming over, because they regarded us as German, and forgetting that we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s469">And you know, I had names thrown at me, and again I hi – you know, I fi –</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: What kind of names?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Like German Jew.</span> <span id="s472">German – just things like that, which was sort of hurtful.</span> <span id="s473">And then I had a – learning English, I had a teacher who – she was very nice, she thought she was doing the right thing, but she would make me stand up and say baker’s man.</span> <span id="s474">Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker’s man, bake me a cake as fast as you can, right?</span> <span id="s475">And she would have me stand up and recite this, and I would always say, pat a cake, pat a cake, becker’s(ph) man, because that was the German pronunciation of it, and the class would just roar with laughter, right?</span> <span id="s476">So she would make me repeat it.</span> <span id="s477">So I-I be – you probably realize by now the very stubborn nature, feisty nature.</span> <span id="s478">The more she made me repeat the thing, the more I would say becker’s(ph) man, I just refused to say baker’s man.</span> <span id="s479">And it was just, you know, funny memories like that.</span> <span id="s480">And then I had somebody who called me a guy – a young boy, and at the time, of course, what was I, nine, probably – who called me German Jewish refugee.</span> <span id="s481">Those were probably the worst words anybody could call me, for some reason.</span> <span id="s482">It just made me – made me so mad.</span> <span id="s483">And so he – so I got into a fight with him.</span> <span id="s484">And we came out onto the playground, and we fought, we wrestled, and all the girls were supporting me, the boys were supporting him.</span> <span id="s485">And I ended up sort of winning this thing.</span> <span id="s486">And years and years later I met this guy at the theater.</span> <span id="s487">I was sitting next to him, and we talked about it, and we were just laughing our heads off.</span> <span id="s488">Funny memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So did you make friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I did, yes.</span> <span id="s491">I made friends there, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s492">And then in ’42, 1942 – so I went to this school for three, four years – 1942, by which time my mother again through working very, very hard and never, never taking a bus, she walked wherever she could go, to save her money, I had the opportunity to go to a Quaker boarding school.</span> <span id="s493">And again, it was with a scholarship from the Quakers and my mother paid so much too.</span> <span id="s494">So I had five wonderful years at a Quaker boarding school.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: And so, while your mother still was in England, what was she writing to you?</span> <span id="s496">Do you remember getting letters from her, and what were the news from Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I don’t have her – well, my mother then moved, cause she was all alone in – in this strange country, she moved back to Germany, to her mother’s house, to Aachen.</span> <span id="s498">And from then for th – she left from there, when she finally got her domestic servant permit, she left from her mother’s house, and she tried to get her mother out too, because we had a – my aunt – my – my great aunt, I guess it is, my mother’s – my mother’s aunt in Switzerland could have gotten my grandmother out, but she said she – my grandmother wouldn’t move cause she said she was too old, that nobody would hurt her, her age, and she was 66 at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Amanda Meyer.</span> <span id="s501">And I have all this in the book, so later on [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s502">So she left from – from a – my mother left from Aachen without her mother, leaving her mother there.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: And when she arrived in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: She arrived in England, she had to go to a – a farm in the south of England.</span> <span id="s505">And my mother, of course, had lived all her life in the big city, had never been near the – near a farm, was terrified of animals, the cows.</span> <span id="s506">And these people had saved up all their dirty linen and everything.</span> <span id="s507">And – and she had to go into the – into the servants’ quarters and do the cooking and the washing, you know, with the washing – with the washing board, this way?</span> <span id="s508">And she had to spend any free – they were out – way out in the country, and any free time that she had – she had – was out in the fields with the animals, and she was terrified.</span> <span id="s509">She had such a bad time there, that she wanted to go back to Germany, actually.</span> <span id="s510">She wanted to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s511">Luckily, she couldn’t go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you meet her when she arrived in England?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, I didn’t, no, I was up north and she was down south.</span> <span id="s514">So I don’t know how we communicated.</span> <span id="s515">I guess we wrote letters.</span> <span id="s516">But th – it wasn’t for very long, cause she was really unhappy there, and the people really mistreated her.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: So what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: And they were – I think they were very angry, cause my mother was probably dressed better than they were, and she was a servant, you know, and – and anyway, the – my Quaker parents there, foster parents, were – realized what was happening, so they – the – the meeting that they were with, it’s called a meeting, Quaker meeting, they managed to get her up to York, and be a – a house – housekeeper, I think it was.</span> <span id="s519">Housekeeper, where she kept house for a widower who had a child, a boy.</span> <span id="s520">And she – they loved her there, she was doing such a good job.</span> <span id="s521">And I would visit from my place to hers, occasionally.</span> <span id="s522">And I remember, another one of these blurbs that I remember, going in there and seeing this boy on my mother’s knee, she was caring for him.</span> <span id="s523">And I was so mad.</span> <span id="s524">What was he doing on her knee?</span> <span id="s525">I remember that, so jealous.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What were your foster parents like?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: They were wer – they were very simple, wonderful people, who – he – he was a conscientious objector.</span> <span id="s528">And again, the family was sort of ostracized by the people in the village around them.</span> <span id="s529">First of all because they – he was a conscientious objector during wartime, and then because they took me in, and they – they didn’t like – like that.</span> <span id="s530">So they – they were very strong people, who did what they believed.</span> <span id="s531">And they didn’t try and convert me, or do anything, but I – they invited me to come with them to the Quaker meetings, and I did do that occasionally.</span> <span id="s532">And the family – she treated me like one of the family, and it was – I was very fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: And the wider family also accepted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Not so much Walter’s family, because Walter’s brother was in the air force, I think it was, not the army, he was in the air force, and he became a prisoner of war of the Japanese, and was very mistreated.</span> <span id="s535">So they, you know, they were angry at Walter for being a conscientious objector, and of course everything that came with Walter, which was me.</span> <span id="s536">But Jessie’s(ph) family, certainly, yes.</span> <span id="s537">All her family accepted me.</span> <span id="s538">I – I guess I just figured I was one of the family.</span> <span id="s539">And then when my mother came over, she lived with us for quite a while.</span> <span id="s540">And she took on a new inco – wa-way of making income, she studied hairdressing with a French hairdresser in town.</span> <span id="s541">And in her way, she beca – became better than he was, so people wanted her, not him.</span> <span id="s542">So, I – actually, it was fine with him, he – he didn’t mind, as long as she was getting lots of customers.</span> <span id="s543">And then one day my mother thought that maybe she could do this on her own and not be working for him.</span> <span id="s544">So I think she gave indication that she may leave, and he didn’t want her to leave.</span> <span id="s545">So he said he would do anything she should stay there.</span> <span id="s546">So she said, okay, I’ll stay if you provide me with cigarettes.</span> <span id="s547">Cause at this time cigarettes were – were rationed.</span> <span id="s548">And he actually went out and kept her supplied with – she hadn’t smoked before she came to England, but it’s a habit she started, she started chain-smoking.</span> <span id="s549">And he kept her supplied with cigarettes.</span> <span id="s550">And eventually she had her own business, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So how was the relationship between – cause you had – when your mother arrived, you had your own mother in town and you had your foster parents.</span> <span id="s552">How did you feel?</span> <span id="s553">Was there – was it conflicting for –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: I – I don’t th – I don’t reme – remember any struggle between the two of them for – for me.</span> <span id="s555">My mother was too busy, you know, working.</span> <span id="s556">And she did everything she could to pay back what they were giving to – she would stay up all night to make – she would do embroidery.</span> <span id="s557">Embroider pillow – cushion covers for birthdays and Christmas and that sort of thing for the family.</span> <span id="s558">And so – I mean, actually my foster mother died in my mother’s arms.</span> <span id="s559">So it was – they were – they became very close, they became best friends almost.</span> <span id="s560">It was a – it’s – that’s sort of a very nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: That is a very nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Really, it – yeah, it – it’s a very nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: So how long did you stay with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: I was at the s – Quaker boarding school til ’47.</span> <span id="s565">I think it was about til f – I would come home for holidays, vacations, til about fi – til the end of the war, maybe.</span> <span id="s566">Til ’45, and then my mother got her own place, and then we lived in the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: In York?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: In York.</span> <span id="s569">[indecipherable] That was – that’s amazing, because that place is now being turned into a – a – a hotel.</span> <span id="s570">The people who bought my mother’s house, bought the two houses on either side, it was sort of terraced housing, and broke through, and it’s now a fairly big hotel.</span> <span id="s571">And I Googled it and I saw our bedroom, which has been converted into a – I mean, it was just – it was an out of body experience.</span> <span id="s572">I can see it, I can get it any time.</span> <span id="s573">I Google it and our bedroom is there, now converted into – it’s strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: Do you remember how the war ended in –</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: How it ended, yes, I remember Churchill’s speech, hearing it on the radio.</span> <span id="s576">I was actually at boarding school.</span> <span id="s577">My birthday is on V-E Day, which is – you know what V-E Day is, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Maybe that’s why I’ve been so lucky, cause I was born on Mother’s day and my birthday was V-E Day.</span> <span id="s580">Yeah, I – I remember that, I remember all the celebrations, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: And what about your relatives in Berlin?</span> <span id="s582">It was your mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: My mother’s mother died in theres – no, not in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s584">She was in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s585">I’m – I again have a package of letters from my grandmother, on –</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: To your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: To my mother.</span> <span id="s588">On paper that is like tissue paper almost, you know, it’s – it’s airmail, and it’s in the old German handwriting.</span> <span id="s589">I can read it.</span> <span id="s590">My mother never read it, ne-never read any of her letters, she wasn’t able to.</span> <span id="s591">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: She couldn’t read the letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: She couldn’t get herself to read anything from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s594">She had all this guilt about leaving her there, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: So, would you read the letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: I have read – yeah, I have gone through them.</span> <span id="s597">I can read most of it, not all of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: But did you read them at the time when you were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: No, no, I read them after – my mother, you know, after she died, I – I got all this stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: So you didn’t even know what was going on?</span> <span id="s601">At the time when she was writing, your mother was not reading them?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Well, the last letter was when she had gone to an old age home.</span> <span id="s603">They had gathered all the old people – old?</span> <span id="s604">She was 66.</span> <span id="s605">They had gathered all the elderly people, and the last letters from there, that she was there, and she was happy, and everything was fine, I mean, there’s a lot of cover up.</span> <span id="s606">And how were we, and she hoped we’d be fine.</span> <span id="s607">And they were going on a journey, they were going to be taken somewhere else, which was to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s608">And then from Theresienstadt, again from my research, I understand she was sent to Minsk, and died there at Minsk.</span> <span id="s609">And I have a couple of different reports.</span> <span id="s610">One is that she was in a – one of the cattle cars, and they were shunted aside, I guess left there, and the people just died of starvation and – and cold.</span> <span id="s611">The other was that she went to the ghetto in Minsk, and that again there was starvation [inaudible].</span> <span id="s612">And I ne – I never told my – I never told my mother.</span> <span id="s613">I had done some research before she died, but she was under the impression she d – her mother died in Theresienstadt, which was not quite as bad as some of the other places.</span> <span id="s614">And I never told her anything about Minsk.</span> <span id="s615">And it turns out that my husband’s grandmother was also in Theresienstadt at the same time as my grandmother.</span> <span id="s616">So we keep saying, I wonder if they ever met each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s618">So, I just want to clear something.</span> <span id="s619">So your mother was re – she was not reading the letters as they were being sent, or you’re saying she did not want to read them after the war?</span> <span id="s620">Did you know what was going on with your grandmother when the wa-war was still going on?</span> <span id="s621">Do you remember your mother talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: I certainly did not know what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: – no memory of ever knowing what – what was happening to my grandmother, until after the war, I had no idea.</span> <span id="s625">And I – I don’t think my mother knew, either.</span> <span id="s626">And I don’t think – I don’t think she read her letters, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s627">She always told me that she had these bundle of letters, that she can’t get herself to read them.</span> <span id="s628">Now, whether it was re-read, that’s possible too, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s629">But my mother – you know, I told you that she didn’t deal with my father’s death, she wasn’t able to talk about that, she was never able to talk about her – her mother, and it was just a – a series of suppressions that she had.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Were there ar – other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Oh, all my grandmother’s – there were – there were – how many of them were there?</span> <span id="s632">Seven.</span> <span id="s633">Seven siblings.</span> <span id="s634">One came to America, to San Francis – to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s635">And her f – that family lived there and I’m in touch with the cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: What’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: That was Feidelberg(ph), the Feidelbergs(ph).</span> <span id="s638">He survived.</span> <span id="s639">Four of the sisters died in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s640">Two of the children of those sisters died.</span> <span id="s641">One was a really, really young, just four or five years old, died.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: And you knew them all from Berlin?</span> <span id="s643">Do you remember any of them?</span> <span id="s644">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: I don’t really – I don’t really remember them, no.</span> <span id="s646">My mother knew them and she talked about them very often, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: And so you learned all that after war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Yes, mm-hm, yeah, one of the – one of the brothers was a pediatrician in Berlin, and he was the one actually, who brought me into the world.</span> <span id="s649">And he – he wa – he became quite a well-known doctor in Berlin, and the Nazis said he could stay, he didn’t have to leave, because one of the – one of them had –</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: What was his name?</span> <span id="s651">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: What was his name?</span> <span id="s653">Was actually the husband, so it wasn’t – the husband of one of the sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: It’s in my book.</span> <span id="s656">Sometimes I have to go to my book to remember names.</span> <span id="s657">One of the Nazis had a child that was very sick, so they came to him to help the child.</span> <span id="s658">And the child was so sick that the uncle did not want to work on him, because he knew that if the child died, he would be blamed for it.</span> <span id="s659">So he said he didn’t want to take it on, the child was sick.</span> <span id="s660">So, by doing that, they – of course they sent him to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s661">That was –</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: So – and how did you end up in U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: My mother’s sister and fr – my cousins and th-the family, four of them, came to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s666">They first went to England and then to San Francisco, at a time when my mother came over, about the same time.</span> <span id="s667">And they had for years said that I should come over and visit.</span> <span id="s668">Now, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Sorry, when was that, when did they leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: When did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Which year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: That they went over?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Probably 40 si – from England they left probably ’47.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s679">I – it was after the war.</span> <span id="s680">After the war.</span> <span id="s681">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Okay, so, they – they sponsored you?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: So yeah, they kept asking me to come over and visit with them.</span> <span id="s684">And I just – I was working at the time in – in London, at the American Chamber of Commerce.</span> <span id="s685">And I had, you know, I’d never – I didn’t have enough money saved up.</span> <span id="s686">Then finally I decided okay, I was going to go.</span> <span id="s687">So I worked in a coffee shop at night and saved up the money for the travel, an-and came over in 1960.</span> <span id="s688">And my husband’s sister, and my cousin were friends and played bridge together.</span> <span id="s689">And when I came over, my cousin said to – said to his sister, could you get your brother to take her around San Francisco in the evening or something, and show her San Francisco?</span> <span id="s690">Well, he – we were both engaged at the time.</span> <span id="s691">I was engaged to a German, and he was engaged to a Japanese woman, so neither of us wanted to go on a blind date.</span> <span id="s692">Anyway, we did go, and we kept going.</span> <span id="s693">So it’s our 50th wedding anniversary this year.</span> <span id="s694">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Oh, congratulations.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A:
