<span id="s25">My father was, I told you already in the -- working in a restaurant and -- but he had no -- not much education.</span> <span id="s26">He started to study the Dutch language and arithmetic here in Holland, in The Hague, whe --</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Why did he cut -- why did he leave Indonesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Well, he was adopted and his foster parents, you call his foster parents hi -- brought him here in Holland.</span> <span id="s29">And I was told that my foster grandmother owned a restaurant, but she couldn’t quite get along with the

about did you have any religious training when you were a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: No, we’d -- at my mother’s -- we prayed before dinner, but one day we -- we stopped doing that.</span> <span id="s41">We didn’t know what to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Though your parents had s -- a divorce, would you say that you had a close relationship to both parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, closer to my father than to my mother because there was Mima Saina, the nanny, and I considered her as my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Tell me a little bit about Mima Saina and her background and how she came.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well, I think she came shortly before I was born, from Indonesia, and started to work for my parents, and -- as a nanny for

<p><span id="s48">A: She was a young woman, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s49">And she couldn’t speak the Dutch language, so we -- as a boy we -- I t-talked Malayan language with her, but I forgot all about it -- well, not everything, but most of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: So, as you say, growing up in your home you spoke two languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes, my father talked Dutch to us, though his Dutch was not the best Dutch that exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And where did you first go to school?</span> <span id="s53">A: In The Hague.</span> <span id="s54">I was on the -- you call it elementary school, I think?</span> <span id="s55">And that’s a seven grade school, and after that I went to high school on -- on a level that is the same as a kind of gymnasium, and I finished that.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: We’ll get to the later years in a moment, I’m -- wanted to talk about the earlier years.</span> <span id="s57">What kind of neighborhood did you live in?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well, we -- we lived in the nice neighborhood, with my father first, I was born in the -- in the -- almost the center of the city and then we moved to some, you call it suburbs, suburbs.</span> <span id="s59">But then we went back in 1937, I think, to the center of the city, and that was close to the street where my mother lived.</span> <span id="s60">But she used to live also in the suburbs, first.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s62">And what kind of a neighborhood was it, was it pri-primarily Indonesian or Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, it was a Dutch neighborhood.</span> <span id="s64">There were not too many In-Indonesian families in -- in -- in those days.</span> <span id="s65">Only the people that worked in the restaurants.</span> <span id="s66">There were the -- well, you have to divide the Indonesian population in two, the real Indonesian people and the half Indonesian people that has also Dutch blood.</span> <span id="s67">And that was another kind of class.</span> <span id="s68">And we were, in fact, real Indonesian.</span> <span id="s69">My father was real Indonesian so the-there was a difference.</span> <span id="s70">We didn’t have the Dutch nationality.</span> <span id="s71">They called it [indecipherable] I don’t know the word [indecipherable] subject, or s -- s -- I don’t know the English words.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s73">And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: My mother was completely Dutch, hundred percent.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So you were con -- you, the children, were considered mixed Dutch Indonesian.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yeah, but we are not completely Indonesian and -- nor completely Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s78">It’s half and half.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s81">And is that considered in society above a hundred -- i-in that society at the time, in the 1930’s, was that half and half considered above a hundred percent Indonesian?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yeah, that was considered ha -- above that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: In your neighborhood when you were small, did you know any Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Some.</span> <span id="s85">Th-They went to the same elementary school as I.</span> <span id="s86">It was not a p -- the religious school, it just a school for everybody.</span> <span id="s87">So there were a lot of Jewish children there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you play with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s90">We -- we didn’t make any difference b -- in those days.</span> <span id="s91">I -- they called me some names because I had the different color.</span> <span id="s92">It never really bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Why didn’t it bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, I saw it as a joke.</span> <span id="s95">I -- I remember I -- just after the war I went with two friends on a cycle tour in Holland, and we came in the middle of Holland with all farmer’s country.</span> <span id="s96">And well, I was -- when I went into the shops everybody was looking at me and I felt kind of proud.</span> <span id="s97">They saw I was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: What are your first memories of hearing of a man named Hitler?</span> <span id="s99">Do you -- I mean, you were born in 1931, he came into power in ’33, obviously you were too young.</span> <span id="s100">Do you -- can you recall your very first memories of hearing about this man?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Well, maybe when I was seven or eight, my parents used to talk about Hitler and -- but they thought, well, maybe it will go over.</span> <span id="s102">Just a short time, it -- then when the war came, we knew who he was, and just --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: You’re talking about in September ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Well, then th-the war started with England, when the -- the Germans invaded Poland, but for us the -- the war started at the 10th of May, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Yeah, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Then jer --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: -- wh-when they invaded the Netherlands.</span> <span id="s108">For you, the war for you, right, right.</span> <span id="s109">Did you have any fear of this man before the -- before 1940, in the late 30’s and in 1939, did you -- what was a child’s sense of Hitler at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Not much, th -- we didn’t talk too much about it and I c -- I can’t recall that we talked about Hitler.</span> <span id="s111">It started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s113">Did you -- just to g -- to go back, and when you were in school you said you had Jewish friends; were there Jewish teachers at your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Not that I know of, no.</span> <span id="s115">There were no -- no, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: And what was the address of the house that you lived in?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Well, I -- m -- the address the the -- van Kins -- with a K, Kinsbergenstraat, where s -- where -- where my father lived and my mother lived in the Zoutmanstraat with a z -- Z.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s119">All right, now it’s May 1940 and you are ni -- just -- almost nine years old, close to nine.</span> <span id="s120">What is your very first memory of that time?</span> <span id="s121">A: Well, it was a -- kind of exciting because there were airplanes in the air and there were parachute -- parachutists droppings in The Hague, German parachutists and we heard all gun sounds and -- so it was kind -- completely new for us and it was a beautiful day I can remember, was lot of sun.</span> <span id="s122">And I was standing with my father in the garden in the van Kinsbergenstraat and I remember my asking my father, are we going to win this war?</span> <span id="s123">And then my father said -- that was his famous last words always, let’s hope so.</span> <span id="s124">And well, it was quite an -- it was a very short war, it so -- was only four days and we -- they -- we surrendered, or the du -- the Dutch surrendered because they threatened to bomb Rotterdam and after that they still bombed Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s125">So that was a short war, and -- but for a child it was -- it -- it’s kind of a new experience and exciting.</span> <span id="s126">You didn’t really -- really realize what the -- the consequences would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Do you have any other recollection of those four d -- those first four days besides the -- the beginning of the days?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, you didn’t notice too much in The Hague.</span> <span id="s129">There were -- there was some heavy fighting in the country, but we didn't notice too much, there were -- there were no -- hardly bombings.</span> <span id="s130">Th-Th-The Dutch aircraft was wiped out in the -- the first day I think.</span> <span id="s131">So there was not much war in The Hague.</span> <span id="s132">Right after that was the occu -- occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And you continued to go to school.</span> <span id="s134">So let’s talk about the beginning of the occupation.</span> <span id="s135">Now, you’re living with your father and Mima Saina at the time, and the sisters are with your mother.</span> <span id="s136">Okay, so, you’re -- you’re -- continue to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah, we went to the school, I was -- it was 1940 so I was about in the -- well, I went to school in 1937, so I was in the third grade, third grade and everything went on normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: What -- what about the summer of 1940, the -- the first summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: Well, we didn’t notice much, there was an distribution -- distribution of food and cigarettes and everything, but everything went well.</span> <span id="s140">There was no hunger in -- in those days and life went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Did you sense any nervousness among your Jewish friends at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: They were still going to school, too, but I think til 1941, and then they were not allowed to school -- go to school any more.</span> <span id="s143">But there was one close friend, I forgot his name, and his mother was a close friend of my mother, and he suddenly disappeared, and we never heard of them any more, they -- I don’t know if they went into hiding, or -- my mother didn’t hear from them, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Did you, as a child, question why a friend suddenly disappears?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, we really had -- we heard soon about the -- that all kind of things against the -- the Jews were all n -- how do you call that, all --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: Yeah, restrictions, and as a child you didn’t think much of it.</span> <span id="s148">You didn’t quite understand what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: What’s it like for a nine year old boy to see it -- a soldier in a German uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Well, the first soldiers -- the -- the German had that kind of way to gi -- to try to get along with the Dutch, because we were the same race, and they want to be friendly with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did you speak, or do you -- did you speak German at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: At the time, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s153">But they th -- didn’t -- the -- the Dutch didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s154">The -- the Dutch were never extreme.</span> <span id="s155">So they’re always in the middle, and they love th-the -- the queen and -- though there were a lot of people angry because she left for England.</span> <span id="s156">Later we heard she was forced to go, she didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s157">And so there was a lot of national feeling all of a sudden and the Germans didn’t like that at all, and then they got more harsh against us, and -- but we didn’t notice much concerning the food.</span> <span id="s158">Til 1944 everything went quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: In April of 1942 the Jews had to start wearing a yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: What did that mean to you, when you would see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Well, it -- it was not th-the -- the -- what’s the word?</span> <span id="s163">Strange.</span> <span id="s164">W-We found it very strange that people has to walk like that, you know?</span> <span id="s165">And that -- to become Jews, and I would -- I sho -- when I -- would have been a Jew, I would have refused to wear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, it -- because it’s -- it -- it’s like a humiliation, you call it that?</span> <span id="s168">Like humiliation.</span> <span id="s169">And -- an-and it’s -- a-and it’s one of the worst things that can happen to a person, humiliation.</span> <span id="s170">But well, you -- you got used to it, but I -- I had to kind of feel sorry for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: You said, I think in 1941 I think the Jewish children had to leave the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Where did they go, or what did you know about it and did you keep in contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s175">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s176">I don’t know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s177">The only family I know, the real family, were the Munzers.</span> <span id="s178">And well, they were killed in -- were very young, not going to school yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Okay, let’s talk about the Munzers because you -- you knew them before Alfred came to your house.</span> <span id="s180">How -- how did you know them and what was your contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: My mother moved to the Zoutmanstraat in 1938 and the Munzers were already living opposite.</span> <span id="s182">Alfred told me today it was number hundred, and we lived on 79 in the other side.</span> <span id="s183">And my mother -- I’d -- I don’t know how my mother met his mother, but I remember often go there, and to play some with the -- the little girls, and have dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: This is before Alfred was born?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Before Alfred was born, yeah.</span> <span id="s186">So this was already 1938 - 19 - 1939 - 1940.</span> <span id="s187">And then things changed and I don’t know what was really happening.</span> <span id="s188">My mother told me what was happening, that -- but that was 1942 when they went in-into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Now did you -- do you remember if you went to their house after ji -- ji -- the Germans invaded the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s191">Course, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: You still went over to be with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yeah, we went to there, yeah, I can remember that.</span> <span id="s194">And my father, his father was -- Alfred’s father was a tailor and my father bought a suit.</span> <span id="s195">So he knew ma -- Mr. Munzer, too.</span> <span id="s196">But I don’t recall too many visits then.</span> <span id="s197">But it -- I think it went on and I -- I -- I really don’t know any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Why did you enjoy going over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Food.</span> <span id="s200">And I still have sugar in my salad.</span> <span id="s201">And I -- I first -- my mother always made th-the salad all -- very sour, and it’s why -- why I still hate sour things.</span> <span id="s202">But she put sugar in it and I liked it very much.</span> <span id="s203">And she was very friendly, too.</span> <span id="s204">Very friendly lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: All right, now let’s move onto the story about how Alfred came to your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Well, the -- my mother was asked to find a hiding place for Alfred, by his mother.</span> <span id="s207">And so she found a -- a place at my aunt’s, my youngest aunt’s, the younger sister of my mother.</span> <span id="s208">And he stayed there for a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: All right, we’re talking about September ’42, what are we -- what --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Something -- something like that, yeah, September ’42.</span> <span id="s211">But he only stayed a month because one of the neighbors appeared to be a Dutch Nazi, so it was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s212">He -- he was crying a lot, he had bronchitis or something, and -- as a baby, and he -- they had to move him.</span> <span id="s213">And I talked to my cousin just before I went to Washington, the daughter of my aunt, and she told me that everybody was crying when he had to leave, and was the first time she saw her father cry.</span> <span id="s214">And then my mother asked my father to have him for -- Alfred for a couple of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: How do you explain your mother and your aunt -- and of course la -- we’ll talk about your father later -- willingly taking in a Jewish nine month old baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Well, my mother always liked to help people, always.</span> <span id="s217">She wanted to be a nurse all her life, but she came out of a big family and the father, my grandfather -- I -- I never met him -- forced them to work right away, to have jobs and shops and so she was not allowed to study for a nurse.</span> <span id="s218">But later on, when she was 65, she started to work as a nurse, though she th -- the -- for the money she didn’t have to do it, but just to help people.</span> <span id="s219">And I remember my mother in those days, she was very agitated to -- really to help and warn us, don’t tell an -- anybody about this, and she was really taking care to try to find places for Jewish people, but I don’t re -- remember if she did this for other Jewish people, too, I don’t know about that, but she did for Alfred.</span> <span id="s220">So he stayed for -- well, that was the intention, to -- for a couple of weeks in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So he comes to your -- he’s brought to your house, do you remember the day that he came?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yes, I remember that, yeah.</span> <span id="s223">Just a tiny baby.</span> <span id="s224">And blonde, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s225">Didn’t look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s226">And I think, in the beginning, that was a luck, too.</span> <span id="s227">His Jewish features he got later.</span> <span id="s228">But the three weeks became three and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: So he comes, what was your first feelings when this new baby is brought into your home?</span> <span id="s230">You -- you had seen -- had you seen him before, because where -- had you visited them in the last nine months?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: No, no, I didn’t visit them in the last months, but we were excited.</span> <span id="s232">It’s -- it was a kind of new thing happening, and well, what can you say when there’s a baby coming?</span> <span id="s233">So it was kind of exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So it -- there was now your father, and Mima Saina, your two sisters, you and the baby, four children.</span> <span id="s235">And how big a house did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, my sisters were staying with my mother, but from time to time I stayed with my mother and they stayed with my father.</span> <span id="s237">And sometimes the three of us were together and -- and my sisters loved it.</span> <span id="s238">Well, it’s -- maybe females are more a-affected to babies than men.</span> <span id="s239">But yeah, they took care right away.</span> <span id="s240">And the house was not big.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Where did the baby sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: The baby slept with Mima Saina.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: She had her own room?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah, she had the -- well, it was not really a -- it -- it was an extension of the house and there were several rooms connected to each other and she slept in one of the rooms and -- with -- with Alfred.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And so she obviously took care of him when he was very young i-i-in the beginning and you continued to go to school while this -- whe -- af -- you were still at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yes, I was still at school and everything went on normal til the end of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And as the baby got bigger, what happened with the -- an-and was moving around, were there any restrictions?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, he had to stay inside, and he was looking through the hole where the -- the letters come in.</span> <span id="s249">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Th-The mail -- you mean the mail slot in the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s252">And he looked through that, but he came in the garden, and he played in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: He went in the garden during the day, when others could see?</span> <span id="s254">A: Yeah, because we have pictures made in the garden, so he went to the garden, too.</span> <span id="s255">But my father told everybody who -- who was curious about the baby that he was a child of his former wife, so my mother.</span> <span id="s256">And -- but she had a new friend and he didn't want to have the baby, so he -- my father took the baby.</span> <span id="s257">That was the excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And tell me how you as a young boy knew how to protect this child and not say anything when you were outside.</span> <span id="s259">How did your father present that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well, there were warnings and we understood that quite good.</span> <span id="s261">Th-The -- when my father and my mother told me that if the Germans would find out, that he would be arrested, my mother would be arrested and probably we too, and brought to camps, or th -- imprisoned, or maybe shot.</span> <span id="s262">So that was a warning enough, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Did you know what it meant at 11 years old to say you might be brought to camps?</span> <span id="s264">What does that mean to an 11 year old child?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Well, we didn’t know about the camps then, but to be -- go in prison or to be shot, you realize that right away, that -- that -- it was not too difficult to realize that.</span> <span id="s266">And we kept our mouths shut, my sisters and me and all the people that knew about it, th -- a lot of the Indonesian community, th-the people that worked in the same restaurant as my father, they kind of knew about it.</span> <span id="s267">And -- but those people didn’t say anything, just helps.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Were you angry that your father put you under this stress of not saying anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: No, no, because we felt th -- very soon quite strong for the baby.</span> <span id="s270">It was our -- our baby, and so we never had the -- the problem.</span> <span id="s271">The only thing maybe, it was for me a little bit difficult, is that I came second in place.</span> <span id="s272">I was the first, I was Mima Saina’s baby and now Alfred was in the number one, I f -- I felt at the time, but she took great care of me too.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: What did you call Alfred?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: We called him Bobby and that is the name my father invented for him.</span> <span id="s275">And Bobby always thought it was the name of the dog, and as far I can remember, there was a dog named Bobby, too, and there was a name -- a dog named Teddy, but died already and -- but there was also a dog named Bobby, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: These were dogs that -- that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Not neighbors, but you?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s280">Just little dogs.</span> <span id="s281">Very friendly little dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Rob Madna.</span> <span id="s284">This is tape number one, side B.</span> <span id="s285">As this baby, Bobby, as you na -- as you called him, got older a-and was moving around, you said he -- he -- some of the things he’d like to do would be to look through the mail slot in the door.</span> <span id="s286">What else did he do during the day as he got bigger and more physical?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Oh, he was playing all kind of games and I -- I -- I think he was a happy child.</span> <span id="s288">Laughing and we played with him and everybody took care.</span> <span id="s289">He likes to sit on my sisters’ laps and it was just a normal family life.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: And what language did he s -- learn to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Dutch.</span> <span id="s292">Dutch language.</span> <span id="s293">With Mima Saina he spoke the Malayan language, and the sa -- I spoke with her Malayan.</span> <span id="s294">With my father we talked Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: So he grew up bilingual also, like you and your sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s297">Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s299">As he got bigger, did you feel more close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: We always felt very close to him.</span> <span id="s301">We -- we all loved him very much and so it -- it was such a normal situation in the house to have him there, and we got used to him very fast and he was our little baby brother.</span> <span id="s302">It -- it was very easy, I think.</span> <span id="s303">I don’t remember any problems at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: But you never spoke of him to your friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s306">The headmaster of my school knew something about it, he was a very nice man, and my mother knew him very well, and he gave me always extra food for -- for Bobby.</span> <span id="s307">And [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Were there any times when it -- it was dangerous, that you sensed a dangerous situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s310">In th -- I told you before, til 1944, everything went -- I only remember one day a -- a bomb fell in The Hague and that was just a minor accident, I think an -- an English plane want to get rid of the last bomb.</span> <span id="s311">And it dropped not far from our house in th-the -- in the neighborhood and I remember Mima saying that took -- everybody was up and awake and she took Bobby out of his bed and took him on his lap, swaying him and start praying.</span> <span id="s312">And -- but that was an incident.</span> <span id="s313">We didn’t notice much from the war til ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: You didn’t notice much of the war in your -- in The Hague, but were -- again, were you aware, or were you interested as a youngster of what was happening in other countries?</span> <span id="s315">Did you know what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Well, we didn’t know about the Holocaust, but we had th-those legal papers that were sent by the resistance movements to people.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Talk a little bit about th -- you had papers, did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah, we re-received letters and papers from the resistance movement.</span> <span id="s319">They were brought to the houses ille -- silently or secretly, and we read about the real situation in the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Oh, these are newspapers, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well, yeah, kind of newspapers, just small pages of paper that informed us about the situation at the fronts.</span> <span id="s322">And of course we had th-the -- the newspapers with the ger -- the German news and the -- they had -- they wer-were winning all the time.</span> <span id="s323">But I remember that in the war I already had a -- an -- especially after D-Day, I had a map of Europe and with a woolen thre-thread, is it called?</span> <span id="s324">And with pins I put on the front line and I knew all the names of the generals and -- and that was -- well, with the -- the illegal papers, I could see all -- they move there and they move there, and they move there, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: What was on the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well, al -- only the German news.</span> <span id="s327">It was, of course, forbidden to have a radio, so it was a kind of a dist -- distribution system with only two local --</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Stations?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: -- stations.</span> <span id="s330">And -- but we -- we -- there were people that had the radio still, and were receiving messages from London.</span> <span id="s331">So we were well informed about the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Did you ever see any Jews being taken away on the streets in The Hague?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Luckily not.</span> <span id="s334">But we heard about that.</span> <span id="s335">And then we knew, yeah, well the -- well, the Germans had -- well, they were just put to -- to work in Germany, so we didn’t think much of it, that they would be killed, we didn’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Was your father involved in -- in any other resistance activities besides doing the wonderful gesture of saving a Jewish child?</span> <span id="s337">Was he involved in any other activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No.</span> <span id="s339">He just went on working.</span> <span id="s340">He was not a man that looked -- liked to take risks.</span> <span id="s341">He was a very peaceful man, and always s-said well, don’t fight, and be quiet and so we were all surprised that he took this risk.</span> <span id="s342">But yeah, I think he -- he thought that it’s a child that has to be helped, so we do it, not thinking further.</span> <span id="s343">He knew about the dangers, of course.</span> <span id="s344">But he -- I think he was very optimistic, like we all were op-optimistic that it would end right, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did -- again, did you know -- you did not know of any other families that were sheltering children?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No, no, we didn’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Did any of the Germans ever come to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Only in the beginning of the war, there was a -- what you call a razzia, and a -- a German -- German soldiers were going from door to door to find men to work in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s349">And I remember one day in beginning of 1945 that a German soldier was at the door, a very small German soldier.</span> <span id="s350">And he was from th-the air force, the ground personnel because the other Germans had to fight somewhere.</span> <span id="s351">And he asked for mann.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Which means?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Men.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Are there men in the house.</span> <span id="s356">But he just asked for mann.</span> <span id="s357">And Mima Saina an-and I were at the door together and we looked at each other very puzzled and didn’t understand, pretending not to understand and then he gave up and went away.</span> <span id="s358">And my neighbor, who was Indonesian too, was only -- we were the only Indonesians in the street, and he was picked up.</span> <span id="s359">But he came back the same evening, they didn’t want us.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did your father provide for a hiding place for Bobby in case -- you said there weren’t any problems, but in case there were problems, did he have a hiding place for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s362">There was the cellar, but if you go in the cellar you could see him right away, it’s a -- not, not really.</span> <span id="s363">Of course, h-he was put in the back room that if somebody would come in and found him, there were maybe some questions and well, then I think the problems would start.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Well, that was going to be my next question.</span> <span id="s365">What about when friends or neighbors knocked on your door or came in, and you didn’t know if they knew about the baby, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: -- how did -- how did your family handle that?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: -- well, th-th-th-th -- I told you about the excuse my father had, who the baby was, and that’s wh -- the story that he told the other people.</span> <span id="s369">But some of them knew, especially the Indonesian co-community, and -- but there were visitors in the house, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And -- and the baby, or the young child was playing right in front of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s372">He was in there at -- when the people came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: And the general living conditions, wa -- how was the food supply?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Til September 1944, til the railroad strike -- then the Dutch started the railroad strike to -- to make it difficult for the Germans to bring all the tanks and all the weapons to certain parts, then it went bad.</span> <span id="s375">And we -- then the -- what we call the hunger winter -- the winter of the hunger started and lasted about -- well, started in October til May.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: This is ’44 - ’45?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s378">And it was a very severe winter, very cold, and I rem-remember there was a small wood in the -- in the neighborhood and when the war was over there was no wood any more, because all the people cut th-the trees in to -- to have heating and to -- able to cook something, or -- so th-the whole little wood forest went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What kind of food did you have during that difficult time?</span> <span id="s380">A: Very bad bread, very bad.</span> <span id="s381">And just -- I ca -- I remember I had four slices of bread a day, and that was all.</span> <span id="s382">And that finally became two slices of bread a day, no butter.</span> <span id="s383">There were some -- how do you call it?</span> <span id="s384">I don’t know the words.</span> <span id="s385">We say [indecipherable], that’s when you replace something that it’s not real, like milk wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: A sub-substitution?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, the substitute.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And there was no sugar, there was no milk.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Any meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: No, no meat any more.</span> <span id="s392">In the beginning of 50 -- ’45, no meat at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Ve-Vegetables or fruit?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Hardly.</span> <span id="s395">But there were those what we call haarkeukens, that were kitchens for the people and you went there every day to get some food, just with a little butter --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: R-Ra -- did you have a ration cards?</span> <span id="s397">Did you have little coupons, little ration cards for food?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: The whole war.</span> <span id="s399">But at the end of the war you had those cards, but you couldn’t get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: So it was -- and there was, o-of course, a black market.</span> <span id="s402">Am a -- I remember my mother in ’45 went on the bicycle to -- from The Hague to Haarlem.</span> <span id="s403">Haarlem is the same name as Harlem and it’s about 45 miles, to get some food.</span> <span id="s404">She knew some people, and I remember th -- she came back, but it was over eight, and you were not allowed to -- to be on the streets after eight, and so we were very worried.</span> <span id="s405">And then she came at the door with a German soldier.</span> <span id="s406">He had stopped her and then she told him I ha -- had some food for my children and he brought her home.</span> <span id="s407">So she was very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Did your father have any contact with Alfred’s family during this time, once the baby was given to you all?</span> <span id="s409">Did -- did Mr. and Mrs. Munzer have any contact with him or your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, th-the parents of Alfred went in -- into hiding too, first in the sike -- si -- si -- seekeeatris -- that -- psychiatrix house, but then they were caught and deported right away, so there was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: There was no --</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: -- more contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: I never saw her in the house before the end of the war, in our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s416">Well, let’s -- let’s talk about that now, the end of the war.</span> <span id="s417">How did you know it was the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Well, we had to wait til the war really ends, and for us it was terrible to think that already in October the allied forces were only 60 miles from The Hague, but they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s419">And we are expe -- ek -- expect them -- e-expecting them every day, you know, it -- but they couldn’t cross the rivers without -- they had too many losses with soldiers when they should have crossed the rivers.</span> <span id="s420">It was heavy defended -- heavily defended by the Germans.</span> <span id="s421">So they decide to take the rest of Holland and just pass the -- th-the -- the places where were lived.</span> <span id="s422">So we were only liberated when the war was over, and I remember, I think it was the fourth or third of May?</span> <span id="s423">Fourth om -- of May, I think, and people were running through the streets, the war is over.</span> <span id="s424">The Germans have surrendered and everybody went on the street and nobody thought about the eight o’clock.</span> <span id="s425">And the Germans didn’t d-do anything.</span> <span id="s426">I remember myself the sixth of May that we were in the city, and the first English soldier we saw was driving a -- a motorcycle and he even didn’t have a gun, he had a pistol, I think.</span> <span id="s427">And on the other side the street, the Germans soldiers were on bicycles, heavily armed, because th-the allies said you have to take care of the situation til we come, but don’t do anything.</span> <span id="s428">So it was very funny to see this English soldier, we were all around him, and see these German soldiers at the o-other side of street.</span> <span id="s429">And then it was over, it was over.</span> <span id="s430">And nobody thought about hunger any more.</span> <span id="s431">The -- the 29th of April -- April, we had a wonderful bombing of The Hague, food bombing.</span> <span id="s432">And th-those big flying [indecipherable] dropped food on some spots of The Hague, so we were very -- we were very happy.</span> <span id="s433">And every time it is becoming end of April, I think of those days.</span> <span id="s434">It’s impossible not to think of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Did you know German by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: The only German family I knew was a family that fled from Germany in 93 -- ’33.</span> <span id="s437">They were communists, but not well -- very well known by the Germans in Holland, so they started t-t-to make a living here in Holland, and they knew about it.</span> <span id="s438">It was very good friend of my father, and they helped, because they -- as the German inoccupi -- occupied the Netherlands, they had some extra things.</span> <span id="s439">So they helped with food and -- and he was a kind of guy who sold medicines and all kind of herbs.</span> <span id="s440">I -- I -- I know he cured me from a disease with all kind of herbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Di-Did you know the German language by then, after being occupied by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Just a little because th-that -- in 1944 I went to the high school, though in the first year of high school it was only one month, September and then we didn’t go to school any more, til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s443">So and -- and German was one of the language you had to do.</span> <span id="s444">Also the English language was still taught.</span> <span id="s445">English, French, German were the languages.</span> <span id="s446">So I learned some German.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Whe-When -- during the occupation when you were on the street and you saw a German soldier, did you have to acknowledge him?</span> <span id="s448">Was there anything you -- that you were required to do, or could you just walk b -- right by him?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: No, the -- my wife had the different situation, she was in the Indonesia with the Japanese and you had to bow.</span> <span id="s450">But th-that was not the -- here, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So you could just walk right by?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: You cus -- you could just walk right by, yeah.</span> <span id="s453">But they stole your bicycle.</span> <span id="s454">My father went out with my bicycle because his -- his bicycle was -- th-the Germans stopped him and they took your bicycle.</span> <span id="s455">And then he took my bicycle and he came home without the bicycle.</span> <span id="s456">So we had an ex -- the expression, the joke to -- we can hardly stop to say to a German, I want my bicycle back.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: You’re still waiting for your bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: Yes, I’m still waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: So now it’s liberation, and then what -- what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, I remember Bobby going on the street for the first time with Mima Saina and wearing a light brown coat.</span> <span id="s461">I still see -- I can still picture.</span> <span id="s462">And with a Turkish [indecipherable] on his hat, and an orange sash around his waist.</span> <span id="s463">And he was walking just really straight up, and Mima very proud.</span> <span id="s464">It was -- it -- it means something now.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Was he excited or frightened to be in such a big open space after being confined in your house his whole life?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No, it just -- when he was with Mima, he was okay.</span> <span id="s467">So no, he -- he -- he an -- really enjoyed it, yeah.</span> <span id="s468">No, he was -- was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Did you really feel free at that time?</span> <span id="s470">Was it a different physical, emotional feeling once liberation occurred?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: I think it’s the biggest feel of freedom I ever had.</span> <span id="s472">Five years occupation is a lot, and -- especially in the last part was a very hard one, and you were afraid.</span> <span id="s473">There were a lot of bombings in The Hague afterwards, an-and -- and the march of 1945 was a happy bombing of the allied and they took the wrong spot.</span> <span id="s474">So a lot of ci-citizens were killed.</span> <span id="s475">So the German propaganda tried to -- to make a thing out of it, but well, we accepted, and -- I saw the bombing from the balcony of my mother’s house.</span> <span id="s476">It was a -- but we got used to it, because there were air raids every day.</span> <span id="s477">Started at eight o’clock in the morning, til five in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s478">But you get used to it, those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did you feel like a very old 14 year old -- I think you were something like 14 at the time.</span> <span id="s480">Did you f-feel like an older person?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: No.</span> <span id="s482">I was still a young boy, and my father said to me, what will happen to you, you will always be a jungecha.</span> <span id="s483">A jungecha means always be a young boy.</span> <span id="s484">And I felt young and not really older.</span> <span id="s485">I was very small.</span> <span id="s486">I started to grow a little bit more between my 14th and my 18th .</span> <span id="s487">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s489">I -- I -- I meant more emotionally.</span> <span id="s490">I mean, you had lived through such difficult, difficult times that with that mat -- did that mature you, seeing what you saw and being in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: Of course, yo-you learn, but I didn’t feel too much different, only freed, and we were very happy about that.</span> <span id="s492">And -- and the excitement t-to -- well, there was a very strong national feeling at the time, and sometimes not quite correct.</span> <span id="s493">What the allied did was okay and what the Germans did was always bad.</span> <span id="s494">Later on, when you learn about the situations that’s happened in the war, and all -- all the other things, then you change your opinion sometimes about making war.</span> <span id="s495">Later on, I -- I thought it’s ridiculous to fight such a war.</span> <span id="s496">Of course, you had to because you are fighting some crazy people.</span> <span id="s497">But when I thought about the generals that would send the soldiers to a coast, knowing that they will die, especially first groups, and then I always ask myself, how ca -- how can you do that?</span> <span id="s498">Break up all kind of families just because there is a difference in opinion in the world, you know, it -- it still is and I think it always will be.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: So now it’s the end of the war and how much longer did Bobby stay with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s501">As I -- I recall, it -- it was in 1946 that his -- in the beginning of 1946, I think, that his mother and Bobby moved to another p --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Wh-Wh-When did she come back, though, to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: It was very soon after the war was over, because she met Mima and -- and she -- yeah, she was there already, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: De-Describe what her first appearance at your house was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Well, it -- it -- of course, I knew her and Mima knew her and everybody knew her, only Bobby just didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s506">And so it was kind of funny and well, she hugged the child of course, but he didn’t want to have -- have anything to do with her.</span> <span id="s507">He wa -- didn’t want to sit on her lap and I think that it will be hard for a mother that -- then, I realize later, much later when I was older, that it was hard for my mother that I preferred Mima to her, you know, that -- that was very hard, I think.</span> <span id="s508">But he went -- went on very well, and I think they had a very good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: So did -- did Mrs. Munzer move into your house and stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yeah, she stayed there and til the -- the -- I think the beginning of 1946 she had the -- she slept in the middle room with Bobby and we slept at the back.</span> <span id="s511">And it was very nice to have her in the house.</span> <span id="s512">She was a very friendly woman, and a very wise woman, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And then where -- and then she decided to leave and -- after a few months, and where did she go?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: She went to a -- a block not too far from us in the Archimedes flat, Archimedes the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: -- the [indecipherable] man, I think.</span> <span id="s517">And I didn’t go too often to there.</span> <span id="s518">I don’t know what -- what’s happening, but it was like we lived our own life from that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Were you sorry to see Bobby leave your house and move in with his mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s521">I -- I did -- I remember that we -- we all felt sorry, but we u-understood that it has to be and -- and well, I started -- I was almost 15 and -- and no -- 15 in 1946, yeah, and I became a real trouble child then.</span> <span id="s522">Especially because Mima died in -- in -- just a few months after the war ended.</span> <span id="s523">She had the brain --</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Hemorrhage?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s526">And well, my world collapsed.</span> <span id="s527">I lost my mother, and -- and Bobby didn’t ro -- realize it fully, and his mother was back so it was co -- a kind of compensation for him.</span> <span id="s528">He did -- he didn’t know what death was, and -- but he honored her very much, but he doesn’t remember her quite well.</span> <span id="s529">So i -- we were in -- yesterday we were talking about all -- many things and found new things, oh yes, that was that, and yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So Bobby and his mother stayed in your house after Mima died?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Yeah, til the beginning of 1946.</span> <span id="s532">My father remar-remarried in 1946, and also his new wife and the children that came had much contact with Bobby and considered him as a brother, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s534">And then I understand they moved to Belgium in the 19 fi -- sometime after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: First his mother i -- had a kind of store, selling all kind of things that -- like little things, you know, like rings and th -- in The Hague, too, and I visit her there, was there.</span> <span id="s536">And he came to my father with the bus.</span> <span id="s537">My father had moved to a other part of The Hague.</span> <span id="s538">And I remember him -- bringing him -- taking him to the bus.</span> <span id="s539">And I remember him, said I -- I want to give you some money.</span> <span id="s540">And I was young myself, in my 20’s, 21, I think.</span> <span id="s541">And so I gave him a gilder, which was a lot money then.</span> <span id="s542">It’s about a half a dollar or something.</span> <span id="s543">And he said well, it’s not enough.</span> <span id="s544">So I gave him another gilder and another gilder.</span> <span id="s545">And Bobby s-said thank you, thank you.</span> <span id="s546">And I always gave him too much s-so that I hardly could the train and go -- go to Rotterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Just a g -- generally tell me then, w-wha -- about your father that -- in the next few years and what happened to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: In the -- after the war, you mean?</span> <span id="s549">Well, I met my wife already when I was 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So you went back to school after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Yeah, I went back to school and was not very successful because I was in music already and I liked to be a musician and not go to school.</span> <span id="s552">But my mother took care that I finished the school.</span> <span id="s553">And I’m very thankful, because later on I studied mathematics and it wouldn’t be possible without that school.</span> <span id="s554">So in the meantime, and -- I was in music, too, and developed.</span> <span id="s555">So I became a professional in ’52, after I finished my school, and did that for about nine years, eight years.</span> <span id="s556">But I -- I didn’t like the way of living, you had to go abroad.</span> <span id="s557">And I -- we married in -- in ’55, and we were very young, I was 24, and Astrid, my wife was 22.</span> <span id="s558">And there was son already in the year after.</span> <span id="s559">And a lot of -- and a long time when we played tennis tournaments they thought we were brothers.</span> <span id="s560">And I always said to him that, you know why?</span> <span id="s561">You have a old face, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Rob Madna.</span> <span id="s564">This is tape number two, side A. And you were talking about after the war and your marriage.</span> <span id="s565">An-nd you had been a musician and w-were you playing or composing?</span> <span id="s566">What were you doing as a musician in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: I was playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What -- what instruments?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Piano.</span> <span id="s570">Playing the piano and I was self taught and started to have contracts already and went to Germany, to Switzerland and Denmark.</span> <span id="s571">In 1954, four month in Sweden.</span> <span id="s572">So I had a l -- lot to do.</span> <span id="s573">But I didn’t l-like the way of living and also, well, I was a fall blu -- full blood jazz musician and you have to play commercial mu-music, and entertaining the people, I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s574">So I decided I’ll go on with my musical career, but I do something on the side.</span> <span id="s575">And then when I s -- that’s -- and then I decided just st-st-start with mathematic study, because I always wanted to be a teacher in the first place.</span> <span id="s576">And in fi -- ’59 I -- 1960 I started to work in the school, h-high school, as a teacher.</span> <span id="s577">And I did that for 25 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: A h -- a high school mathematics teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s580">And for 25 years, and the last four years of those 25 years I was assistant director of the sc -- school.</span> <span id="s581">We had one -- we call it a hector and we had five bi -- because it was a big school of 1700 people -- pupils, and we had five assistant hectors.</span> <span id="s582">We call them conn hector.</span> <span id="s583">And I didn’t apply for the job, they ask me for the job.</span> <span id="s584">I said well -- I was like my father, di-didn’t like to take risks, you know, but I learned a lot in those years.</span> <span id="s585">But during all the years, I developed my music and did a lot of television, radio shows and made some records, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: This is playing the piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Playing the piano, yeah.</span> <span id="s588">And I started to write music because a friend of mine who was already in Holland a famous writer said, you should write.</span> <span id="s589">I said, I don’t know how.</span> <span id="s590">And he said, I know, but use your fantasy.</span> <span id="s591">And so I started to write and learning from other people and t-talking about music and learning and listening to music.</span> <span id="s592">And I learned very much of all the records we got from the States.</span> <span id="s593">Astrid always liked Frank Sinatra much, so we had a lot of Sinatra music with Nelson Riddle arrangements.</span> <span id="s594">And I learned a lot by how f -- the [indecipherable] leadings were going.</span> <span id="s595">And so I started to write, and wrote for th-th-th-th -- a kind of jazz symphony orchestra too, with violins.</span> <span id="s596">I never wrote for violin before, but the same friend said, use your imagination.</span> <span id="s597">So I started to do that, til ’85 when I was offered a full time job at the Hilversum Conservatory, the jazz school, jazz department.</span> <span id="s598">And I hesitated because I thought, well, is it wise to make your hobby your profession?</span> <span id="s599">But I did, and I’m still working in school.</span> <span id="s600">It’s now the Amsterdam Conservatory, after the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s601">And well, I’m still playing.</span> <span id="s602">I’m playing this year in July in the big festival in The Hague, the North Sea Festival where a lot of American musicians come.</span> <span id="s603">So they invited me this year, too.</span> <span id="s604">And then I’m 71 years old, so I can’t complain.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: And you have two children?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: I have two children, a son of 46 and a daughter of 43.</span> <span id="s607">I’m not a grandparent yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: My son’s name is Arthur and my daughter’s name is Helen.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Tell me about your father after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Well, my father continued wor-working.</span> <span id="s612">He was a man who likes to work.</span> <span id="s613">The -- the only time he had off was Wednesday afternoon and then the family gathered.</span> <span id="s614">My sisters came to my father’s house and we always had a kind of party, eating and have all kind of cakes and pastries and it was always a nice day.</span> <span id="s615">But then it -- it changed when he had a second marriage in 1946 and the children grew up, th -- my half brother and two brothers and the half sister.</span> <span id="s616">And -- but I was in the house, and lucky for them because I was th-the guy who took the discipline things.</span> <span id="s617">She couldn’t manage the children and my father was always working, so i-if there was a problem, I was th-the big brother, I was fi -- 15 years older than my youngest brother, I took care.</span> <span id="s618">And I still have contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you all talk about the war a lot after it was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: With my father, yeah.</span> <span id="s621">And well, my brothers and my -- my sisters, we talked a lot.</span> <span id="s622">We always have a -- a lot of memories when we meet and they bought books about The Hague, who it was -- how The Hague was in the 30’s and beginning of 40’s and then all kind of things.</span> <span id="s623">We t -- we talk about that, yeah.</span> <span id="s624">So there’s always -- the war is a very important part of our life.</span> <span id="s625">Was -- we talk often about it, and we talk a lot about Bobby, too, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: What -- what relation did you have with him at -- then?</span> <span id="s627">He moved away with his mother to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Yeah, and then I didn’t see him for a long time.</span> <span id="s629">He had more contact then with the Madna -- the new Madna fa-family.</span> <span id="s630">And then he went to the States, I heard about that, and it wasn't til ’73, I think, that we came in contact again.</span> <span id="s631">He was studying, he had to go in the army, he was in the air force, and -- and we heard about that.</span> <span id="s632">My father told -- but I didn’t have direct contact with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: So he stayed in letter contact with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s635">He informed my father about everything.</span> <span id="s636">And then we start to meet again, he came over to Europe and we were very, very excited an-and there were -- there are many pictures of those days and -- and -- and after that there was much more contact.</span> <span id="s637">And now we have really m-much contact the last -- last few years.</span> <span id="s638">Calling, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s640">Just -- can you tell me a little bit about your wife’s background, just generally who she is and -- and how she came to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Well, the -- she came in Holland in 1950, she was born in Indonesia.</span> <span id="s642">And they were -- the family was isolated th -- in the street.</span> <span id="s643">They had -- didn’t have to go to the camp, but they couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s644">So the -- the house was their prison.</span> <span id="s645">And she -- she brought the [indecipherable] and the Japanese [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s646">She’s from 1933.</span> <span id="s647">So she -- she -- she lived the war too, you know, she knows about the war.</span> <span id="s648">And then after that there was the period that th-the Indonesians took over and this was the worst period, even worse than the Japanese period.</span> <span id="s649">So they came to -- they came to Holland.</span> <span id="s650">Those are all German family.</span> <span id="s651">Her name is Mueller and we have all kind of German names in the family, like Hess and Funk and Uchman and Luther.</span> <span id="s652">And well, I me -- I met her, I think she was three months here in Holland when I met her in a jazz club.</span> <span id="s653">She didn’t want to go but her cousin said, let’s go.</span> <span id="s654">And there -- there’s where we met.</span> <span id="s655">And we stayed together from that day.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: You had said that when you first became a musician you had traveled to Germany.</span> <span id="s657">What was that like for you and what are your thoughts about Germany today?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: I remember one incident, I was working in Germany for the first time in 1953, in Cologne.</span> <span id="s659">And I remember I ate in the intermission.</span> <span id="s660">And we had a -- a -- the tough job.</span> <span id="s661">We started nine o’clock in the evening, until five o’clock in the morning, for 23 marks.</span> <span id="s662">That wa -- wa-wasn’t bad money in those days.</span> <span id="s663">And I remember that I woked up to see the night, because it was summer.</span> <span id="s664">I went in with daylight and come out with daylight.</span> <span id="s665">So I went up to see the night.</span> <span id="s666">But I remember while eating in the intermission, there were two waiters talking about Hitler.</span> <span id="s667">And that -- hm, I -- I think he will come back.</span> <span id="s668">And I got so angry, and then I said, and then we will definitely kill him.</span> <span id="s669">And they become so afraid, because in those days, if I would have told the English authorities about them, they would get in trouble.</span> <span id="s670">So they quieted down and be-be-became like slaves, they acted like slaves, you know.</span> <span id="s671">Didn’t dare to say anything whe-when I was in the neighborhood, but I remember that made me very angry to hear that.</span> <span id="s672">And Cologne was bombed heavily, it was ruins.</span> <span id="s673">I worked in Düsseldorf, too.</span> <span id="s674">But I kind of like Germany.</span> <span id="s675">It’s a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s676">We always make the joke, it’s a pity there are so many Germans here.</span> <span id="s677">But you know, I -- I’m -- I’ve been teaching germ -- Germans since 1985 at the conservatory and a lot of them became my good friends.</span> <span id="s678">And I know you can’t blame them.</span> <span id="s679">But still I -- I told about my attitude in the war, and I told them about the two sisters, Eva and Leah, of Alfred and told them about Alfred and they always feel very uncomfortable th -- when you talk about it.</span> <span id="s680">I said, I don’t blame you, I blame that system.</span> <span id="s681">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Al-Alfred lost his two sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s685">So you’re comfortable when you’re visiting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: I feel comfortable, yeah, because it’s -- it -- it’s a beautiful country.</span> <span id="s687">Only when they raise the voice I’m getting angry.</span> <span id="s688">I even told a German student of mine who was raising his voice -- not against me but to somebody else, and said, I hate it when people raise their voice, and especially when they’re German.</span> <span id="s689">And I told him why.</span> <span id="s690">Because if a German raises his voice, I see right away a uniform around his body, wa -- an SS.</span> <span id="s691">I said, I hate that.</span> <span id="s692">He said, oh, so sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Do you think you are a different person today because what -- of what you lived through as a young -- as a -- as a child, what you went through, the war, the sheltering of a child.</span> <span id="s694">Do you think that has made you a different person than if you hadn’t experienced those times?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Oh, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s696">One thing is, for instance, I hate to spoil food and to take too much on the plate so that there’s something left.</span> <span id="s697">I hate that, because we were so hungry we even ate tulip bul-bulbs in -- in the -- in the last part of the war, because there was no other food.</span> <span id="s698">And they didn’t taste bad.</span> <span id="s699">Taste il -- they’re kind of sweet, but I say s -- tell it to one of the people I met here, yeah, they were talking about growing tulips.</span> <span id="s700">I said, oh yeah, you grow the tulips.</span> <span id="s701">We ate them.</span> <span id="s702">But, of course the -- I told you before that in -- especially in these times, the end of April, beginning of May, the war comes back to you and the ar -- yeah, the memories.</span> <span id="s703">I think the war was -- yeah, a mi -- a major experience in my life.</span> <span id="s704">And I never want to -- to have that again in my life.</span> <span id="s705">If -- I was in the army myself and it was -- I had to go again in the army in ’62 just for a -- a few weeks, and then the ticu -- Cuba crisis came, so we were very [indecipherable] but luckily it didn’t -- it worked out well.</span> <span id="s706">But I think the experience -- you have to tell younger people about it because I always say, when you never had a toothache, you don’t know -- you can’t talk about a toothache.</span> <span id="s707">And if you never experience war or hunger, you can’t just -- can’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s708">But you can tell them the story that way that they kind of feel it, you know?</span> <span id="s709">Because there were a lot of young people said, can’t you forget that?</span> <span id="s710">I remember in -- though, a nice German musician was in the band I was playing in and he ca -- explained this -- the way to Germany, we had a gig in Germany, you know, in the -- understand the word gig?</span> <span id="s711">Because it’s an kind of music -- musician expression.</span> <span id="s712">And he said, oh it’s very close.</span> <span id="s713">I said, I know it was close, they were pretty soon here, you know.</span> <span id="s714">And then he said, can’t you forget about it?</span> <span id="s715">I said, not my generation.</span> <span id="s716">You have to wait.</span> <span id="s717">So.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Are you more religious, less religious, not religious, whatever, because of what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: I’m not religious.</span> <span id="s720">I don’t believe in religious of people.</span> <span id="s721">There are so many rules.</span> <span id="s722">I can’t live by the rules.</span> <span id="s723">I can’t live by the rules.</span> <span id="s724">Th-The only thing I think my religion is don’t hurt other people.</span> <span id="s725">Don’t hurt them, and try to -- when you are getting along with people, you must see them, you must listen to them.</span> <span id="s726">I met a lot of people here and they are very friendly, but they don’t listen to you.</span> <span id="s727">And I met, luckily a lot of people that listen.</span> <span id="s728">I was impressed by th-the Jewish community here.</span> <span id="s729">I saw the whole Bar Mitzvah, th-the -- the ceremony there and I was impressed by the belief of people have and -- but I don’t have that, I di -- can’t believe in things.</span> <span id="s730">Maybe I’m too much a mathematician.</span> <span id="s731">I-I da -- I need proof or something, but I believe in the -- I can understand why people want to go in religion if religion helps them to -- to make th -- to let them have good life and help them in other kind of things, I won’t oppose to that.</span> <span id="s732">It’s good, you know?</span> <span id="s733">But I think I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s734">I have a strong belief in -- in myself and to -- to look in the mirror constantly and make the necessary changements in the -- I have scars, I call them mental scars, of all the things I did to people I didn’t want to do.</span> <span id="s735">And they sometimes pop up, you know?</span> <span id="s736">All of a sudden, you sit in the car and [indecipherable] sorry, then they pop up.</span> <span id="s737">And I think that’s enough.</span> <span id="s738">And -- but I can live with that, but th -- I learned from that to -- to have friends.</span> <span id="s739">I’m not a real national feeling person.</span> <span id="s740">I think Holland is a great country and I’m very happy that I was born there.</span> <span id="s741">We have a good security, a good living there.</span> <span id="s742">But I hate to watch soccer and get excited, you know, for the national team.</span> <span id="s743">National feelings makes me -- I -- gets an awkward feeling of we are people -- people, and I have my friends everywhere.</span> <span id="s744">Any kind of religion I don’t mind.</span> <span id="s745">And I don’t mind if they’re homosexual, or -- if they’re people and they are good people, they are my friends.</span> <span id="s746">And that’s the way I want to live, and maybe that’s my religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: I know that you, when you are at the Holocaust Museum, and we saw that wall where people had saved, at the end of the exhibit where they list the rescuers, we talked about there were so many people from the Netherlands listed, column after column after column for such a small country.</span> <span id="s748">How do you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s750">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s751">I didn’t know that there were so many Dutch people involved.</span> <span id="s752">I thought there was a complaint that we didn't do too much for the Jews.</span> <span id="s753">Moby -- maybe the people as a whole, but there was maybe the silent group that nobody talked a -- my father didn’t like to talk about it, that he was a kind of hero, you know, and he always, ah, it’s nothing.</span> <span id="s754">You know?</span> <span id="s755">He didn't want to have a medal or something, you know, that’s -- you th -- he didn't think it important.</span> <span id="s756">And -- but there are probably more people like that, and well, the list shows it, Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s758">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s759">Were you affected by the visit to the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, a lot of things I saw already.</span> <span id="s761">I saw a lot of movies on the Discovery channel about Germany and they still are going on and also the Holocaust or the -- the Hitler period, and I see them all and so I knew a lot about it already.</span> <span id="s762">And well, it always -- it -- it’s, when you look at it -- I really get angry if they deny it, that there was a -- a Holocaust in th -- in there.</span> <span id="s763">I think they are the greatest idiots to deny it.</span> <span id="s764">And -- but it doesn’t look real when you see all those corpses of those skinny people, you know, lying there.</span> <span id="s765">It -- it -- it -- it’s not real, it’s like that’s a drawing, you know, you don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s766">And the American soldiers when they came to the camps, they didn’t believe it either.</span> <span id="s767">But this -- the -- wh-wh-what kind of brain you -- do you have to do this, you know?</span> <span id="s768">Maybe a lot of Germans, well they didn’t like to do it either, but they had such a fear of not -- to become in -- the same prisoner, you know?</span> <span id="s769">Maybe.</span> <span id="s770">But I think in that case you have to make a decision.</span> <span id="s771">I would refuse.</span> <span id="s772">I think I would refuse to do it.</span> <span id="s773">And maybe you get killed, but I th -- I think I wouldn’t be able to live with the thought I didn't do anything, that this -- if you see this and then you are th -- fellow soldiers kill people and just shoot them, you know, and I can’t imagine that people can do that.</span> <span id="s774">I wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: You sound like you’ve inherited something from your father.</span> <span id="s776">How d -- just again, how do you explain his willingness to put himself at risk and his children at risk, to save another person’s life?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Well, it -- I told you before, it surprised me that he did it.</span> <span id="s778">And th-though it was supposed to be only three weeks and Mima Saina didn’t want him to go, Alfred, so he agreed.</span> <span id="s779">He is th -- he is the boss of the family, but he agreed, you know, so he must have felt a lot for the child, too.</span> <span id="s780">And well, decided to do it.</span> <span id="s781">I -- I can’t explain it, myself.</span> <span id="s782">But he was a peaceful man.</span> <span id="s783">I don’t think -- he couldn’t stand that Bobby would -- would have been taken by the Germans and would suffer, you know, and die or something, I -- I don’t think he would -- he’s cra -- he was really proud of Alfred, really proud.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: What was their relationship in later life?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Well, it was still Papa Madna, and it -- it was the only father he ever met, so yeah, it was a very good relation and it was very lucky that he saw him just one month before he died, he visit him.</span> <span id="s786">And he was ill, and -- but when I visit him, 10 days before his death, he was very healthy, he was good looking, and -- and he said well, you know -- I had a long talk with him.</span> <span id="s787">He said, it’s enough for me.</span> <span id="s788">I have to -- to swallow too many pills.</span> <span id="s789">And I said, well, you will o-outlive us, I told him.</span> <span id="s790">But then 10 days later I got a phone call from my brother and he said well, that he died, so -- and -- and Bobby came to the funeral, and at the funeral ceremony I had as many difficulties I as -- in the beginning as I had with my tears in the -- at the ceremony this time.</span> <span id="s791">But when I overcame that I said well, he was a man who took the risk to save a child’s life.</span> <span id="s792">He let the women do the work, that was always -- he did -- the women had to raise the child, he only had some wise remarks for us, don’t do this and don’t do that, but he was not the kind of father that really took care of the children mentally.</span> <span id="s793">He took care of us with clothing and food and -- but he didn’t like to take risks he said, but some-sometimes he was difficult.</span> <span id="s794">I didn’t really have a good contact with my father.</span> <span id="s795">Later, at the end maybe.</span> <span id="s796">But, he said well -- but he took the risk with him, and he was sitting there, yeah.</span> <span id="s797">Yeah, it was some moments.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Is there anything else you wanted to say before we end?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: No, I don’t -- th-there are maybe no -- more things, but there are so many.</span> <span id="s800">And we noticed when I talked to Bobby last night that there were o-other things we all of a sudden remembered out of the house, and th-the funny things that happened.</span> <span id="s801">But we -- we talked about the funny things.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Do you still feel like he is your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Oh yes, very much, very much.</span> <span id="s804">And especially the-these days when -- he brought us here at four o’clock yesterday and we had a drink in the bar, and then he picked us up at 7:30.</span> <span id="s805">I said, you know, I already missed you.</span> <span id="s806">So you have a good contact and I -- I told him, you spoiled us so much I -- I don’t think that I ever can go back to a normal life again.</span> <span id="s807">It’s hardly possible to pay anything and no, it was really an experience and I think we are even closer now than we w-were before.</span> <span id="s808">Also with Joel we have a good understanding and they are very lovely people.</span> <span id="s809">So it -- I hesitated to come to Washington, and -- but I am glad I did.</span> <span id="s810">I didn’t think that I would ever go to America again after my visit in Boston and Miami, because not too many things, and I met those -- and we met some congressmen yes-yesterday and they say hello to you and they say nice things and -- and I always had the feeling that they didn’t know we were there, you know.</span> <span id="s811">But we met other, nice people, real nice people that talked to us and -- and listened to us, so -- but I met the other kind of American, that is -- say, you have a nice day, but without meaning.</span> <span id="s812">T-Too many of them and that makes me -- well, also the things I don’t agree with.</span> <span id="s813">Like I -- I didn’t agree with Vietnam.</span> <span id="s814">I didn't agree with a lot of things.</span> <span id="s815">The -- the power and th-the -- be friendly but still that superior feeling they try to express.</span> <span id="s816">Also the music.</span> <span id="s817">We met at an -- I remember that the delegation from Miami that visited our school because we have connection with the University of Miami, the music department.</span> <span id="s818">They thought, well it’s always nice to have connection in Holland, you know, Europe.</span> <span id="s819">But they thought they were much better, and it wasn’t so.</span> <span id="s820">They were, really when they heard our students, [indecipherable] oh, how is this possible?</span> <span id="s821">So that gave me some anti feelings, but I know for sure that it’s the system sometimes I hate, but I met so -- so many nice people, too.</span> <span id="s822">Musicians.</span> <span id="s823">I met a lot of American musicians, played with a lot of American musicians, also famous guys, and they were very friendly.</span> <span id="s824">And when I met them sometimes seven years, they knew exactly who you were, huh?</span> <span id="s825">So it’s people, and not a nation.</span> <span id="s826">But I hope everything will go well.</span> <span id="s827">And Israel has a difficult period now.</span> <span id="s828">I hope everything -- because in Holland they are changing also, little bit.</span> <span id="s829">It’s a-about 50 percent a-against and 50 percent -- because we have also a lot of Moslems in Holland.</span> <span id="s830">But I think -- my opinion is that Israel has to fight back because they are surrounded by enemies.</span> <span id="s831">And I’m still for Israel and maybe not for Sharon, sure for Peres.</span> <span id="s832">And th-they are not really united.</span> <span id="s833">Th-They think different.</span> <span id="s834">They want peace, too.</span> <span id="s835">And maybe there are Palestinians that want peace, too.</span> <span id="s836">But I don’t want to go in politics.</span> <span id="s837">I think I have -- we have to bring the luggage down, eh?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Well, thank you very much for doing this interview.</span> <span
