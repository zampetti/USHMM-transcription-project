<html><body><p><span id="s1">George and Renee Tobias</span></p> <p><span id="s2">April 1, 1978</span></p> <p><span id="s3">G: I was born in 1923 in Danzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">Q: Did you grow up in Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">G: Grew up until the age of 14.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Can you tell me a little about your education in Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">G: Alright.</span> <span id="s8">I went to grammar school and then I went to the German Gymnasium for the first three years and then that was 1933 and then all the Jewish boys were thrown out of the German gymnasium and the Jewish community formed a Jewish gymnasium and I went there for another three years until I finished ober tertia which is five years of gymnasium and that was the end of my education in Germany.</span> <span id="s9">After that I went to France and continued my education there.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Up to the time you were thrown out of the gymnasium in 1933, what was your relationship with the non – Jewish children in the neighborhood, in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">G: First of all, let’s talk about the pre – school years that I can remember.</span> <span id="s12">We lived in an apartment house where there were about 10 apartments.</span> <span id="s13">Out of the 10 apartments, there were two families that had young children.</span> <span id="s14">One was a gentile family and the other a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s15">I played with the boys of both families without any distinction – there was absolutely as far as I can remember no difference in closeness between myself and the gentile family or the Jewish family.</span> <span id="s16">It was something that didn’t even come up.</span> <span id="s17">Then, we were talking about grammar school – in grammar school, there were perhaps three or four Jewish children in my various classes and I remember that the only time that the question came up was when the subject of religion was taught, the three or four Jewish kids got up and went to their religion class which was a class where practically the entire school was combined into – there were perhaps 20 Jewish children in the whole grammar school and that was the only time where a distinction was made.</span> <span id="s18">I don’t remember any incident in grammar school and this would be up to 1932.</span> <span id="s19">I don’t remember any incident where the Jewish question came up in the least – not from any of the children and not from any of the teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: In 1933, you had to leave the school...</span></p> <p><span id="s21">G: No, that was grammar school.</span> <span id="s22">I went to grammar school from 1928 to 1932 and then I transferred – I must have gone to gymnasium in 1932 and as I said, in grammar school, I don’t remember anything or any incident coming up in anti – Semitism absolutely none.</span> <span id="s23">There wasn’t even a question about what are you or are you Jewish.</span> <span id="s24">I don’t remember anything like that.</span> <span id="s25">Danzig had perhaps somewhere in the neighborhood of six or seven gymnasiums.</span> <span id="s26">Out of the 6 or 7 gymnasiums – we had one Polish gymnasium because Danzig after all was a free state – apart from Germany – had it’s own government but the Polish railroads ran the railroad system of Danzig and there was a Polish post office so there were somewhere around 2,000 Poles living in Danzig and they had their own gymnasium.</span> <span id="s27">This was an entirely different colony so to speak.</span> <span id="s28">Basically, Danzig was a German city.</span> <span id="s29">Out of these seven gymnasiums, I went to one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Was it a free choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">G: Absolutely free choice.</span> <span id="s32">I would say in those days Danzig was a fairly representative city as far as economics of German cities were concerned.</span> <span id="s33">I would say that 20% of the school population went to gymnasium – 80% went to vocational schools.</span> <span id="s34">That is fairly representative of all Germany.</span> <span id="s35">You picked the gymnasium in accordance with your future plans.</span> <span id="s36">My parents had plans that I should study medicine simply because I had a few uncles who were doctors.</span> <span id="s37">This was not a foregone conclusion but it was something of a preference.</span> <span id="s38">Now if your education was geared toward the study of medicine or law, there was a greater emphasis on Latin and on liberal arts than on the technical subjects like mathematics and physics so you went to a gymnasium – they called it in those days humanitsches gymnasium rather than the real gymnasium which was geared toward the technical subjects.</span> <span id="s39">So I went to the humanistic gymnasium – that was the one where you started your first foreign language was Latin and then ancient Greek and then you started with the living languages whereas in the Real Gymnasium you started with either English or French.</span> <span id="s40">So, I must have finished grammar school in 1932 and gone to the humanistic gymnasium and in the first year, I don’t remember – there may have been about 3 Jewish boys in a class of about 25 or 30.</span> <span id="s41">I did not feel any kind of discrimination and as far as my friends were concerned I probably had as much of a social relationship with gentile boys as I had with Jewish boys at that particular time.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: When was the cut – off point when you had to go to the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">G: Okay, now let me think – approximately a year later – that must have been in 1933 when Hitler came to power, in Germany the Nazis had not yet seized power in Danzig.</span> <span id="s44">Danzig was still teetering – it still had a socialistic kind of coalition in the Parliament.</span> <span id="s45">So in my second year, the only thing that happened was that there appeared all of a sudden in the gymnasium a bunch of Hitler Youth uniforms and I don’t ever remember getting any kind of feedback from boys in my own class but I remember getting verbal let’s say slander from strangers in the school who might have recognized that I had Jewish features or something like this or I may have been pointed out as a Jew and once in a while, I would hear myself being called dirty Jew or something like that.</span> <span id="s46">That was perhaps the first time that I heard anything like that.</span> <span id="s47">And this was also the time when the Nazis first made an open appearance in the street – where you had S.S. or S.A contingents marching through the streets singing Nazi songs.</span> <span id="s48">They were permitted to do so because under the Danzig Parliamentary law which was by the way, I don’t know if I should digress but the government of Danzig was completely patterned according to the United States government.</span> <span id="s49">They had a lower house which was called Volkstag and an upper house which was called Senate and the only difference between the American system and the Danzig system was instead of having an elected president, the League of Nations appointed a High Commissioner who ultimately had the right to veto anything which the Danzig Parliament would declare – who by the way was only a figurehead...</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: I’ll come back to that in a moment because it plays a role in what happens in Danzig but I wanted to get back to school for a moment...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">G: Okay, now comes 1933 – my third year in school.</span> <span id="s52">Something very drastic happened.</span> <span id="s53">The old director retires – the school director and he is replaced by a principal who is an avowed Nazi who comes into the classroom and sets the law right then and there that first of all at the beginning of every school day, every body had to get up and salute the Hitler salute and he even, the first time he came into the classroom he asked the question are there any Jews in this class?</span> <span id="s54">So I got up and a couple of the other Jewish boys got up and he said something to the effect now take a good look at these boys – at these three – because they are the cause of all our ills and they are only out for one thing and that is rabach.</span> <span id="s55">And he calls on me and he says, explain to your classmates what the word rabach means.</span> <span id="s56">I had never heard the word before so he said – he made a bad remark that I was a liar in front of the class.</span> <span id="s57">This was the ultimate aim of the Jew – to make rabach and that means to exploit everybody else for their own benefit.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: As an eleven year old boy, that must have been very hard...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">G: Yes, it was but at the same time – it had already started – I got already a little bit shoved around.</span> <span id="s60">At that time I was never really beaten up but I used to get an elbow in the ribs in a corridor – not by my classmates – but it was visible that there were anti – Semitic stirrings and they were done on purpose.</span> <span id="s61">It was nothing terribly problematic because boys shove each other around out of pure fun and that happens in schools everywhere but to get an elbow into the ribs just out of nowhere, you know that the reason for it was just plain – he’s a Jew boy, let’s give him an elbow.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: In your own class, did any of your classmates come to your defense?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">G: No, they did not come to my defense but I did not feel myself ostracized or I did not feel that anyone – first of all, no matter what school you go to, you only have maybe three or four buddies.</span> <span id="s64">The rest is kind of – you know you are indifferent to.</span> <span id="s65">But even the ones I was indifferent to and even if they came in Nazi uniforms which a few did, I never experienced any act of verbal or physical attack.</span> <span id="s66">You can’t feel ostracism of you are indifferent to the boys so they – those who I was not friendly with before, what difference did they make and those that I was friendly with absolutely remained friends with me even after I left that school so there was really no – I never experienced any act of – even negative thing due to this action on the part of the principal.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did the principal continue to harass the Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">G: Well, he would drop in every once in a while and say something derogatory about the Jews.</span> <span id="s69">Interestingly enough, his name was Heydrich – I don’t know if he spelled it like the Czechoslovakian Heydrich or whether perhaps it was the same Heydrich but this man was a fanatic Jew – hater but the rest of the faculty had remained basically unchanged and I must say in all fairness, that I never felt the slightest bit of anti – Semitism from any of my teachers – not any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">QL When such things happen like the time with the rabach, did you go home and tell your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">G: Oh yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: How did they try to explain this whole situation to you as an eleven year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">G: They didn’t really have to explain too much to me because my parents were quite concerned – my father particularly was very concerned about the Nazis from way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What do you mean way back?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">G: Even back to the late 1920’s – he sensed that this could very easily get into a serious matter – that there were too many organized people, and organized Jew – hating and so on.</span> <span id="s76">And the combination of things happening – the S.A. marching through the streets, the Stuermer coming out and being displayed in public places , all these – if you had even as a ten or eleven year old, you were conscious of the fact that there was a political party that called themselves Nazis who were out and out Jew haters and anti – Jew in every respect and that it would be of utmost necessity to contain this faction in order to have peace or quiet...</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What type of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">G: Textiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Self – employed?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">G: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Retail?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">G: Both.</span> <span id="s83">We had a retail and a wholesale store.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did the Nazis coming to power in 1933 affect your father’s business then?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">G: Yes.</span> <span id="s86">To some extent it did.</span> <span id="s87">This is a paradoxical thing – this by the way brings to mind this Skokie proposition that is going to come up now.</span> <span id="s88">The Constitution of Danzig had declared complete freedom of – political freedom and you actually had a 11 parties had their own uniforms, had their own columns marching except that the Nazis were particularly military in their overt aspect – they did more marching than anyone.</span> <span id="s89">But whenever there was a march going on, it might be socialists or communists who would all of a sudden come out from around a corner with clubs and would result in a fight of some sort but the Nazis were actually given the freedom of organizing themselves and of walking around with placards in front of Jewish stores and to boycott – just like a picket and they took advantage of that as early as 1933 – immediately after the Nazis seized power in Germany although they did not yet have a majority in the Parliament, nevertheless as a minority they were very well organized and they started to picket stores and it was more of an annoyance in the beginning because the people who wanted to buy from Jews did so anyhow.</span> <span id="s90">They may have been shouted at just like if you go into a store here while the employees are on strike.</span> <span id="s91">You cannot pinpoint the loss of business due to the Nazis because the era coincided with the depression.</span> <span id="s92">Don’t forget, when you are talking about 1932 or 33, you don’t know if the hard times as far as business is concerned was caused – I have a hunch it was caused more by the economic situation which existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: But the follow up is that business increased in general as Hitler got Germany out of the depression.</span> <span id="s94">Under normal circumstances, business should have prospered as time went on...</span></p> <p><span id="s95">G: My father’s business was not a criterion because he switched from his own textile business about the time – 1933 – and became a factory representative from various industries on the continent who were exporting to Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s96">My father took advantage of the fact that Danzig was located on the Baltic and was an excellent distribution point for Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s97">So he switched from a wholesale and retail business to a distributorship.</span> <span id="s98">So far as his career is concerned, I cannot really point anything towards any political thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did he travel to the Scandinavian countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">G: Yes.</span> <span id="s101">He traveled there frequently and was always very much impressed by the Scandinavian countries – for him it was always a great relief because these heavy war clouds that were on the horizon bothered him a great deal and every time he came back from there, he would rave about the fact that everything was so nice and peaceful there.</span> <span id="s102">Also, there are other things which might interest you about my father.</span> <span id="s103">My father’s only avid sport was bowling and he got himself into a German bowling league.</span> <span id="s104">I think one other man and he were in a bowling club – a sports club.</span> <span id="s105">This bowling club may have had 100 members and my father was a very good bowler – he was a very popular guy – he was one of the boys.</span> <span id="s106">This was a bowling club which was comprised of a fairly nice cross section – bourgeois, upper middle class type of people.</span> <span id="s107">They had some bowling clubs which were mostly proletarian but this one was upper middle class.</span> <span id="s108">He had a very interesting pipe line – through some freak this bowling club was very popular and there were three high ranking police officers of the Danzig police that were members and they are probably responsible for having – as a matter of fact they are responsible for our survival as our family goes because way back in 1932, they were already warning my father about things that were going on.</span> <span id="s109">They knew that in Germany the Gestapo was making – building concentration camps.</span> <span id="s110">They were the ones who told my father – Joe, if things continue the way they do, we advise you to look around because as far as we are concerned, Germany holds no future for the Jews.</span> <span id="s111">They were extremely good in retrospect.</span> <span id="s112">These police officers influenced my father’s thinking and foresight and this will explain something later on why I was one of the first youngsters in Danzig who was sent out by their parents to other countries.</span> <span id="s113">But to go back to the general atmosphere as it existed in school in those first two years of gymnasium, it was quite tolerable.</span> <span id="s114">By the way, when I related these maligning incidents of the new principal to my father, he went to school and complained about it, especially as a World War 1 veteran – you know, they were very, very sensitive about that – frontkaempfer but it didn’t get him anyplace.</span> <span id="s115">At the same time, the same type of situation occurred in the other gymnasiums and this also coincided with the preferred discharge of Jewish teachers in Germany proper.</span> <span id="s116">Apparently when the Jewish community in Danzig organized to form their own Jewish gymnasium they advertised for teachers who had been dismissed in Germany and this small gymnasium was built up with a fantastic teaching staff.</span> <span id="s117">Actually we had college professors teaching us on a secondary level.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Were you notified that you could no longer go to the gymnasium you were attending?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">G: No, I was never notified.</span> <span id="s120">I could have – I don’t know how long I could have stayed in the German gymnasium.</span> <span id="s121">By the time I was in the third year – quarter – I must have been around 12 by that time, these verbal attacks became more frequent but they were certainly nothing that a person could not have tolerated.</span> <span id="s122">I was fairly – I was annoyed by them but they didn’t make a tremendous impact on me.</span> <span id="s123">I was complaining about it at home but at the same time, we were aware that the Jewish gymnasium was formed.</span> <span id="s124">So why continue in an atmosphere which became more adverse or more unpleasant if you have a Jewish gymnasium.</span> <span id="s125">At the same time also, for instance one of the things which were very annoying and embarrassing was that one of the courses was music and from 1933 on – the music course was basically singing and what did they sing, they sang Schubert and things like this – all of a sudden, they had a repertoire of Nazi marching songs.</span> <span id="s126">Now the 2 or 3 Jews in the class absolutely – the teacher said right away – boys, you don’t have to sing along.</span> <span id="s127">Even the music teacher who was forced to instruct the boys in these songs – I had the feeling that his heart wasn’t in it at all.</span> <span id="s128">But it was an imposition to be sitting there listening to this.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Did they ever have any instruction along political lines?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">G: No.</span> <span id="s131">This was the only thing I remember of Nazi nature being taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: When you switched over to the Jewish school, as a 12 year old, did you like the idea of making the switch?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">G: I was happy about it.</span> <span id="s134">First of all, this was not an easy thing.</span> <span id="s135">The Jewish gymnasium was a Real Gymnasium so I had to take cram courses in French and English to get me up to date because I had had Latin and Greek so I had to catch up.</span> <span id="s136">But this didn’t annoy me and I felt quite happy.</span> <span id="s137">This was also a time where things happened very very fast.</span> <span id="s138">The fact that more and more German boys came into school with Nazi uniforms, there was a Zionist Scout organization called Maccabi Hazair which was non – political Zionist – let’s put it this way, it was a Zionist organization but a boy scout organization so that it did not have any leanings as to revisionists or the Habonim which were the left Zionists.</span> <span id="s139">They were wearing boy scout uniforms – traditional boy scout uniforms with a boy scout hat and boy scout pants and we were very proud to wear boy scout uniforms while the Nazi boys were wearing Nazi uniforms.</span> <span id="s140">Among 13 and 14 year olds this was a matter of pride.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Did they speak much about Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">G: Oh it was entirely Zionist.</span> <span id="s143">The difference was this – we had youngsters who belonged to the Betar which was the revisionist wing like the Irgun or Likud.</span> <span id="s144">They had Habonim which were socialist Zionists like the Histadrut people and they had kids belonging to factional type groups whereas we were Zionists but we did not commit ourselves to any internal political leanings left or right.</span> <span id="s145">We were Zionist boy scouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: How much discussion was there about going to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">G: The whole direction was geared toward Palestine.</span> <span id="s148">I know what you are driving at because in the gymnasium there was an entire faction who were absolutely avidly anti – Zionist.</span> <span id="s149">I remember the JJB – Jung Judischer Bund – they were first Germans and then they were Jews and they were absolutely appalled about thinking about emigration to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How did belonging to this organization either influence or conflict with discussions that you were hearing at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">G: First of all, my father was probably not a Zionist in the idealistic sense, but he was certainly – he recognized the eventual necessity of getting out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: We’re talking 1934 – 5?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">G: Yes.</span> <span id="s154">He was one of the few at that time.</span> <span id="s155">He might have been considered a prophet of doom at the time but he definitely considered Palestine as a possible destination although he didn’t have strong leanings in that direction.</span> <span id="s156">Getting out was more important than where to get out to.</span> <span id="s157">He was sympathetic to Zionism although he was not a Zionist.</span> <span id="s158">The fact that my Zionist organization was a true boy scout organization without any political commitment probably pleased my parents but I think it was less that.</span> <span id="s159">I would say that perhaps the most important factor was that there was a social status involved too.</span> <span id="s160">The wealthiest and the oldest Danzig families – now my father was born Viennese and he came to Danzig as an outsider so to speak after WW1 – the old Danzig Jewish families considered themselves quite aristocratic and their children belonged to the JJB which was certainly anything but Zionist.</span> <span id="s161">They were the ones that felt that in this bastion of culture – Germany – nothing barbaric like the prophets of doom were predicting could ever happen and their children belonged to the JJB.</span> <span id="s162">But of the Zionist faction, the nicest element belonged to this Maccabi Hazair.</span> <span id="s163">The Habonim had more the proletarian kind of kids – the children of tailors and butchers – the tradespeople.</span> <span id="s164">So my parents were happy that I belonged there because it was a nice type of youngster who belonged.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: During all this time, your father’s occupation as a sales representative was...</span></p> <p><span id="s166">G: Was continuing and was – there was a noticeable increase in business when you go towards 1935, 6, 7.</span> <span id="s167">Things were looking up.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Do you remember when he came home from the Scandinavian countries, any conversations about perspectives that he may have gotten about Germany from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">G: No, I don’t think that he – I don’t remember him talking in this vein because he probably relied more on what he saw in Germany than what the Scandinavians may have been thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Danzig was under the auspices of the League at the time, did your family think that this was adequate protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">G: No, definitely not.</span> <span id="s172">In the first place, the population of Danzig – Danzig was a German area, a German enclave, which was actually not under the jurisdiction of Germany.</span> <span id="s173">Like many of the border Germans who were living on the outside of Germany, you had a much more fervent nationalism than the Germans themselves.</span> <span id="s174">I don’t know – you may have heard that from people who lived in Silesia or in the Alsace or if you take the Czechoslovakian situation – you always find that the Germans that lived outside the borders of Germany but adjacent to Germany were extremely militant in their outlook – they were much more nationalistic Germans – they had to be – so that you find that the excesses of those nationalistic Germans – first of all, they found that the Nazi party was the answer to their prayer – as far as expressing nationalism was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What about their fervor about rejoining Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">G: Oh, absolutely, that’s conditia sine qua non.</span> <span id="s177">As far as making Danzig part of the Riech – that was of course, condition no.1 As a matter of fact, in the elections of 1935, the Nazis actually gained the majority in the Volkstag – the lower house – and thus the government actually became a Nazi government – they made the laws in Danzig.</span> <span id="s178">There was still a conflict because the Senate did not have a Nazi majority and there was the High Commissioner with veto power.</span> <span id="s179">But the whole thing tipped the scales all of a sudden – it was like the dam burst – there was no doubt about it – Danzig is German and we are going to rejoin the Reich and from what I know now, the population of Danzig was much more Nazi oriented then for instance what I hear my wife telling me about Stuttgart – they weren’t that fervently Nazi.</span> <span id="s180">And since anti – Semitism was one of the great mainstays or doctrines of the Nazi party and since basically the Jews of Danzig were a rather affluent group – they found a very natural outlet.</span> <span id="s181">There was no doubt in my mind that if there was any place where things would be bad – it would be in Danzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you see signs Juden Verboten or Juden Unerwuenscht?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">G: Not yet.</span> <span id="s184">Danzig didn’t have it yet.</span> <span id="s185">That was something which came only after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s186">Up to 1938, there were no restrictions in public places.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: At what point do you remember first hearing discussions that you must leave Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">G: It must have been around 1937 because I remember that it was in 1937 that we applied for emigration visas to the United States and at that time also, there was something very interesting which was peculiar to Danzig.</span> <span id="s189">Danzig had it’s own monetary system and also it’s own monetary laws.</span> <span id="s190">And Danzig didn’t have any monetary restrictions.</span> <span id="s191">You were unable to – Germany already had laws that restricted the flow of money to other countries.</span> <span id="s192">Danzig was like the United States – there was a complete freedom of flow of money which enabled parents who wanted to send their children abroad to study to send them because there was no restriction as far as getting the money out to enable them to do this.</span> <span id="s193">So, I had relatives in France who were writing –who heard about what was going on and who were corresponding and saying look, since you agree with us that Germany has no future, why don’t you let George come to France and in France his future is certainly more secure than in Germany.</span> <span id="s194">My parents discussed this and they asked me how I felt about it – I was quite mature.</span> <span id="s195">First of all, I must tell you that anti – Semitism became more overt after I had switched schools – now we’re talking about 1936 and I’m already in the Jewish gymnasium and the Nazis are a majority and you can see more and more kids in Hitler Youth Uniforms and we had aside from the Maccabi Hazair – we also had – every Jewish kid went to the Tourn Verein.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Sports group?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">G: Yes, it was the Bar Kochba or the Maccabi.</span> <span id="s198">In Northern Germany it was the Bar Kochba and we had our own gym and twice a week – I think Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 6 to 8, we had gym – this was in addition to athletics in school.</span> <span id="s199">We also had this gym and we had incidents where some of the Nazi kids – it was quite a long walk – it must have been a 20 minute walk – from the gym to my house and they knew I was coming out of the gym and one time, I was quite heavily roughed up.</span> <span id="s200">They accosted me – about 4 or 5 of them and I came home bloodied up and this was quite something – you know a Jewish mother, Jewish parents get quite hysterical when their 14 year old comes home all bloodied up and when the relatives from France say, why don’t you have him come to France?</span> <span id="s201">In parenthesis, I might say that in the Maccabi Hazair, we organized – if any of us was roughed up in going home by ourselves, we started a system whereby 6 or 7 of us followed the particular fellow a block away and there were – there was later one thing one thing which during World War 11 bore out again and made me quite contemptible about the German Army.</span> <span id="s202">The German Army was always beautifully – an organized and oiled machine as long as it had the upper hand.</span> <span id="s203">The moment that they found a match – they disintegrated very fast.</span> <span id="s204">Whenever we had an incident where we suspected that they would pounce – 5 or 6 of them would pounce on one guy, 7 or 8 of us would follow and if we just ran towards those 5 or 6, they made an about face and ran away – they never got into a fight – those Nazi boys – unless they had a 4-1 majority.</span> <span id="s205">It gave you a very interesting insight to the German character as far as courage is concerned – personal courage.</span> <span id="s206">From my earliest observations as a boy fighting with Germans and then later on, during the war, I’ve always had the impression that the Germans really had an inferiority complex about their own prowess – they want to live up to the Germanic legends of great physical feats of courage and I have never been able to see man to man that a German would be a particularly courageous fighter.</span> <span id="s207">During WW 11, every country that the Nazis occupied had underground organizations which were taking pot shots at the Nazis and sabotaging them left and right, when the Allies occupied Germany, there was not one German who ever lifted one little finger against the occupying authorities.</span> <span id="s208">I knew that very early – they were great heroes when they were in the majority...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: In relation to that, as a 13 old boy, how did you feel about not being accepted by this growing group of your own age group?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">G: I would say there was a sense of isolation.</span> <span id="s211">I would say I was convinced that there was no future in Danzig or even in Germany.</span> <span id="s212">I was convinced that I would have a new life outside of Germany – whether it was in America or in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: But as a 13 year old...</span></p> <p><span id="s214">G: I would imagine every child has vague plans of where he is going to live – perhaps our youngsters might have ideas about California, that they might not stay here in the East – but my own feelings were quite pronounced.</span> <span id="s215">I knew there was a kind of day to day temporariness about my life.</span> <span id="s216">You saw things going on – for instance, the fact that your teachers had come out of Germany and they regarded Danzig only as a stepping stone to – it gave them a breathing spell to resettle themselves.</span> <span id="s217">In 1936-7, there was an equal division between those people who thought that the whole thing was temporary and was going to blow over and those who were pessimistic or realistic enough to know that it was time to make plans to get out and this was reinforced by the fact that there were people – not only professors – but there were other people from Germany who came to Danzig just to use Danzig as a stepping stone and there were all kinds of rumors that came from Germany.</span> <span id="s218">Well, of course the Nuremburg Laws were the first fantastic disappointment...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: But were they put into effect in Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">G: No, they were not in effect in Danzig at all.</span> <span id="s221">But they were close enough that basically it was a great disturbance and the rumors about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s222">Those who didn’t believe thought it was a rumor – those who did believe it knew in their hearts that it was true.</span> <span id="s223">My father’s buddies in the police dept. assured him that it was true.</span> <span id="s224">That they had their pipeline in Germany – that they were drinking with some fellows in the police dept. and they were telling them that the Gestapo boys were preparing concentration camps and that they had some in operation already.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What did the word mean at the time to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">G: To me it meant something synonymous to a prison camp.</span> <span id="s227">I did not – I imagined something like chain gang type of thing that you saw in American movies.</span> <span id="s228">I don’t know who gave me the idea – whether I asked my father – what is a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s229">It was vague in those days.</span> <span id="s230">So, I was one of the first in my school, where my parents were considering taking me out and sending me out of Danzig.</span> <span id="s231">It is difficult now to remember what my feelings were – they were probably extremely mixed.</span> <span id="s232">First of all, in every youth of 14, there is a certain amount of romanticism if he has a chance to go to a foreign country.</span> <span id="s233">And from early childhood, I was fanatic about traveling in general.</span> <span id="s234">I had accompanied my father, as I told you, he was Viennese and we had gone back on occasion to Austria where his relatives lived.</span> <span id="s235">I had accompanied my father several times to Scandinavia – I loved to travel.</span> <span id="s236">This is probably also one of the reasons why I am in my profession.</span> <span id="s237">And so the idea of going to France was kind of romantic.</span> <span id="s238">Don’t forget also the entire somberness of growing up in the early 30’s – I’m sure I must have had the kind of – I’m sure I was way ahead of for instance what our youth would be thinking of.</span> <span id="s239">Our concern with future must have been present in the same way as perhaps an 18 year old American kid is.</span> <span id="s240">We were much more conscious about things at a much earlier age because of the rumblings that were on the horizon so that I could also understand the wisdom of getting out of Germany.</span> <span id="s241">I could also – you give a teen – age child a chance to get out of his parent’s home, it means a certain amount of freedom.</span> <span id="s242">From a purely psychological point of view, I don’t know how I felt but it was a positive feeling.</span> <span id="s243">I think I had very little apprehension about leaving.</span> <span id="s244">I felt perfectly secure because I was going to a country where I had relatives who actually wanted me to come...</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">G: Yes, an only child.</span> <span id="s247">There was no doubt that I could return home on vacations which turned to be correct for a couple of years and even though in today’s terms, it is not a great distance, in those days to go to France from Danzig across all of Germany – it was quite a distance involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Where did you go in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">G: I went to a small town called Besancon, which was in the French Jura not far from the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s250">The reason we settled...interestingly enough, my family was in Paris and the good secondary schools in and around Paris were quite hard to get into – they were swamped.</span> <span id="s251">And very good friends of ours had their relatives in Besancon and this was a sort of completely forgotten place which had a super high school – as a matter of fact, it’s the birthplace of Victor Hugo and the relatives of these friends of ours said that they would be happy to have me stay at their house and that the school was wide open – there would be no problem.</span> <span id="s252">So, instead of waiting for a year or more to get into one of the good schools around Paris, I was able to go there right away.</span> <span id="s253">This created quite a hassle in the Danzig gymnasium.</span> <span id="s254">I think I kind of started an avalanche because immediately, as I was telling my friends of leaving Danzig to go and study – immediately everybody who had family in England, in France, in Holland started making enquiries and saw the validity of such thinking and the management of the school was quite unhappy about that.</span> <span id="s255">They said why start a panic and so on – it isn’t that acute.</span> <span id="s256">Well, first of all the management of the school was probably of that faction which did not want to believe that things were so serious and secondly, it was a matter of losing tuition.</span> <span id="s257">Out of my class which was ober tertia which was the fifth year of high school, I would say about 5 or 6 boys or girls – by the way this was my first experience of co – ed schooling because the grammar schools and gymnasiums were separate but the Jewish one was co – ed.</span> <span id="s258">5 or 6 that left very shortly after I did.</span> <span id="s259">Actually I was the first one to leave and that was in the winter of 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Just to clarify for myself.</span> <span id="s261">You mentioned that your parents had applied for a visa to the United States also in 1937.</span> <span id="s262">Did they have relatives here?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">G: Yes.</span> <span id="s264">We had cousins here and we did apply for a visa but it was a matter of routing.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: A precaution?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">G: Yes.</span> <span id="s267">They had not even – they got in touch with the cousins here and they were of course asking them to procure affidavits.</span> <span id="s268">Telephone rings.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: We were talking about leaving the gymnasium and going to the school in the Jura.</span> <span id="s270">Do you remember the day that you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">G: Definitely.</span> <span id="s272">It’s entirely clear in my mind.</span> <span id="s273">As a matter of fact, my father accompanied me up to Berlin and from there, I went to Besancon.</span> <span id="s274">I remember I changed trains in Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s275">One interesting factor that I might mention – if you were a Danzig citizen, the free city of Danzig had their own passports.</span> <span id="s276">Now I didn’t have a Danzig passport – I had an Austrian passport because in Europe your nationality comes after your father.</span> <span id="s277">My father being Viennese had an Austrian passport – regardless of where I was born or lived, I was automatically an Austrian.</span> <span id="s278">So, when it came to travel, I had to go to the Austrian consulate and get myself an Austrian passport.</span> <span id="s279">So I traveled on an Austrian passport and in 1937, Austria was still a sovereign country.</span> <span id="s280">I did not need any visa as an Austrian for either Germany or France.</span> <span id="s281">All I needed was the passport.</span> <span id="s282">My father accompanied me to Berlin where we had relatives and he had some business and I went from Berlin on – I took a train to Strasbourg and changed there for another train to Besancon and this was quite a traumatic situation because as it turned out, I arrived in Besancon after a night on the train and at the station – I was standing there.</span> <span id="s283">I had thought that I would be picked up by these people but there was nobody there and there was a Frenchman standing there with his car and he saw me there with my suitcase looking disappointed so he said what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s284">And I said I had hoped to be picked up and he said where do these people live and I gave him the address and he said I’m passing by and I’ll give you a lift.</span> <span id="s285">The railroad station was quite a bit away from where they lived and he dropped me there and this was the first time I had any encounter with what it meant to be in a state of emigration.</span> <span id="s286">These people – these relatives of our friends who lived in Besancon – had lived in Schweinfurt, Germany before they left Germany a year before this.</span> <span id="s287">They had come to France in economic straits and the building in which they could afford to live was probably something like medieval – maybe 14th or 15th century.</span> <span id="s288">For a youngster who has grown up in an upper middle – class home which was quite comfortable which was the equivalent of the type of home that I have here – to come to a house which was located in I wouldn’t say slum but certainly in a poor section of town – very old building – walking up an outside stairway.</span> <span id="s289">First you had to go into a courtyard.</span> <span id="s290">In the courtyard – it was not unsimilar to New York fire escape, the stairway was outside going up to the fourth floor with one toilet to each floor on these outside verandas – quite impoverished looking – the apartment itself.</span> <span id="s291">So, you come to a foreign country and you’re dumped into a set – up which was quite a bit different then than the set – up that you had.</span> <span id="s292">I dumped my bags and went out in the street and I walked around in the street crying for about 3 or 4 hours and I came back and I was quite unhappy.</span> <span id="s293">And the next day, in the building, there were 2 or 3 chaps my own age they said, come along, we’re going out to play football or whatever, and twenty four hours later, everything was roses because these young fellows were just buddies and they were very curious about where I had come from and then a day or two later, I went to that school And I was kind of a novelty there and everybody hung around me and they were highly – you know in those days – the Bosch – in France, you’re enemy is my enemy.</span> <span id="s294">If you left because of the Bosch, you’re a friend of ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did you encounter much anti – Germany feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">G: Oh yes, the French were quite – they had quite a complex about the Bosch – they were extremely paranoid about the Germans.</span> <span id="s297">You can’t wipe out something like – this is only 18, 19 years after the end of WW1.</span> <span id="s298">France had lost 2 million of the flower of their youth.</span> <span id="s299">This was a tremendous trauma...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: In terms of yourself, did they regard you as a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">G: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s302">First of all, I was very careful to avoid the word German because I had an Austrian passport so – even through Austria was German ally, they were considered by the French as being much more docile.</span> <span id="s303">But aside from that, they knew that the Germans persecuted the Jews and they knew that I had come because of the German persecution of the Jew...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: How were you aware of all of this in the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">G: I was.</span> <span id="s306">You were quite aware of things that went on.</span> <span id="s307">You saw it in the press – you saw it all around you.</span> <span id="s308">You knew that the French had no love for the Germans and therefore, you were very quick to make them understand that you were a refugee from the Germans and I was very anxious to have the record set clear – that I was an Austrian number one and that I was getting out of Danzig because of what is going on in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Was French a problem for you – I know you had said you had studied it?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">G: It took me three days to be – to have absolutely no problem in getting along and it took maybe two months to be fluent.</span> <span id="s311">At that age, it is no problem at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: These people that you stayed with...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">G: They were paid room and board – this was arranged in advance and the French schools were free so I didn’t have to pay for schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: How did they receive you?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">G: They treated me very well.</span> <span id="s316">First of all, they had two daughters and one of them was my age and they briefed me how to get along in French and with Frenchman and at the same time, as I mentioned, when the kids in the apartment heard that I had arrived, they came up and they took me out to play and to go on hikes and whatever have you.</span> <span id="s317">And there was one kid who went to the same school and we walked together and the status that I had in the first – I arrived in January and school ended the first of July – my status was that of a non – matriculated student.</span> <span id="s318">I would sit there and not be responsible for anything from the point of view of tests – just a listener – for the first – up to July.</span> <span id="s319">Then I would be quizzed by my professors and they would decide where I would fit into the school system.</span> <span id="s320">This caused absolutely no interruption – as it turned out, I was then for the next year put into the same grade that I would have had if I had stayed in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: On your vacation, did you return to Danzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">G: Yes, I returned and then I came back after the vacation and in early 1939, I made my baccalaureate from high school and then I went back to Danzig during the Easter vacation in 1939.</span> <span id="s323">That was after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s324">The Jews had to move together by then.</span> <span id="s325">But there was one event which came before.</span> <span id="s326">The Germans occupied Austria in 1938 and I had to turn in my Austrian passport and get a German passport instead.</span> <span id="s327">If I had been a Danzig citizen, I still would have had a Danzig passport but I got a German passport with a J on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: In 1938 already?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">G: Immediately, because the Austrian passports were declared null and void by the Germans and so you had to turn in your Austrian passport...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Where did you get this German passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">G: At the nearest consulate in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: When you went to the consulate...</span></p> <p><span id="s333">G: I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s334">I mailed the Austrian passport in and they mailed me a German passport back.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: When you saw this “J” on...</span></p> <p><span id="s336">G: It didn’t surprise me at all because I knew that others had gotten it so it didn’t surprise me in the least but it caused me a good deal of annoyance.</span> <span id="s337">I had made a few trips home as an Austrian and I was completely unmolested at the borders and the first time, I went back with that passport with a J on it, I really got the treatment by the Gestapo – by the border guard, always interrogated, and then, I remember, I went home during the Easter vacation of 1939.</span> <span id="s338">This was the first vacation that I went home since – in November, 1938 was the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s339">I went home in April, 1939 and that was an entirely different proposition.</span> <span id="s340">It was a gloomy situation.</span> <span id="s341">I remember, my parents had had to vacate their apartment and had to move together with two other families in one apartment – 3 families were occupying one apartment.</span> <span id="s342">There was an atmosphere of panic in Danzig...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: How did you notice or feel this atmosphere of panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">G: Well, first of all, the mere fact that these people were forced to live together – they had to by law move together.</span> <span id="s345">A Jewish family was not allowed to occupy more than one room or a certain amount of space.</span> <span id="s346">They all had lost, each and every one of them had lost or abandoned their businesses and they all concentrated on one thing – where will we go?</span> <span id="s347">Argentina, Cuba, United States – everybody was just running wild – where will we go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Along these lines, how did they get information about where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">G: They were grasping at anything, just to give you an example – what happened to my parents and this of course was a blessing in disguise which if it had been successful would have ended in sure death.</span> <span id="s350">They had – the Germans had a sort of planned vacation type thing – the Nazis had – which they called “Kraft durch Freude” – that was Strength through Joy and they had trips – organized package trips and one of those trips was a steamer cruise to the Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania – and this steamer stopped in Danzig and took on some Nazis from Danzig and people who wanted to pay for this and went on to the Baltic.</span> <span id="s351">And my father had the idea of just getting off in Riga, in Latvia and just walk down the gangplank and with a few thousand marks in his pocket or something and see what he could do about establishing a temporary toehold and waiting to go somewhere outside of Europe.</span> <span id="s352">This was 1939 and in 1938 had been the first crisis – the Chamberlain – Daladier Munich talks and WW 11 was temporarily averted but for how long?</span> <span id="s353">And Czechoslovakia had already been occupied and it could happen any day so you get out and maybe if there’s a stepping stone like Latvia.</span> <span id="s354">What happened was that everybody could go ashore in Riga but they had to give their passports to the purser and just before the steamer landed in Riga, an announcement came over the loudspeaker – Mr. and Mrs. Tobias, come to the purser’s office.</span> <span id="s355">And there, they were informed that as a Jew, you are not allowed to get off and take a shore excursion.</span> <span id="s356">So they had to stay on board and come right back and when they came to Danzig, they were allowed to get off.</span> <span id="s357">So that didn’t work.</span> <span id="s358">If it had worked, I imagine they would never have gotten out of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: You’re father intended to take money – had money how did he at that point I don’t think you were allowed to leave Germany with more than ten RM (money).</span></p> <p><span id="s360">G: It was not Germany yet – it was still the free city of Danzig, there was nothing against the law – if he had a million dollars he could have taken it with him.</span> <span id="s361">There was absolutely no law against taking money and that, interestingly enough, they didn’t even bother to search them because if they would have been German residents and they would have been caught taking money out of Germany that would have meant God knows what.</span> <span id="s362">But since they were residents of Danzig there was no point of searching them because there was no law of taking money out of Danzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Had their passports been replaced in the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">G: Also, yes.</span> <span id="s365">In the same way as their passports had been replaced in the same manner but nevertheless it said born in, resident of Danzig.</span> <span id="s366">If you were a resident of Danzig you were under the laws of Danzig.</span> <span id="s367">So they did not, by taking money along, and I don’t know what sum was involved, but it doesn’t matter – he did not do anything against the law so they couldn’t touch him.</span> <span id="s368">Now, I was home for the Easter vacation (39) and this was perhaps in May or June of 39 when this happened so I had already gone back.</span> <span id="s369">On my way back, on my last visit to Danzig, going through Germany back to France, I had again changed trains in Berlin and I was on my way to Paris and in Aachen, where the French – Belgian border was I was on a train which was supposedly to go directly from Berlin to Paris.</span> <span id="s370">The Gestapo came into my compartment, they looked at my passport, they said, “Jew, out!”</span> <span id="s371">And the officer said to his subordinate, he said “by the way did you rent this pillow?</span> <span id="s372">In Mutopa you could buy a pillow for the night.”</span> <span id="s373">“Yes, that’s mine.”</span> <span id="s374">“Take it with him – see if he’s hiding anything in the pillow.”</span> <span id="s375">And I got taken down there and got three hours of the most humiliating search – they ripped my luggage apart and they were looking back and forth and the only thing that I had on me of any value was a gold watch that I had gotten for my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s376">I was carrying that and they were debating about it – they finally threw it on the floor and it went into a million pieces and I just put the casing into my pocket.</span> <span id="s377">Anyway, I missed the train and I had to wait in Aachen for a few hours and in the meantime whenever one of these SS guys came around I got a slap in the face, or something like this, you know, real heroes.</span> <span id="s378">And then I had to undress and they looked up into the, you know, all places.</span> <span id="s379">By the way, I had a wonderful revenge.</span> <span id="s380">The first city, as an American GI, that we occupied in Germany was Aachen, the same place, and we had taken an entire bunch of 200 of the border SS that we had taken prisoner and who were in one compound.</span> <span id="s381">I got a hold of them and they had to do to each other exactly the same things that I had to go through three years before.</span> <span id="s382">It was sort of a sweet revenge.</span> <span id="s383">They were very embarrassed.</span> <span id="s384">It was the middle of the winter and they had to undress in the courtyard and look up each others’ rectum and things like that which they had done to me and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: As a sixteen year old boy traveling alone I’m sure you were quite frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">G: Well, I was amazingly...I admired myself in a sense afterwards because I was amazingly composed there.</span> <span id="s387">I didn’t quite understand why these grown – up men took such a delight to shove – I was always a little fellow, I was a late bloomer.</span> <span id="s388">I started growing after I was maybe seventeen years old and so on.</span> <span id="s389">So I was actually a kid.</span> <span id="s390">At sixteen or fifteen I looked more like thirteen years old.</span> <span id="s391">And here were these grown – up guys in their uniforms and so on with guns by their side and they took such delight in slapping a thirteen year old boy around, you know, that size.</span> <span id="s392">That just didn’t sit well with me but I just figured okay, I am ready for anything.</span> <span id="s393">But they didn’t find anything; they just ripped all my baggage apart and they couldn’t find anything that I smuggled.</span> <span id="s394">They just let me go and gave me a few kicks in the behind and so on.</span> <span id="s395">And I came to Paris.</span> <span id="s396">Instead of arriving in the morning I arrived late in the evening.</span> <span id="s397">In the meantime, this business with my parents, they tried to get to Riga, which failed.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Why did you go to Paris instead of back to Besancon?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">G: Well first of all by that time I had finished high school and my parents transferred me to something which is similar to the Cornell hotel management school.</span> <span id="s400">They thought that would be a good profession to learn and that was in Nice and I was already going down to Nice to this hotel management school.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: On that trip when you were back in Danzig, when we were talking about the panic that you noticed.</span> <span id="s402">How did you see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">G: The atmosphere was pretty grim.</span> <span id="s404">I left Danzig after that stay with a feeling of tremendous trepidation.</span> <span id="s405">This entire situation that I had witnessed there – the people – the morale – it had changed tremendously.</span> <span id="s406">My last vacation had been summer 38 before the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s407">This was seven months later.</span> <span id="s408">The people are living like, you know.</span> <span id="s409">Although I had come down as far as standard of living is concerned by moving in with these people in France so that the physical aspect did not bother me but the idea because they were friends with each other so that if they had a four – room apartment and three families were living there everything was very nice but the point was that they were forced to be so and there was an atmosphere of gloom and everybody from morning until night went into the coffee houses of the cafes whatever.</span> <span id="s410">For the Jews there would be only one topic of conversation and that was what did you find out at the Cuban consulate of what do you think about the idea of going to Madagascar or this and that.</span> <span id="s411">All the topics were how does one save one’s hide.</span> <span id="s412">There was a tremendous panic.</span> <span id="s413">Another thing that had happened which put the Danzig Jewish population into an absolute trauma was that there was a contingent of people from Danzig who had chartered an old tub from the port of Constanza in Romania the Black Sea – an old freighter with which the people of Danzig wanted to go into Palestine through the Black Sea.</span> <span id="s414">They were refused entry into Palestine and that old freighter was traveling around Greek waters etc.</span> <span id="s415">And I don’t know what kind of diseases broke out and everything.</span> <span id="s416">The whole thing ended in a big fiasco.</span> <span id="s417">That had been just around that time so people died and people got terribly sick.</span> <span id="s418">I don’t know what eventually happened.</span> <span id="s419">This was common knowledge in Danzig.</span> <span id="s420">This had happened just before so people were absolutely running scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Did you belong to the great synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">G: Oh yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Was there conversation within the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">G: The synagogue had been burned down during Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Again, it was a free state still so...</span></p> <p><span id="s426">G: But the Nazis burned it down.</span> <span id="s427">The Nazis had practically free reign.</span> <span id="s428">They had free reign, they had as far as Nuremburg laws went.</span> <span id="s429">Whether they were legally executed or illegally executed, the Nazis had free reign after the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s430">The only laws against which they could not do anything were the amounts of things the Jews were permitted to take out or money etc. because this was outside of their realm but from a purely technical point of view there was nobody to stop them from harassing Jews, breaking their businesses up, herding them together.</span> <span id="s431">The Danzig police was doing absolutely nothing to stop the S.S. or the storm - troopers from doing anything.</span> <span id="s432">They had the upper hand.</span> <span id="s433">The other political parties were completely powerless, absolutely nothing to say anymore at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Did the people realize that Poland would be the next step for Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">G: They realized that Poland would be the next step and they were completely...Poland was absolutely no help whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: No, but what I meant was that once Hitler came to Poland that Danzig would be...</span></p> <p><span id="s437">G: Yes, would be immediately counted a part of the German Reich.</span> <span id="s438">It was already there.</span> <span id="s439">I mean you could see people walking around.</span> <span id="s440">This was the first time when I had an inkling of what fifth column was.</span> <span id="s441">The Jews in Danzig knew that there was a tremendous amount of German Gestapo in Danzig or German officials without uniforms.</span> <span id="s442">They were wearing a certain type of trenchcoat – you couldn’t miss them and they were already there.</span> <span id="s443">This was all just a matter of the day the war would start this was just automatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Did they realize the urgency that if the war should start in Poland that they might be trapped?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">G: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: They realized that?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">G: Oh, no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: That’s what I meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">G: No doubt about it that they were already...they realized that already during the Munch statement.</span> <span id="s450">Oh yes, I would say they realized that.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: So that you were seeing a sense of panic or urgency.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">G: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s453">They were probably much more panicky than the people in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: That’s what I had in mind.</span> <span id="s455">When you left to go back to Paris, in fact to Nice, was it difficult that time to leave?</span> <span id="s456">I mean difficult for you to leave your family at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">G: Well, you know, interestingly enough, the time before I left that was at the end of my summer vacation of 38.</span> <span id="s458">My parents urged me to get out of Germany, out of Danzig early because the Munich thing was impending and France was already mobilizing and they wanted me outside if there would be a war.</span> <span id="s459">So I left early.</span> <span id="s460">And this was already the first time that I was psyched up that this might be the last time I would see my parents.</span> <span id="s461">And then came Munich and there was a stalemate for that year and I went back once more and again I had at that time a definite feeling that anything can pop any moment.</span> <span id="s462">So I had grave trepidations about everything.</span> <span id="s463">It was tough and of course my parents could not hide the fact that they were happy that I should go out to a country where there was freedom.</span> <span id="s464">And nobody thought the Germans would occupy France as fast as they did and so on.</span> <span id="s465">At any rate there was definitely that kind of atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Did you notice, in looking at your parents, between the early years (1934-5) and now (1938) Did you see a difference in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">G: Well to a slight degree.</span> <span id="s468">If it had not been for the fact that my father had been one of the early ones to urge this sort of thing, I may have noticed a much greater change.</span> <span id="s469">But since the events only reinforced what he had been saying all along, it was not such a drastic thing.</span> <span id="s470">In other words, although there may have been an exterior or physical thing that was noticeable, there was no difference in their thinking.</span> <span id="s471">Whereas some of my parents’ friends who had not believed in it, they were much more shook up by it because they had to revise their entire thinking.</span> <span id="s472">So the change was more one of outward things, of material things.</span> <span id="s473">If you had lived in comfortable surroundings and all of a sudden you live in cramped quarters, this kind of thing is a physical thing, whereas from a psychological point of view I think there wasn’t too much to be seen.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Was your mother of the same mind as your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">G: Yeah, very much so.</span> <span id="s476">She did not have that kind of political sense but she went along with him in that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Your mother was from Danzig, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">G: No, she was actually from Silesia but it doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Did her family live...</span></p> <p><span id="s480">G: Most of the family lived in upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: And your father’s family was still in Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">G: Well they had scattered, which brings me to the next point.</span> <span id="s483">One of my father’s brothers had settled in Czechoslovakia and the other brother had gone to a resort town on the Adriatic, Abatzia, which was Italy, and he was living there and he is living there now.</span> <span id="s484">He is my only surviving relative, actually who is still alive.</span> <span id="s485">This brings me to the next episode.</span> <span id="s486">These bowling friends of my father, these police people, which had remained friends.</span> <span id="s487">Now comes July of 39 and my father gets a telephone call from one of his high up police friends to come and meet him.</span> <span id="s488">He gets himself up to meet his friend and says, “Can you get ready in three hours and get the hell out of here?”</span> <span id="s489">“Yes,” my father says, “I can if necessary.”</span> <span id="s490">So he says, “I’ve got a tip for you.</span> <span id="s491">There is a tremendous troop movement going from Germany through the Brenner Pass and there has been a clattering of messages going through that all the passenger trains for the next three days should go through the Brenner Pass, through the Italian border without stopping in order not to hold up traffic of the military trains.</span> <span id="s492">He said, “If you can get yourself right now on a train to Berlin and hop a train to Italy, you’ll zip through the Brenner Pass, through the German – Italian border without any examination or anything.</span> <span id="s493">These trains have to roll through, they’re not allowed to stop during the next forty – eight hours.”</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Meaning essentially illegally?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">G: Illegally, meaning essentially that all trains have to roll through the Brenner Pass, the German – Italian borders without stopping so as not to hold up these materials movements – whatever they were carrying and shipping – tanks, through the Brenner Pass.</span> <span id="s496">So my father got himself packed.</span> <span id="s497">So they got themselves ready and they were ready to do anything, so they hopped a train, one to Berlin, and from Berlin a train that was destined for Florence or anything and the mere fact that my father had a brother living in Italy, in Abatzia, was an added incentive to get out into Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Once he got to Italy, once he got off the train, the Italians, being allies of the Germans, would have...</span></p> <p><span id="s499">G: No, the Italians were extremely decent throughout the war.</span> <span id="s500">Previous to that you would have needed an Italian visa and they wouldn’t have gotten an Italian visa and they wouldn’t have gotten an Italian visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: But what were they going to do without an Italian visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">G: Well, if they had not had my uncle in Italy they would even have gone under these circumstances.</span> <span id="s503">There must have been hundreds of Germans living in Milan and surroundings and so on that had somehow slipped across into Italy.</span> <span id="s504">But the fact that my father had a brother there was even an added incentive...he didn’t think twice about going to Italy – “Oh I’m going to join my brother”.</span> <span id="s505">And so it was absolutely correct – the train rode right through the Brenner and they got themselves out in Verona or someplace and hopped a train for Abatzia and completely unexpected arrived at my uncle’s house and that was fine as far as that went because the war broke out a couple of weeks later and that would have been the end.</span> <span id="s506">I had, interesting also, and this was 39.</span> <span id="s507">Now the war broke out in 39 and I started the hotel management school in 39.</span> <span id="s508">I was in Nice.</span> <span id="s509">Oh yes.</span> <span id="s510">They were in Abatzia, the war was on, but there was no war yet between Italy and France...it was just, you know, Italy had remained neutral up to the point where the Germans occupied France.</span> <span id="s511">So in 39 I had thus heard from my parents that they had arrived in Italy.</span> <span id="s512">I went to school and no problem with money or anything like that.</span> <span id="s513">What my father had done, he had in the meantime gotten all our money out to America, just sent it officially to America, to our relatives here.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: A free city?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">G: The relatives in America were sending money that my father had with them to Italy for them and to France for me.</span> <span id="s516">And this hotel management school had a very terrific institution during vacations – you actually were farmed out to hotels for work experience.</span> <span id="s517">I remember that when the war broke out I was working at a hotel in Evian – on the shore of Lake Geneva and I had tried to get myself an Italian visa to visit my parents in Italy.</span> <span id="s518">And I sent my passport someplace, I don’t know, to the Italian consulate or something to get a visa and never got the passport back.</span> <span id="s519">It was finished.</span> <span id="s520">And then the war broke out and I was completely cut off from my parents then.</span> <span id="s521">And once the war broke out the only way that I heard from them was through America because they could write to America and they forwarded the mail to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: They couldn’t write directly to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">G: No, I don’t think so...I think at the beginning they could...No, you’re right, after Italy got into the war then it stopped, but that’s a little fuzzy in my mind.</span> <span id="s524">I had no passport at all at that point – I couldn’t go anyplace.</span> <span id="s525">I was just in France, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">QL Evian – the same place as the Avian conference?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">G: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: How long did you stay in the school or in work experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">G: Yah.</span> <span id="s530">I stayed in the school; I went back to finish the school as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s531">I finished it in 1940, in June of 40.</span> <span id="s532">The moment I finished the school I was interned by the French.</span> <span id="s533">Because this was another thing, a very peculiar quirk.</span> <span id="s534">The French really, being at war with Germany and the Austrians being German, whatever it was, they interned everyone who was German, whether he was a Jewish German or not Jewish German, what did they know?</span> <span id="s535">So on my seventeenth birthday I had to report to the police station where I was taken to an internment camp where there were a bunch of Nazis and Jew as well, you know, all mixed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Where were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">G: This was a place in Provence, near Aix – en – Provence, called Les Milles, a brick factory just outside Aix – en – Provence, in the south of France.</span> <span id="s538">We had a very decent camp commander, a French camp commander because I remember when the German armies were approaching Lyon, we sent a delegation of the Jewish internees, sent a delegation to him, and I was one of the delegation because at the time when it came to negotiating I had been a high school graduate already, and so on.</span> <span id="s539">I spoke French like a native Frenchman and as far as negotiating I was...my French was among those other young guys whose French was flawless.</span> <span id="s540">We went to the camp commandant and explained to him that if the Germans are advancing further and would advance to as far as where we were they would make mincemeat out of us.</span> <span id="s541">First you could see where the non – Jewish internees were preparing for the day of liberation.</span> <span id="s542">They were starting to have victory speeches and victory rallies and we poor Jews were there, you know, trembling for the Germans to come and take us back or something.</span> <span id="s543">As it turned out, you know the French signed the armistice and the Germans did not come that far.</span> <span id="s544">There was Vichy France.</span> <span id="s545">But I was one of the delegation sent to the French camp commander and the Germans were approaching were about four or five hundred miles away and we were explaining to this camp commander that as Jews we would just be dead, that’s all.</span> <span id="s546">And he understood that perfectly and he said, “Gentlemen, I am personally going to issue each and every one of you a travel document and a discharge document, a document of liberation.</span> <span id="s547">And there were about five or six of us that had good handwritings and we just sat down and for about 500 people we typed up and wrote out documents, first of all a document that stated that we had been officially and duly released from internment camp, signed by the commander, and another one, a document which was asking the French authorities to let us travel freely within the zone because we would be endangered by the Germans.</span> <span id="s548">So within a matter of 48 hours or so every one of the Jewish people had a couple of these documents and they just opened the gates to us and let us out.</span> <span id="s549">The non – Jewish Germans stayed right there and waited for their buddies to come and liberate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I just want to backtrack for a second.</span> <span id="s551">When you were in Nice, when the French came, how did the French go about interning you?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">G: Well it was a very simple thing.</span> <span id="s553">You had in France things were done by proclamation.</span> <span id="s554">First of all, like for instance, when you mobilize the army, you had these round cylinders on the streets where they had advertising plackets.</span> <span id="s555">The mobilization would be posted.</span> <span id="s556">And there would be a sign posted first of all on the first day of war, that every person of German nationality over the age of seventeen must report to the prefecture or something, room number so and so for further instructions.</span> <span id="s557">So right away as the war broke out, every German national, whether Jewish or not Jewish, had to report if he were seventeen or over, if he were male.</span> <span id="s558">And so they were just told at that point: Go home and pack your bags and take this and that stuff and report at a train station at this and this hour and this is how they were interned.</span> <span id="s559">But when the war broke out I was not seventeen yet, I was sixteen, and on my seventeenth birthday, the law was if a German national reaches his seventeenth birthday he has to report to the prefecture for further instructions.</span> <span id="s560">So all I did was, on the day before my seventeenth birthday I reported to the prefecture in Nice and the first thing they did was I had to report to a French military camp and I was put in a stockade, together with French soldiers who had either gone AWOL or something like that, into the stockade, until there were about 20 of us in that week from the neighborhood who had reached our seventeenth birthday and when they had a busload they took us from Nice to Les Milles which was the nearest internment camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: When you reported to the prefecture, was this a frightening experience or...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">G: Not at all, not in the least, because first of all we knew that, for instance, the wives of intern people had visited their husbands, they knew that these internment camps were nothing at all, that they were basically the internees were watched by the French troops, just in terms it was a confinement.</span> <span id="s563">They could play football, they could play chess, they could play cards, they could do what they want.</span> <span id="s564">The only thing is if they wanted to go town they only allowed two or three at a time per week to go to town.</span> <span id="s565">You got permission, there was no mistreatment.</span> <span id="s566">The food was the same that the French army was getting.</span> <span id="s567">Young fellows who had been going to school in France usually got a job in the office to do clerical work which I for instance did.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Was it paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">G: Volunteered, volunteered for that.</span> <span id="s570">No, I don’t think we got paid.</span> <span id="s571">The only thing is that instead of having to eat with the internees we got to eat with the soldiers or the sergeants or something like that.</span> <span id="s572">It was a slightly better deal from the point of view of food or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: But in general for the internees, did they have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">G: No, they were not put to work at all.</span> <span id="s575">It was just a matter of we were inspected that we kept our quarters clean and we had to inspect for reports for physical examination once a week or something like that, so that there would be no lice or anything.</span> <span id="s576">But otherwise there it was like being in a vacation camp technically.</span> <span id="s577">It was an old brick factory where everybody got a mattress and blankets and you just made yourself comfortable wherever you wanted to.</span> <span id="s578">There was a huge amount of property around it and one piece of property was used for a football field and another one the guys would just sit around and play cards and do whatever they wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: When you say ‘a mattress’ you mean including a bed or...</span></p> <p><span id="s580">G: No, just on the floor and blankets.</span> <span id="s581">They didn’t have cots or anything like that.</span> <span id="s582">What you did, there were plenty of bricks around, you usually built sort of an area with bricks around yourself and put your mattress on the floor and got your blankets and that was all.</span> <span id="s583">No hardship for a young fellow.</span> <span id="s584">I would say some of the older guys might have been uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: You lost your passport in this shuffle in Nice.</span> <span id="s586">What prevented you from just not reporting as a German?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">G: Well you had, every person living in France had to have an identity card.</span> <span id="s588">And I never got rid of my identity card.</span> <span id="s589">You had to have identification papers.</span> <span id="s590">As a matter of fact, after the war broke out, there were roadblocks on the spot and things like that.</span> <span id="s591">If you were caught without your identity papers you were in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: After you got out of Les Milles, or got your papers through this negotiation, what happened to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">G: This was a period of great uncertainty.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">G: I was there about two weeks, that’s all because that was from the middle of June to the end of June.</span> <span id="s596">By the time we got out, a few days after we got out, they signed the armistice and I headed back to Nice where I had all my friends and at that time Vichy France was created.</span> <span id="s597">And we were quite relieved that the Germans themselves had not come that far south, but it was quite rough living under Vichy France, not that anybody was harassed or anything, but it was difficult to even survive from even a physical point of view.</span> <span id="s598">The Germans were bleeding France from an agricultural point of view and you had to live on food stamps.</span> <span id="s599">For example a physical worker got halfway decent ration of food stamps.</span> <span id="s600">But the refugees like us who didn’t work or were going to school and so on, got the white collar rations.</span> <span id="s601">The white collar rations were very meager, the blue collar workers were getting twice as much.</span> <span id="s602">For a 17, 18 year old boy to go hungry, you know, this is the time of the great appetite, as I was telling you.</span> <span id="s603">I started growing just at the time of my internment, that was the time when I needed food the most, so it was pretty rough.</span> <span id="s604">This is very funny, I worked in a restaurant for no pay from six in the morning ‘til nine at night just for food.</span> <span id="s605">That was fine – I got enough to eat that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: How did you get that job?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">G: Oh, that was relatively simple because once you were a graduate of this hotel management school, the director was a very nice chap.</span> <span id="s608">He got you a student permit to do practical kind of work as a student.</span> <span id="s609">In other words, I couldn’t have gotten a job as a job, but as a student without pay I could get it.</span> <span id="s610">And of course they had to feed me.</span> <span id="s611">So in that respect I was quite well off.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: At this point even though this was Vichy France and they had signed the agreement did you make any plans to leave then?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">G: That was the summer of 1940.</span> <span id="s614">In the fall of 1940 I heard from my relatives in America that my parents were about to get their visa in Italy.</span> <span id="s615">My father had been taken to an internment camp, you couldn’t call it a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s616">All the Jews were rounded up in Italy and put into internment camps.</span> <span id="s617">It was not much worse than what we had in France, so the Italians again were very decent.</span> <span id="s618">There was no beating or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Were you aware of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">G: Yes, I was aware of it and my mother had to go into what was called confinement.</span> <span id="s621">She had to go to a little village and was not permitted to leave the premises of the village.</span> <span id="s622">Together with another two or three women they were living in the little village.</span> <span id="s623">And my father had to go to this camp in Kilabria.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Kilabria, isn’t that almost Sicily?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">G: Almost Sicily, right.</span> <span id="s626">Down at the cold Firamonte?</span> <span id="s627">Towers.</span> <span id="s628">Most of the Jews were interned there.</span> <span id="s629">And they could write to America and my relatives in America used to write to me and I heard from my parents that way.</span> <span id="s630">And they wrote me that my parents had been called to the American consulate in Naples, that they were getting their visa.</span> <span id="s631">And they were trying to see to it that I could get my visa in Nice.</span> <span id="s632">And there was a great deal of red tape, it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s633">My parents got their visa late in December of 40 and because you had an American visa you could get a transit visa for France, for Spain, for Portugal, and so they got their transit visa through France and they managed to come through Nice.</span> <span id="s634">And the first thing we did was my father asked for an appointment at the American consulate in Nice and we went to him and we showed him the visas that he had and (asked) whether he could do anything, after all I was a minor of eighteen in those days.</span> <span id="s635">And that American consul was an absolute bastard.</span> <span id="s636">As a matter of fact later on he was in the same U.S. intelligence unit as I and I almost killed that guy when I saw him again.</span> <span id="s637">It was the first, that was the only time in my life that I ever saw my father cry because he said, “Look, we applied for our visa as a family.</span> <span id="s638">He is our only child and we have to leave him here while we have a visa for America?”</span> <span id="s639">He said, “No, there’s no way of doing it.”</span> <span id="s640">But look anything is worth it.</span> <span id="s641">Please send a cable to Washington, see what you can do and so on.</span> <span id="s642">The guy would not budge an inch.</span> <span id="s643">The only thing was he had a secretary who was sitting in and she caught us at the door.</span> <span id="s644">She was a French girl working for the American consul and she said, “Look, if you want to have a valid tip from us, get to America as fast as possible and get your boy out on a non quota deal because if your own parents are already there, a minor child, it’s almost an automatic thing.”</span> <span id="s645">So they left and their transit visa through France was good for 48 hours or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: When they got the visas, the visas came for two, not for three?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">G: The visas only came to Naples, but it only came for them, nothing for me.</span> <span id="s648">Nothing came to me and therefore the problem arose.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: When they had the transit visa for 48 hours, they were going through France.</span> <span id="s650">Where were they going to catch transportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">G: Spain and Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Both?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">G: Right, France, Spain and Portugal, to leave there?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: When they left you there...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">G: Well that was quite traumatic, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s656">First of all, this was the funniest thing, my father practically left me all his clothing because everything I had at that point was up to my elbows and up to my knees.</span> <span id="s657">So my father took me to a tailor and he took about three or four suits, coats and the tailor just tied it up a bit because my father was a bit heavier than I was.</span> <span id="s658">But then they got out and went to Spain and Portugal and did indeed go to America as quickly as possible and from the first day here they started working on the visa situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: During all this time, the money flow from America was easy and constant?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">G: Yes, well because the flow from America, anybody could get money in, there was no problem there, the French were very happy to get American dollars and pay me Vichy francs.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Did you live under hardships?</span> <span id="s662">Or what was your life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">G: My life was quite bearable because I worked hard because to work in a French restaurant as a comey, as a type of fifth wheel, you did everything from sweeping the floor.</span> <span id="s664">It didn’t bother me at all to wash dishes, to peel potatoes, it was like doing kp in the army, something like that.</span> <span id="s665">At age 18 to get in a good meal three times that was very very important and I had enough money from America to pay my rent, to go to the movies, to do this and that.</span> <span id="s666">So I had a very carefree life and I had friends so it was very bearable.</span> <span id="s667">But I also knew that this war was not going to be very favorable and to get out was of paramount importance.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: How long did it take after your parents got to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">G: It got into a terrible situation.</span> <span id="s670">First of all my parents went through France in January and reached America in March.</span> <span id="s671">And they went to work immediately on my visa and I was called over to the consulate somewhere at the end of June to have a physical and to sign final papers and I actually had an appointment like to come next Tuesday to pick up the visa.</span> <span id="s672">And I come Tuesday and the secretary greets me with a long face and she says, “I’m sorry, no visa.</span> <span id="s673">They just passed a new law in the United States (this was 1941) that people would only be entitled to receive a visa if the sponsor had a check by the FBI that they were desirable people.”</span> <span id="s674">In other words they wanted to prevent fifth column (spies) or something to come into the United States.</span> <span id="s675">So there was an actual law that stopped the visas and it took my father quite a bit of doing in political circles with congressmen and all kinds of things to get them to have the FBI background check made in a hurry and I was among the first three people after this prohibition, this new law, from June to October, four months later, one of the first to get a visa granted after the sponsors here in the United States had been checked out.</span> <span id="s676">And so this was October of 1941 and as soon as you got your American visa you could go to Marseilles and get yourself a transit visa for Spain and Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: The only way to go was over Spain and Portugal?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">G: The only way out was over Spain and Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: No boats going from northern France?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">G: From northern France, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: How about southern France?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">G: No, just that was the only way out and my parents had paid when I got to Lisbon all steamship lines had been prepaid passage money.</span> <span id="s683">I only had to wait about ten days for a ship to get on but I got here in November if 41 and on December 7 the war broke out so that was just in the nick of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: When did the Germans come into Vichy France?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">G: After we attacked north Africa in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: So you were out by then.</span> <span id="s687">When you came over did you come over by regular passenger boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">G: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: When you came to New York, I take it your parents met you, where did you go that day?</span> <span id="s690">Where did they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">G: they lived in Washington Heights; they had rented a room in a seven room apartment.</span> <span id="s692">There were about 5 or 6 other tenants in the seven room apartment on Fort Washington Avenue and 161st Street, the address at that time.</span> <span id="s693">And just before I came they had managed to get me another room in that apartment so that’s where we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: At that point when your parents had come here, I assume the funds were not unlimited when your father came here.</span> <span id="s695">What kind of job did he find?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">G: He found a job with a clothing manufacturer in the shipping department making up shipments, packages, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: A clothing manufacturer, meaning like the garment district?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">G: Men’s clothing.</span> <span id="s699">They are located mainly around 14th, 17th Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Did he find that difficult?</span> <span id="s701">It’s usually dominated by an American – Jewish group.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">G: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s703">He had always said he was ready to carry crates or be a stevedore at a port rather than stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s704">No, they were extremely happy to have escaped and they worked extremely hard which did not bother them.</span> <span id="s705">Times were getting better, they could even save a few pennies; there was an entire reversal of having been without any income for two, three or four years and then being able to work gainfully.</span> <span id="s706">That was very good for the morale.</span> <span id="s707">The war was of course raging by that time; they were of course grateful to be here in relative safety.</span> <span id="s708">So I’m sure that my parents were very content as far as that aspect of life is concerned.</span> <span id="s709">I’m always comparing our way of emigration with the people who came after World War 11 who felt that the flesh pots of Europe, what they had left behind there was better than what was waiting for them in America.</span> <span id="s710">I think that the people who arrived in America just at the eve of WW 2 were so grateful for having escaped Europe that they did not mind any hardships.</span> <span id="s711">That was perfectly all right; working hard never hurt anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Did your mother work too?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">G: Yes of course, my mother worked too.</span> <span id="s714">She was sewing brassieres in a lady’s garments factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: When you came and you now had two rooms in a seven room apartment, how did your mother arrange the cooking and the eating?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">G: Well, the first thing, first of all it didn’t affect us very greatly because we were there for maybe a month or two because my parents were looking for an apartment of their own when I came so this was very transitory.</span> <span id="s717">It was a very short period of time.</span> <span id="s718">The other thing was that I, my first job, I was hardly here for three days, I couldn’t wait to go to work.</span> <span id="s719">And the first job that I got was a waiter’s job in a nightclub and I had a completely upside down kind of schedule.</span> <span id="s720">I started work at nine in the evening and I came home, it closed at 4 in the morning and I came home at 5 in the morning.</span> <span id="s721">I remember I used to get, there was a bakery on Broadway, I used to pick up at 5 in the morning hot fresh rolls.</span> <span id="s722">My parents had those for breakfast and I was sleeping till 2 in the afternoon and then I would go to the movies at 2 in the afternoon and they would come home for dinner and I would be off and I would eat dinner in the nightclub first before I started working.</span> <span id="s723">So we had an upside down kind of life.</span> <span id="s724">The nightclub lasted about four weeks and then they closed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: How did you get that job in the nightclub?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">G: From my hotel management school they had sort of an alumni association which was called the Geneva association and they had an employment service for hotel and restaurant employees and I took the first slip they handed me and went right in there and started working.</span> <span id="s727">I didn’t want to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Did you know English well enough to...</span></p> <p><span id="s729">G: Oh yes, look, I had had English from the time I entered the Jewish gymnasium in the cram course through all the time in France.</span> <span id="s730">I must have had seven years of English in school.</span> <span id="s731">I was as fluent the day that I walked off the ship as I am today.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: So that didn’t present a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">G: No problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: When the nightclub closed what kind of job did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">G: I must have had about five different jobs as waiters in hotels that lasted about a week or so.</span> <span id="s736">I wasn’t cut out for that kind of stuff until finally when the manpower shortage made itself felt, this was maybe February of’42 already.</span> <span id="s737">I saw that they were advertising for an assistant manager of a restaurant in the Times Square area.</span> <span id="s738">I just went there and got the job.</span> <span id="s739">They were taking anybody at that time.</span> <span id="s740">So that was more to my liking.</span> <span id="s741">I was already in management.</span> <span id="s742">But first of all that was only for about four months because then I went into the army, but secondly it also gave me an insight into the whole hotel and restaurant business in the United States, which was completely and utterly, for someone who had gone to a hotel school in France, it was just an absolute horror because over in Europe the people who work in hotels and restaurants.</span> <span id="s743">This is considered a skill where you have to go through an apprenticeship and work your way up and this is a career.</span> <span id="s744">In this country you just pick up a tray and you just throw it at people.</span> <span id="s745">I was completely shocked at what went on in the Waldorf Astoria, for instance.</span> <span id="s746">These are waiters?</span> <span id="s747">My God!</span> <span id="s748">If they had been in France they couldn’t even have gotten a job as a shoeshine boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: How did you see waiters in the Waldorf Astoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">G: Because I had a job there for a week and I just couldn’t take that kind of thing; it was absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s751">Furthermore I was appalled by the sanitary condition of the hotels and restaurants in this country.</span> <span id="s752">They are absolutely gruesomely filthy compared to Europe.</span> <span id="s753">They would be intolerable in Europe.</span> <span id="s754">So I made a resolution that when I would get out of the army, when the war would be over, the hotel and restaurant business would not be my cup of tea.</span> <span id="s755">I was going to be something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: When did you...did you get a draft notice?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">G: Oh yes, I was drafted in 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Did that surprise you after being here for...</span></p> <p><span id="s759">G: No, I was waiting for the moment...I was 18 but then they were only taking 19 year olds but then they changed it to 18 year olds so I figured any time it must come.</span> <span id="s760">So I went late in 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: They didn’t bother you as an enemy alien?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">G: No, I wasn’t an enemy alien because, this is how naive all these countries are about enemy, not enemy.</span> <span id="s763">The Austrians were not enemy aliens and the Germans were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s764">Because of my father’s birth I was an Austrian and Austrians were okay, but Germans were not.</span> <span id="s765">So I was not an enemy alien and I was drafted and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: When you were drafted, when did you find out that you were going to be sent to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">G: Actually, I didn’t know how things would run; it was all a series of accidents.</span> <span id="s768">I was first put through basic training like everybody else and when they went eeney meeney miney moe, I ended up in the medics for basic training.</span> <span id="s769">Then just when I was finishing basic training they were picking up everybody with a fairly high IQ, which they called AGCT and put them through a college program.</span> <span id="s770">It was called ASTP.</span> <span id="s771">I went to the University of Illinois for a few months just to learn technical subjects.</span> <span id="s772">Then they put me into the signal corps and then finally in 43 I met someone here, I was on furlough in New York and he was telling me that he was in the intelligence service here in camp Richie in Maryland and he told me that he was coming home every week and I thought that was pretty good idea so I wrote to Washington that I thought I was better qualified for the intelligence service and they picked up that letter and I got transferred.</span> <span id="s773">Then I knew because then they asked for volunteer for OSS work and then I knew I would be going home.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you volunteer for OSS work?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">G: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s776">But that was a volunteer job.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: How did you feel about going back to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">G: Oh, I felt that I had made myself useful as best as I could and there was no doubt in my mind that as I spoke languages like a native that they should take advantage of that.</span> <span id="s779">They were looking for people too, so it was a very good marriage, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: But OSS work was sometimes very dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">G: It was no more dangerous than anything else.</span> <span id="s782">I must say my entire life has been one lucky thing after another.</span> <span id="s783">You know, just always getting out of things in the last minute.</span> <span id="s784">I think it’s much too glamorized, this business of dangerous.</span> <span id="s785">The espionage work and so on is not at all as it’s fictionalized.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: But you did realize that you were going back toward Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">G: Oh yes, I was ready to go and operate behind...they told me that it entailed operating enemy lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Once you got toward Germany, what were your feelings about...</span></p> <p><span id="s789">G: The first phase of operation was in France.</span> <span id="s790">I was landed in the area of...first of all it took full advantage of the fact that I was completely familiar with the area around Nice and that I was completely fluent and knew every place and so on.</span> <span id="s791">We were a team of four and we were landed at night in southern France and they had already made preparations.</span> <span id="s792">In other words, I had to contact somebody who already had quarters for us and the most amusing thing was the time lapse from October 1941 to January 1943, this is only about over a year, I would meet people in the street, like school buddies and they would say, “Gee it’s funny, you know, somebody said that you had gone to America.”</span> <span id="s793">Or something like that.</span> <span id="s794">So I would say, “No, I was in Marseilles for a while but I wish I could have.”</span> <span id="s795">And so on.</span> <span id="s796">And so at this time it was radically different.</span> <span id="s797">We arrived with papers with beautifully forged French papers.</span> <span id="s798">In other words, I was no longer as Austrian student living in France, but I was a French native, which was an entirely different thing.</span> <span id="s799">And I also had a document which showed that I was a member of the Petain party, that I was okay.</span> <span id="s800">For instance when we were in the cafe and the German Gestapo was hanging around and it showed that I was an officer in a German sympathizing group, a collaborator, he smiled at me and gave me my papers back.</span> <span id="s801">So it was just absolutely a breeze to live that way.</span> <span id="s802">We had access, we had ration books and coupons for five, everything forged.</span> <span id="s803">It was like a new world because the only people who could possibly betray us was one contact I had with a French FFI and one contact with a British agent and these were the only two people who could possibly be any danger to me if they would have gotten caught and talked or something like that.</span> <span id="s804">It was very remote; they were my only two contacts and my job was strictly to be...All we were, were messengers because it was a question of collecting information and it went through channels and back to the allies and I got bits of information from the interior of France which had to be relayed to the alliesand we had to sometimes meet with someone on a beach and hand him a package which contained a lot of messages and so on and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Pyschologically it must have been a very different feeling to have been in France a year before...</span></p> <p><span id="s806">G: Under completely different...but completely different...Psychologically I was feeling even better than the time in New York before that working in restaurants.</span> <span id="s807">I had a ball; I had an absolute ball.</span> <span id="s808">Because unless things went very wrong, I was practically in an untouchable, enviable kind of position.</span> <span id="s809">And it was extremely remote that I could get caught and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Also I had in mind your view towards the Germans must have...</span></p> <p><span id="s811">G: At that time I was still dreaming of getting a machine gun and mowing them down and so on.</span> <span id="s812">Then came the liberation.</span> <span id="s813">44 came and the allies landed in France, both in the north and in the south.</span> <span id="s814">So here I was, all the agents, all the British, French and American agents that had been operating in France were taken back to England for reassignment.</span> <span id="s815">I was still in the U.S. army but they had no longer any use for me, OSS wise, so they reassigned me.</span> <span id="s816">I became an interrogator on an interrogating team in the regular army.</span> <span id="s817">And I was a second lieutenant at the time and I had four other sergeants as part of the team and in about August of 1944 I was assigned to the seventh army division, actually as field interrogator.</span> <span id="s818">We were right up at the front together.</span> <span id="s819">The seventh division went through northern France into Belgium.</span> <span id="s820">And I must say one thing.</span> <span id="s821">It took exactly three days and things started falling into place in a most amazing way.</span> <span id="s822">I had built up an enormous hatred against the Germans.</span> <span id="s823">And as I told you before, I wished nothing more than to be able to kill them, just mow them down.</span> <span id="s824">So I am assigned as an interrogator to the seventh army division, we are right up at the front line and I am supposed to interrogate German prisoners.</span> <span id="s825">And the first day came for me to interrogate and I almost didn’t believe my eyes because the German soldiers that were coming in were shaking in their boots and throwing themselves at my mercies, so to speak, and begging for “don’t shoot” and “please” and “what do you want to know” and volunteering everything that you wanted to know without any kind of... they were the most unashamed cowards in general that I have ever met.</span> <span id="s826">The great majority were begging for mercy, “Please don’t” “I’ll tell you everything you want to know” “Don’t shoot” or something like that.</span> <span id="s827">And after three days I said gee, this looks very familiar, this is just the kind of thing that I remember when we were following boys after gymnastics in the evening and how they pounced on one guy and when we came around the corner how they took off in a hurry.</span> <span id="s828">The same kind of thing, you know, they just...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: You spoke to them, I take it in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">G: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did you let them know you were a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">G: Absolutely, there was no opportunity or anything.</span> <span id="s833">You looked at the guy, you say, “German....................” You just bawled him out and you just treated him like a piece of rag and they would stand there and shake.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did you notice any difference between yourself and maybe an American interrogator of non – Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s835">G: Well you...there were a lot of different philosophies among interrogators.</span> <span id="s836">There were those who didn’t hesitate to slap a guy around, in other words, to give him a slap in the face or a kick or something like that.</span> <span id="s837">I felt that I didn’t have to lower myself to even touch anybody.</span> <span id="s838">I had terrible contempt.</span> <span id="s839">This incident that I was telling you, this was months later, when we got into Aachen and I had my fun with these people.</span> <span id="s840">By that time I was...this was just, you know...I had nothing but contempt.</span> <span id="s841">And at that time I treated them with contempt.</span> <span id="s842">We had very few...if you got a German officer, as a rule, it was a different story.</span> <span id="s843">They had themselves under slightly better control.</span> <span id="s844">The German enlisted men that we got terribly cowardly as far as I’m concerned, as a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Were you aware at this point of what had gone on as far as 6 million...?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">G: No, I was not aware then.</span> <span id="s847">I was aware of quite a bit of things that others were not aware of.</span> <span id="s848">I was aware of, for instance, and this gave me a lot of problems.</span> <span id="s849">While I was in Nice I was aware of the fact that there were people disappearing, Jews who had...Jewish refugees who all of a sudden disappeared.</span> <span id="s850">I knew that a lot of them were getting picked up by the Gestapo and we never saw any trace of them.</span> <span id="s851">So this was already, I had an inkling that something was going on and you did of course hear about atrocities and so on and these things trickled through in France and so on.</span> <span id="s852">But the extent, or the things that went on in Poland, in Auschwitz and things like that, that was not known.</span> <span id="s853">We knew what but we didn’t know to what extent, we didn’t know the compass that they involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Did you find any of that out as an interrogator or did you find it out when they were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">G: No, I never found it out as an interrogator for two reasons.</span> <span id="s856">First of all we did not...First of all we had sort of an unofficial committee in the various army units.</span> <span id="s857">When we liberated a town and there certain families which were hiding Jews, we immediately, these people were showered with food packages and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s858">Cigarettes was the currency of the war.</span> <span id="s859">We got cartons of cigarettes.</span> <span id="s860">We couldn’t do enough.</span> <span id="s861">I remember in many instances we had enough power to give them political jobs, especially in Germany.</span> <span id="s862">When we occupied France or Belgium or Holland the provisional government was actually run by the resistance forces.</span> <span id="s863">So we could only recommend that the FFI or the Belgian resistance etcetera would reward families that would hide Jews.</span> <span id="s864">But in Germany if there was a German family that really was hiding Jews, we actually had enough power with the military government to, if these people wanted a good job or something, with the military government that they would immediately get them.</span> <span id="s865">So in a sense we had a good deal of leeway especially during the first few months.</span> <span id="s866">I returned back to the states actually rather shortly after the war ended but I know that during the few months that I was there, during the army of occupation, that we rewarded those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: While you were in Europe, in Germany, did you notice the people coming back to like Badnaulheim?</span> <span id="s868">from who had survived the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">G: Not at all, no, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s870">The only people that we came across were those who were immediately liberated.</span> <span id="s871">They were usually asked if they wanted to stay on or if they wanted to go to a displaced persons camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Immediately liberated from Western Europe though, from in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">G: Right.</span> <span id="s874">They would either elect to stay on or to go into a dp camp, displaced persons camp.</span> <span id="s875">And the displaced persons committee would take care of them.</span> <span id="s876">But there was no time really to do anything on an organized scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: When you found out what had happened to 6 million, did you realize how close you had come to being in France still in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">G: Oh I had realized that even at the time I had left.</span> <span id="s879">I had no illusions about surviving if I could not get out.</span> <span id="s880">And even at that time, I had nightmares for months after I had come to the United States that somehow I had gotten stuck over there.</span> <span id="s881">I was conscious of that even before the war broke out.</span> <span id="s882">Even from the actions of these border guards and so on I knew what was brewing.</span> <span id="s883">I had no illusions about that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Even though you didn’t have the concrete information about the extent?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">G: Even though that was the case.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: When you left the army and returned to New York, what did you plan for your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">G: I first of all knew, as I told you before, that I did not want to return to the hotel business and I wanted to get myself a college degree.</span> <span id="s888">The fact that the GI bill of rights was there was very nice.</span> <span id="s889">I took my French school papers to Albany to the section called University of the State of New York.</span> <span id="s890">And they examined my papers and they said, “In order for you to get a bachelor’s degree in college you are missing so and so many points.”</span> <span id="s891">So I enrolled in Columbia and I went to Columbia for a year and a half and I got a bachelor’s degree in a year and a half.</span> <span id="s892">And after that it was just a matter of pure coincidence.</span> <span id="s893">When I finished one of the job offers that I had was in a travel agency.</span> <span id="s894">That was more up my alley than going back to the hotel business.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Today, are most of your friends more American or more from your original background?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">G: No, I would say that most of our friends are part of the particular geographic area that we touched.</span> <span id="s897">Some of Renee’s friends are from the tabernacle days which hasn’t changed at all.</span> <span id="s898">Some friends are from our Riverdale time; some friends are from since we moved out here in Jersey.</span> <span id="s899">I think it’s more a matter of geography than...if we for instance did not stay as close to New York as we did stay, we might not have as many friends from the old tabernacle crowd that Renee had.</span> <span id="s900">It’s more geographical I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: In your business you’ve met a lot of American – born colleagues.</span> <span id="s902">Do you feel yourself different from them in terms of the way you do business?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">G: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s904">Since the great majority of my life has been spent in America now, I think very much like they do, except when it comes to matters that touch upon the very questions, where the background may have something to do with it.</span> <span id="s905">And perhaps somewhat more vehement about political issues than someone who has been living the sheltered life of America.</span> <span id="s906">I’m probably more conscious of political happenings.</span> <span id="s907">There care things that bother me much more than someone who was born here.</span> <span id="s908">Like the Skokie business or something like that.</span> <span id="s909">I am much more concerned with that than maybe the average guy who grew up in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: As a parent, do you think you were a different parent from your American counterpart?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">G: Well only in that I am a psychological product of these years, in terms of my temper and my nervousness.</span> <span id="s912">I don’t know whether the fact that I am a very nervous person is attributable to these very traumatic things happened during my adolescence and therefore I am very short – fused and this particular aspect of my life may have had influence on my children.</span> <span id="s913">But I found that my children to this day have been quite indifferent about the Holocaust or my background and to them I have a feeling that it is as remote as the exodus from Egypt of our forefathers.</span> <span id="s914">And the fact that it only happened in the generation of their own father.</span> <span id="s915">I have a feeling that it is far removed from them.</span> <span id="s916">Maybe I am wrong or maybe it’s going to take a certain amount of time as they mature and as certain events fall into place.</span> <span id="s917">That some of the things which they may have heard as children will influence their thinking at that particular time.</span> <span id="s918">But it is probably something that is at the present time in the back someplace, dormant, but might come out in some way.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: When you came back from the army, there wasn’t too much of an interim between the time you came originally and when you went into the army.</span> <span id="s920">When you were dating, when you came back from the army, did you date girls mainly of German – Jewish background or American girls as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">G: I think the people I hung out with was like that free synagogue, Rabbi Klein’s group.</span> <span id="s922">I would say it was primarily refugee, top heavy.</span> <span id="s923">Again, this geographical situation because the entire west side of Manhattan was either German or even Viennese further down, in the nineties or eighties, but that’s the same thing.</span> <span id="s924">They’re still refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: But at Columbia, did you meet American born girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">G: I went to the Columbia school of business and in the school of business there were only men at that time.</span> <span id="s927">I didn’t meet any girls at Columbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Do you consider yourself more a part of the American mainstream or more part of the German – refugee community?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">G: Oh, I would say the American.</span> <span id="s930">I would say this though.</span> <span id="s931">Again, I have to qualify this.</span> <span id="s932">If we would not be as close to the German group through the tabernacle or through my profession, where there are a lot of people who prefer me because I can speak German to them etcetera.</span> <span id="s933">If we would be living elsewhere we would be completely assimilated to that particular environment.</span> <span id="s934">I think it’s only a geographical accident that we have any connection still because I could see myself very comfortable with American – born Jews anywhere, in any town in America.</span> <span id="s935">And our circles of friends are divided right in the middle there.</span> <span id="s936">We have those who are American born and those who are of the old refugees.</span> <span id="s937">But I think it’s because of a geographic accident and that is all there is to it.</span> <span id="s938">If we had for any reason gone to a town in America which had both, let’s say, we would not necessarily have veered towards the refugee side of it.</span> <span id="s939">It would have been a matter of indifference to us, wouldn’t you think?</span> <span id="s940">That it would have been the people themselves for what they are rather than from where they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">R: Yeah, but we have friends from Germany, or people that we knew in Germany that we are still friendly with.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">G: Or in a tabernacle crowd.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">R: Because we lived in Washington Heights, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">G: But let’s say we...</span></p> <p><span id="s945">R: The Jewish community sold the synagogue, sold the synagogue to have money for all the Jews – they are legal, they are not legal, when they hired a boat and they went to Israel with this money which they got from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s946">But I have still the last newspaper with the synagogue in picture, the last service in the synagogue in Danzig.</span> <span id="s947">You can imagine it was a very sad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">G: Wasn’t it burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">R: No, they made something out of it, a sport house.</span> <span id="s950">But anyway, my late husband and I, we were supposed to go with this boat too, SS Samaretur (?)</span> <span id="s951">because (illegible) we have sent him to France.</span> <span id="s952">And we were pretty young couple at this time but we got telegrams from American cousins, please don’t go – and from my late family in Poland: (language?)</span> <span id="s953">You shouldn’t go.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">G: You’re talking now about this ship that they chartered from Romania, the Dassig (?)</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: That’s the one you told me about?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">G: The ship was from Constanza Romania.</span> <span id="s957">They wouldn’t let them in in Palestine at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">R: And they were many many weeks on water.</span> <span id="s959">I think after six or eight weeks they got the message, they landed, but they were made to land.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Did they land illegally in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">R: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: That’s the ship you told me about but I had heard something about how they sold the insides of the synagogue to the Joint Distribution Committee and they got money to try and help...</span></p> <p><span id="s963">R: This I cannot tell exactly if it was the money from the insides or the money from the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: When was the last service?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">G: in 39.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: After Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">R: I think 38, right after Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s968">I can tell you if I look up this last newspaper, on the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">THE END.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s971">PAGE 1</span></p> <p><span id="s972">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s973">PAGE
