Vilijampole.</span> <span id="s21">We had a normal life.</span> <span id="s22">My father was not a millionaire but he made a nice living.</span> <span id="s23">He was doing some business with Russians and things like this, and it was binders from boot sales and selling this from the houtgarba(ph) to make leather out of it.</span> <span id="s24">I was going to school.</span> <span id="s25">I was going, of course, to Cheder, a Hebrew school and my brother the same thing.</span> <span id="s26">And we was going on a normal life.</span> <span id="s27">Of course, we had the little- the Lithuanians was not always with Jews.</span> <span id="s28">There was stories all over the place, but we had a normal life and living like normal people, and then, of course, in 1940 came the Russians because the war started already with the Germans.</span> <span id="s29">It was not a war yet, but when the Germans came to Polandbut the Russians came to Lithuania and then the Russians occupied Lithuania close to a year, and then the war started in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Tell me what changed when the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: It was a little different because you willI was going to a, to Hebrew school and then all of a sudden I was going to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s32">They are cutting down on the religious part.</span> <span id="s33">They were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when you're young you think is the future.</span> <span id="s34">But my father was always against the regime because of Communism.</span> <span id="s35">In fact, he got arrested one time.</span> <span id="s36">One time he got a chicken he was carrying this to the street and he was stopped.</span> <span id="s37">What do you have a chicken for?</span> <span id="s38">And he was afraid to tell everything to go to officially.</span> <span id="s39">They arrested him and after a couple hours, but they let them out.</span> <span id="s40">They didn't want to get the men for the chicken.</span> <span id="s41">You can imagine my father didn't care much for the Communists.</span> <span id="s42">But I was not myself.</span> <span id="s43">I liked the movie and things like that.</span> <span id="s44">But it was really normal.</span> <span id="s45">It was a little different with the new regime, but I was too young to see the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Let me ask you to go back before the Russians came.</span> <span id="s47">You said there was a lot of Antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a bicycle for my brother.</span> <span id="s49">I was the younger and he was a year older.</span> <span id="s50">We were riding one time and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys, not Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the bicycle, and like young boys, of course, we chasing them.</span> <span id="s51">You broke the bicycle.</span> <span id="s52">How come you broke the bicycle?</span> <span id="s53">And where I was living inwe got a little farther outwas a church and we chased them to the church and, of course, course the police came out and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this door and he told us, go away you Zyds.</span> <span id="s54">I told them and this time, of course, I spoke.</span> <span id="s55">I forgot –Lithuanian, I was going born therethem I told him he broke the bicycle and he kept saying, go away.</span> <span id="s56">Of course, I couldn’t fight him.</span> <span id="s57">It was experience.</span> <span id="s58">We came back home and my father took this bicycle to the man that fixed the bicycle and fixed it.</span> <span id="s59">But you had a feeling like you were always not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Did you have Lithuanian friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the Cheder.</span> <span id="s62">But in the area I was living there was Jewish people.</span> <span id="s63">But we had a few people from the ________ a restaurant there.</span> <span id="s64">His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as children, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into Poland.</span> <span id="s67">Of course, my father was a middle‑aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a little bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in Poland, the liquidations and the killing over there.</span> <span id="s68">And it was we started.</span> <span id="s69">A lot of Jewish run away from Poland and come to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s70">In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the Germans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the Germans.</span> <span id="s71">But most of them was happy to have the Germans in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: You were very young.</span> <span id="s73">Did you hear your parents talking about it and did you read the newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it and feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are not welcome.</span> <span id="s76">Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the next step.</span> <span id="s77">He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time, but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming.</span> <span id="s78">But my father reading the papers and knowing what is going on.</span> <span id="s79">It's time to leave everything and run because what is going on in Poland is maybe going to be the same thing here in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s80">And we had a horse and wagon, and I have a lot of stories to tell.</span> <span id="s81">We had a small little horse and we are using it to take the coals fromit was a little like a pony.</span> <span id="s82">It was like a dog.</span> <span id="s83">You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were believable.</span> <span id="s84">And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the wagon and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away from the Lithuania.</span> <span id="s85">And the Germans were always bombing the airport, and a lot of Jews start running to get away from the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: And this is in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: This is in 1941.</span> <span id="s88">And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the Russian Army tanks, putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them.</span> <span id="s89">And all of sudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage of the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enoughit was too fast.</span> <span id="s90">We left.</span> <span id="s91">They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the horse and wagon and we was going to get out of there.</span> <span id="s92">And we are running the streets with the Russian Army and we were going to Latvia.</span> <span id="s93">A lot of people in this area.</span> <span id="s94">You can go to Latvia and then to Minsk, and then from Minsk to White Russia, but we didn't make the journey so far.</span> <span id="s95">We just took that horse and wagon.</span> <span id="s96">We have involved with the Russian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the streets and we were going through the hole.</span> <span id="s97">I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time, and my mother, in fact, was shot, slit.</span> <span id="s98">The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this way.</span> <span id="s99">We were going in the same direction as the Russian army.</span> <span id="s100">There was always fires and dead people on the streets and a lot of them couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s101">You know, the soldiers and a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it.</span> <span id="s102">We kept on going and then, of course, we came to the border of Latvia.</span> <span id="s103">We came in at Minsk.</span> <span id="s104">There was a lot of Latvian people there, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible things going on against the Jews, even in Minsk.</span> <span id="s105">But we were lucky and we were still going in the car with the Russians, the army.</span> <span id="s106">But the army was really practically 99 percent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing.</span> <span id="s107">One was running right and one was running left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the wagon and two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride.</span> <span id="s108">My father said, Look, I got a little tiny horse.</span> <span id="s109">We have four people.</span> <span id="s110">We won't make it.</span> <span id="s111">They took out a revolver and they point it at my father.</span> <span id="s112">They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are going with you.</span> <span id="s113">Also because we can’t walk.</span> <span id="s114">They might look a little Communist inclined, I don't know.</span> <span id="s115">Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this.</span> <span id="s116">Not running, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with machine guns and I feltI was in the wagon with my mother and my brother and my father was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a something.</span> <span id="s117">We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy.</span> <span id="s118">We look and then he laying, fall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in thisright in his, in the part, the men part, and it went in thisexcuse the expressionright in where it aches for the men.</span> <span id="s119">He could feel the bullet.</span> <span id="s120">He could touch it.</span> <span id="s121">The other man said, don't do nothing.</span> <span id="s122">Drive faster the horse.</span> <span id="s123">Drive the horse, and then we were already in Latvia, and then we stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the water.</span> <span id="s124">And they took him out of the wagon and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the water.</span> <span id="s125">And I said, how can you leave them by the water?</span> <span id="s126">And he said, I made arrangements to the other side because the other side of the river, the Russian Army was a little bit more organized.</span> <span id="s127">It could start to fight back.</span> <span id="s128">It made like a zone to fight back, and we left them there.</span> <span id="s129">My father didn't want to leave the man.</span> <span id="s130">After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on sayingI was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it.</span> <span id="s131">You'll kill him.</span> <span id="s132">And anyway we left him by the edge of the water and we started going farther.</span> <span id="s133">We are alreadymy father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the wagon with him, and this he took with him.</span> <span id="s134">We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in Latvian, is different, similar but different.</span> <span id="s135">My mother didn't speak Latvia, and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't.</span> <span id="s136">Then he hear some fromsomebody told us ______ that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s137">You are one of them.</span> <span id="s138">The Germans were not even there yet.</span> <span id="s139">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s140">And go there, make a left and a right there.</span> <span id="s141">And there was a farm and there was a Jew.</span> <span id="s142">Maybe he can give you directions.</span> <span id="s143">Anyway, we came over there.</span> <span id="s144">He had a farm and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this.</span> <span id="s145">And there was a little town and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s146">And my father said to him, what should we do?</span> <span id="s147">And he said, I am in the same boat like you are.</span> <span id="s148">The war was going on.</span> <span id="s149">We didn't know how long it was going to go.</span> <span id="s150">So stay with us for a while.</span> <span id="s151">And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the farm was close to the water, maybe a quarter of a mile.</span> <span id="s152">And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other side.</span> <span id="s153">But we couldn't.</span> <span id="s154">He wanted to go over.</span> <span id="s155">The reasonI skipped a little bit.</span> <span id="s156">The reason we came to this 10 place, he wanted to go to Latvia.</span> <span id="s157">The Russian go over to Latvia.</span> <span id="s158">There was bridge and the Russian Army exploded the bridge becausethen the tanks and the army.</span> <span id="s159">Their own people.</span> <span id="s160">There was a lot of Jewish, and on the bridge, we were lucky not to make the time on the bridge.</span> <span id="s161">If we were on the bridge we would be exploded too.</span> <span id="s162">Right before our eyes we saw the bridge collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really.</span> <span id="s163">With their rifles and they couldn't even walk.</span> <span id="s164">They got on the other side.</span> <span id="s165">We remained on our side and the people on the other side, there was still the army holding the gun.</span> <span id="s166">But a couple days on the farm with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on.</span> <span id="s167">And we took the little boat.</span> <span id="s168">We really wanted to go over.</span> <span id="s169">He said, I can't take anyone right now.</span> <span id="s170">I was going in the nighttime.</span> <span id="s171">I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there?</span> <span id="s172">They are fighting with the Germans and ________ and the Jewish and he found out.</span> <span id="s173">And they couldn't make it back on the other side, but he came back with this man from the farm.</span> <span id="s174">And he came back and said, look, he said, it is bad.</span> <span id="s175">I am taking my horse and wagon and I am going.</span> <span id="s176">He had some people that came to him and said, ride it out from the 11 people.</span> <span id="s177">And we are left completely alone, and this was like in evening and I said to my fatherand my father's name was Heim(ph)and he shake hands with him.</span> <span id="s178">I got my family and you have yours.</span> <span id="s179">I have to go my way.</span> <span id="s180">I can't take you where I'm going.</span> <span id="s181">We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other side.</span> <span id="s182">We were trying to go back from where we came.</span> <span id="s183">That's why I said the little horse was like a dog.</span> <span id="s184">We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse.</span> <span id="s185">He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this.</span> <span id="s186">And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks Latvia, and we

things like this.</span> <span id="s203">We knew how to speak German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right.</span> <span id="s204">But of course, my father knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar.</span> <span id="s205">But in this experience we are going down to a house, a bag to grab it and saw it on the ground and it exploded.</span> <span id="s206">It was like a
