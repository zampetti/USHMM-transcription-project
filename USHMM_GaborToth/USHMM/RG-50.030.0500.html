<p><span id="s31">Q: And where?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: In Lódz, Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: So let’s spend a little time talking about your family and h-how you were raised, and what it was like to live with your parents and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I am the oldest one, my sister is six and a half years younger, so I was the only child for six and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So that means you have an only child perspective, almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Ob-Obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What did your dad do?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My dad was a journalist in a Jewish newspaper that a group of young men got together and formed a cooperative, and it was a daily Jewish newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: And was that -- that was his profession, to be a journalist?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Right.</span> <span id="s41">Actually, what they did, it was -- at that time it was right after the first war -- war, and of course I was not there and don’t remember anything of that, just by stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My father was, to start with, a very active leader in unionization right after the war.</span> <span id="s44">And he helped to establish the union of printers in Lódz.</span> <span id="s45">Now, a [indecipherable] statement is that Lódz was the second largest city in Poland, Warsaw was the capital, Lódz was the industrial city, and it was called the Polish Manchester.</span> <span id="s46">And the -- really the only industrial city in Poland, which meant that it was also a city of social and political ferment.</span> <span id="s47">The union -- uni -- birth of the unions, the workers movement etcetera, and I was born in that atmosphere.</span> <span id="s48">A big city coming into being as a substantial industrial city, in a Poland that was mostly, or only agricultural before.</span> <span id="s49">The city -- the population of the city consisted of sort of three parts.</span> <span id="s50">Pol -- Poles, Jews, and Germans.</span> <span id="s51">The industrial trend was coming from the west, so the Germans were a very important element, establishing all kinds of industrial complexes, but the main thing how this textile business came to be, is through -- I don’t know th-the name would it be -- for people working at the loom in their own apartments.</span> <span id="s52">So they would be home workers, and when you -- when I was going to school, from my home to my school, I would pass many homes where on the first floor you could hear the click of the looms, one after another and you saw men sitting in the loom and working.</span> <span id="s53">That -- that was the basic thing, what built, you know, industry in Lódz.</span> <span id="s54">And then of course, the -- were the big manufacturing things and Germans, it was mostly in German hands, big, you know, big stores, and big commerce, led mostly by Germans and Jews and Poles.</span> <span id="s55">So it was a three part city that lived pretty much in peace til the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: What was your home like?</span> <span id="s57">Wa -- did your mother work, by the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: No.</span> <span id="s60">So she was home?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes, she was home, she was a homemaker.</span> <span id="s62">My father worked, and that is how I sort of learned first hand from my mother about feminism.</span> <span id="s63">She never used the name, neither did I, but looking back when I got in touch with my feminism in modern times here, in America, I was recalling that where I -- where I got it from.</span> <span id="s64">And I don’t know, life was good, and I knew that.</span> <span id="s65">Why?</span> <span id="s66">Because I was very observant, and I was, you know, had many friends, and visited, and revisited.</span> <span id="s67">And also each time when I went to another home, my mother was drilling me, what did you see, what was the furniture, who lived there, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: So I had to pay attention to all that, to give mother a report.</span> <span id="s70">So -- but I also saw the relationship, you know, in the homes, and I always came back and ti -- this time that the relationship were the best in my home, between my parents and between my parents and children.</span> <span id="s71">But i -- so what she was saying about her life was sometimes she got very a -- not sometimes, very often, she was very angry.</span> <span id="s72">She was also very laughing and singing, you know, so all -- all emotions were just on the surface.</span> <span id="s73">And she would say, when she was angry with my father a little too much, I would say, “Mother, what do you want?</span> <span id="s74">Don’t you realize you have the best husband, and I have the best father?”</span> <span id="s75">She says, “I realize that, but look at his life and look at my life.</span> <span id="s76">He gets up, I fix breakfast, he eats, he gets dressed.</span> <span id="s77">I see that he’s properly dressed and go -- he goes to work outside, for fun.</span> <span id="s78">What do I do?</span> <span id="s79">I clean, I cook, I clean, I cook, I shop and clean and cook.</span> <span id="s80">And I would like to work, I would like to be in the outside world.”</span> <span id="s81">So I said, “Why aren’t you?”</span> <span id="s82">Because I cannot.</span> <span id="s83">You know, she was the daughter of a pretty well to do -- a construction -- a builder, he was building houses.</span> <span id="s84">And before the w -- first war, they were quite well-to-do.</span> <span id="s85">After the war I saw a lot of paper money around, bags of paper money, and I knew that that’s where the money went.</span> <span id="s86">You know, there was a total wipe-out.</span> <span id="s87">And she says, “I could not work, my father would never let him, it would be a bad mark, if he -- his daughter, Shlomo Gavcewicz’s daughter would work?</span> <span id="s88">Never.</span> <span id="s89">And now, since I am married, if I would work, that would mean that your father is not capable of supporting a family.</span> <span id="s90">So I cannot do that, it would be hell.</span> <span id="s91">That’s my life.</span> <span id="s92">But you, you will be different.</span> <span id="s93">You will get all the education so that you can work, and life will be different for you.”</span> <span id="s94">That was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: It’s very interesting.</span> <span id="s96">How -- do you remember about how old you were when you had this kind of a conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Oh, about 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: About 10 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Nine, 10 - 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: But she didn’t seem to say this with a lot of bitterness, it was just very straightforward.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s102">Straightforward.</span> <span id="s103">And about bitterness and anger, I -- you know, particularly when I became a physician and I learned from families for women and I notice that the biggest characteristics of women’s upbringing was don’t be angry, cover it, don’t be a -- and I -- at first I didn’t understand, but then I understood that those were the messages in this culture that families gave to girls.</span> <span id="s104">Anger is for boys, and for you, be nice and sweet.</span> <span id="s105">So, I remember then, you know, how my life -- when I was angry, Mother never stopped me, only let me -- let me fume, then at one point she says, “Okay, you’re angry.</span> <span id="s106">How long -- how long will it last?”</span> <span id="s107">That stopped me.</span> <span id="s108">In other word, you can get angry, it’s okay with me, but don’t overdo that.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: So that -- that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: So you must have been very close to her.</span> <span id="s112">Somewhat --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: I was, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: And -- and without knowing, really, because she was not a doting mother.</span> <span id="s116">For that I had my grandmother, her mother, you know?</span> <span id="s117">My grandmother’s lap was always open and I can jump and be there, and she would cuddle me and hug me.</span> <span id="s118">My mother did not acknowledge any of those things.</span> <span id="s119">It was all talk, but no close physical contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Other than, you know, there was a habit of kissing the hand of mommy and daddy when I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">On -- as good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And when you came home, the same thing or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: No, not.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Only the -- only good-bye?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: O-O-Only the good-bye, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So your mother was not physically affectionate, it was your -- your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, not physic -- no, that’s right, that I got from my grandmother, but mother always -- yo -- it was a subject to talk with me, explain and ask give, you know, encouragement, to give reports, to observe and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And was the grandmother your mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: And was she living in that house with you as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yes, we were living together, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: So you had a lot of access to --</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: And grandfather, it was the -- my grandfather’s property.</span> <span id="s137">It was a s -- a four story building, apartment building and we lived there together in a large apartment, and my grandfather was a good guy, he always watched as I was coming from school, with whom I am coming home, etcetera.</span> <span id="s138">But ne -- also, no physical closeness.</span> <span id="s139">Only grandmother was th -- was for that.</span> <span id="s140">Grandfather I always had a good contact, I could talk to him, he would ask me things, but no physical closeness.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: And what about your father?</span> <span id="s142">Were you close with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Very close, yes, ver -- we were very close.</span> <span id="s146">I was the first one, the only one for a long time --</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: -- and he was always watchful.</span> <span id="s149">He would make homework with me, and help me out and he would read to me.</span> <span id="s150">And when I was a little older, nine, 10, he would bring me books.</span> <span id="s151">And, you know, working in a newspaper, there were always books b-brought in by publishers, and so on, so he would bring me samples of those books.</span> <span id="s152">And they were pretty advanced books, Polish history, and the bloody Polish history of -- you know, Poland had a very bloody history.</span> <span id="s153">It is a country that is between Germany, Russia, Austria, the Hapsburgs, the Prussians, and the Norse.</span> <span id="s154">And though there was a part of history, there was the golden age of Poland in Middle Ages, where Poland was quite potent and -- militarily, and was attacking the neighbors, and also is known for having the first university in Krakow, in Europe.</span> <span id="s155">So it was a pretty -- you know, pretty acknowledged country, but bloody history, you know?</span> <span id="s156">Like we had the significant that I remember, and there were books written, the Norse i-invaded, you know, the Swedes, the Vikings, Middle Ages, invaded Poland and run down the whole country and the beautiful books that the author got a Nobel Prize, part of the flood when the Vikings flooded the whole country.</span> <span id="s157">And the atrocities and interrogation and punishment.</span> <span id="s158">The underground places where they kept the people that they -- you know, the invaders, bloody killings and so on.</span> <span id="s159">So I was exposed to that really very early, so I knew history very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did your father understand what your mother was si -- telling you about being independent?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And he appreciated that?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: It was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: But not for his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: No, that was part of the culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: That’s culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Both of them would not dare for my mother to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s171">But it was okay for that to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I had -- I had the new generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Uh-huh, it’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Different.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did you eat lunch together?</span> <span id="s178">Did your father come home for lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: It depends, you know, he worked shifts, you know, the ol -- the p -- the whole group worked shifts.</span> <span id="s180">He was a printer by -- by trade, so I remember him working this big linotype -- this big, mechanical machine came from America, and you know, I saw him working, and I -- I was fascinated by that.</span> <span id="s181">He also set types, he also wrote editorial.</span> <span id="s182">You know, there was -- everybody did something of the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I don’t -- so -- but they worked shifts, so I don’t know how it was lunch.</span> <span id="s185">When I was going to school I would take lunch and dinner was always early, two o’clock, three o’clock, that was the main meal.</span> <span id="s186">We ate together, so everybody was at the table together.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: So maybe that’s what I mean.</span> <span id="s188">I’m calling it lunch and I shouldn’t, I should call it dinner, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: That’s -- that was at dinnertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: -- you had supper --</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: -- later.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So your dad would be home for the dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: When he worked that way, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: When he worked that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Was that -- w-was -- was that nice, the dinner, the conversation?</span> <span id="s199">And were you included, or were you really considered a kid, so you should be very quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was included when I wanted to say something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: I-It was a nice time.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And your grandmother and grandfather were --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Separate.</span> <span id="s207">They --</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s210">We lived in one large apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: -- but there were separate households.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: And actually, you know, so they -- my grandmother was cooking for her husband, my grandfather, and in earlier years there was, you know, my aunt was there, and my uncles.</span> <span id="s215">There were three -- five children, including my mother.</span> <span id="s216">And then they got -- slowly they all got married and left home.</span> <span id="s217">So they was separate -- cooked separately, so it was a separate household.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: In addition to being interested in history, what other interests did you have as a kid?</span> <span id="s219">Did you like school?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Oh, I loved school.</span> <span id="s221">To go -- oh, grade school, and high school, I loved school.</span> <span id="s222">My biggest interest was natural sciences.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Zoology, and bi -- bot -- botany.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s227">And I remember, every summer we went on vacation in the country, you know?</span> <span id="s228">That was a habit, a custom, not only for the rich by -- but middle class as well, and maybe lower, too.</span> <span id="s229">You would rent a cheap place, or more expen -- whatever your finances were, in the country, which would be maybe 50 kilometers, 30 kilometers outside the city, and spend the summertime, which was a long time, it was two and a half months.</span> <span id="s230">School was out.</span> <span id="s231">And my father would come for weekends, and we stayed, you know, children, very often there was extended family, cousins.</span> <span id="s232">So that was a wonderful life.</span> <span id="s233">And each summer, after summer, I would come home with loads of samples of leaves and -- pressed leaves, ple -- pressed flowers.</span> <span id="s234">Preserved salamanders and snakes, and -- you know, things like that.</span> <span id="s235">My father taught me how to catch snakes and preserve them.</span> <span id="s236">That was for my classes, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So you caught live snakes?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And then you killed them?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s242">And then you --</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: And salamanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And salamanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: And frogs, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: So I was, you know that -- every summer.</span> <span id="s248">That was my -- my doing.</span> <span id="s249">And catch butterflies and kill them and make shows of different butterflies.</span> <span id="s250">It was fun.</span> <span id="s251">Very busy summers.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: I can see that.</span> <span id="s253">And then you would take them to the class, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Oh yes, I would take them to school, and show off, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: So you did a lot of work for the teachers, actually, without knowing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh, I didn’t look at it like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Right, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: -- I was just showing what I did during my summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And the -- the other kids, you told me you were friends.</span> <span id="s260">Were they as interested in school and study as you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Some were.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s264">And then there were some kids as we got older, got interest very much in the social issues, which was a burning question in Poland in those times between wars.</span> <span id="s265">You see, to our right was Russia, that just became Bolshevik Russia, and that was a big experiment, and we couldn’t stop talking about it.</span> <span id="s266">You know, kids.</span> <span id="s267">Grown-ups, too, but it was a forbidden thing to even think about.</span> <span id="s268">Ye -- Communism was forbidden by the Polish reactionary government, and other governments, you know, it was a sort of a new things, and so that was all discussed in hush with friends, so I had some friends that were very interested in the question as was I, and I was reading to no end, all the, you know, chief writers of Communism, Socialism.</span> <span id="s269">And I know that was not against what my father was thinking, but we nev -- it was unspoken because if you were caught and went to -- the thing was that the kids that were then caught in the -- this Communist spirit, and infiltration, you know, there was infiltration from Soviet Union by youths, too, and you could hear murmurs, you know, when we were going out of school by Friday, come to the meeting, come to the meeting here and here.</span> <span id="s270">And we knew that was Communist meetings, but you didn’t dare to think about it because you could get expelled from school, and kids were getting expelled from getting involved in Communist cells.</span> <span id="s271">But the curiosity at that age is so strong, that I could just not -- you know, put it together aside.</span> <span id="s272">So we had couple kids that were on the same wavelengths and we would read and discuss, and discuss, particularly about w-what is -- how -- what are the best way to edu -- to bring up children.</span> <span id="s273">And you know, part of the Communist agenda was to -- to -- to put a wedge between parents and children and took away ch -- take away children, often to -- for separate education and so on.</span> <span id="s274">And that was dangerous stuff, you know, at home to talk about.</span> <span id="s275">But we talked nevertheless, and what we think, what would be better, there was endless discussions.</span> <span id="s276">And then one time -- this friend of mine that was mostly knowledgeable said, look, there is a meeting such and such a day, such and such a place, I have a friend and he wants us to go, a-and participate there.</span> <span id="s277">So I said, “You know, Stephanie, it’s dangerous.”</span> <span id="s278">“Oh, who cares, come on, let’s go.”</span> <span id="s279">I said, “Okay, we’ll go.”</span> <span id="s280">So we went, and that was the friend that took us there, and it was in the Polish section of town.</span> <span id="s281">Actually, it was in the section of town that later was turned into the ghetto for Jews.</span> <span id="s282">So we were in there on a little, small, apartment, you know, very high up, and there were people around the table.</span> <span id="s283">It was cold, it was winter, it was bitter cold.</span> <span id="s284">And there was a little iron stove that was giving a little heat, and a lot of people, and so we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s285">And you know the saying is that poverty s-smells.</span> <span id="s286">That was just my experience, the poverty stunk there.</span> <span id="s287">It was so poor.</span> <span id="s288">People were from the very, very poor population, sitting, and there was this guy, and this guy just came from Russia.</span> <span id="s289">Communist, propagandist, and was talking, and everybody was hushed and listening.</span> <span id="s290">And he was talking what a great country Soviet Union is, how things are good, how poor people are doing well, how the regime is taking care of poor people, etcetera, etcetera, and of course they all listened and loved it.</span> <span id="s291">And, okay, so we went -- you know, that was after that, went home and I had all kinds of -- they were really not mixed feelings, I understood very well why this guy looked and was received like a -- as a prophet.</span> <span id="s292">You know, smelling the smell of poverty, and the posture of those poor people, you know, the babushkas and so on.</span> <span id="s293">I said, well they are looking for a prophet.</span> <span id="s294">They have it so bad that I am not surprised that they are looking for that.</span> <span id="s295">But then I said, you know, as for -- later on I said, well, it’s not my life.</span> <span id="s296">I am not part of it.</span> <span id="s297">He da -- you know, he cannot speak to me, he did not speak to me.</span> <span id="s298">And that was it for me, you know?</span> <span id="s299">The contact with Communism, and the aura of paradise, but I understood that.</span> <span id="s300">So that was this episode of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: How old were you when you went to that meeting, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: 14 year -- 13 - 14.</span> <span id="s303">But we were engaged in serious --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Serious discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: So you were reading Marx, you were reading --</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Were you reading Marx and Engels and --</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: -- Trotsky?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: -- sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes, and I thought Marx was great, and Engels was great.</span> <span id="s314">Oh, no question about it.</span> <span id="s315">And I had the books and I didn’t have them open, but I knew my parents did see them, and they did not tell me don’t read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Don’t read them.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: In other words, learn everything you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s319">Was -- was there any political discussion in school, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: No.</span> <span id="s322">Not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: No.</span> <span id="s324">Forbidden.</span> <span id="s325">And then another interesting thing.</span> <span id="s326">This guy whom -- my friend who brought my friend and me to the cell, Communist cell, was in ghetto later.</span> <span id="s327">I had no contact with him, nothing close, but I knew who he is.</span> <span id="s328">And one day he was arrested in the ghetto for killing his mother and keeping her body in his place, and using his -- her ration cards to get bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So he could get two rations.</span> <span id="s330">Wow.</span> <span id="s331">So something about the --</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Is there a correlation or not?</span> <span id="s333">But I say, well, okay.</span> <span id="s334">What can you say?</span> <span id="s335">You know, that -- that was just something to -- to note about people.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Now, your father was a Bundist?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I don’t think he was a -- officially a Bundist, but a Bundist’s, you know, perception.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: [indecipherable] uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: He was not a party man.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s341">And your mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: -- agreed, but she was not --</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: No, not involved in any party.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: So did you discuss politics with your parents?</span> <span id="s346">I understand you didn’t discuss the Communist stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: But did you discuss politics in other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s352">My father was in -- at the newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Right?</span> <span id="s355">And he al -- always was bringing news from the -- from the first sort of thing.</span> <span id="s356">And there was always a lot of discussion about anti-Semitism in the government, and what they are doing.</span> <span id="s357">And the big discussion was in the Parliament about the Jewish question and the way that Jews, they killed the animals.</span> <span id="s358">You know, for food, what do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Oh, Kaszrut rules, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Kaszrut -- ritual killing.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: And if the government wanted to do away with special way Jews were killing their animals.</span> <span id="s365">You have no idea how much time was spent on that in the Sejm which was the Congress, and my father knew it from the news coming year in, and year out.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Anti-Semitism was just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: I think we have to change the tape and we’ll continue the discussion in a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Paula, I just want to go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s372">What kind of a school did you attend?</span> <span id="s373">Was this a regular public school, a mixed public school, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, it was considered a regular public school, but it also was clear that the public school was segregated into -- aro -- along the line of sex and relig -- religion.</span> <span id="s375">So I was attending a girl’s school for Jewish girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And so would there be a girl’s school for Catholic girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s379">Were your friends mixed in your neighborhood?</span> <span id="s380">Were you with Catholics as well as Jews, or were you primarily with Jewish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: We lived in a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s382">See, there were Jewish neighborhoods, but we lived in a -- a-and some Jews not, but the majority lived in Jewish quarters.</span> <span id="s383">But we lived in a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s384">So my best friend was a Catholic girl next door, which was a Catholic family, a -- with five children.</span> <span id="s385">And I was the only child, so I was there a lot.</span> <span id="s386">One of the girls was my age, Jadwiga, and we were best friends in both homes.</span> <span id="s387">And it was a wonderful friendship.</span> <span id="s388">Every year I will spend that Christmastime in their home at the Christmas tree, and you know, Santa Claus coming, I was part of it.</span> <span id="s389">The only thing I couldn’t do was to eat there, because we -- m -- respect Kaszrut, y-you know?</span> <span id="s390">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: So you were kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Kosher, yes.</span> <span id="s393">So -- mixed kosher, but still kosher enough that I could not eat any non-Jewish home.</span> <span id="s394">But other than that, you know, I was part of their home, and it -- it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s395">They were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s396">He -- Mr. Wojkowski worked on the railroad, and he was sort of a chunky guy with big whiskers, you know, like that, oh.</span> <span id="s397">Lovely man.</span> <span id="s398">And his wife was a chunky woman, she cooked, you know, with big pots and so on.</span> <span id="s399">So -- I -- I -- I loved being there, a-and it was great.</span> <span id="s400">Two things.</span> <span id="s401">In their home, on one wall, there was a big portrait of the -- o-of -- of Mary, and it was the black Mary of Matka Boska Czestochowska.</span> <span id="s402">Matka Boska, mother of God, from Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s403">And that was a holy part where some -- this portrait, this mother of Jesus saved Czestochowa, stopped in Czestochowa, which was a western border city, stopped the influx of the Vikings.</span> <span id="s404">Her portrait stopped the Vikings.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: So in very -- homes that respect that, it was her portrait with a red light on top of it that burned day and night.</span> <span id="s409">And I was so scared of that portrait.</span> <span id="s410">I remember that, cause there was a such a powerful black woman, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s412">That’s a very big symbol in Poland, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: And it being a Catholic country, you had on holidays, eastern and other, you would have people marching in the street with the holy -- holy pictures, and singing.</span> <span id="s416">It was part of life.</span> <span id="s417">The bad part for -- of that life for Jews was like that.</span> <span id="s418">Every Easter before the holiday, there came a priest with a bunch of holy water, and he was going -- it was a four story building, from top of the building to the bottom and sprinkle -- sprinkling holy water and saying pray -- prayers.</span> <span id="s419">When he was coming, Jewish people had to stay indoors.</span> <span id="s420">We could not get out.</span> <span id="s421">Okay?</span> <span id="s422">That was the anti-Semitism from top, right?</span> <span id="s423">Also, before Easter there was always, every Easter, there was a story written up in papers, spoken, that the Jews caught a Christian boy, killed him and used his blood to bake matzohs.</span> <span id="s424">And that day, Jews were beaten up all around the city, just for the sake of beating Jews.</span> <span id="s425">So that came with the holidays as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: So how did this affect you as a young Jewish girl growing up, since you have -- you were living in a mixed neighborhood, your best friend is Catholic.</span> <span id="s427">Does this provoke a kind of conflict in you, or this is just the way it is?</span> <span id="s428">I mean, I ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: That’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: That’s life.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: So at home there were alls -- always -- the oy veys, and who next, and who will be beaten, who will be killed, and be careful on the street, stay home, don’t expose yourself and things like that.</span> <span id="s432">Between me and Jadwiga, we had -- we were all very curious girls, and all through the year, we would walk on the street and have heavy discussions, mostly about religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s435">So the point of it was, whose religion is best?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: That was the point?</span> <span id="s437">And?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: The end result.</span> <span id="s439">So we would bring up our arguments.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: And my argument, it is the oldest religion, look how many years, 5,000 plus years, da da da da, we gave the Bible, we got Moses and -- and her was again about Jesus and so on, and so on.</span> <span id="s442">And then we play on the street, that was just part of the routine.</span> <span id="s443">And then when she or I would run out of arguments, I don’t -- I didn’t know what to say any more to counter, I said wait a minute, I will be back, and run to my mother.</span> <span id="s444">And she did the same when she ran out.</span> <span id="s445">We would run to our mothers and ask how to continue our discussion, and come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: But this was not an argument.</span> <span id="s447">You weren't --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: We had -- it was a discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: It’s really a discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: It was really a discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Did anybody win in the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I’m sure if she once, I wa -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Both of you si -- but it never -- it didn’t affect your relationship?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: No.</span> <span id="s456">It’s interesting because often that kind of a conflict you don’t want to have with somebody, so you avoid the discussion, but not you folks.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Ha -- we had very smart mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Yes, I guess you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: Both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: That, you know, knew how to continue our discussion --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: -- between us without getting hostile.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Cause they could have, if they wanted to --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: -- they could -- they could have interfered that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: But no, they just gave enough material to keep talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Did you ever want to be not Jewish, before --</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s474">And then to -- the only son -- you know, that I think there were five girls and one son, Tadek, Tadeusz, was a nice guy.</span> <span id="s475">And Christmas time, of course, I was there, sitting in the circle, and then yo -- Santa Claus was coming and giving things and so on, and so I was part of it.</span> <span id="s476">And then one time, I probably was six years old, seven maybe, Santa Claus is coming and does the same thing, and I looked at him and I said, who is he?</span> <span id="s477">And I say in the moment, “Tadek!”</span> <span id="s478">And they all broke out laughing, because I -- you know, it was the first time that I --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: That you realized.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: -- that I realized who Santa Claus is.</span> <span id="s481">And then later when I was thinking about it and laughing, I said, well, if anybody should be Santa Claus, Tadek is fine.</span> <span id="s482">I like him, he wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: You like him, he was good.</span> <span id="s484">Did they ever take you to church, or did you ever take them to synagogue or was that also si -- you just didn’t do that, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: You’re kidding.</span> <span id="s486">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: I -- I guess I am.</span> <span id="s488">You didn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: It was forbidden.</span> <span id="s490">I tell you that this was so forbidden and such a touchy subject that I didn’t know the real -- realize that til late -- lately.</span> <span id="s491">The idea was that I was told -- excuse me -- was when I pass a church, I should run quickly and be gone.</span> <span id="s492">Don’t look, just pass it quickly, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s493">I don’t understood -- I -- I don’t think I understood that commandment, you know, not to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I don’t remember why it was lately that I understood that.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: You mean you had forgotten that you were told that?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: No, I remembered it all the time.</span> <span id="s498">Cause somebody I -- you know, cause a -- a -- in my life here, I was in Catholic church or Protestant ch -- numerous times, on occasion of my friend’s different traditions, you know, weddings, birth of a child or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Funerals.</span> <span id="s501">But I -- you know, somebody asked me so why -- why was it such a -- such a -- you know, anathema to avoid the church?</span> <span id="s502">And I -- I think it came with the realization how much anti-Semitism is connected with Christian religion.</span> <span id="s503">That it, for the 2,000 years since the death of Jesus, Jews were accused of killing him, and encouraged by the church to hate Jews and kill Jews.</span> <span id="s504">And it still goes on, til now.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: But that wasn’t your consciousness as a kid.</span> <span id="s506">You -- you knew there was a problem with being Jewish in some way, certainly on these holidays when you knew you had --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: -- right?</span> <span id="s509">But in general this was not -- this was not an every day feeling of yours, or was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: If not every day, very frequent.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: It was frequent?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Beating Jews was on the agenda.</span> <span id="s513">Plus, you know, that news that my father was bringing about the Congress fighting Jews.</span> <span id="s514">Now, the ritual killing of animals, you know what that is, i-it -- it depends on the humanitarian point to kill the animals in -- animal as quickly and p -- as pain free as possible, which means that the guy that is killing, using the knife, is looking for a artery in the neck of the animal and cuts the biggest artery, one or two on both sides.</span> <span id="s515">So that the death come quickest.</span> <span id="s516">And the government said no, don’t do that.</span> <span id="s517">It is a Jewish -- Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s518">We kill it differently, which is not so humanitarian according to Jewish thinking -- Jewish ritual thinking.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: So, you know, I heard about -- you know, the -- the war against Jews really, the fight against Jews from top to bottom.</span> <span id="s521">Killing on the street --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s523">Was it typical for most of Poland, or was this more in Lódz that -- that the schools were segregated by sex and religion?</span> <span id="s524">Was this typical at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: That was typical.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: It was typical.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: So that you and your friend -- and obviously when you’re walking, you’re going to walk to separate schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And then you come together later.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Did that bother you?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: That was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: -- that was life.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Were you worried, as a young Jewish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: No.</span> <span id="s539">You figured you were okay, that this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I was okay, I was protected by my parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Parents, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: -- life inside was good, life in school was good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Would you have considered yourself wealthy?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I wouldn’t know what you’re talking about --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: -- if you ask me then.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: You -- you lived in a comfortable place.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: You were at -- you had good food.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: You had clothes, you had a -- a rabbit’s fur coat until they got you a cloth coat, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So you were f -- you were comfortable?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Absolutely, very comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: When Hitler took over in Germany in ’33, when the Nazis come in --</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: -- do you -- you hear about it, cause you’re father’s a journalist, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: The radio was on all the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: -- with his speeches, with Hitler’s speeches.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: So you’re 11 years old, so you really become conscious of what’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s564">And is Poland then becoming more radically right at that time as well, so there’s more Fascism in Poland at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: So it becomes worse in Poland as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Right.</span> <span id="s568">And there was also big discussion about it, what’s happening, what should Poland do --</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: -- with the idea, you know, is what is happening there, and I think the resolution day came for is to -- to go to the right and to meet Hitler halfway, sort of be friends with Hitler --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: -- to avoid what may happen, which they did not avoid anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s574">Do you remember before the war, in ’39, that there’s any discussion about we’ve got to get out of here, they’re going to do something?</span> <span id="s575">There is discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: And how.</span> <span id="s577">A lot of people got out.</span> <span id="s578">You had to have a lot of money, and you had to consider running away from your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s580">It’s a terrifying thing, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: It became terrifying more and more as -- after ’33.</span> <span id="s582">The relatives that we had in -- in Germany, in the Saar, my father’s mother, my grandmother, and one of the daughters, Erna, who at that time was married and had one child, and couple uncles emigrated to s -- to the Saar, Germany.</span> <span id="s583">That was for -- I think that was in 19 -- 19 -- maybe ’30.</span> <span id="s584">That was for economical reasons, because the depression in Poland was very bitter, and Germany, [indecipherable] and Germany had it better.</span> <span id="s585">So for economic reasons they moved.</span> <span id="s586">Now, when Hitler came, the question was -- they were under Hitler, we were still free.</span> <span id="s587">What do they do?</span> <span id="s588">What does the family do?</span> <span id="s589">So, I think even before ’39, part of the family m-moved to Palestine, at that time, you know, Israel was not existing --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: -- but to Palestine.</span> <span id="s592">And my father approved of that, you know, get out of Germany.</span> <span id="s593">Then, you know, a year or two passed, or so, and they could not establish themselves.</span> <span id="s594">Econ -- economy in Palestine was horrendous and they could not make it.</span> <span id="s595">So they went back to Europe, and my father was so mad.</span> <span id="s596">They should have stayed, do you know what’s coming, don’t they see what is coming?</span> <span id="s597">They went to France, not to Germany, and lived in France.</span> <span id="s598">So that what my father thought about, you know, moving --</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: [indecipherable] different.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: -- but for himself and so on, there was not the urgency, there was not the money and there were Mother’s parents, aged parents that -- Mother was very reluctant to sit -- to separate herself from.</span> <span id="s601">So there were endless discussion, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s602">Then we got a -- eventually what happened to the family that went eventually to friends was that my aunt was taken from the street of Paris to a death camp.</span> <span id="s603">My uncle and the three boys, my cousins, with whom we were corresponding, were lucky enough to escape and stay in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s604">Because many were turned away, Switzerland was -- was not very kind.</span> <span id="s605">And they were interned in a camp for Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: In Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: -- in Switzerland throughout the war.</span> <span id="s608">So the positive side was they survived in relative okay condition, the negative that they were treating -- treated like criminals in Switzerland, in camp.</span> <span id="s609">So that was this part of the family.</span> <span id="s610">Now shortly before ’39, people were running away on foot to Russia as a way to escape Hitler.</span> <span id="s611">Many Jews did, and the question was, why don’t we?</span> <span id="s612">I was the one to instigating into -- who was instigating a run.</span> <span id="s613">Don’t you see what’s happening?</span> <span id="s614">We cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s615">Run.</span> <span id="s616">My mother says, if you want to run, go.</span> <span id="s617">It would be okay with me, but I cannot.</span> <span id="s618">Here are my grand -- my parents, I cannot leave them, so I won’t go.</span> <span id="s619">And my father too, there was a reluctance to leave on the simple premise, that’s my home, that’s my country.</span> <span id="s620">I don’t want to run.</span> <span id="s621">Who can force me to run?</span> <span id="s622">And I don’t have enough money, and beside they were news too, that people that invested money in running, to -- making plans to go to South America for instance, we later find out that that was a lie, the offices took money and got -- transferred the Jews to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s623">So there was no firm belief that you can really run, because you may lose everything and your life anyway.</span> <span id="s624">So that was the decision, to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Did you think a war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Did you think a war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: We didn’t think, we knew it’s coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: You knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes, we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: So when you all s -- when your father said to his relatives, why are you leaving Palestine, you know what’s happening --</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: -- he -- that’s what he thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: And you thought so too?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: We took Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” literally.</span> <span id="s637">Hitler was still talking on the radio and me -- we I mean, my father and my mother and a bunch of other people believed that that is his plan and he is following it.</span> <span id="s638">There was no discussion that he will stop, unless friends in England will intervene, which they did not, they brou -- broke the pact with Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: They supposed to stand by Poland and they broke the pact, and they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: And did you -- did you also feel that there was a particular vulnerability to the Jewish population, to you and your family because of what you heard from Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: We believe in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: So there’s no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: There’s no question.</span> <span id="s647">In our mind there was no question.</span> <span id="s648">Particularly that -- I think that was ’38, Hitler led -- Hitler ran out jew -- from Germany, Jews that were not German citizens, that were Polish citizens.</span> <span id="s649">There were a lot of Jews from Poland that were in Germany, and they were not citizens.</span> <span id="s650">He send them back to Poland.</span> <span id="s651">And we were in touch with those Jews, particularly in Lódz, you know, we knew there was a bunch of young Jews coming, so we got, you know, our group got in touch with those guys, and they were telling us what’s happening in Germany, and about Hitler’s pra -- plans, and to take it seriously.</span> <span id="s652">So for many ways, we knew to take him [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I don’t know how it was in United States, but we to -- we knew it’s coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: There was no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Let me change the subject for a minute, because I realize I’ve forgotten about your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Your sister was born in 1926?</span> <span id="s660">Four years, or si-six years?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: No not -- six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Right, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: So she was born in ’20 --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Eight, eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Eight.</span> <span id="s667">1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: How was that for you when this new littler person comes --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Pretty horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: It was pre --</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: I did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: You didn’t approve of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: I didn’t order her.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: No.</span> <span id="s677">She just came.</span> <span id="s678">So it was pretty nasty.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Did your mother try to explain to you what was going to happen?</span> <span id="s680">Or did she just -- your mother got bigger and she arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah, so -- oh, she -- it was talk, she let me feel her belly.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: She was -- my mother was pretty open, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s685">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: -- you know, sort of down to earth.</span> <span id="s687">And that it’s coming, but we didn’t know of course, who.</span> <span id="s688">They wanted -- my mother wanted a boy, but -- probably both parents wanted a boy, they had a girl already.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: But the sister came and here she was, and I had to adjust.</span> <span id="s691">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s692">And I was so mad because later on, you know -- my mother didn’t expect me to raise my sister or do much for her, really, she never did.</span> <span id="s693">I have to say, she was a wonderful mother.</span> <span id="s694">My father had chronic TB, you know, which was endemic in -- in -- in Poland.</span> <span id="s695">And so he would get attacks, you know, of some bleeding from the lungs.</span> <span id="s696">And she never expected me to serve as a nurse or do things.</span> <span id="s697">She was -- that was her duty, and so on.</span> <span id="s698">A-And about my sister, too, that was her child and so on.</span> <span id="s699">But then when my sister was walking, going for a walk, she would ask me sometimes to take her for a walk in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s700">I protested, but I took her.</span> <span id="s701">My friends loved her, she was a cute girl.</span> <span id="s702">It was pretty horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: But you were not happy to have this child around?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, I was not happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: What was her name?</span> <span id="s706">Her name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Dora -- Dorka, Dorka diminutive.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Did you ever like being around her?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: There’s a story.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: There’s a story?</span> <span id="s711">It’s a long story.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: No.</span> <span id="s714">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: It was so -- a-and then with homewo -- I was an excellent student, my sister was not, so my mother asked me to -- to help her with homework and so on, and my sister offered me all kinds of deals I couldn’t resist.</span> <span id="s716">If you help me I’ll wash the dishes for you, and things like that.</span> <span id="s717">It was not pleasant, you know, really.</span> <span id="s718">But she was growing up, and then we sort of parted ways, you know.</span> <span id="s719">She had her life and I had my life, til we were sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: So in Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And then it changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: It changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Why don’t we take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Paula, we’ll get back to your sister and this change of relationship under these --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: -- horrendous circumstances.</span> <span id="s730">But let’s talk about the beginning of the war some.</span> <span id="s731">The war finally -- you -- you’re all expecting this to happen.</span> <span id="s732">You expect the Germans to cross into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: So it’s September, 1939.</span> <span id="s735">What do y -- what do you remember about those first days in the war?</span> <span id="s736">What -- what picture is in your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, you know, before the war, there were all kinds of rumors coming from northern Poland.</span> <span id="s738">You know, Gdansk -- y-you know the name of the city, Danzig German, Gdansk, Polish.</span> <span id="s739">It was a -- a very sore spot between Poland and Germany.</span> <span id="s740">Poland in s -- Danzig -- Gdansk and Danzig, both countries thought it belongs to them.</span> <span id="s741">Finally, after the first World War, there was this agreement that Poland got a little bit of corridor, because Poland wanted some access to the sea, Baltic Sea.</span> <span id="s742">And if -- if Gdansk become Danzig, you know, Poland would have nothing.</span> <span id="s743">So they agreed to a small corridor that would lead to the Baltic Sea, so that both countries had access, and that Gdansk, or Danzig -- Poland will have access to -- to Gdansk to use it as a port.</span> <span id="s744">They were building another port, Gdynia, but that was later.</span> <span id="s745">Okay, so that was sort of a sore spot between the two countries, and a sore spot to erupt.</span> <span id="s746">The news came that Polish troops crossed into Germany across this small corridor, and germa -- Germany was ready to attack.</span> <span id="s747">What turned out later that the troops -- Polish troops were Germans dressed in Polish uniforms.</span> <span id="s748">So they provoked that, and they attacked.</span> <span id="s749">In Lódz what did we do?</span> <span id="s750">Well, we knew they are coming, and we developed, you know, sort of on the street, some defense.</span> <span id="s751">We will be watching or walking the streets, particularly the youth, and I was part of it, and watching for signs of airplanes coming, German airplanes at-attacking.</span> <span id="s752">So we were watching -- you know, walking around the blocks for a couple days.</span> <span id="s753">And then finally the news came on the radio that the German are on Polish so -- soil, and they are coming.</span> <span id="s754">So what I remember about that?</span> <span id="s755">I was there -- we were there, my grandmother and my mother.</span> <span id="s756">I think Father was at work, and my mother burst out crying.</span> <span id="s757">And she says, “I won’t make it, not a second time.</span> <span id="s758">Lived through the first World War, it was horrible, I won’t be able to make it.”</span> <span id="s759">And to me it was, my God, if Mother says that, I am doomed as well, I cannot take it, I cannot do anything like that without my mommy.</span> <span id="s760">So that was it.</span> <span id="s761">So we were still marching and watching, and watching and reporting to the elders.</span> <span id="s762">Nothing was happening, and then all of a sudden we ha -- we heard some bombs falling.</span> <span id="s763">But Lódz did not suffer from the bombing.</span> <span id="s764">It was, you know, here and there [indecipherable] nothing was happening, and one day the troops were marching in.</span> <span id="s765">And the Germans were in.</span> <span id="s766">And we were still waiting.</span> <span id="s767">We were ating -- waiting, and pretty soon the Germans started to paste orders on the w -- on the street walls, you know, the special walls when you put -- what do you call it when you put news?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Posters?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Posters.</span> <span id="s770">About, you know, some orders what not to do, times and so on and be home, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s771">And was a di -- probably the worst thing then that happened in those moments was that Polish -- Polish neighbors, particularly the -- there was a Polish couple that was taking care of the building, you know, sort of administering cleaning and so on.</span> <span id="s772">And some others started -- began to go to Jewish neighbors and taking out things, furniture, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s773">Sort of unprovoked, nothing, it was the Pole that started the war with the Jews.</span> <span id="s774">And I remember I was so furious about it.</span> <span id="s775">We had a neighbor, another neighbor who was a middle-aged woman, a businesswoman, she was a widow, and she and her son were running a little factory, they were making cardboard boxes.</span> <span id="s776">And she spoke perfectly German and so on, and I talked with her and I say, “What do we do, Mrs. Kronenburg?”</span> <span id="s777">And then I say, “Well, let’s do something.”</span> <span id="s778">And she says, “How about you and me will go to the German quarters and report our neighbors, they are robbing us?”</span> <span id="s779">I said okay, and Mother said okay, she didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s780">And that Mrs. Kronenburg spoke German very well.</span> <span id="s781">I spoke German too because German was second language in -- in -- in high school, foreign language.</span> <span id="s782">So we went to the German commando, very innocent, you know, and we asked to talk to the chief, and we tell him such and such, with disgust, that we are being ro-robed -- robbed, and that -- is that legal, is that how it should be?</span> <span id="s783">And he says no, it should not be.</span> <span id="s784">So he s -- asks an officer to come with us and stop the rob-robbery from our neighbors.</span> <span id="s785">And the officer came with us and talked to the neighbors that were robbing.</span> <span id="s786">Then they not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s787">So we were very proud of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Little did you think what would happen there.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Oh my God, the chutzpah that we had, right?</span> <span id="s790">I mean, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: -- innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Then there came the announcement about Jews, pertaining Jews.</span> <span id="s795">All Jews had to wear a star -- the stars of davi -- David, and restriction of being on the street, and more and more of that.</span> <span id="s796">And then pretty soon, as they settled in, you know, sort of, in Lódz, atrocities started to -- catching Jews on the street, taking them to the Gestapo for beating, interrogation.</span> <span id="s797">Slugging Jews with beards on the street, where mobs were hanging around, and enjoying -- the Polish mobs, and enjoying that.</span> <span id="s798">That was September, and the announcement of the ghetto, where the ghetto would be, and that by April everybody will have to be there, moved out.</span> <span id="s799">School, we did not start, you know, it was September, I supposed to be in high school, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: 12th grade.</span> <span id="s802">Did not start, it was closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Was that true for non-Jewish kids, for the Gentile kids as well as for the Jewish kids, there just was no school?</span> <span id="s804">Or you didn’t -- do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: I know it was for Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s809">And the school were used then as sort of office space to make lists of Jewish population, we were sitting and making lists of people, this quota, this quota, that quota.</span> <span id="s810">And of places in the ghetto, design ghetto, of the houses, house numbers, street numbers etcetera, where -- where people were sent.</span> <span id="s811">So for good while, you know, kids were -- me among them, were busy doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: So they had the kids who would have been at school being s -- pupils --</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: -- doing this --</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: -- logistical work.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Yes, yes, right.</span> <span id="s818">So -- okay, so the atmosphere was totally changed.</span> <span id="s819">Fear, unex -- unexpected can be expected any time, beating, arrest, sending here, there, we didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s820">After all, the -- within six days the German army occupied the whole Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: The total country.</span> <span id="s823">And as we were joking but not so happily about the Polish army that had beautiful officers, you know, famous for their sitting on the horses, the officer on the horses in corsets and handsome, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s824">And the tanks, the German ca -- tanks, took them pretty seriously and didn’t -- all that they wanted with themself.</span> <span id="s825">No defense, no defense.</span> <span id="s826">It was occupation, and what can I say, i-i-it was -- it sort of was unimagabable -- the unimagable was happening.</span> <span id="s827">A-A state of being nowhere, being nothing, and who knows?</span> <span id="s828">And nothing good coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Oh, that’s for sure, that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yes, so, we know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did you wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did you wear the Jewish star?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Sure, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: And did your little sister have to wear?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s840">So everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s842">And then it was something like that, and the family -- Mother’s sister lived in Warsaw, and Warsaw was still free, and then already we knew that Warsaw will be treated differently than Lódz.</span> <span id="s843">See, the Germans in-incorporated Lódz into the Reich, they changed the mi -- map, and that became part of Germany, and got the name of Litmannstadt.</span> <span id="s844">Warsaw was the free territory, it was just occupied -- a territory.</span> <span id="s845">And we were thinking maybe we should go to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s846">So the plan was for me and my -- a cousin that lived next door, a little older than myself, that we will go to Warsaw, and bring some stuff there in preparation for the families to go there.</span> <span id="s847">Well, so we went, and I didn’t look very Semitic, and neither did she, but we were wearing the stars anyway, but we had some babushka, you know, around ourselves, and went to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s848">Uneventful.</span> <span id="s849">We made it back and forth, forth and back.</span> <span id="s850">So I saw my -- my aunt there, and her son and husband.</span> <span id="s851">And they were at limbo just as we were.</span> <span id="s852">So I deposited some stuff that, you know, we could use when we come, and -- and that was it, I never saw my aunt again, you know, and I don’t know what happened to her, but she didn’t survive and neither did her husband or her son, a little boy at that time.</span> <span id="s853">And we came back, a-a-and that was that.</span> <span id="s854">And pretty soon -- soon we were transported into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Did you think that you and your family should have moved to Warsaw, or you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: I had no opinion, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s857">Ni -- nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: I see, so -- so all you were doing was transporting these things --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: -- in case someone made the decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: That’s right, in case we would go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: -- to have something there.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Le-Let me ask you a small question.</span> <span id="s865">What about your friend, your Catholic friend?</span> <span id="s866">The war comes, and Jews are clearly segregated in some very significant way, what happens with that family and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Very soon after the Germans came, there were many arrests.</span> <span id="s868">He was -- Mr. Wojkowski was arrested one of the first, and killed.</span> <span id="s869">Why?</span> <span id="s870">He was working for years on the railways.</span> <span id="s871">Railroads were the most important thing -- way of transportation in Poland for the Poles, and was to be for the Germans.</span> <span id="s872">Though the German had airplanes by that time, it was different.</span> <span id="s873">But that was very important for the Germans, to destroy the railways.</span> <span id="s874">So they took all that knowledge -- knowledgeable workers, and shot them out.</span> <span id="s875">And Mr. Wojkowski was killed.</span> <span id="s876">And then the family moved out to somewhere, they had relative in the country, so they moved in the count -- you know, to the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Since we mentioning that, it was after the war, in Lódz, when I was back in Lódz and going someplace, that from far away I thought and then I knew that I saw one of the sisters, Wojkowski sisters, not Jadwiga.</span> <span id="s879">A-And -- and you cannot imagine what was going in my mind.</span> <span id="s880">I did not want to approach her, because I thought, what if she asks me the question about my family.</span> <span id="s881">And I have to tell her I survived and they didn’t.</span> <span id="s882">I couldn’t face up to that.</span> <span id="s883">So I let it by.</span> <span id="s884">That was [indecipherable] friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: So you never saw them again, I think?</span> <span id="s886">No?</span> <span id="s887">No.</span> <span id="s888">So you were hard on yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: You were hard on yourself, weren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I felt it was all my fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: What didn’t I do?</span> <span id="s894">How comes I am here, and have nobody to show up that I supposed to save.</span> <span id="s895">Protecting my sister.</span> <span id="s896">So that what -- what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Did you -- did you see brutality bef -- before the ghetto, did you see the Nazis on the street, or the Poles, taking Jews and beating them up, did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: That must have been extremely difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: We saw those pictures.</span> <span id="s903">We heard about those pictures on radio, what’s happening in Germany, so we were not surprised, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: But the brutalization must do something to you, especially as a kid, when you first see it.</span> <span id="s905">You’re not -- you’re not used to people being brutal like that, even if you see photographs, right?</span> <span id="s906">I mean, I don’t know exactly what it does, but it must do something, to -- cause violence has a -- a -- I don’t know, is a -- is a -- a level of violation about it that’s so powerful, it seems to me, especially for a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Tell you the truth, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: We knew that was happening.</span> <span id="s910">We saw mostly from the far.</span> <span id="s911">I was not exposed close by to the brutality like, you know, dragging Jews by the beard, you know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: -- Orthodox Jews, and beating them.</span> <span id="s914">I did not see it from close by, I have to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s916">Let me ask you another question.</span> <span id="s917">Before the ghetto was actually formed, the head -- what they called the -- the elder of the Jews, it was decided upon, and it was Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Had you heard about him before the ghetto, as head of the orphanage?</span> <span id="s920">Had you heard anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: We knew he was the head of the orphanage, and then he became a member of the Jewish Committee --</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: -- and then he became the Alteste of the ghetto, but I didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: -- have any close relationship --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: You didn’t [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: -- of people close by to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s929">Do you remember your parents talking about why is he being made head of a -- head of the Jews?</span> <span id="s930">And this is what you -- no.</span> <span id="s931">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I am sure there was talk like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: But it was talk subdued by the feeling what’s happening, the end of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: We have no power, we -- we -- we are totally dependent now on Hitler and his promise to kill us.</span> <span id="s937">Tha-That was the essence, he is going to kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: So you believed very early?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Certainly m-much earlier than Roosevelt did.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: And earlier than when death camps are actually in existence?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s943">So does -- do you have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Oh, I used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: As a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No, not as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Not as a kid, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: After Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: After the hol -- after the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yes, uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: So it doesn’t happen at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: No, not now.</span> <span id="s953">I -- I think that is the best thing that psychotherapy did for me.</span> <span id="s954">I was able to sleep again.</span> <span id="s955">If nothing else, it did much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: But that was the biggest thing, that I can sleep now.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: You can sleep again.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: And sleep well.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Not plagued by nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: During this beginning period, do -- do you remember feeling scared all the time?</span> <span id="s963">I’m trying to figure out ho -- you know, what it’s -- what it’s like on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s964">Would you feel scared when you see a German soldier, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: N -- that came much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: It came later.</span> <span id="s967">So not in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Not in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: How do you find out you’re supposed to go to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s970">Is there a poster that says Jews have to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Oh yes, it was on poster, that at such and such date, all Jews have to be transported -- transport themselves to the ghetto, to -- a-and says what streets there were -- you know, w-what quarter, that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And it was Baluty, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Baluty, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: And how do you pronounce that, Baluty?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Baluty.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: Baluty.</span> <span id="s977">And that was where you went when you were younger, to this cell, it was in that area, when you went to that Communist discussion.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: That’s right, it was in that area, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: It’s the same -- same section.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s981">The poorest arna -- area in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Area of -- of -- in the town.</span> <span id="s983">And did you know where you were going to go?</span> <span id="s984">H-How was it decided where --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: They formed a department of housing.</span> <span id="s986">Jews were in charge of it, and the Jew -- the housing department had lists of the streets of the houses and how many square feet were available in each apartment or room.</span> <span id="s987">And they were assigning people, people working in that department were assigning customers that came to the -- to that place, square feet, the street number, and the -- the house -- you know, the street number, and the place they will live.</span> <span id="s988">So it was -- and I worked for that department for a few years.</span> <span id="s989">And I was, you know, giving people places to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: So how did you decide?</span> <span id="s991">You’d say four people have x number of square feet, and so this is available, you go here?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Was there corruption in this process?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s995">Not among my level.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s997">But at some level.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s999">At the highest level.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Because the conditions in this area are awful, in terms of just ordinary sanitation.</span> <span id="s1001">In terms of water and toilets and baths and -- there’s practically nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1005">There was a water pump, usually in -- in -- you know, on the plat -- I mean, on the yard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: In the yard, not in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Not where you were living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: No.</span> <span id="s1010">Amazingly enough for all that squalor and density of population, the sanitation was pretty good.</span> <span id="s1011">The -- the reason -- the number one reason was clear, the Germans were very interested not to start an epidemic in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1012">Because they -- in the center of the ghetto, they had their offices, the German had their offices, and they did not want to be exposed to a th -- epidemic.</span> <span id="s1013">So what they did, you know, they had good sanitation department, and the street was smelling -- stinking with chlor any time of day or night.</span> <span id="s1014">They were pouring chlor, you know, o-on the street, on the what do you call.</span> <span id="s1015">So -- and on the toilets, the outside toilets, chlor, etcetera, and keeping thing clean.</span> <span id="s1016">It was amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: But it stank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Oh, chlor is better than --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Chlor is -- yeah -- yeah, better than whatever else it would -- but that’s quite amazing because the circumstances in that area are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: -- just awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: That was amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Now, do you remember the day that you moved from your house -- apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: -- into the ghetto area, that you left your things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: You had to pick what you will take, and that was not much because it was a limited ti -- you know, amount of things that you could take with yourself.</span> <span id="s1029">And then you walked with -- I don’t -- somehow I -- you know, in my mind is that we were schlepping it on what you ca -- call?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: A wagon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Wagons.</span> <span id="s1032">Or was it still snow, that we could use --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: A sleigh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: The sleigh?</span> <span id="s1035">Maybe.</span> <span id="s1036">April, so it was before -- March, it could have well been we schlepped it on sleighs and to -- to the -- where we were assigned to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Do you remember what you took, since you were -- it’s 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: So your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Personal things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s1043">But you see, one thing was that I took my best personal things to Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And left them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: [indecipherable] myself, what did I do, you know, I am here, and -- and so there was not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Not much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Did you take something to write with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Oh, I am sure I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: You must have had something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: Yes, yes, I am sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: -- so that you could do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: -- yes, that I brought my stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: And did your parents take any furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: You couldn’t take furniture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: So you’re going into a situation where whoever’s left has left their things and you’re going to be there with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: And I think we probably took some chairs, some little stools --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: -- some little something.</span> <span id="s1064">Nothing big you could take.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Nothing big.</span> <span id="s1066">Is your grandmother and grandfather also going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: And are you going -- there’s lot of people on the street [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: -- it was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: [indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: And are there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: A procession of the dispossessed, going to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: And are there people watching on the sides?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">A: I don’t remember, but who cared?</span> <span id="s1078">You know, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Germans?</span> <span id="s1080">Do you remember Germans guarding you in some way, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: You’re seeing it, aren’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Yeah.</span></p>

the first war.</span> <span id="s1116">You have to understand, Poland was divided and not free for a few hundred years.</span> <span id="s1117">It was the first war, and after the war that Poland become independent again.</span> <span id="s1118">So they were honoring their troops.</span> <span id="s1119">[indecipherable], that is 28 Battalion of Kanioski shooters rife -- riflemen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: Okay, that probably were famous in the -- one battle or another.</span> <span id="s1122">That was -- the street was named in their

that enough for you?</span> <span id="s1151">One.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: One small room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: For you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Four people.</span> <span id="s1156">My grandmother and grandfather had another room on the same floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: On the same floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: And is there a bathroom on that floor?</span> <span id="s1160">I knew you were going to look at me like that.</span> <span id="s1161">There’s -- there’s nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Water?</span> <span id="s1166">No, no water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: No water.</span> <span id="s1168">Pump downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: But downstairs, so you pump the water to bring it -- so h-how do you get food?</span> <span id="s1170">What -- what do you do for food?</span> <span id="s1171">Is there a sm -- anything to cook on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: No, we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: -- got the ration cards, and so you had a prescribed amount of bread for a week per person.</span> <span id="s1175">Then you had stamps to get -- to go to the grocery once, whatever, and get supplies for those stamps, which were minimal.</span> <span id="s1176">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s1177">Vegetables would come to the ghetto every few weeks.</span> <span id="s1178">In wintertime they were frozen.</span> <span id="s1179">So you ate frozen vegetables, a-and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: So there’s very little hot meals that you’re getting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: Hot meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Hot meals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Well, you cook.</span> <span id="s1184">You know, my mother was cooking, so she was -- you know, the women were -- that were cooking, the housewives were very ingenious in providing some meals, cooking all things possible, like making sardines out of beet leaves.</span> <span id="s1185">You didn’t taste that, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: But you roll this, the beet leave --</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So it looks like a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: So it looks like a sardine, you sauté it a little bit and sprinkle some salt or -- and it’s good.</span> <span id="s1190">When you’re very hungry, everything is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Everything is good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: And we were very hun -- it was unbelievable hunger.</span> <span id="s1193">I remember, you know, Mother was scolding me once because after a year or two I look in the mirror, and I said, “Mother, now I look as I want to look.”</span> <span id="s1194">I was close to being a skeleton, you know?</span> <span id="s1195">I said, “Mother, isn’t that nice?</span> <span id="s1196">I am so thin.”</span> <span id="s1197">And for awhile I really thought so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: You really thought so, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: And she was aggravated with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1202">Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Did she get very thin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1205">Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: People were dying on the street --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: -- from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: When -- when you first move in, I understand that Rumkowski and the council began to take over certain things, sort of -- I don’t know what you want to call it -- nationalizing it for the ghetto and for his -- for his group.</span> <span id="s1211">So there are schools --</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: He established a monarchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: Where he was the ruler, and he has a council to help him.</span> <span id="s1215">He established a school of which he was very proud, rightly so.</span> <span id="s1216">Right?</span> <span id="s1217">That was what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1218">So consequently, I was in that school for a year, and graduated from high school, from that school, right?</span> <span id="s1219">So that was in his favor.</span> <span id="s1220">This school consisted of both the per -- teaching personnel and students, of remnants of people that were in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1221">Remnants because a lot of people from each school were missing.</span> <span id="s1222">Either they were killed off already, or they were able to run off to Russia, for instance.</span> <span id="s1223">You know, a good number of people survived living in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: So there were sort of remnants of different student in different schools, so that was the new school.</span> <span id="s1226">And the same went for teachers.</span> <span id="s1227">And the director of the school was a very acknowledged woman, Mrs. Rhein, R-h-e-i-n, who was a director of one of the high schools, girl’s high schools, private high schools in Lódz city.</span> <span id="s1228">And she, you know, directed that school.</span> <span id="s1229">So consequently, you know, I graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s1230">And it serves me -- served me right later.</span> <span id="s1231">It was acknowledged by the university in Germany, this high school.</span> <span id="s1232">Although he developed different, what we called, resorts.</span> <span id="s1233">Resorts were really a industrial complex, not a resort like, you know, you go to for a rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: So they had th -- see, I have very mixed feelings about Rumkowski, okay?</span> <span id="s1236">For once, I hate him, for once I hate the whole Jewish kingdom that he built, which is no question about it.</span> <span id="s1237">On the other hand, he did something positive.</span> <span id="s1238">What he did was to bargain with the Germans for life, through the -- through the whole period of ghetto’s existence.</span> <span id="s1239">So he told the German and they liked to hear that, that we will supply you with workers, and we will gi -- you first -- give you first class industries that you can use for yourself.</span> <span id="s1240">For the price that you -- that I ca -- can keep this place alive, I can have living people working for you here.</span> <span id="s1241">And that’s how it worked out.</span> <span id="s1242">So at different resort, there was ro -- a resort, the industry of -- oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1243">I -- where I was working in Capol, the first one was we were ma -- a tailor industrial per -- complex, making -- making uniforms and particularly coats for the German army.</span> <span id="s1244">And that consi -- what we were working at is -- it was called the Gummi Fabrik.</span> <span id="s1245">You recall probably the coats that German soldier -- they were stiff like a board, right?</span> <span id="s1246">Broad shoulders, stiff and big things here.</span> <span id="s1247">What we were do -- the tailors were cutting them, you know, cutting out the part.</span> <span id="s1248">We -- we were using a glue -- special glue to glue those parts together, you know, because they were double, sort of double.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: So they weren’t sewn, they were glued.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: They were glued, yes.</span> <span id="s1251">So -- for stiffness, and for wearability and so on, we were doing that.</span> <span id="s1252">After we graduated, and graduated with -- with big pomp and parade.</span> <span id="s1253">Of course, it -- the par -- the pomp was for Rumkowski, that he did it.</span> <span id="s1254">We were given -- we were given work, you know, then we had to work.</span> <span id="s1255">Otherwise we had no way of being in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1256">People that -- that worked could be in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1257">Whoever didn’t work was sent out to another camp, meaning Auschwitz, but we didn't know about that then.</span> <span id="s1258">So we were given work.</span> <span id="s1259">So the first place that he send us girls -- the girls, graduating girls, was to this factory of the Gummi coats, which was such a horrendous place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: It was run by man tailors of the lowest degree.</span> <span id="s1262">And for them to get a group of intellectual girls, God, how they treated us.</span> <span id="s1263">Was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: What’d they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Call us names, pinch us, I don’t know what else he -- they did with some other girls, not with me, but the atmosphere was just full of perversion, laughter at us.</span> <span id="s1266">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1268">When do you -- when do you graduate?</span> <span id="s1269">I’m just trying to get a time frame here.</span> <span id="s1270">You hadn’t started high school when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: 1940 we gr -- I graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: In ’40?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: I think it was in ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: So the same year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: It was the year after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: -- the same year as the ghetto starts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: No, that’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1278">I don’t remember the year.</span> <span id="s1279">Probably couple years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: So high -- is high school -- high school is not like American high school, it’s not four years, it’s less, right?</span> <span id="s1281">Because you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: It’s 12 years, still the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: Right, but the high school actually starts later, am I right?</span> <span id="s1284">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: High school is four years, high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: It is four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: But you go -- you actually graduated in less time in the ghetto, am I right?</span> <span id="s1291">You didn’t go for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: No, but I was in the junior high school, I’ve -- I finished junior high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1294">So it was the last two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: -- and was to start -- yes, was to start high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: -- senior high school in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: When you’re going to get work after you graduate, do you know the person who is head of the labor bureau, Bert Fuchs?</span> <span id="s1299">Bert F-u-c-h.</span> <span id="s1300">There’s a Fuchs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1303">Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: It does not ring the bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Doesn’t ring a bell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: He was the director of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: The labor bureau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: The labor bureau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: At a certain point there are two or three people, but at the beginning, he’s the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1313">No, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: You don’t remember, okay.</span> <span id="s1315">Cause I thought maybe you had crossed paths or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: So how did -- how long do you stay in that first job, a few months, few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Probably months.</span> <span id="s1319">I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: How is it for your parents?</span> <span id="s1321">Is your father a -- are your father and mother working right away, or you -- only your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: My father was working.</span> <span id="s1323">He became -- he got a job of being a -- ad -- administrator of a -- of a part of the ghetto, it’s a couple streets.</span> <span id="s1324">They were assigned different administrator to look after the needs of the -- of the street, the needs of the building, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1325">So he was doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Mother was not working.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: So would he be -- have been considered part of -- not the Jewish Council itself, but part of the administration of the ghetto in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: -- in some way.</span> <span id="s1331">Was -- did this mean you got more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1334">Meant nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Meant nothing.</span> <span id="s1336">Meant nothing, that he was working, otherwise he would be sent out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: And it meant that he got some -- the money was insignificant.</span> <span id="s1339">But got some rations, you know, maybe a little more of rations cards, though I don’t think so, it meant nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: He was just privilege by being able to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1343">Now, from my reading, I understand that in 1940 and ’41, there were a lot of worker demonstrations against Rumkowski and the -- and the Jewish Council, that the rations were insufficient, the work wasn’t sufficient, and that Rumkowski sent the Germans in, and got these people depor --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: You don’t recall that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: So you didn’t see any demon --</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: May -- maybe it was in another part of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: It might have been, but I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Uh-huh, but you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- it didn’t come --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: -- you weren't aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: -- close to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1356">So how did you get out of this first job?</span> <span id="s1357">Did it just stop, or did you ask for another position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: …I am sort of wrestling with myself.</span> <span id="s1359">I would like to share something with you, not about myself, and not myself, but I would not like it to get in the record.</span> <span id="s1360">Is that possible, or I shut up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Well, we -- you can tell me at another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Good.</span> <span id="s1363">But anyway, he was organizing the police, okay, Jewish police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: You heard about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: And he also decided to have a troop of women police -- policewomen, okay?</span> <span id="s1368">And he took the -- hi-his beloved high school graduates and sent them to the female police force, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: He really liked this group of girls, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: He liked this group of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: It was his pride --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Oh, his pride, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: -- he did something for the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: You know.</span> <span id="s1377">And he was a social worker at heart, y -- it’s -- it’s a very mixed bag in that man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: So he -- a-and that what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1380">Few of the girls from the -- from the -- this -- you know, tailor resort, went into the police.</span> <span id="s1381">And we as police women were given the task to be on the street, and keep the street -- keep the street traffic in order.</span> <span id="s1382">So we got uniforms, you know, and a office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: What kind of uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Green jackets with buttons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: And green pants, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Hat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: Hat.</span> <span id="s1389">And then we were in the office.</span> <span id="s1390">I and another girl were made to be officers, you know, in charge of the troops, and above us was a elderly Czech Jew, who came from Prague.</span> <span id="s1391">You know one thing is that to the ghetto, Lódz ghetto, there were sent Jews from all over Europe to be there and dispose with them, you know, everyplace else.</span> <span id="s1392">So there was -- was a wonderful group of Czech Jews that came to the ghetto, okay?</span> <span id="s1393">Mostly young students graduate, and it was such a refreshing -- I worked then at the housing department, so I met with them, you know, a lot, because they came for housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: And they were so refreshing.</span> <span id="s1396">I mean, innocent.</span> <span id="s1397">They didn’t know they are Jews, or nude.</span> <span id="s1398">You know, it was very -- a mixed culture, Jews and Gentiles.</span> <span id="s1399">So one of the Prague guys was this elderly, handsome guy, you know, old -- pretty old, and he was in charge of [indecipherable] the women -- just -- it was comedy -- with another woman, a Czech woman, I think she was his assistant.</span> <span id="s1400">So we’re sitting in the office and telling stories from Czech -- P-Prague, etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1401">So that la-lasted for awhile, and that was disband, too.</span> <span id="s1402">Okay, it was not such a innocent group in such a innocent job.</span> <span id="s1403">Now, that I am talking freely because it’s about myself, not about a friend.</span> <span id="s1404">So i-it -- other than keeping the traffic going -- not traffic, you know what traffic, there were no car --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: It’s walking traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: -- walking traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: A-And there was other traffic.</span> <span id="s1409">There was a lot of sewage people working, you know, sanitation, because the toilets had to be -- the outside toilets had to be cleaned regularly because of fear of epidemic, so that traffic was going.</span> <span id="s1410">What else?</span> <span id="s1411">And the -- the traffic to the cemetery, that was a lot, you know, a lot of people were dying.</span> <span id="s1412">You know, picked up from the street or otherwise.</span> <span id="s1413">Other than that, we were given a order there should not be any trade on the street.</span> <span id="s1414">Now what kind of trade do you think there was?</span> <span id="s1415">What there was is that people were making candies out of the sugar rations.</span> <span id="s1416">People were making candies with a taste, and wrapped them, and then they were selling it on the street.</span> <span id="s1417">And their order was that that trade should not exist.</span> <span id="s1418">So we were supposed to watch for that, and if we -- when we catch a guy that is selling this candy, we were supposed to bring them to the real police, the men police.</span> <span id="s1419">So that’s what we were doing, we were supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1420">Now, if the real police catch a guy like that, you know where he was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: They’d get deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: So it was one -- one day, I and a friend of mine from the school, my previous school, she was per -- patrolling the street and she said -- I was a officer, you see, I was not patrolling.</span> <span id="s1425">So she says, “Paula, you have to come with me.</span> <span id="s1426">I want you to come with me and I want to show you what we are doing, our job.”</span> <span id="s1427">So, fine, you know, so we walked the street, and then we come to a guy that was selling candies, and she says, “Well that what I have to do, and I will do you what -- I am arresting him and bringing the -- to the police.”</span> <span id="s1428">Which she did, and we went to the police, and she depart.</span> <span id="s1429">And she says, “Do you know what will happen to the man?”</span> <span id="s1430">And she says, “Do you know what we are doing here?”</span> <span id="s1431">We spent all night walking and talking.</span> <span id="s1432">And could not get a peace of mind.</span> <span id="s1433">So I say, that’s it, no more, I am leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: And did she do the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: The lucky thing was that the pol -- women police was disbanded in a week from that occurrence, so we didn’t have to do anything.</span> <span id="s1436">We were told, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Was that because the two of you said you didn’t want to do it, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: No, no, independently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Independently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Rumkowski did away with it, for whatever reason I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: And for how long was this going on, a few months, a few week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Not -- but not for very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Not for very long, few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: And were you -- the office that you were in, were the -- was the male police -- Jewish police there also, or were you totally separate from the Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: You were separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: We were separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: And was that your first confrontation with what that job was doing?</span> <span id="s1450">When you went out with this woman --</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1452">That was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: -- you really didn’t -- you didn’t think about it, or know what he said to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: That’s right, that’s right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Not so easy, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: Oh, horrible.</span> <span id="s1459">But that what it was.</span> <span id="s1460">The police was helping Rumkowski keeping order --</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: -- and keeping the deal with the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: And did you have opinions then about the male Jewish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: You want to tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: The male Jewish police wasn -- no question about that they were fully cooperated with Rumkowski and therefore with the Germans, and we had no good opinion about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1468">Were you afraid of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: And they were very helpful at the time of getting Jews into the transport going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1472">I tell you, it was horrible, the thought that Jewish police is helping Germans.</span> <span id="s1473">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1474">I changed my mind a bit watching Lanzmann’s movie.</span> <span id="s1475">You know, when he interviews the Sonderkommando in Auschwitz, and you saw people that were really on the other side, in Auschwitz, helping Germans to kill Jews, frankly to kill Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: And I got away with a different feeling.</span> <span id="s1478">How can you blame people that were forced to do the job, knowing they are going to be killed in four months, how can you blame them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: It was very powerful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: On the other hand -- let me give you the other hand here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: You couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1484">You couldn't do something that was in a way simpler, but was part of a process.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: No, I couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: And it was something that you couldn’t do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: And I’m sure other people couldn’t either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1491">So some could, and maybe they could live with themselves and maybe they couldn’t, but they did it anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1493">That -- you’re right.</span> <span id="s1494">And in Auschwitz, you know, the Sonderkommando that did work, you know, the gas chambers and the crematoria, some were just picked and forced to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: They had no way out other than go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: And be killed.</span> <span id="s1498">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: -- right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1501">You ever think what would have happened if everybody said no?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: There would be a revolution, and maybe successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: It’s hard to do that though, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: That’s why the big problem was, you know, is -- Hannah -- what was her name, Hannah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Hannah Arendt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: Arendt, accusing Jews in Poland that they went like sheep to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: Actually, she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">A: Who did?</span> <span id="s1511">Where did that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1513">Sometimes the resistance said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Sometimes the resistance, the partisans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: -- said don’t go like sheep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Oh, I see, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: She never s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: But she didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: She didn’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: I see, okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: But it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: No, but it’s a -- it’s an accusation that people think she said things like that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: -- she didn’t.</span> <span id="s1528">She -- she was not happy with the councils, but she never blamed the rest of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1529">She thought that the councils shouldn’t have cooperated.</span> <span id="s1530">That, yes, but she never said that other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: And this gave me also another thought, you know, when I was in August in Lódz --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Oop, w-we have to stop?</span> <span id="s1533">Okay, we’ll stop.</span> <span id="s1534">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Finish later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Yes, we’ll finish it later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1540">We forgot something.</span> <span id="s1541">When you were talking about being in high school, weren’t you at some point in something called a farm settlement that we didn’t talk about?</span> <span id="s1542">What was that?</span> <span id="s1543">Was that while you were in high school?</span> <span id="s1544">Was that part of the high school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: That was part of Rumkowski’s plan.</span> <span id="s1546">As you know, he was a social worker and director of an orphanage before the war.</span> <span id="s1547">He also was a great Zionist.</span> <span id="s1548">And at the -- at the time when the school opened, he gave us a proposition that whoever would volunteer can go to this place that was part of the ghetto, but it was sort of more rural, and it was a old house that used to be a orphanage.</span> <span id="s1549">Not his orphanage, but the Polish population.</span> <span id="s1550">And that we would, boys and girls go there and learn farming in preparation for the -- to go into Palestine and become kibbutznik farmers.</span> <span id="s1551">So, you know, we needed to have the permission of our parents, and then a group of us went there.</span> <span id="s1552">And we spent a full year there.</span> <span id="s1553">And it was a wonderful time, a time that permit us who were willing to be there, to forget where we were.</span> <span id="s1554">It was out of this world, really.</span> <span id="s1555">It was a huge house, a orphanage, you know, so there was big halls.</span> <span id="s1556">And our group was probably not more than 20 boys and girls.</span> <span id="s1557">Boys separate, girls separate bedrooms, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1558">And in the morning we would go to school.</span> <span id="s1559">We would go by -- by carriages, you know, we had some people that were bringing u -- by horse and buggy, big buggy, to school, and then afternoon we would come to the farm.</span> <span id="s1560">We call it Hak’shara, which is Hebrew for farm.</span> <span id="s1561">And it has the Zionist implication, but we couldn’t give a damn about -- at that time about the implication of Palestine, it was just a lovely place.</span> <span id="s1562">It was a farm that used to be used -- you know, it was used by Poles as a farm, and also had animals.</span> <span id="s1563">It had goats, and chickens, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1564">And there was one guy, he was a German Jew who was a farmer, and knew about, you know, farming, and other than going to school, homework, etcetera, he would teach us what to do.</span> <span id="s1565">In other word, we would sow seeds, and all kinds of thing, and take care of the growing crop.</span> <span id="s1566">There was a orchard, and there were the animals.</span> <span id="s1567">The animals we would -- let’s see, there were some cows, and there were some goats, and we would learn how to milk them.</span> <span id="s1568">And then distru -- distribute the milk by buggies, and -- horse and buggies to cooperative, to stores, you know, run by the -- by Rumkowski that will be selling it to the population on carts and so on.</span> <span id="s1569">So it was a ideal love -- life, really.</span> <span id="s1570">Very gratifying.</span> <span id="s1571">Of course, we paired up, boys and girls, and so were some romances going and that was, under the circumstances, unheard of.</span> <span id="s1572">We -- of course, were properly chaperoned by mothers that would take turn and come for overnight to be with -- with the -- you know, with us, to make sure nothing was happening.</span> <span id="s1573">So that was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">Q: Did they really stop things from happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">A: I think, in a way, yes.</span> <span id="s1576">So that was the time, and it was a lot of camaraderie, and there’s sa -- were some evening that we had music, some of the people play [indecipherable] particularly played the piano, and there was a piano.</span> <span id="s1577">So we had music, and we were dancing.</span> <span id="s1578">You know, so we were cooking [indecipherable] for the crew, you know.</span> <span id="s1579">So we would take turns for 24 hours to prepare meals, a boy and a girl, cou -- you know, prepare breakfast, lunch, dinner, and etcetera.</span> <span id="s1580">So it was a unbelievable year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: So you were staying there as opposed to being with your parents and your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: That’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1584">Did you have a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Was this a boyfriend from before, or somebody that you met in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Somebody who I met in this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: In group?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: And how many boys and girls were there, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Altogether close to 20.</span> <span id="s1592">18 - 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Did you mother ever -- was she ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: -- chaperone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: Yes, yes, she agreed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: They never took the fathers for a chaperone, only the mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yes, cause [indecipherable] why, why, why -- I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: And was this er -- wi -- like in ’42 -- 1942, do you think?</span> <span id="s1600">Do you have any recollection what year?</span> <span id="s1601">I mean, I know it’s hard to figure out what years these things are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: ’42 - ’43.</span> <span id="s1603">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: I was just trying to figure it out in relationship to the work that you were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: It was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: It was before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: -- right, because you were still in high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: That’s right [indecipherable] said before high school.</span> <span id="s1610">And then, when we graduate from high school, what happened?</span> <span id="s1611">O-Of course, the farm disbanded, why did it disband?</span> <span id="s1612">Times got tougher politically.</span> <span id="s1613">I think Rumkowski did not have any more ji -- way of thinking and doing to supervise or insist, or we simply -- that what happened, it was disband and we were given jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: We were needed to work.</span> <span id="s1616">We had to stop and we are needed to -- to work for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: You know we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: -- we -- we were needed to pay off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: So this is that same class, that last graduating class in the high school that you talked about before, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Right, yes.</span> <span id="s1623">There was another class after us, so two classes graduated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: But they didn’t have this opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: They’re -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: The farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: They didn’t come to the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: I don’t remember why, or the times already toughened and, you know, there was no -- no time for frivolities, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">A: So we were the only group that did it, that had this privilege, really.</span> <span id="s1632">Oh f --</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: And did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: -- yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1636">Did you then go back to live with your parents and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: Actually, I never went back to live with my parent again.</span> <span id="s1638">I was emancipated.</span> <span id="s1639">Oh, there was another job immediately after, that was -- so many jobs in such a short time, so it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: -- sort of get mixed up.</span> <span id="s1642">Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: It’s okay if it gets mixed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1645">One job was making, you know, in -- in a production of houses, what you call houses that you build part -- parts for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Prefabricated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: Prefabr -- prefabricated homes for export to Germany, okay?</span> <span id="s1648">So some of us went to work on that, and we got housing there, also outside, you know, the main part of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1649">And we -- we were living there totally, and working.</span> <span id="s1650">So that was -- lasted for awhile, and that was finished.</span> <span id="s1651">Now, we were doing the -- the prevat -- prefabricated parts with cement, mixing cement, pouring it into forms, taking out -- you know, we learned the whole production of how do you do -- how you do it.</span> <span id="s1652">And that ended.</span> <span id="s1653">But another job that I had was working in a kitchen, and that was the best job.</span> <span id="s1654">An-And really ended badly.</span> <span id="s1655">There was a occasion to go to work for a kitchen that was established -- kitchen restaurant, so to speak, establish by Rumkowski that was producing dinners one -- once a day dinners for people that work in different kind of industries and were given a bonus to come to this -- to this kitchen for a dinner, for a week or two weeks or so.</span> <span id="s1656">It was a extra sort of a pay-off for good work and so on.</span> <span id="s1657">And working in that kitchen, of course it was wonderful, because you could eat, okay?</span> <span id="s1658">You didn’t have to be hungry, right?</span> <span id="s1659">So -- and it was nice, there was a nice by -- bunch of girls, familiar also from the school, and it was nice to work there.</span> <span id="s1660">We made hamburgers, we do this, we chopped up all kind that was needed in the kitchen, under the supervise -- supervision of women cooks.</span> <span id="s1661">And then what happened was that there was a Sonderkommando older guy, you know, that I and he knew each other, I don’t remember from where, but there were no hard feelings bet -- between us, there was some hostility.</span> <span id="s1662">I don’t know what -- what was the cause, but at any rate, he was on duty one day, and I went -- supposedly I was asking the cook that was serving the soup -- I was serving -- you know, the guy that -- the Czech that was supervising the women police, and he was there e -- as a client, and I suppose that he asked the server to give me a little more in the plate of soup, because I wanted to, you know.</span> <span id="s1663">And this Kohn, Kohn was his name, caught me doing that, and therefore did saw that I was kicked out from the kitchen, from my good job.</span> <span id="s1664">Himself was a -- a s-son of a gun, you know, terrible guy to get to be accused of anything.</span> <span id="s1665">And -- an-and -- and that was it, so that job ended, and I was sent, as a punishment, I was sent to a -- to a resort, a -- a factory that was making stuff out of wood.</span> <span id="s1666">That means they were making wooden chairs, wooden wagons, you know, wheels, wooden wheels.</span> <span id="s1667">It was a huge factory, under one roof, you know, just huge, full of machineries that produced a lot of dust when you worked them.</span> <span id="s1668">So that was my punishment.</span> <span id="s1669">I was sent to Siberia, and I was there for about a year or so.</span> <span id="s1670">It was a tough year, really.</span> <span id="s1671">Hard work, a lot of dust, and I was punished, you know, that was punishment.</span> <span id="s1672">So what can I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: And you were agai -- still living away from your parents.</span> <span id="s1674">You -- you had found your own place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: No.</span> <span id="s1676">At this time I think I went back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: -- home, cause there was no place to -- to be.</span> <span id="s1679">So -- but I found a very nice friend there, working around the young people and we chummed together.</span> <span id="s1680">And so from the social point of view, it was nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: Except that it was a dirty job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1684">Now, is this after you were in the women’s police force?</span> <span id="s1685">Do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: I think it was before, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: You think it was before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1691">So -- a-and you know, my encounter with this Sonderpoliceman was as we were the last day in the ghetto, as we were transported to Auschwitz, you know, before -- before being [indecipherable] to the -- you know, to the wagons, y-you know, that take us.</span> <span id="s1692">And there was I and this policeman, and I looked at him and I didn’t say a word, just thinking, you scoundrel.</span> <span id="s1693">Here you are and here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1695">Here you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Common ending --</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: -- of the story.</span> <span id="s1699">So that was part of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: What’s happening to you as a young woman?</span> <span id="s1701">You’re 20 -- in 1942, two years after the -- the ghetto was formed, you’re 20 -- 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yes, 19 - 20, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: 19 - 20 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: What kind of a person are you becoming?</span> <span id="s1706">Are you -- you clearly -- as you tell the story, you clearly have moments when things are not so terrible.</span> <span id="s1707">You’re meeting friends, you have friends, there’s something -- thing -- there are things that make you happy.</span> <span id="s1708">But clearly, there’s an underlying something that must be very wearing on you.</span> <span id="s1709">Are you depressed, are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: I think the motto for that being then is we shall overcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: You really felt that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1715">And in the family too, you know.</span> <span id="s1716">We didn’t know the song we shall -- you know, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: -- that black people brought and led the -- the Civil Rights Movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: But that was what kept us going.</span> <span id="s1721">We shall overcome.</span> <span id="s1722">And the motto was life, keep on living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: So you didn’t give up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: In spite of everything that you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1727">And neither would my mother or father, or within the close-knit family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: They didn’t give up either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: No.</span> <span id="s1730">We shall overcome.</span> <span id="s1731">And, you know, listening to the ri -- radio --</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: -- and of course we had to give up when the German came, first among their rules was all radios you bring to this place in Lódz, and sewing machines and all machinery, guns of course, you know, etcet -- etcetera.</span> <span id="s1734">So if you were caught listening to -- to the radio, you could be deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: But I want -- I wanted to say you can get killed, but deported was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: The same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: -- equals death.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: The same thing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: So -- so no radio, no listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s1741">So we didn’t know, but somehow some rumors were crossing, some people were listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s1742">You know, they dared and they were listening to it.</span> <span id="s1743">And I think my father had some connection with somebody that got the news.</span> <span id="s1744">So we knew broadly what was happening, and we knew where the Germans were, you know, the trip to Siberia, and Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s1745">And also what we knew that at that time he had all Europe under his hand, right?</span> <span id="s1746">And -- and fighting England and bombing London, and so on.</span> <span id="s1747">So we knew what was th -- and some of the news were brought by people that were deported from Paris and Vienna, and yi -- all your Holland, Dutch people, Czech -- Czech people, they were bringing news because they still knew what was going on, closer than we did.</span> <span id="s1748">So we knew that he has by now all Europe under -- under his foot, and that there’s little hope really, of very -- very m -- very changes that could happen in immediate future.</span> <span id="s1749">So you just had to take a -- a long view to the future, we shall overcome, in spite of everything that is happening.</span> <span id="s1750">So you have to be strong.</span> <span id="s1751">And one thing that became very important in every day life was how you live with almost nothing.</span> <span id="s1752">That the ration that you got from the bakery, that piece of bread that you got per person, and you are in charge of it, it has to last you all week.</span> <span id="s1753">Don’t eat it in one setting.</span> <span id="s1754">Because people that did, died.</span> <span id="s1755">People that didn’t lost weight, and died too, some that could not go on and got some infection and so on.</span> <span id="s1756">So how do you do that?</span> <span id="s1757">Families that could do that, and my mother was the leader of it, we did it under her supervision.</span> <span id="s1758">We stemmed the hunger and take very -- took very little, could survive and hope for later.</span> <span id="s1759">Many people could not, and died just because they could not do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Did you smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Did a lot of people smoke then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: I take it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: You take it back, you did smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: My first experiment with smoking was when I was in the police fers -- force, and this guy, the Czech guy and his assistant were smoking, and I say, hey, let me try it.</span> <span id="s1766">So I tried, and I got sick.</span> <span id="s1767">Dizzy, and so on, and I gave it up.</span> <span id="s1768">But I smoked later, for a few years, you know, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: The reason I ask is because many people smoked because it’s -- I don’t know if it stops hunger, but you don’t seem to be -- necessarily eat as much if you’re smoking.</span> <span id="s1772">So I thought possibly that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: I didn’t get to that stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: You didn’t get to that stage.</span> <span id="s1775">So you -- you and your family were very disciplined about the rationing of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Your sister is much younger, was it more difficult for her because she was so much younger?</span> <span id="s1778">Or was she old enough to understand by --</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">A: I -- she was old enough --</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: -- she must have been, she was a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: -- and she was a smart little gi-girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1785">Let me ask you something about Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s1786">I interviewed someone, Lucille Eichengreen, who both -- she wrote about and -- a-about her own experiences, and experiences of other people with Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: That he was abusing young women, sometimes boys.</span> <span id="s1789">It happened in the orphanage, according to her, and it -- then it happened in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: You mean before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: Before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1793">Pedophile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: And in the ghetto, as well.</span> <span id="s1795">And I wondered if you heard anything or knew anything about Rumkowski and what he did.</span> <span id="s1796">Because we don’t -- we can’t -- she’s the only person who has been willing to talk about it, and she only talked about it once everybody she knew was dead, so she wouldn’t hurt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1798">I see.</span> <span id="s1799">I knew that -- but not directly -- and I never had any interview with him, though people would go asking for special things, and would have a need to talk with him.</span> <span id="s1800">I never had the need, I never met him personally.</span> <span id="s1801">But I heard that he wa -- you know, that if you want a audience with him, you have to be prepared that he will sexually assault you.</span> <span id="s1802">So I heard -- that was floating rumors all over, and to be believed.</span> <span id="s1803">Now, I know about his life something else.</span> <span id="s1804">He got married in -- in the ghetto, you know, and his wife lived in the house -- same house that we lived.</span> <span id="s1805">And he was -- she was a lawyer, so-called a old maid, you know?</span> <span id="s1806">I don’t know if she was 30 or 31 or 29, but she was all -- already old.</span> <span id="s1807">You know, according.</span> <span id="s1808">And he married her, so I saw him come, you know, to the house, walking into the house and that -- few times, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1809">Then when they were married, I suppose she lived with him not -- not in that house where I lived.</span> <span id="s1810">So why he got married, I don’t know, but who’s to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: So, I think -- a-as you know, he was the last transport, both of them went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: And did not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1816">Of course, there are different rumors about that, he was killed by people who had been in Lódz, or he was gassed, who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Nobod -- nobody is sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: No, I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: -- anything beyond that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">Q: Do you remember the speech he gave in September of 1942, give me your children, were you there?</span> <span id="s1823">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: The worst day in the world.</span> <span id="s1825">He gathered a lot of people, cause it was known that he will give the speech, so people came.</span> <span id="s1826">And we knew that it cannot be any good news, so you know, that was in the air.</span> <span id="s1827">And he gave a speech.</span> <span id="s1828">He was a good speaker, you know, telling how much he cares, telling how much work he puts in -- into survival, and do the best for the population, and we should believe him and trust him.</span> <span id="s1829">And in that vein, he wants to tell us that it is up to us to prevent any big loss of population, the Germans gave him a number of children between the ages -- I don’t remember, young children, but not too young, you know, the -- they -- the Germans will bring those children to a special care -- camp, that they will get a very good care, better than in the ghetto, that he can assure us will happen, and that will allow the ghetto to survive til war is ended.</span> <span id="s1830">So please, mothers, go home, prepare the children.</span> <span id="s1831">Give them, you know, prepare something, clothing, some dishes to eat from.</span> <span id="s1832">And it was not the dep -- you know, the collection, such and such day.</span> <span id="s1833">That was it.</span> <span id="s1834">And there was, of course, a lot of crying and screaming, and the people dispersed.</span> <span id="s1835">It was paralyzing, you know, paralyzing fear and anger.</span> <span id="s1836">But what bothers -- bothered me worst, as we ma -- were making our way home, I don’t know if wha -- my mother came or not, I know I was, and I was by myself, so I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1837">What bothered me most is I was walking back home and some neighbors wi -- with me were walking too, how quickly those women adjusted to that idea.</span> <span id="s1838">I -- I couldn't understand that.</span> <span id="s1839">Mainly -- mainly accepting his premise, believing him, and saying we need to do what he say, and maybe that way we’ll save our children.</span> <span id="s1840">So they were eager to go home and prepare their children for that.</span> <span id="s1841">I almost died then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">Q: Because you didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">A: Not a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Did you say anything to these women that you heard, or you just kept quiet and walked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">A: No, but I went home, we talked and non -- nobody home believed that either.</span> <span id="s1846">Many people did not believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: But I was surprised how many people did believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1850">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: So immediately.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">Q: Maybe they always believed him.</span> <span id="s1853">We need to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: Paula, do you think what -- what do you think Rumkowski thought he was telling people?</span> <span id="s1857">Did he believe that these kids would be okay?</span> <span id="s1858">Did he not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: I don’t think he was so dumb.</span> <span id="s1860">I he -- I think really that he was calculating.</span> <span id="s1861">In his work with [indecipherable] the other German, he was simply calculating how to save most of Jews, how to help as many as possible Jews to survive.</span> <span id="s1862">And that’s how he was making the deals.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: So as long as he could save some, it wouldn’t matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1865">Against liquidating the whole ghetto.</span> <span id="s1866">That could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: You know, the Germans just could come and erase the ghetto, you know, any time, either by bomb or sending out people.</span> <span id="s1869">They had the power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: It -- so he was calculating how to make the best deal against that possibility.</span> <span id="s1872">I think he was sincere about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: About doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1876">Have you heard that speech again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Have you ever read his speech again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1880">Is there -- is there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Yeah, I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: On what, on paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: Now I have it on paper, but I believe it’s on tape.</span> <span id="s1884">Some -- somehow you can hear his words.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1886">Mm, I would be interested in hearing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">Q: Let me -- let me just read you the last part of it for a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">A: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">Q: “A broken Jew stands before you,” he said.</span> <span id="s1890">“Do not envy me.</span> <span id="s1891">This is the most difficult of all the orders I’ve ever had to carry out at any time.</span> <span id="s1892">I reach out to you with my broken, trembling hands and I beg, give in to my hands the victims, so that we can avoid having further victims.</span> <span id="s1893">And a population of a hundred thousand Jews can be preserved.</span> <span id="s1894">So they promise me.</span> <span id="s1895">If we deliver our victims by ourselves, there will be peace.”</span> <span id="s1896">It’s quite a speech.</span> <span id="s1897">But he clearly was trying to also talk about how difficult this was for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1899">I believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1901">And you do believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: I -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: He was a politician, and traded in human life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">A: And from the point of view as I told you when -- last August I saw this fairly large number of survivors of the ge -- lo -- ghetto Lódz, I said, that is because of Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s1907">Not that I love him, or admire him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: No, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: But that’s a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: So the deal with the devil --</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: -- worked in some respects.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: That’s what I think.</span> <span id="s1914">And the death of the president in Warsaw ghetto didn’t produce anything but a loss of one human life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Czerniakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Czerniakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1919">That doesn’t say that I would not, given m-myself and that choice, I probably would kill myself rather than stand like Rumkowski, saying that.</span> <span id="s1920">But in judging, what is more pr -- I want to say productive -- of what is more -- I don’t -- I don’t find a word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: I -- I -- I cannot hate Rumkowski for it.</span> <span id="s1923">You know I have some respect for him for that.</span> <span id="s1924">And for his pain, as he was saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1926">D-Do you have any recollection of when you -- I know that you thought that the Germans were going to kill Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: But the -- but they don’t start murdering until 1941.</span> <span id="s1929">There’s some murders, but there’s no -- the Einsatzgruppen come with the attack on Russia in 1941, and the -- the killing centers start in ’41 and ’42, and the major killings are f -- 1942.</span> <span id="s1930">When is it that you realize that what you think is going to happen is really happening?</span> <span id="s1931">Do you know?</span> <span id="s1932">Is it in the middle of the ghetto, is it when -- y-you have a friend who comes with her daughter to the Lódz ghetto -- I mean, she becomes a friend of yours.</span> <span id="s1933">Now, this may be towards the end, I don’t know if this is 1942 or it’s later, 1944, and she won’t give up her daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Oh -- oh, you -- oh, the story that I told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Is -- is she the one who convinced you that what you thought was happening was really happening, or did you think that before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: I re -- since 1939 and before, listening to Hitler did not think that he is talking kwotch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: And that the “Mein Kampf” book is just a book of a sick mind.</span> <span id="s1941">We took him very seriously, and I know we were listening to the radio for hours.</span> <span id="s1942">The -- his speeches were transmitted live as it was happening in Berlin or wherever, so we had a chance to listen to the radio, and sort of judging the speeches, and my father, my mother, myself, we knew he is speaking the truth, and that we have nothing to hope for if he is a-allowed to bring his plan forth.</span> <span id="s1943">That is France, England -- we didn't talk about America, that was sort of, you know, outside of Europe.</span> <span id="s1944">Unless they come and stop him, he will bring it to fruition, kill us.</span> <span id="s1945">How, what, when, that was unknown, but we -- this projection we had way back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: So I guess when -- maybe you can repeat the story that you told about this friend, during the de -- it -- it -- that you told in the shi -- in the -- in the film, “Shoah.”</span> <span id="s1947">Not in the film, in the -- in the interview that you did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: -- it wasn’t in the film, because it appeared as if it had a-an enormous impact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: It was not in the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: What?</span> <span id="s1952">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: He didn’t put it in the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: Okay, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: No, your portion --</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: -- in the film was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: I know.</span> <span id="s1962">That -- that’s right, I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: -- it -- it was -- it was much smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: But this is a story about this woman who comes in, she must be in her 20’s, maybe not so much older than you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: That’s right, that’s right --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: -- with the daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: -- yes, in 20’s.</span> <span id="s1969">And I know that I work then -- then I worked in the housing department, and she came from the line, you know, she is from a little town, she named the town, you know, close to Lódz.</span> <span id="s1970">And she says is -- she is with the daughter so she needs housing for herself and the daughter.</span> <span id="s1971">Her husband was the Alteste of the -- of the -- the small Jewish community.</span> <span id="s1972">He was taken away and killed with others, and she is here.</span> <span id="s1973">And in my heart was going out to her, she was -- so I -- there was a room in my -- in the house that I was living, so I told her to go there and see, and if it is okay, she can move in.</span> <span id="s1974">And then I started to contact with her and we -- we became good friends and talked, you know, a lot.</span> <span id="s1975">And she was telling me about the life there, and th -- and you know that in the end, i-it w-was just killed off then -- you know, and she is sent here, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1976">So, it was nice to have -- she was a very warm, smart woman, and a cute kid, nine years old, a little girl.</span> <span id="s1977">And then it came, you know, the speech of Rumkowski, and she said never.</span> <span id="s1978">You know, I will never give up my child.</span> <span id="s1979">So we still had few days to talk about it, so we talked at length, and I said, “My God, what are you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1980">So she said, “Never will I give up voluntarily my daughter.”</span> <span id="s1981">And I agreed with her, you know, I -- I was not quarreling.</span> <span id="s1982">And then the day came of our street being run, you know, with SS troops, and coming, and they ask all population of a given building to go in the backyard and line up.</span> <span id="s1983">And two, three SS guys with, you know, bayonets came into the yard.</span> <span id="s1984">I was standing close to my fre -- I forget her name -- close to my friend.</span> <span id="s1985">And they said -- announced, all children of this and this age, please come.</span> <span id="s1986">And she was holding the girl’s hand tightly.</span> <span id="s1987">And, you know, she was not budging.</span> <span id="s1988">Other kids came forth.</span> <span id="s1989">And then the SS guy comes to her and says, bring -- takes the girl’s hand and wants to pull her away, and she said no.</span> <span id="s1990">And he said in German, “If you don’t let go, I will shoot you.”</span> <span id="s1991">And she says, “Okay, shoot me.”</span> <span id="s1992">So he takes her by the neck, turns her around, and puts the revolver to her neck and shoots.</span> <span id="s1993">And she falls to my feet, on my feet.</span> <span id="s1994">And I hardly could stand.</span> <span id="s1995">And he took the girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Anyway.</span> <span id="s1997">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: You see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: Rumkowski’s philosophy a-and the reality, and how can you say anything, just don’t ask me any questions about it, cause there are no answers.</span> <span id="s2001">For three days I could not talk and could not eat, and my mother started to worry about me.</span> <span id="s2002">And then there was no choice but to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: I’m not sure exactly what I ha -- I have thoughts in my -- my head, I’m not quite sure what to ask you about this because I -- on the one hand I thought to myself, she -- she had to know they would take her daughter no match you -- no matter what she did, and worse comes to worse they would shoot her and then the daughter would die, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: And so I’m just wondering, what was -- what -- what must have been going through -- and you don’t know what was going through her head, because she had to know if they were going to shoot her, they were going to take the daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: And I guess one would just say it was an impossible situation whichever way she did it, she was going to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: But she was not going to agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Agree to it, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: Give her life first before agreeing.</span> <span id="s2011">I can understand that.</span> <span id="s2012">Over my dead body, it says.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2014">Ri-Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: Literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2017">And the daughter was -- you think was gassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: Unless by some fluke she could escape or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2022">Was this the first time you saw a dead person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Oh no, you could see many dead people on the streets of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: But this was somebody you knew, and pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yeah -- ye -- my grandmother died in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2026">My -- my uncle died in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: So I went to the funerals of my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: And so they’re buried in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: And after three days you said, I have to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: Yes, somehow I revived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: So this was 1942, this was in the middle --</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: -- of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2036">But deportation meant death to you, that was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: It was not clear, but it was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: It wasn’t known, but it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: -- the intent was clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">A: How did we -- there were people that came to the ghetto, some people that lived in the ghetto in Lódz, and were deported, and somehow run away and came, you know, sort of on the black -- black side --</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: -- to the ghetto, and they brought news.</span> <span id="s2044">One first news was about Chelmno.</span> <span id="s2045">You -- y-you -- you know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Yes, I was going to ask you, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: That was -- that was a small time -- town, not far from the city, and that is where the first experiment with gas were done in buses.</span> <span id="s2048">So those guys that escaped, escaped that, but they were witness to what’s going on, and escape.</span> <span id="s2049">So we knew about the gassing, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2050">Then there were other news, also from peop -- you know, we got a lot of mail from people that were deported, that they are in camp like that, and everything is fi -- you know, that was all hoax.</span> <span id="s2051">But some people came, and they brought news from Auschwitz, and that we could not believe, that there were factories to gas people and burn their bodies, crematoria.</span> <span id="s2052">We could not believe, but they were circulate -- those news were circulating.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: But Chelmno you believed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: People believed what was going on in -- in Chelmno --</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: -- but not Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s2059">I -- are -- or -- impossible.</span> <span id="s2060">And it -- but those were people they were talking about, so it was sort of, we don’t want to believe that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: -- hey, you have to pay attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: So there were news like that of what’s happening in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Was there a lot of corruption in Lódz, you think?</span> <span id="s2066">That’s a -- that’s a lot, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: It’s inevitable though, isn’t it, under those circumstances, since there’s no -- was there a black market?</span> <span id="s2069">Even though it was so isolated, there was a black market?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">Q: So when I say was there corruption and you look the way you did, what is it -- what -- what is it that’s going through your head?</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">A: Through my s -- head is I ca -- I -- I cannot tell her anything concrete that I know, any facts [indecipherable] he told me so, but I know there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: Part of the cor -- not corruption but sort of tangentially, wer -- my experience was following.</span> <span id="s2075">My father was working, I was working, my sister was in school for a couple of years and then she got some job to work.</span> <span id="s2076">My mother was not working.</span> <span id="s2077">And we began to worry about it because she could be the next deported person.</span> <span id="s2078">So the question was how do we get -- we need to get her a job.</span> <span id="s2079">Who will get her a job?</span> <span id="s2080">My father could not hit right.</span> <span id="s2081">And then was the -- also the peculiar situation in ghetto of reversed roles.</span> <span id="s2082">You know, the people -- kids like myself that were coming of age in the ghetto, but they were children in school, but by the time it was going on, they were 17 - 18.</span> <span id="s2083">There was the support of the -- of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2084">That on them leaned the economy of life in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2085">Those were the people with strength, that could work and buy time for Rumkowski from the Germans.</span> <span id="s2086">So all of the sudden I became very important in the group -- in the populati -- in the, you know, population.</span> <span id="s2087">And influential.</span> <span id="s2088">So my father said, “Well you have to do something.”</span> <span id="s2089">But what can I do?</span> <span id="s2090">We have to do something.</span> <span id="s2091">At this time I was working in this housing department which had couple bosses, one older man, and his assistant -- I forget their names, Wolf -- one was Wolfe, the young one was Wolfe, and the older I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2092">And the -- you know, older guy and his assistant was the younger guy, and they -- you know, we had very good relationship, they respected me, I respected them, i-it was nice.</span> <span id="s2093">So I said, I have to go to both of them and ask if they can find a job for Mother.</span> <span id="s2094">It was a dangerous step, because you had to pay.</span> <span id="s2095">And what does a young girl pay?</span> <span id="s2096">How does a young girl pay?</span> <span id="s2097">Sex, right?</span> <span id="s2098">So that was written in big letters.</span> <span id="s2099">Am I willing to pay that for my mother getting a job?</span> <span id="s2100">I had to count on that, when I go to one or the other.</span> <span id="s2101">That’s how Rumkowski comes in that category, too.</span> <span id="s2102">When people came, women, particularly young women came to him with begging for some favor, like for a sick person to get some medicine, or what n -- extraordinary thing, they had to pay.</span> <span id="s2103">So I said, what do I do?</span> <span id="s2104">And I cannot talk to Father about that.</span> <span id="s2105">So I said, well, God help me, and I go to both of them.</span> <span id="s2106">But to one, the older one, he was a chief, and tell him such and such, and I need a job for Mother, to keep her alive.</span> <span id="s2107">What can I tell you my surprise that he didn’t ask for a prize, and he got Mother a job in a kitchen in some resort, you know, in some factory.</span> <span id="s2108">And Mother started to work.</span> <span id="s2109">I was surprised, but pleasantly, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: So that was a one thing.</span> <span id="s2112">The other thing was Mother worked in that factory, the director was Mrs. Sandberg, who was the father of my classmate in grade school, and we knew each other -- I forgot her name, first name, but not closely, but she -- she was a nice kid and I think she thought me, too.</span> <span id="s2113">I knew her parents from all kinds of affairs for kids.</span> <span id="s2114">Her father had a horrible opinion, you know, as a explorator, as a bad guy, as nobody to talk to, y -- just -- that was the opinion of Mrs. -- about Mr. Sandberg.</span> <span id="s2115">Her mother was a nice lady.</span> <span id="s2116">Mother was very happy working there.</span> <span id="s2117">I told you my mother s -- wished to work --</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2119">She finally --</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: -- and she could not.</span> <span id="s2121">She got a job.</span> <span id="s2122">And was she happy.</span> <span id="s2123">She really was happy.</span> <span id="s2124">She was going in the morning, she worked in the kitchen, peeling potatoes, all kinds of stuff, but being among a bunch of women -- my mother was an excellent talker, you know, and communi -- you know, sort of with people, she was a -- enjoyed it and was liked, and she would come back with stories.</span> <span id="s2125">And I said, “Mother, I never saw you so happy.”</span> <span id="s2126">And also, in the kitchen, we -- they were allowed some stealing.</span> <span id="s2127">They could take some -- first of all, they were allowed to do is to bring home potato peels.</span> <span id="s2128">Something that you throw out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Throw away, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Potato peels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: It’s good for you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: That was delicious food.</span> <span id="s2135">Mother would cook a kugel from potato peels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: Yes, and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s2138">So it was food for the family.</span> <span id="s2139">And she smuggled few potatoes with it, so we had few potatoes.</span> <span id="s2140">So she was double happy for herself and that she could bring something home from the job.</span> <span id="s2141">Make me very happy, you know, it was just nice to see that woman, under those conditions really thriving.</span> <span id="s2142">Then one day comes the order through Mr. Sandberg, as it was coming to all directors of the factories, to supply by that date, that many workers of his to send out to -- for relocation.</span> <span id="s2143">It was called relocation, to another ghetto.</span> <span id="s2144">Right?</span> <span id="s2145">So Mother is in danger, and in serious danger.</span> <span id="s2146">And what do I do?</span> <span id="s2147">Mother says, go and talk to Mr. Sandberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: This time Mother says it, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: I may be sent out.</span> <span id="s2150">Oh.</span> <span id="s2151">I was beside myself.</span> <span id="s2152">I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s2153">He’s a mean -- I say, “Mother, he is a mean man, I may make it worse.”</span> <span id="s2154">And she says, “Don’t worry, just go and talk to him.”</span> <span id="s2155">I walked the streets around my house half of the night, what do I do, what do I do?</span> <span id="s2156">So I did -- first of all I went to talk to Mrs. Sandberg, the wife.</span> <span id="s2157">And she knew me, you know, I was a classmate of her daughter, and I said, look, such and such, I don’t know what to ask you for, but please understand where we are.</span> <span id="s2158">She didn’t say anything, yes, no, whatever, nothing.</span> <span id="s2159">And then I made an appointment to see Mr. Sandberg, and I did see him, and he was nice enough.</span> <span id="s2160">Not nice really, but polite enough.</span> <span id="s2161">And I begged him for my mother’s life.</span> <span id="s2162">Well, he didn’t put her on the list.</span> <span id="s2163">But you asked me what were the fi -- feeling, living like that.</span> <span id="s2164">You see this horror of those feelings?</span> <span id="s2165">And horror of ever -- of being forced, not by my parents, by what’s going on, to do something that you may think that you contribute to your mother’s death one way or another.</span> <span id="s2166">Could have happened very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: He could have said, I have no choice.</span> <span id="s2169">What would you do in my place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">A: Things like that.</span> <span id="s2172">But that worked out that way.</span> <span id="s2173">How does it leave you internally?</span> <span id="s2174">Certainly not with a feeling of power.</span> <span id="s2175">A feeling of rage, of anger, that you cannot get riv -- rid of through your lifetime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2176">Q: Do you also think of the other side, your mother saved, but somebody else goes?</span> <span id="s2177">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: That’s true, but I didn’t think that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Not then, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Mm-mm.</span> <span id="s2181">But of course somebody -- you know, there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Yes, somebody’s got to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s2184">He had to -- he had to produce the number of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: -- the Germans wanted.</span> <span id="s2187">Rumkowski and the Germans wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: But to go beg for someone’s life is not -- it’s not what one wants to do in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q: This -- the -- the tales you were just telling about going and trying to get work for your mother came after I talked about corruption in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: And clearly you think that these examples show in what sense there was corruption in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2196">Can -- can you explain that a little bit more, why -- why you think so, even though these men never asked you for sex.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: No, personally, I was afraid of that because we knew -- knew stories -- of the stories where young women would go asking for a favor, including Rumkowski, and they had -- you know, they were sexually assaulted, and they had to submit if they wanted this vital -- begging to take -- you know, to be gratified.</span> <span id="s2198">Had to do with saving a life of a mother, a sister, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2199">So in that way there was corruption of the people that had positions, they had the power to demand pay-offs, and in a sexual way from -- from women.</span> <span id="s2200">That what I meant [indecipherable] what I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2202">So this provides an example of what you may not know in terms of your personal existence, but assumed that there was a lot of different --</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Oh, we heard about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">Q: -- kinds of corruption going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: There were circulating stories that women were telling about, and warning other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: And was there other kinds of corruption?</span> <span id="s2209">People paying off people to not be put in deportations?</span> <span id="s2210">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: I don’t know enough about it to really speak of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: I’m sure there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: What was -- what were the relationships like?</span> <span id="s2215">Well -- well let me do it smaller first.</span> <span id="s2216">Ho -- how were the relations with your parents and your sister during this period?</span> <span id="s2217">Was -- did things become more tense, or was it easy?</span> <span id="s2218">I -- were you angry at your parents because yo -- there was a role reversal, and they weren’t protecting you, you were now protecting them in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: There was a anger that you probably could not admit even to yourself, knowing the situation.</span> <span id="s2220">No, anger with my father that he told me you have to find a job, of course I was angry, but I had to keep it in, most of it, because -- because he was right.</span> <span id="s2221">It was this role reversal in the ghetto that the young people were made to take over, make decisions, give yi -- e-etcetera.</span> <span id="s2222">They were also the people that the life of the ghetto depend on, because they had the strength to work, and the older generation was sort of losing this physical strength of working the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: So you think it was the younger people who were -- who kept the ghetto going, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2225">They were given the role, not that they asked for, but by the exhaustion of the older generation of their strength by doing that work for a year or two under conditions of hunger, losing weight, illnesses, the younger were coming up, they had the strength to work.</span> <span id="s2226">So they could not complain, but they were angry for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: They were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: I was, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2230">Because you were given a burden you didn’t -- you would have preferred not to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: That’s right, I didn’t ask for it, and -- and it was a burden of saving the life of your mother.</span> <span id="s2232">You know, that’s not small potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: No, it’s not.</span> <span id="s2234">Now I -- i-in some of the work that -- that I’ve done, I noticed that for long periods of time in the ghetto, the men had more jobs, many more jobs than the women did.</span> <span id="s2235">Now I don’t know whether as a person living in the ghetto you could even notice that.</span> <span id="s2236">Did -- did you notice that there were more men working at certain jobs?</span> <span id="s2237">I don’t mean just that there was a male police force, I -- I don’t -- I don’t mean that, but even in the factory, were there many more men than there were women?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Look, when we went into the war, and into the ghetto, the structure of society was not dissimilar in th-the structure of my family.</span> <span id="s2239">The men worked, the women kept house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: So, in the ghetto too, the primary role of men was to get a job and bring the bacon, maybe salami, right?</span> <span id="s2242">But there was no salami either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">A: Right?</span> <span id="s2245">It was only because -- and of course there were some jobs that women from the beginning, like the sewing job, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: -- they sew -- I mean what -- they making -- were making clothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: -- clothing, so they were sewing machine, and for those job women were hired, and women did that before the war, too.</span> <span id="s2250">So some of those jobs were -- you know, sort of women were working, young women, older women, but the majority job was men’s job.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: So does that mean that more women, do you think, were deported, because they didn’t have jobs, so they’re more vulnerable to deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: Not necessarily, becau -- because women started to -- to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">Q: To work, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">A: They got jobs, and they started to work.</span> <span id="s2255">And -- in bigger numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: There was a hat factory, they were making hats.</span> <span id="s2258">There was the sewing factory, the women were -- were working and making all kinds of apparels.</span> <span id="s2259">So, you know, those were jobs that women could easy fit in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2261">A: Kitchen work, women were doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: So did you ni -- besides the -- the corruption of -- of men being in certain positions of power and being able to say, you want this, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: -- pay for it, sleep with me, right?</span> <span id="s2265">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: Were there other ways in which you think there was a kind of a -- using the word discrimination is a har -- is a strange -- strange word, but that there were differences between the lives that men were leading and the lives that women were leading in the context of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2267">Where as this -- is this one very important, because sexual exchange, that’s what women have to exchange.</span> <span id="s2268">And so that would be a lot of what might be going on in many instances.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: So, do you think that that was the primary difference between men and women, that there was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: Men were -- I mean, it was their experience from before the war, where men were employed, and gain, as a group of men, experience and know-how and in different jobs -- of course, in the ghetto men got that differentiation too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: They were more fit for jobs, women were not prepared, they were not trained, much more so than nowadays, where women are everywhere.</span> <span id="s2274">But years ago, that was a more patriarchal society, like in my family, the men worked, the women stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: Was the housekeeper.</span> <span id="s2277">So that was a big minus for women.</span> <span id="s2278">They had to change --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: -- under conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s2282">In -- in the interview with Lanzmann --</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: -- he asked you about thi -- there was a part of the interview, not that’s on the screen, but in the -- about thinking, and at one point you said, I couldn't think, I had to withdraw, because if you thought, you would commit suicide.</span> <span id="s2285">You would -- it -- it was impossible to think too much.</span> <span id="s2286">Do you still think that about who you were then, that you -- you really, in order to survive, you simply had to keep going in some practical way?</span> <span id="s2287">It --</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2290">So too much consciousness could kill you, too, in some -- in some respects.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: Well, I think I was pretty much conscious of what’s going on, and in talking with Father and Mother, you know, we were not suppressed of not thinking, and go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">A: But you -- you had to, foremost -- I told you, we shall overcome.</span> <span id="s2294">I was not conscious of that sentence then, but the philosophy was, go on, survive and tell the story.</span> <span id="s2295">Which --</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: That really was conscious?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Did you know people who didn’t feel that way?</span> <span id="s2299">Who really went down -- not to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: They did not survive.</span> <span id="s2301">They got sick and died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: So what do you think is the difference?</span> <span id="s2303">What is -- what i -- what is it about you and your family, you think?</span> <span id="s2304">Does -- I mean, is there an -- even any way to know what it is that kept you going that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: I was raised that way.</span> <span id="s2306">Don’t ask me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: Well ask me, you know, I’m just telling you it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: -- very hard to -- to answer that question.</span> <span id="s2311">I was raised that way on one hand with tremendous love and care, and a certain discipline.</span> <span id="s2312">And one example of that is like that.</span> <span id="s2313">I remember -- I told you we lived with my grandparents, entrance, a little hall, kitchen, bathroom, you go in a big dining room, old fashioned, with old fashioned furniture, you know, the carved furniture.</span> <span id="s2314">My grandparent’s bedroom, and then the last room was a very huge room, that was our family room.</span> <span id="s2315">It was a dining room and a bedroom at the same time, a children -- everything, but a big room, a huge table in the middle, oval table, and a lamp, a ceiling lamp from the ceiling and I remember it had a green -- light green silk -- what do you call this outside of the lamp?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: Ah, lampshade.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Lampshade, and lights in the middle.</span> <span id="s2318">And that was the place where everything was taking place.</span> <span id="s2319">We would eat there, I would make homework.</span> <span id="s2320">And homework my father was involved for a number of years with me, doing every day homework.</span> <span id="s2321">And I would work with my father, he was a pai -- he painted well, he drew well, and he showed me how, and all that.</span> <span id="s2322">And I remember one scene, I was sitting with my father, and he was watching me drawing, and watching.</span> <span id="s2323">And I remember I drew a bunch of lilac.</span> <span id="s2324">Blue lilac.</span> <span id="s2325">So that was a little branch with blue lilac and leaves.</span> <span id="s2326">And I was very busy drawing that, my father on this side.</span> <span id="s2327">And I looked up, and there’s my mother standing beside me, and shaking her head to what my father saying, she’s doing very well, you know, without saying.</span> <span id="s2328">And I looked, and I was so happy, because my mother was not one to gr -- congratulate me or tell me you’re doing well, never, okay?</span> <span id="s2329">I was doing, it was my job, whatever, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2330">It was the only time that I saw she really cares.</span> <span id="s2331">And she approves of the work that my father is doing with me.</span> <span id="s2332">And that memory survived untouched for all those years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: And that’s what gave you a kind of strength, you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: You think so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">A: I think so.</span> <span id="s2337">Approval and strength.</span> <span id="s2338">Silent approval, not approval gushing you’re great and so on, to blow up my head, but approval.</span> <span id="s2339">And you know, a message.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">A: I don’t have to tell you that.</span> <span id="s2342">The -- only one time you can see that, but you know.</span> <span id="s2343">You should know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: But you also had something from your grandmother who was so affectionate, and clearly loved you a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2346">It was another memory.</span> <span id="s2347">I told you, I could always jump in her lap and she would hold me --</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: --and caress me, and so on.</span> <span id="s2350">And then too, there was a time -- you know, the -- really, my parents had it good, she was a built-in babysitter, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: She was not going out mu-much.</span> <span id="s2355">So I stayed and they would go out, and they would go out to see the concert and so on.</span> <span id="s2356">Later they, when I grew up more, they were taking me Jewish theater and other theater, so I was -- and I got to know the writers and actors because I would come often with my father to the administration, to the newspaper room, and there were always some actors and writers bringing book -- you know, eager to be, you know, put into the press.</span> <span id="s2357">And I would shake hands, three years, four years old, with the biggest Jewish actors in town, that would come for shows and so on.</span> <span id="s2358">It was wonderful, you know?</span> <span id="s2359">So this night they were going to theater, and I stayed home and I got sick.</span> <span id="s2360">As a kid I would get often sick with croup, you know, this bad cough?</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Croupy cough.</span> <span id="s2363">And I was coughing and coughing and crying, Mama, Mama.</span> <span id="s2364">My grandmother got scared and she called the ambulance, you know, because she didn’t know what to do with me.</span> <span id="s2365">The ambulance came, and then my parents came, so [indecipherable] they still here, the ambulance people left, and my mother got furious with grandmother and told her, she just fooled you, you should know better.</span> <span id="s2366">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2367">Never do it again.</span> <span id="s2368">You should not have called the ambulance, because there’s nothing wrong with her.</span> <span id="s2369">She just had the croup.</span> <span id="s2370">That was my mother, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Was she right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: That you were exaggerating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: And you knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: Yeah, I thought she was right, later on particularly.</span> <span id="s2377">When I became a mother.</span> <span id="s2378">That was an example.</span> <span id="s2379">My mother was a doctor, she didn’t need any other doctors, she was herself the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Right, she -- she knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: She knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Did you get sick in the ghetto, besides being hungry and turning into skeletons, sort of?</span> <span id="s2383">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: Doesn’t that surprise you?</span> <span id="s2386">Under those conditions that you never got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Maybe I had a cold or so, but I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: No, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: -- remember being seriously ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Not your parents either?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: In the ghetto?</span> <span id="s2394">Yes, my mother got very ill.</span> <span id="s2395">She got ill with dysentery and was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s2396">And I was on the -- on the farm, living on the farm then.</span> <span id="s2397">And that was the only time that I needed help for my mo -- mother, it was some medication, or food stamps, you know.</span> <span id="s2398">And didn’t want to go to Rumkowski, but I went to somebody else.</span> <span id="s2399">What -- you say, what was her -- his secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: Fuchs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: Fuchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Oh, Dora Fuchs --</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: Dora Fuchs, or somebody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: -- was the secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: And they gave me some -- what I needed for my mother.</span> <span id="s2406">And then she recovered.</span> <span id="s2407">But my father took care of her, not I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Because you were away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: I was away.</span> <span id="s2410">And -- and he wouldn’t let me either, you know, they took care of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: What sort of medicine is there for dysentery?</span> <span id="s2412">Do you know?</span> <span id="s2413">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: I don’t know, whatever it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">Q: It helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">A: -- or maybe it was some cottage cheese, some spec -- special dairy product that was to be helpful.</span> <span id="s2417">But that’s when I needed -- a-and then when I tell you that different people needed some help --</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: -- from there up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: -- on special occasions.</span> <span id="s2422">But, it was frightful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: In -- in general, what were the relationships like among people?</span> <span id="s2424">Were -- were peop -- was their solidarity in the ghetto, or was everybody out for themselves, or out for their small family group?</span> <span id="s2425">How do you remember other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: It was mixed.</span> <span id="s2427">I don’t know if I paid much attention.</span> <span id="s2428">I -- you know, told you about my getting into the friendship with the woman whose daughter was taken away.</span> <span id="s2429">And there was another friendship or relationship that I developed there, and that was also a Czech woman.</span> <span id="s2430">The cze -- the Czech transport was so outstanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Such wonderful people.</span> <span id="s2433">Really unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2434">So this woman was talking with me about the place to live.</span> <span id="s2435">So I gave her, you know, we looked through the -- what’s available, and wrote out where she should go.</span> <span id="s2436">And she went and she came back, and she says, it’s wonderful, I love it.</span> <span id="s2437">Let me do a favor to you.</span> <span id="s2438">Can I give you this, and she takes out a tchocki or something.</span> <span id="s2439">I said, “No, nothing.”</span> <span id="s2440">Can I give you some money?</span> <span id="s2441">I have to do something, I have to tell you thank you.</span> <span id="s2442">She came back again.</span> <span id="s2443">And I was telling my mother what was happening, and thi -- she said, “Look, I am very good dressmaker.</span> <span id="s2444">Let me sew you a dress.”</span> <span id="s2445">So I came home -- and I said no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2446">Listen, I am happy that you’re happy [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2447">So I came home and I told Mother, and Mother said, “Paula, let her do something for you.”</span> <span id="s2448">So ma -- Mother took out a green dress of grandmother that was very beautiful material, and was old and grandmother by that time, either was before she died, or maybe after she died.</span> <span id="s2449">And Mother said, “Give her this dress, and let her sew you a dress.”</span> <span id="s2450">Which I did.</span> <span id="s2451">And that was great.</span> <span id="s2452">The dress didn’t look so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: The dress didn’t look so great?</span> <span id="s2454">So tell me, what is it -- what is when you tell that story, what’s -- what -- why does it move you so much, do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: I think because it’s about my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: And her relationship with me, that I could talk to her, tell her, and she would always give me the right answer, that still now today seems very correct.</span> <span id="s2458">I didn’t want to take jewelry, I didn’t want to take money, but let her sew you a dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">Q: Let her do something for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">A: Yes, and let her do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: Well, that was one sort of relationship, other than that, what can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: What about the Germans?</span> <span id="s2464">There’s a -- the Germans have their administrative office inside the ghetto, which is not the most usual procedure in these ghettos.</span> <span id="s2465">So does that mean that you have contact with these Germans?</span> <span id="s2466">Or you don’t have contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">A: God forbid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: Gosh --</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: That was, you know, the center of the ghetto was the -- the marketplace from before the ghetto was formed, and through the ghetto, and now, because I visited in Lódz.</span> <span id="s2470">So those were marketplaces where people were coming, you know, sell their wares and so on.</span> <span id="s2471">That was turned in -- into the center of the ghetto administration.</span> <span id="s2472">It mean rums -- Rumkowski’s office was there, his secretaries, and other people in the administration, and the German headquarters.</span> <span id="s2473">Beside there, there was another building that was the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s2474">And that was fearsome to walk across that, because atrocities were happening there.</span> <span id="s2475">People called for no reason for interrogation, for confiscation, for killing.</span> <span id="s2476">So that was the German influence in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2477">Now, on this Balutski rinnek, Rumkowski was there and if you want -- if you needed a audience with him, it’s where you would go, or a audience with this Miss Fuchs, that’s where you would go.</span> <span id="s2478">And that was a place too, that you don’t pass easily, or go in easily.</span> <span id="s2479">Part of that Balutski rinnek was also dedic -- sort of kept for transport for -- let’s say for vegetables and fruit.</span> <span id="s2480">Fruit we didn’t have, but vegetables.</span> <span id="s2481">Frozen cabbage, frozen potatoes, all kinds of things, that’s where they were dished out, you know, if you -- if you got to know that there is something there, and you came so you -- you got some.</span> <span id="s2482">So that was part of -- o-of that center, too.</span> <span id="s2483">And that was it.</span> <span id="s2484">There were no Germans -- well, there were Germans around the border of the ghetto, you know, and -- the sentries, and the Gypsies across the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: And [indecipherable] there’s no -- there was no interaction between the Jews and the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2488">There were about 5000 Gypsies, I gather, in that section.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: I don’t know the number, but we knew they are there, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: Did you know where they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: Hungary, Romania.</span> <span id="s2492">That sort of comes to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">Q: You know, I ask you about the Germans because I ask you so many questions about the internal relationship amongst the Jews, and it isn’t the Jews who formed the ghetto, or who decided upon this process, it was the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2494">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">Q: So I need to ask you about the Germans to see what sort of relationship.</span> <span id="s2496">So did you ever see Biebow?</span> <span id="s2497">No.</span> <span id="s2498">Did -- Himmler visited -- you didn’t see, no.</span> <span id="s2499">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2500">Do you remember ever seeing Rumkowski walk around, or be on his -- was -- did he have a -- a car that he rode in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: He had a car, I told you I saw him few times --</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">A: -- when he was coming courting his future wife --</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">Q: His wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">A: -- on our street.</span> <span id="s2506">Other than that, the one remarkable place, it was the graduation from school that, you know, he was present and you know, asked the student and parent and he was giving speeches and how proud he was and how grateful -- how great he felt to graduate a bunch of kids from high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2508">Do you remember seeing him wearing high boots?</span> <span id="s2509">Someone said he wore very high boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Like the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2512">[indecipherable] maybe like the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: No, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: There were hangings in the ghetto, weren’t there?</span> <span id="s2517">And were you forced to see these wi -- you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">Q: So was everybody in the ghetto forced to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">A: The hanging were on a little -- not place, but a -- a little marketplace, other than this Balutski rinnek.</span> <span id="s2521">And there were buildings around that market, and one of the building was the office of housing, where I worked.</span> <span id="s2522">And when the hanging were happening, we were asked to come down and watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">Q: To watch people being --</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">A: The hanging.</span></p> <p><span id="s2525">Q: --

forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: You were forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: To see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">Q: More than once?</span></p> <p><span id="s2533">A: More than once.</span> <span id="s2534">And there were speeches of course, that I think once those guys, they were trying to run away from the ghetto and they were caught, or others were stealing or whatnot, you know, but they were hung.</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">Q: And who was doing the hanging?</span> <span id="s2536">The Germans?</span> <span id="s2537">Or could you tell, even?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">A: No German.</span> <span id="s2539">Jews were doing the killing.</span> <span id="s2540">Ger-Germans were there on their post, you know, watching it all, supervising it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: But the so-called [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: But there were the Jews that were hanging, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: Okay, I think we need to

the chronicles of the Lódz ghetto that you read, people put out a newspaper of some kind with the news on it?</span> <span id="s2547">Or was the chronicle a sort of underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: Don’t recall, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: You don’t recall, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: But we had a theater and concerts --</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: -- in the ghetto, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2553">Q: And were they good?</span></p> <p><span id="s2554">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: And did you go often?</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: I went enough, you know, we had quite few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s2559">Q: Like once a week, or less than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">A: I don’t think they were that often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: They weren’t that often.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: Maybe once a month, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: Did somebo -- did you have to pay to get in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: Yes, ghetto money, which was worthless anyway, so it was sort of -- what could you get for it?</span> <span id="s2565">A concert.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: But the ghet -- but the ghetto money functioned inside the ghetto, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: That’s right, you could, you know, you could buy bread and other st-stuff with the ghetto money, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Did it have his picture on it, Rumkowski?</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: I cannot tell you, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Do you remember pictures of Rumkowski up in offices?</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">A: And if there were, I don’t recall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: Maybe you didn’t want to see them, if they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: That’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: In August there was going to -- there was a deportation, right, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">Q: -- when they start, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2579">A: 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s2580">Q: Do you hear about this sort of liquidation -- it’s not exactly a liquidation because people aren’t being killed then, they’re being sent out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">A: Mm-hm, but that was a liquidation of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">A: It stopped existing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">A: The structure stopped existing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2587">And does -- it stopped before August, I as -- I imagine.</span> <span id="s2588">Or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">A: End of August was the last transport that left the -- you know, the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2590">And Rumkowski was on that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2592">A: -- transport.</span> <span id="s2593">Now they left a crew of Jews on the Balutski rinnek you know, in the center, to clean up.</span> <span id="s2594">You know, clean up the space, put away stuff, etcetera, clean up.</span> <span id="s2595">And a good number of those people, I think two -- 300 people were able to hide in the last minute, and survived.</span> <span id="s2596">Th -- it was shortly before the Russian troops marched in.</span> <span id="s2597">So a good number -- good number, 200 or so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2598">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">A: -- Jews saved their lives, the ones that worked on -- on the Balutski rinnek, and were asked to stay to clean up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: You were not asked to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: Oh no, I did -- I didn’t work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Those were workers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Who worked in -- in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: Yeah, that’s right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">Q: So what happened to you and your family at that -- at that time during the August deportations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">A: During the August deportation, y-you had to make a decision to go voluntarily or not, you know?</span> <span id="s2608">There was a station, a train station called Radogoszcz, where the trains were set up to leave.</span> <span id="s2609">And you had to make up your mind if -- you were assigned a day where to -- when to go.</span> <span id="s2610">I don’t remember how it happened.</span> <span id="s2611">And I said, “I am not going voluntarily.</span> <span id="s2612">I am not going.”</span> <span id="s2613">And my mother wrung her ha -- ha -- hands, what do we do, and turning to me, what do we do.</span> <span id="s2614">You know, I have to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: You have to give --</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: -- to tell her what to do.</span> <span id="s2617">So I say, “I don’t know, but I don’t want to go.”</span> <span id="s2618">So let’s try to hide.</span> <span id="s2619">And we hid.</span> <span id="s2620">I had a friend around there, and she had a policeman that was sort of high up in the Sonderkommando, and he knew what to do, but eventually didn’t know, nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2621">So we were hiding in a place that already was evacuated, but out -- out of a -- our house, because we had to get out of where we lived, so -- to be close to the train station.</span> <span id="s2622">So we hide -- we did hide in a house that was strange -- you know, we didn’t know it, but -- and spend a couple days or more, waiting for some signal from God, or who knows who, what to do.</span> <span id="s2623">And then we were watching through the windows how the German SS were walking and pulling people out, and bring -- you know, marching them to the train station.</span> <span id="s2624">And we didn’t know what they do with them, do they shoot them on the way or not.</span> <span id="s2625">So the outlook for successful hiding was ne-never -- not too good.</span> <span id="s2626">And we were losing -- we are losing the -- the willpower to hide and be dragged out and killed.</span> <span id="s2627">So it was sort of what happened to everybody, will happen to us too.</span> <span id="s2628">You know, resignation.</span> <span id="s2629">And one day we just showed up at the point where they were collecting people and marching them to the station of Radogoszcz, and putting them on the cattle -- cattle train -- cattle wagons.</span> <span id="s2630">And that’s how we landed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">Q: So this was you, your younger sister, your mother and your father.</span> <span id="s2632">Your grandparents have --</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">A: Dead by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: -- are dead by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">Q: And this is a train trip of a day, two days?</span> <span id="s2637">It’s hard to remember, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: It’s hard to remember how long it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: It’s a pretty fair distance, with a train that doesn’t go too fast.</span> <span id="s2641">So hours, many hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">Q: Was it awful on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">A: Pretty awful.</span> <span id="s2644">No water, no toilet, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: Was there a bucket for a toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: I don’t think there were buckets either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">Q: How old are your parents by now?</span> <span id="s2648">You’re -- you’re now 22 years old, about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2650">My mother was 47 years old, my father was 51 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">Q: An-And are they still strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">A: Pretty strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">Q: They’re okay, they’re pretty strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">A: Yes, they were pretty -- in good health.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2656">So you get to Auschwitz, di -- you’ve heard about Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s2657">Bef --</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: We heard the name mentioned, but not really, we did not hear, other than we heard, you know, gas, and crematoria and death, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: So is -- so is that what you expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: That you would go there and you’d be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: So you get off this train, is it daytime, nighttime, morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: Was daytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: Daytime.</span> <span id="s2666">A train with a lot of people on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: Lot of people, loaded, full trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: And it’s a full train from Lódz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Lódz, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2670">And as we get unloaded, there were SS men, few, but mainly Jews working there, they were the sonderco -- Jewish jo -- Sonderkommando, and they were unloading us.</span> <span id="s2671">Get out, outsteigen, get out, and so on.</span> <span id="s2672">And we ask, where are we?</span> <span id="s2673">Where are we going?</span> <span id="s2674">And they said in Hebrew, to mishpitt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Mishpitt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">A: Mishpitt is the -- the day of reckoning -- wa -- how do you say it, the day of -- the judgment, day of judgment, the judgment day.</span> <span id="s2677">In Hebrew, mishpitt.</span> <span id="s2678">So it was clear what they were saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: This is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: Death, to death, yes.</span> <span id="s2681">So we are herded in groups and start marching.</span> <span id="s2682">And of course, all the things that we were carrying with us, bundles or so, were taken away and thrown on the street, you know, next to the train.</span> <span id="s2683">So we were relieved of the luggage, and marched to the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Now you’re -- the train comes up close to Birkenau, yes?</span> <span id="s2685">So you go -- but does the train go under this underpass, or are you outside and you walk in, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: Life mu -- “Arbeit macht frei.”</span> <span id="s2687">That was the big sign there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">A: Work sets you free, “Arbeit macht frei”.</span> <span id="s2690">And we marched -- we didn’t know anything, Birkenau or not Birkenau, because they -- that probably the train stopped in Auschwitz proper and we were marched to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Or we -- the train went to Birkenau and we were marched to the -- to the showers.</span> <span id="s2693">You know, to the place where we were greeted, and the greeting was, take off your clothes, stay naked, and around were women, men, and the first thing that they were doing were shaving us.</span> <span id="s2694">Our heads, all hair of our body.</span> <span id="s2695">Man did that.</span> <span id="s2696">I suppose that was Sonderkommando, too, Jews doing it.</span> <span id="s2697">And then we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">Q: But you’re not with your father.</span> <span id="s2699">You’re father’s been separated, or am I wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: Take me back.</span> <span id="s2701">We go, we walk, and then we -- we walk to the point where Mengele is standing, you know, the German physician, and says, you know, women left, men right, and men go right away to the other side, and women go to this side, and then we march in front of Mengele.</span> <span id="s2702">And so it is Mother, me and my sister.</span> <span id="s2703">And he pulls Mother out to one side, and us to the other side.</span> <span id="s2704">And I said, “I want to go with Mother.”</span> <span id="s2705">I follow Mother, and he pulls me out and sends me to the other side, to left instead of right, which the right was going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2707">How -- how did you know it was Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: I didn’t know it was Mengele.</span> <span id="s2709">That was a physician, we knew a physician, people were talking, I don’t know who.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: But we later find out that -- you know, or people were talking because they knew from some of the Sonderkommand that this is Mengele, this is Mengele.</span> <span id="s2712">So we knew the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: And the face, now the face, so we knew that was the physician of Auschwitz, the famous one.</span> <span id="s2715">And then we go, I and my sister are left, and we are led to this big hole where, you know, we sat naked and shaved, and then led to showers.</span> <span id="s2716">And we knew already that the showers mean death, so -- and that was sort of -- we all were looking for -- you know, for death.</span> <span id="s2717">As it happened, of course, the ones that we were with did not get killed, we were really taking showers, and given some so-called clothing, one shoe high heeled, one shoe low heeled, and s -- coup -- and a couple of sort of schmates, and led to barracks, we were led then to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">Q: Were you tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">A: No, our transport was not tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">A: And there was a number of transport that -- I think it was August already and I don’t think they had time any more for things like -- for -- for playful things like that, so we didn’t get tattooed.</span> <span id="s2722">And we were led to the barracks, and a-acquainted with the kapo, which was a woman and her helper.</span> <span id="s2723">And the kapo had, in this big barrack had a wonderful room, nicely furnished and all that, nice.</span> <span id="s2724">She had a very important role, and was paid for that by special favors.</span> <span id="s2725">And that’s how it started, life in Auschwitz started.</span> <span id="s2726">So before we were sent to the barracks, we still had to stay on si -- c’est l’appel, which was counting down a -- how many people we are, and that took hours.</span> <span id="s2727">It was way into the night.</span> <span id="s2728">And then we were sent to the barracks, and given space enough -- not enough to stretch out.</span> <span id="s2729">There were like five in a row, five women in a row, not enough to stretch out, but just to curl up somehow, and that was our first day and first night in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2730">Early in the morning was c’est l’appel again, where we were standing and were counted.</span> <span id="s2731">Every day, twice a day, was hours, it took hours to be counted.</span> <span id="s2732">And the number better be right, or else we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2733">Q: Otherwise they count again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Otherwise they count again, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2737">And there were incidents where somebody would run away, and we would stand for hours, and then that person was brought back and killed.</span> <span id="s2738">And so, you know, to give an example what happens if you think of running away.</span> <span id="s2739">And life started there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">Q: That’s a bit ironic, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s2741">Life starts --</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Now, did you know rather soon what probably happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s2747">We knew right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: You knew right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2750">Those people were sent o -- didn’t know what happened to Father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">A: I found out much later on, you know, in Lódz, when I was back in Lódz from a friend of Father, that was with him in the same camp, they were sent off to camps outside Auschwitz, and I think he told me that my father died in one of those marches to another camp, on the way.</span> <span id="s2753">So, he died.</span> <span id="s2754">If he was -- I assume that he was killed, you know, because in a march, when you si -- when you slow down, there was the SS man then helped you die quicker.</span> <span id="s2755">So I assume that what happened to Father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: Now, a number of hours ago when we started, and I asked you about your relationship to your sister, it wasn’t -- you didn’t like that she was there, blah, blah, blah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: But something changed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2759">So now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: Yes, y-y-you see, though Mother was very careful not to load me, the older sister with responsibility for my -- for my sister, nevertheless, it was I was the older sister, and I didn’t like it, you know?</span> <span id="s2761">If she didn’t load me, I thought she expect me anyhow to help her with homework, and s -- so I had the special duty of an older sister that I did not like.</span> <span id="s2762">And she couldn’t do nothing for me.</span> <span id="s2763">You know, it was all one way, though she tried.</span> <span id="s2764">She did the dishes, and she just tried.</span> <span id="s2765">She loved me and she tried so hard, poor thing.</span> <span id="s2766">And then in Auschwitz, we were together.</span> <span id="s2767">And the c’est l’appel you had to lined out with five -- five women to the count, and the five women slept together, sort of in one row.</span> <span id="s2768">So there was myself, my sister and three other women.</span> <span id="s2769">And we sort of hung out together, and that was it.</span> <span id="s2770">Then I became ill.</span> <span id="s2771">I developed -- really, I got sick with typhoid fe-fever.</span> <span id="s2772">You know, fever and diarrhea and all of that, and I had no choice but report to the hospital, which was another terrible thing, because we hear terrible things what happens in the hospital.</span> <span id="s2773">But I had no choice, so I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s2774">My sister stayed.</span> <span id="s2775">And i-in the hospital, I ended up on the ward, the infectious disease ward.</span> <span id="s2776">And we had a wonderful woman pediatrician that was from town, Dr. Greenberg, and her daughter was there, too.</span> <span id="s2777">And she was a wonderful physician and treated us well.</span> <span id="s2778">Every day or every other day, Mengele would come and segregate people that he thought should die already.</span> <span id="s2779">So we had visits to -- of that sort.</span> <span id="s2780">And then one day -- then it was one room, and there was the other room, and between the rooms were knocked out, you know, a knocked out hall that you could look into the other room.</span> <span id="s2781">And I found out that my sister is there.</span> <span id="s2782">You know, she got ill, too, and came.</span> <span id="s2783">And so I could communicate, and we communicated.</span> <span id="s2784">Twenty-sixth of September it was her birthday, so I made her a present, I saved up some bread, and some sausage, and gave her the happy birthday sandwich.</span> <span id="s2785">Not only that, in Auschwitz, before I became ill, and when I started to be not feeling well, our role changed.</span> <span id="s2786">She took care -- was taking care of me and doing everything for me, and being thoughtful and caring.</span> <span id="s2787">It was just a different sister I had.</span> <span id="s2788">For the first time in my life she was taking care of me.</span> <span id="s2789">I needed her help.</span> <span id="s2790">And it was so great.</span> <span id="s2791">But short-lived, you know, so we ended up in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">A: Then one day we hear -- oh, and then it was -- they -- medically they treated us very well.</span> <span id="s2794">Isolated, with the -- was a -- they were examining every day the stool, etcetera, and blood, so they know when people were well, and when they got well they were sent out back to the main camp.</span> <span id="s2795">And one day I was told that I am well, that her examination came negative and I can go back.</span> <span id="s2796">And I told that to my sister, and she says, “So go back.”</span> <span id="s2797">So I said, “No, I will wait for you.”</span> <span id="s2798">“Oh, what are you doing, that’s dangerous, you know.</span> <span id="s2799">You may get killed.”</span> <span id="s2800">Cause periodically they were cleansing the hospital to the -- to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s2801">So she says, “Well, you know, they may catch you.”</span> <span id="s2802">I say, “I don’t care, you know, I don’t want to be separate from you.</span> <span id="s2803">So I wait and then we’ll go together.”</span> <span id="s2804">And then in couple days we hear rumors that they are going to liquidate the infectious disease hospital.</span> <span id="s2805">And true enough, one day the trucks come, and I could see it through the window, and they are going to do that, okay?</span> <span id="s2806">So we hear the s -- SS men coming in, and we were sort of in the middle, so they come there and the hole -- now we could communicated -- communicate with my sister through the hole, but there was no way that I could come to her -- her room, or she could come to my room.</span> <span id="s2807">There was -- there was no possibility.</span> <span id="s2808">They had sentry watching.</span> <span id="s2809">So she and I talked, and she says, “What are we going to do?”</span> <span id="s2810">I say, “Dorka, I don’t know what to do, do you?”</span> <span id="s2811">“No, what are we going to do?”</span> <span id="s2812">So I said, “Well, I cannot come to your room so we could be together and go wherever together, you cannot come here, so I really don’t know.”</span> <span id="s2813">I suppose we could not cry even, you know, it was beyond crying.</span> <span id="s2814">Then I hear steps and the sentries coming to our room, and saying to la -- for us to line up, so people start lining up.</span> <span id="s2815">And I just was not eager to line up up front, so I was sort of holding back and watching.</span> <span id="s2816">And people started to leave the room.</span> <span id="s2817">And towards the end I see two girls are jumping under the -- the beds, you know, the -- what you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">Q: Bunk beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">A: Bunk bed -- beds.</span> <span id="s2820">And I say, wow, not a bad idea.</span> <span id="s2821">So people are leaving and I am holding back.</span> <span id="s2822">And I start jumping under -- on the other end, under the bunk.</span> <span id="s2823">Well -- and those two start crying, don’t do that, you will give us out, they will kill us because of you.</span> <span id="s2824">Needless to say I did not listen to that, and I stayed under one bunk bed, and that was it.</span> <span id="s2825">And of course, I hear then, you know, they go to the next room where my sister is, and the room gets emptied, and I could see through the window, there was a window, the truck is waiting there, and they climb naked into the truck.</span> <span id="s2826">Hours pass, and it gets dark, and two SS men come in the room with lantern and dogs and start, you know, looking.</span> <span id="s2827">Ser -- search light under the bunk beds, and did not find us.</span> <span id="s2828">And they leave, and we still there, under, you know, waiting couple hours or so until it was totally quiet.</span> <span id="s2829">The buses were -- have left, and we started to talk with each other and say well, maybe it’s time to get out and see what’s -- what’s happening.</span> <span id="s2830">So we get out and go up front, through a big hole, nurse’s stations.</span> <span id="s2831">And we find out that a number of people are left.</span> <span id="s2832">First of all, some people not from the infectious disease division.</span> <span id="s2833">Some doctors, women doctors, and we join the group.</span> <span id="s2834">And then, I don’t know how long we waited, but we were put on a train and transported, we didn’t know where to, but it was a benign atmosphere.</span> <span id="s2835">We were transported to Birkenau to the old -- to the camp from which we originally came.</span> <span id="s2836">And that camp was leaving next morning in trains, to go who knows where -- to a camp, to another camp, you know, so who knows, and who has to believe that.</span> <span id="s2837">And indeed we -- we left, still not knowing, still full of fear, what will be in the train, gas in the train, the -- you know, this in the train.</span> <span id="s2838">And we were transported to a camp in -- in a forest.</span> <span id="s2839">It was Silesia, the German Silesia.</span> <span id="s2840">You know, Auschwitz is in Silesia, the Polish Silesia, and more left is the German Silesia, but still Silesia in the forest and outl -- unloaded in woods.</span> <span id="s2841">Forest, pine forest.</span> <span id="s2842">And -- and led to -- to tents.</span> <span id="s2843">In each tent there were eight women or so.</span> <span id="s2844">The bedding was pine branches, and the cover was pine branches a-and -- and hay.</span> <span id="s2845">And that where we lived from then on, for the next couple months.</span> <span id="s2846">Digging -- didding -- digging ditches --</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: Ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: -- against tanks, Russian camp -- tanks that were -- that were a -- coming soon.</span> <span id="s2849">So that was our -- and it was November, December.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">Q: So it was hard to dig?</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">A: With hardly any clothes on us, o-on -- on our backs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">End of Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Beginning Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">Q: C-Can I ask you something about Auschwitz for just a second?</span> <span id="s2856">Because it’s -- unless I misheard you, you said that you were taken from the hospital back to Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">Q: So does that mean the hospital you were in was not in Birkenau?</span> <span id="s2859">You were in Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2861">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2862">Q: Or you were in another part of Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A: Another part of Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2865">And did they take you bay truck back to your barracks?</span> <span id="s2866">Is that what they did?</span> <span id="s2867">Or you don’t remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: I remember it being on the train.</span> <span id="s2869">So maybe it was Auschwitz, you know, the real Auschwitz camp, not Birkenau, but it was a distance.</span> <span id="s2870">The hospital was a distance from the Birkenau barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: So they were taking us back to the barrack parts.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">A: And then we had to walk a bit and go to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">Q: Do you remember what barrack it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">A: Number?</span> <span id="s2877">No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">Q: Do you remember whether it was on the far right, where the -- they used to call Mexico, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2879">A: I don’t remember Mexico.</span></p> <p><span id="s2880">Q: -- you don’t remember the ba --</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: You didn’t say, but I’m assuming that your sister was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: She was.</span> <span id="s2885">And that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: The end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: -- that was the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2889">Q: So you were not able to say good-bye, nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">A: Well, that I think was the worst day in my whole experience about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">Q: Was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">A: Was that.</span> <span id="s2893">That day.</span> <span id="s2894">That always in my mind, you saved your life, but you could not save your sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: Even though you know that you couldn’t have saved her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2896">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">Q: It still -- and it’s the same with your parents, in your head.</span></p> <p><span id="s2898">A: Stronger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Stronger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: That you somehow should have been able --</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2903">Cause in a symbolic way, my mother in Auschwitz, gave me the job to take care of my sister.</span> <span id="s2904">And the symbolic way was that before we entered -- before we were parted, she gave me a little handkerchief with few jewelry pieces, her pieces, few ri -- you know, that was not much to talk about, but few rings, and a necklace of hers.</span> <span id="s2905">And she gave it to me, and says -- she said, take care.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: You’re not over it yet.</span> <span id="s2907">I guess there’s no getting over it.</span> <span id="s2908">So I can’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">Q: I can’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2911">I can’t take it away.</span> <span id="s2912">I’d like to take it away from you.</span> <span id="s2913">But you also feel as if you’re responsible for your parent’s deaths.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2915">But especially for my sister, because of that exchange.</span> <span id="s2916">And then later I was not so clear, but later I said, well she kid not -- could not mean the few pieces of gold, she meant my sister, to take care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">Q: Care of.</span> <span id="s2918">Not to take care of these, yeah.</span> <span id="s2919">Did you still have a desire to live in spite of that?</span> <span id="s2920">When you went to this new camp, when you -- when you would say to me in -- in -- in Lódz, though we didn’t know the words, we were going to overcome, we were going to survive.</span> <span id="s2921">Did you feel that, or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">Q: You still felt that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2927">Why give in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: To whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2931">To yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: The Germans, to give in and let them kill me?</span> <span id="s2933">Take my life, too?</span> <span id="s2934">That was a different message --</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">A: -- than --</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: I live and they died, and I shouldn’t live.</span> <span id="s2939">And that’s a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: Different message.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: And it’s not incongruous, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2944">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">A: -- experience at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2947">So you’re in this subcamp of Auschwitz in Silesia --</span></p> <p><span id="s2948">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">Q: -- with part of the people who were the staff of the hospital, is that true?</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: Oh, I don’t know, then we got mixed up, totally, so it -- it was a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span> <span id="s2952">Did you know any of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">A: I knew a few people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2954">Q: You knew a few.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">A: From way back, you know, those Lódz people --</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: So I knew some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2961">A: -- the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: How bad was it in the subcamp?</span> <span id="s2963">Was it really -- was it worse than Auschwitz, or did you now know they’re not going to gas me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">A: I didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s2965">They can take their way any place, anytime, so that was not unfinished story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: But how was it?</span> <span id="s2968">It was very cold, standing in the cold with hardly any clothes, digging ditches with very little to eat, and then coming to this tent.</span> <span id="s2969">There was sentry, there was a little stove, a little -- you know oven, that gave a little hit -- and heat, and we could dry maybe some clothing, socks -- we didn’t have socks -- you know, on the oven, and then go to sleep.</span> <span id="s2970">The air was good, though cold.</span> <span id="s2971">And we huddled together, and we slept and we went up and we were up day in, day out.</span> <span id="s2972">And in short time there was something very much that lifted our mood.</span> <span id="s2973">And that was more often we heard airplanes buzzing overhead, and we saw at the same time the German commander and his helper looking up and crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">Q: Crying?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2976">Those men -- those were not German airplanes, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">A: You guess who it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s2981">And we were laughing.</span> <span id="s2982">I-I mean, we didn’t laugh in their face, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2984">So i-in your view, something was going to happen quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2986">Q: Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: But before that, let me tell you one thing, in the barracks in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s2990">We had a -- we heard a number of times airplanes above our head, and we could go out and see the airplanes flying very low.</span> <span id="s2991">Those were not Russians, those were American planes.</span> <span id="s2992">With insigna -- insignias, U.S., etcetera, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2993">And we are in the barrack, and praying in unison, drop a bomb on us.</span> <span id="s2994">Why don’t you drop a bomb?</span></p> <p><span id="s2995">Q: On you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">A: On the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: At least --</span></p> <p><span id="s2999">Q: But then you’d be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">Q: It didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">A: Didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s3003">Do something.</span> <span id="s3004">Somebody do something.</span> <span id="s3005">Drop a bomb on the railway.</span> <span id="s3006">But at that point we were praying drop a bomb, just don’t be so sadistic and watch us and do nothing.</span> <span id="s3007">Those were American planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">Q: Were you -- you left in October to go to this -- this subcamp in Silesia, I think.</span> <span id="s3009">Am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">A: Something like that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3011">Q: Do you remember whether the uprising in Auschwitz had taken place, or you went to this camp before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3012">A: I -- we heard about it, but frankly I don’t remember much about it, and I -- I must have known more, but I don’t remember what I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">Q: You may not have been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">A: I -- I might have been in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3016">Okay.</span> <span id="s3017">So were you angry at the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">A: And how.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3020">You still are.</span> <span id="s3021">A: I’m still.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: Of course I still am.</span> <span id="s3024">More so later, because you know there is history now.</span> <span id="s3025">There were people, particularly one Polish aristocrat, I forget his name, that went to Warsaw ghetto and saw what’s going on, and he went to Washington to talk to Roosevelt and to London and tell them what’s going on in Warsaw ghetto, and they wou -- didn’t want to believe him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">Q: Karski.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: Karski, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: The courier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s3031">That was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3032">A: That what confirmed the airplanes going above our heads and doing nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3034">A: What cynicism.</span> <span id="s3035">And Roosevelt saying we -- first we have to finish the war, then we’ll think about the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">Q: Nothing much has changed, has it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3037">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s3039">Do you escape from this camp in Silesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">A: Escaped from the route.</span> <span id="s3041">I told you how the rou -- how the Germans reacted to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">A: -- sight of planes, and probably to the news that they were getting through the radio and so on.</span> <span id="s3044">You know, they knew more than just the planes, they knew the army -- the Russians are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: So one day we get the order to get ready to march.</span> <span id="s3047">We going to the west.</span> <span id="s3048">And then when the Death March, so-called Death March started -- you know about that, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">A: Evacuating the camps to the west.</span> <span id="s3051">So we got ready to the March.</span> <span id="s3052">What -- how should we get ready, w-we had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: Nothing to pack, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: Nothing to pack and nothing to worry about, who to li -- leave behi-behind or not.</span> <span id="s3055">And the -- they had a good number of German women, SS women, and they packed their things, and they went into the wagon, a big wagon, the women.</span> <span id="s3056">And they -- we, the -- the slaves, had to pull that wagon with the -- those German madams sitting there, taking turns, and that was a added bonus for the Death March.</span> <span id="s3057">So we were going and going and going, and where are we going?</span> <span id="s3058">We didn’t know where we going.</span> <span id="s3059">You know what happened, the Death March ended in Bergen-Belsen, right, on the west border.</span> <span id="s3060">We didn’t dare s -- to slow down, because if you slowed down, you were dead.</span> <span id="s3061">You know, the -- you know, they shoot the women, many women were shot on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">A: So you have to use all your strength to go.</span> <span id="s3064">And on the third day I said I -- wherever we going I won’t make it because I am totally exhausted.</span> <span id="s3065">And that night we were finished at a farm, at a big farm, and slept over, on the ground of course, under cover.</span> <span id="s3066">And th -- in that farm there were in -- under a shed, there were three big kettles of molasses.</span> <span id="s3067">They were making molasses, okay?</span> <span id="s3068">Hungry as we were, you know what we did.</span> <span id="s3069">We threw us -- ourselves on the molasses and ate the molasses and you know what happened later.</span> <span id="s3070">Diarrhea and vomiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">A: And I wake up, and I said, which way do I want to die.</span> <span id="s3073">I have to find a way, because I am not making it.</span> <span id="s3074">So at that time I was talking with a friend of mine, you know, a neighbor on my street from before the war, and in the same class, graduating from Rumkowski’s high school.</span> <span id="s3075">And she too said, well, we have to think about something.</span> <span id="s3076">So we started to think and work together.</span> <span id="s3077">And what we were observing is that we are going through one village after another with a very narrow village street -- road, really, and that the houses beyond the fence looked empty, and we don’t see any people there.</span> <span id="s3078">You know, one village after another.</span> <span id="s3079">So the conclusion was that they eva -- they evacuated the Germans earlier, wherever.</span> <span id="s3080">So we thought, well, it will be easy enough to get to one of the houses if we think about it.</span> <span id="s3081">And that’s one way, taking a chance.</span> <span id="s3082">If Germans are there, we are dead.</span> <span id="s3083">If we march we are dead, so what do you have to lose?</span> <span id="s3084">So we picked a time where the sentries were not in the -- at the place that we were close by, but you know, it was a very long line of women marching.</span> <span id="s3085">Started with a thousand women and shrinking.</span> <span id="s3086">So the sentries were sort of spaced, so we thought, well, that’s time.</span> <span id="s3087">And we just didn’t have to go far to the right, we were marching that way, houses were here.</span> <span id="s3088">And we opened the door -- you know, the -- undone the door, and we go in.</span> <span id="s3089">And then, on the left hand side was a barn, so we go around the barn and get into the barn and jump into the stack of hay, and stay quietly there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: Inside the hay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: Inside the hay.</span> <span id="s3092">And we heard the march going on, and in not too long time, it was quiet, so they passed.</span> <span id="s3093">So we waited longer, longer, til it cleared, til it was to -- completely quiet and got dark.</span> <span id="s3094">And started to listen what’s going on on this side.</span> <span id="s3095">And we heard voices.</span> <span id="s3096">We heard voices, and we heard a language -- a Slavic language but could not distinguish.</span> <span id="s3097">It was not Polish, but we knew that i-in Germany there were many workers -- farm workers taken from Russia, from Ukrainia, from Belarus.</span> <span id="s3098">So that all could be there.</span> <span id="s3099">So after we got some reasonably time, we said, oh we have to go and see who is there.</span> <span id="s3100">So we went and opened the door, and say hello, and happy to see you, and there were few women and few men sitting around.</span> <span id="s3101">And they don’t look very favorably at us.</span> <span id="s3102">And they say -- they -- they didn’t say anything, they knew who we are.</span> <span id="s3103">Shaved heads, you know, schmates on us.</span> <span id="s3104">So we say, yes we just run away from the -- from the march, and we ask for help, kindly.</span> <span id="s3105">You are Jews.</span> <span id="s3106">Get out of here.</span> <span id="s3107">Okay.</span> <span id="s3108">There was no way to discuss an answer like that coming from the group.</span> <span id="s3109">So we left, and we were in the -- you know, on the outside again, and what to do?</span> <span id="s3110">Well -- and they also said there are Germans in the village, and they will catch you.</span> <span id="s3111">So we thought they may be right, they don’t have to be right.</span> <span id="s3112">Our thinking was clear, you know, in all that, the thinking was clear.</span> <span id="s3113">So we look around, and started to explore slowly.</span> <span id="s3114">And what we see on the street in the middle of the road, many dead German soldiers, okay, with guts spilling out, and -- there was a fight, there was a battle, and left the Germans behind, so they are -- the Russians are probably advanced beyond that village.</span> <span id="s3115">That would be then to the east, and the Russians would be going west.</span> <span id="s3116">So finally we see a house on a little hill, so we go out there.</span> <span id="s3117">We’re looking now for shelter.</span> <span id="s3118">And we see the door is locked, but the key is hanging on the left hi -- side of the door.</span> <span id="s3119">The family left the key so when they come back they open the door again, okay?</span> <span id="s3120">Evacuees.</span> <span id="s3121">So we opened the door and farn -- found a well supplied household, and food and wood and coal, you know, to heat and to eat and get sick from overeating.</span> <span id="s3122">And we made ourself at home there.</span> <span id="s3123">And y -- cured our stomach eventually by, you know, getting to some normal eating.</span> <span id="s3124">And then what do we do?</span> <span id="s3125">It’s quiet, nobody moves.</span> <span id="s3126">The next few days we were explore the village slowly, seeing if somebody is there or not, and we didn’t find anybody so we were just, you know, nursing ourselves.</span> <span id="s3127">It was warm and clean, and clean linen, and clean clothing, it was paradise.</span> <span id="s3128">A German paradise.</span> <span id="s3129">We can laugh now, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3131">A: So we say w-w-what’s happening?</span> <span id="s3132">And one night we hear marchers, you know, thump, thump on the road.</span> <span id="s3133">We could oversee the road, the main road, east west, and we say who -- it’s a army we hear, who can it be?</span> <span id="s3134">Either Germans or Russians.</span> <span id="s3135">We didn’t dare to move, but eventually we say we have to see who it is.</span> <span id="s3136">So we were slowly walking down that hill and looking and trying to find who they are, and what we saw was a lot of white.</span> <span id="s3137">A lot of white horses, white, little horses.</span> <span id="s3138">Soldiers on the horses are marching in white, and white hats and white fur.</span> <span id="s3139">I say, well it looks like Siberia, you know, snow.</span> <span id="s3140">So that -- perhaps they are Russian.</span> <span id="s3141">So we go closer, eventually, and then we had no doubt they are Russians, you know?</span> <span id="s3142">Because -- indeed, you know, the white hats and white thing and white horses.</span> <span id="s3143">Everything to camouflage in Siberia, but that was winter, so that served everywhere in that part of Europe.</span> <span id="s3144">And we see, you know, officers on horses along the marchers and we say, well, let’s take a chance, let’s go and talk to the officers.</span> <span id="s3145">So we approach couple officers and we threw ourself in their arms and say, thank God, you are saving us, you know that?</span> <span id="s3146">Well, they were glad to hear that, you know.</span> <span id="s3147">They -- you know.</span> <span id="s3148">So -- and we felt perfectly safe.</span> <span id="s3149">So we asked, where you going?</span> <span id="s3150">Na Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s3153">So I say, so what will be with us, aren’t you going to stay here?</span> <span id="s3154">And -- we were naïve.</span> <span id="s3155">And then they say no, we have to go -- we go to get Berlin, to free Berlin, and in couple days in a different un -- different units will come here to stay, to -- the occupation army.</span> <span id="s3156">So wait, they will come.</span> <span id="s3157">Well, we were jubilant, you understand, right?</span> <span id="s3158">Our saviors are just here.</span> <span id="s3159">Two, three days pass, and then we see a bunch of young women marching in the direction of our house, because our house was lit.</span> <span id="s3160">And as they come closer, we see those are our friends, those are the girls from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3161">We know them.</span> <span id="s3162">But they look -- they didn’t look the same.</span> <span id="s3163">So they come closer, and we say, what happened to you?</span> <span id="s3164">And they say, well, we were raped by the Russian army.</span> <span id="s3165">And they are coming here, too.</span> <span id="s3166">They were much more east, so you know, the Russians encountered them.</span> <span id="s3167">Wow.</span> <span id="s3168">They didn’t want to stay, they wanted to go forwards, I don’t know -- they had their plans how to go.</span> <span id="s3169">And then is what are we going to do?</span> <span id="s3170">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: Never st -- never stops, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Never stops.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: We were forewarned, that’s true.</span> <span id="s3175">So, in another few days, and the army is marching again, and few officers are coming our way, every one with a bottle of whiskey in their hands.</span> <span id="s3176">And they oh, they hug us, my -- my was lublu.</span> <span id="s3177">We love you.</span> <span id="s3178">Let’s have a party.</span> <span id="s3179">So we -- w-we knew already, but we are forewarned.</span> <span id="s3180">We prepared a bundle to run away beforehand.</span> <span id="s3181">And then we said, you know, come to the living room and sit down and they didn’t need e-encouragement or more invitation, so they came and sat down, and we said, my was lublu, too, but we will join you in few minutes, just be patient.</span> <span id="s3182">And we --</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">Q: Could you speak Russian?</span> <span id="s3184">Some Russian, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: You could -- few words in Polish, you know, so y-you could make yourself understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: So we go and grab our bundles and go the back door to the road.</span> <span id="s3188">And the Russians are marching, you know, those were hu-humangous armies, you know?</span> <span id="s3189">They are marching and we ask them, where is your headquarters?</span> <span id="s3190">So they told us, more east -- no, more west, and they were going, too.</span> <span id="s3191">As you know they going now Berlin.</span> <span id="s3192">So we [indecipherable] -- no, actually they said, they -- the headquarters were most -- more east from they were coming.</span> <span id="s3193">So they go west, we go east, and after awhile, we -- we chance upon the -- a small house that wa -- you know, a -- a cottage, really, German cottage, and the headquarters.</span> <span id="s3194">And we ask to be led to the chief, to the commander, and we tell the commander the story, where we from, and that we want -- we are on our way back home to Poland, Lódz, and would he -- and the danger of his soldiers, being raped, etcetera, would he help us to get -- get back home?</span> <span id="s3195">And he says yes, we’ll help you.</span> <span id="s3196">And he says go to the kitchen, th-there are our women working, you join them, and -- and you can stay here.</span> <span id="s3197">So another chapter started.</span> <span id="s3198">We were with the girls, the Russian girls in the kitchen, peeling potatoes, doing other things, and was fun.</span> <span id="s3199">They are -- they were very friendly, they were singing all the time.</span> <span id="s3200">And that part was fine.</span> <span id="s3201">And we pel -- felt pretty safe.</span> <span id="s3202">We slept -- so during the day we were in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s3203">At night -- it was the front line.</span> <span id="s3204">From there, soldiers were going to the front for the day, at night they came back to sleep.</span> <span id="s3205">They were eating dinner in the dining room, and then they were sleeping on the floor, and we were sleek -- sleeping on the tables in the dining room.</span> <span id="s3206">And it was pretty safe.</span> <span id="s3207">It was -- it was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">Q: It’s safer than being in the hay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">A: Much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">Q: Much safer.</span> <span id="s3211">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Beginning Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3214">Q: Paula, would you have considered that liberation?</span> <span id="s3215">When you were with these -- the Russians, and you’re sleeping on the tables, and the Russian soldiers are sleeping on the floor, I mean, were you then free?</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">A: We are on the way home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">Q: On the way home.</span> <span id="s3218">So you’re going east.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3220">Q: You’re going towards Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: Towards Lódz.</span> <span id="s3222">W -- our road to -- was to go west.</span></p> <p><span id="s3223">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">A: No, east.</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">Q: East.</span></p> <p><span id="s3226">A: East, yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3227">Q: But are you -- do you consider yourself liberated from the Germans cause there are no Germans any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3229">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3231">Q: So is there a -- a moment of -- you know, liberation is a very funny word, and I never un -- I never know when -- is there really a moment when you feel free?</span> <span id="s3232">It doesn’t s -- it seems a little impossible.</span> <span id="s3233">It seems as if it’s a -- a process as opposed to a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3234">A: I think it’s a process, and we were on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3235">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3236">A: And don’t forget, we were on the front.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3238">A: Right?</span> <span id="s3239">The Russians were fighting to go -- they were going west, and they were fighting their way -- na Berlin, the goal was Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: They were -- they were far from Berlin still.</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s3243">Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: So -- and there was no way of knowing if the Germans won’t get back.</span> <span id="s3245">You know, they could conquer -- a-and that what happened in that war.</span> <span id="s3246">They were -- you know, they were not giving up easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s3247">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: Was the western armies or -- or the Russian armies.</span> <span id="s3249">So we -- we knew that there is a big strength that -- of -- of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s3250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: -- Germans.</span> <span id="s3252">But they were, you know, the Russians were fight it -- fighting.</span> <span id="s3253">And listening to their mood -- na Berlin and, the army’s going na Berlin, ah, we are fighting with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">A: You know?</span> <span id="s3256">It’s happening.</span> <span id="s3257">It’s a turnaround.</span> <span id="s3258">So we were just jubilous together with the -- with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3260">A: On the other hand, we knew that every morning troops were going out to the front that was not far away.</span> <span id="s3261">We -- we heard fightings, you know the shelling of each other, all day, and then the soldiers came dead me -- you know, tired, home to the base, which was a small house, and they were, you know, eating dinner, and -- and then conking out on the floor, going to sleep.</span> <span id="s3262">So it was in the center of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3264">What -- how was your being Jewish treated?</span> <span id="s3265">Did they care?</span> <span id="s3266">Were they sympathetic, were they -- they di -- or what --</span></p> <p><span id="s3267">A: No, we were so happy, so when we were sitting with the soldiers and eating dinner, they ask us about -- and a -- as I tol -- told you, between Polish and Russian we could understand each other, with difficulties, but we could make ourself understood, and they ask about us, where we come from, who we are.</span> <span id="s3268">So we were telling we are Jewish, we come from Auschwitz, and we are ready to go home, thank you.</span> <span id="s3269">And then one day, after a few days of such liberal talks, two officers approached us, me and Vonda, and they introduced themselves, and they say, we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3270">And we -- we -- we hear what you saying to the Russian soldiers and please stop telling them that you are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3271">They don’t know we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3272">They hate Jews.</span> <span id="s3273">So don’t tell them who you are.</span> <span id="s3274">We will help you.</span> <span id="s3275">Wow, that was a slap in the face.</span> <span id="s3276">You know, to the liberators we cannot say we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s3277">But those were astute officers, and they were Jews, and they -- we sensed that they know very well what they are talking about.</span> <span id="s3278">And we were not surprised then.</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">A: So what’s new?</span></p> <p><span id="s3281">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3282">It’s the same story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3283">A: You know?</span> <span id="s3284">Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">Q: Same story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">A: Same story.</span> <span id="s3287">So that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">Q: So no more talk about who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s3289">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: And how did they help you, these officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: Oh, they were just keeping an eye on us for safety and so on.</span> <span id="s3292">So just was good to know that we have some comrades here that know what’s cooking, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3294">A: -- share with us, so that was a good feeling.</span> <span id="s3295">Friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s3296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3297">A: This kind of a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3298">Q: So did you stay with that group for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">A: We stay there for awhile, and they are promising us that they -- they are working on set -- on putting a train together that will go from that point to south Poland.</span> <span id="s3300">And when the train is ready, we are free to go.</span> <span id="s3301">And it did not take very long.</span> <span id="s3302">They told us, and they drove us to the station when the train was set.</span> <span id="s3303">And we took a train and arrived in Lódz one day.</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">Q: And you went back to Lódz because you thought what?</span> <span id="s3305">You thought your father would come?</span> <span id="s3306">Did you think anyone would be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3307">A: We didn’t think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">Q: You didn't think.</span></p> <p><span id="s3309">A: We were just wanting to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3310">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">A: Knowing that there’s nobody, you know.</span> <span id="s3312">I didn’t have illusion that Mother will be there, or Father, or my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3314">A: But that’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">A: That’s all I knew about home.</span> <span id="s3317">My city.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">Q: And when you got there, a lot of survivors had come back, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">A: Not a lot, but some.</span></p> <p><span id="s3320">Q: But survivors from other circumstances came, not just from Lódz.</span> <span id="s3321">Am I correct, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: Well, first of all, there were the remnants of Jews in Lódz that stayed, you know, because of they were needed to clean up --</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: -- the -- the -- the quarter, and they were coming out of their holes now, you know, openly.</span> <span id="s3325">So they were there, and they were pre -- in pretty good shape, I have to tell you know, you know?</span> <span id="s3326">They probably -- they could not stop thanking God for what happened, that they were allowed -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">A: -- that their things were so different from others.</span> <span id="s3329">There were people that coming from the camps, very few.</span> <span id="s3330">And for a long time, weeks, we sort of saw that that’s it, nobody else survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">Q: Ah, out of the whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3333">Q: -- Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">A: That -- that that is -- that is all.</span> <span id="s3335">So we tried to -- to live.</span> <span id="s3336">We got assigned a apartment, and that was an apartment that Germans were living in and then they evacuated, they -- they went west, to Germany.</span> <span id="s3337">So we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s3338">We had no job, there were no jobs to be had, we had no money.</span> <span id="s3339">The Jewish Committee that was trying to form itself was very weak and inefficient.</span> <span id="s3340">And there was not much help that they could give us, me, my friend and some others.</span> <span id="s3341">So life was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s3342">And what do we do?</span> <span id="s3343">We wanted to enroll at school, at the university.</span> <span id="s3344">Lódz did not have a university before the war.</span> <span id="s3345">It was opening, and they had a medical faculty.</span> <span id="s3346">So that was not possible to get to that, so I enrolled in natural sciences, and tried to go to school, which was very hard to do, you know, we were not there, mentally.</span> <span id="s3347">So life was hard and there was a question how do we survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">Q: And you were together with your friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3350">Q: Wanda -- Vonda?</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">A: Vonda.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: Wanda?</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3354">How do we survive?</span> <span id="s3355">Then there were the opportunities to make sa -- a living, where for men, following, you know, after a war, and the war was not finish really, but Russians were in Lódz so it was a city occupied.</span> <span id="s3356">Usually it is -- people live from black market, you know, exchanging -- exchanging dollars, zlotys and so on.</span> <span id="s3357">And a big thing was ba -- bringing food stuff to the west, to the German border, and exchanging it for other things like linen and so on, and then coming to Poland and se-selling linen for money and living on that.</span> <span id="s3358">The only thing that there was a different between a -- men and women, men were very comfortable doing it.</span> <span id="s3359">As a woman you had to be prepared to get raped on the way.</span> <span id="s3360">That was the -- the law of post-war without org -- or-order, without police, without anything.</span> <span id="s3361">You know, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">Q: Rape w -- rape was common?</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3364">You had to count on that.</span> <span id="s3365">And some women didn’t mind, or got used to that, and we didn't want to do that, so we were like that.</span> <span id="s3366">Then comes along a friend of Vonda’s, whom she knew from ghetto.</span> <span id="s3367">And she introduced me to him, and that was my future husband.</span> <span id="s3368">And pe -- ex-husband.</span> <span id="s3369">And it was a typical story of a woman that cannot support herself, poor thing, so she has to have a man who does.</span> <span id="s3370">Is not rich, but he came also, you know, from Auschwitz, but he went to his little town close to Lódz, and his parents had a little factory of producing oil from grain.</span> <span id="s3371">And he started this factory and he was making money.</span> <span id="s3372">Not much, but enough to be very, effusively generous with us, helping us with bread and butter.</span> <span id="s3373">And from little to little, you know, I was caught in that gratefulness.</span> <span id="s3374">Had sex, and once I had sex, my Mama told me, that’s your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">A: You marry him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">Q: Period.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">A: My mother was dead, but that I imagined what Mother would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">Q: She never said that to you, but you imagined --</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">A: You had to be a virgin --</span></p> <p><span id="s3381">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">A: -- when you married.</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3384">A: And the Jewish law was when you marry -- when you have sex, you -- you are married, if you didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">Q: It’s not a great -- no, I didn’t know this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">A: I’m telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3387">Q: It’s a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3388">A: I wish I would be so smart.</span> <span id="s3389">So yeah, that was a terrible thing, because from the day one, I didn’t think he’s a -- you know, he is a partner for me.</span> <span id="s3390">But I was grateful, that’s true and that’s fine.</span> <span id="s3391">But wi -- I was [indecipherable] myself, feeling obliged by Jewish law to be his partner.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">Q: Were you attracted to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3393">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3394">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">A: But it was a question of loneliness, of no food, of having sex.</span> <span id="s3396">And I was not a femist -- feminist then, free of my mother’s beliefs about sex and marriage go together like a dove and carriage, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3398">Yeah.</span> <span id="s3399">You need to go farther, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">A: That’s right, and leave that, and go on.</span> <span id="s3401">That what I should have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">Q: What was he like?</span> <span id="s3403">When you say you -- you knew instinct -- that he really wasn’t going to be a partner, so was he not an intellectual, was he not a sensitive --</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A: Totally unintellectually.</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3406">A: Totally insensitive.</span> <span id="s3407">Totally -- good heart he had, you know, in part, you know, to help Vonda and me, and that was of his good heart.</span> <span id="s3408">He hel -- opened his house in that little town to some relatives, they were coming also, from everywhere.</span> <span id="s3409">And feeding them, and giving them sleep, etcetera, so he was good in that way, and warm.</span> <span id="s3410">But nothing else.</span> <span id="s3411">Not a man to -- man to talk with, to discuss things, and y-you know, that’s -- that was a big miss, and I was just poor little girl needing somebody to take care of her.</span> <span id="s3412">I was not raised for that, but that’s how it felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">Q: Did -- did Vonda say to you, what are you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">A: Vonda was married in ghetto to a guy, and he came back from war --</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3416">A: -- at that same time, so she was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: She was set.</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: She was set.</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">Q: She --</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: She told me not to marry him, but I was not ready to listen.</span> <span id="s3421">I knew myself that [indecipherable] don’t, but I did anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">A: [indecipherable] of being alone, lonely, unhappy, abandoned by the world, by everybody.</span> <span id="s3424">Poor thing.</span> <span id="s3425">And he gives me shelter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">Q: Sure, makes sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">Q: Probably happened a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3429">A: But I didn’t have to pay the price for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3430">Q: Well, no, I guess --</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">A: I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3432">But I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3433">Q: But you did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3434">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: But you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3436">Or you didn’t know how not to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">A: I didn’t know how not to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">Q: And I’m sure this is true, this is a very common kind of story, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">A: Aprow -- yes.</span> <span id="s3440">It is the sort of morality that enslaved women, that their sexuality is not theirs, but a man’s, and they have no say over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3442">A: It’s very hard to get away from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3444">A: We’re still not, as women, out of the woods, to comfortly -- comfortably to distinguish a relationship, sexuality, laws, etcetera.</span> <span id="s3445">Men have no problem.</span> <span id="s3446">Men were doing it all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">Q: Including during your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">A: Including during war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">Q: It’s not a new thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3450">A: Not a new thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3452">A: And we have a long way to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3454">How long did you stay in Poland together?</span> <span id="s3455">You -- so you -- when did you get married, ’46, ’47?</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">A: ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3457">Q: ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s3458">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">Q: So, very soon after you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3460">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">Q: Are you going to school when you got married?</span> <span id="s3462">Cause you started school before?</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">A: No, I enrolled in school before I was married, but then -- what happened then too, as I told you, I intended to stend -- stay in Poland because I thought that’s my country, and you have no right to kick me out, German or Pole -- or the Polacks.</span> <span id="s3464">But what started then, if you don’t know, pogroms started in Poland, around in small towns, in Lódz Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s3465">There were famous killing in southern Poland, Kielce, where Jews were killed for nothing.</span> <span id="s3466">And it was frightful.</span> <span id="s3467">You know, it was just a second ch-chapter of killing Jews, but now from Polacks, which was not a big surprise.</span> <span id="s3468">But after that war?</span> <span id="s3469">So there was a big exodus from Poland by Jews to Germany.</span> <span id="s3470">Why Germany?</span> <span id="s3471">Because Germany was divided and occupied, you know, by the western powers and by Russia.</span> <span id="s3472">And that was Germany, particularly American occupation that we were aiming for.</span> <span id="s3473">Was a window out of Europe, and that was my resolve.</span> <span id="s3474">I have enough of that continent, I’m getting out.</span> <span id="s3475">So that was -- we went to Germany, smuggled, of course, you know, through the border.</span> <span id="s3476">It was a big exodus, many people left.</span> <span id="s3477">But in Germany, what happened?</span> <span id="s3478">The big powers organized DP camps, displaced people camps, in which they put Jews, and Jews were in those camps for five, six years, cause nobody wanted to give them a visa, okay?</span> <span id="s3479">So that was another eye opener, you know, where you going?</span> <span id="s3480">So I enrolled in school, the university opened in Frankfurt [indecipherable] in medical faculty, and I enrolled, and I could do it because German government paid for tuition, it was the beginning of reparations for -- you know, for Jews after the war.</span> <span id="s3481">It took me five years, I started in Lódz, five years to get my diploma, and the visa cames at that time too.</span> <span id="s3482">So I was ready to go with my M.D. title, to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3483">Q: And your husb -- your husband, was he shocked that you were going to medical school?</span> <span id="s3484">I mean, this was not ordinarily in the 40’s to -- for a woman -- maybe it was in Europe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3485">Certainly wasn’t here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">A: In Europe this was much more acceptable.</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">A: And in that way I should say I admired him.</span> <span id="s3489">He let me do what I wanted.</span> <span id="s3490">He let me work, make money and he took the money and gambled it away.</span> <span id="s3491">He was a gambler.</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3493">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3494">So I was grateful.</span> <span id="s3495">I could work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">Q: You were gra -- but you couldn’t have your own money.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">A: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">Q: So, you graduated with a medical degree in what?</span> <span id="s3499">What sort of medical doctor were you at that time, after five years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">A: Medical, general medical.</span></p> <p><span id="s3501">Q: Just general med-medical degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">Q: So then, you came to this country in ’51?</span></p> <p><span id="s3504">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3505">And hi -- I had a son two years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s3506">Q: So while you were finishing medical school, you had a son?</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">A: Right, David.</span></p> <p><span id="s3508">Q: Wow, that’s a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">A: Yes, I always did a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">Q: You always did a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3511">A: Don’t you get the feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s3512">Q: I get the feeling, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3513">A: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s3514">I was capable, and I liked doing a lot.</span> <span id="s3515">You know, I -- I had the energy to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s3516">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">A: -- and enjoying it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3518">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3519">And did your husband help?</span> <span id="s3520">Was he good with David?</span></p> <p><span id="s3521">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3522">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3523">But I -- I was so grateful to him that he -- you know, most husband didn’t like their wives to work or make money, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3524">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3525">A: Stay home, you know, that was the common cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3526">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3527">A: And he was different, he let me -- he helped me studying, he took care of David.</span> <span id="s3528">You know, i-it was so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s3529">Q: Well, you were also a way for him to have money so he could gamble, given what you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">A: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3531">Q: Yes, hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3532">A: He trained me so he can [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3533">Q: Where did you go in the United States when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">A: Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s3535">Q: Why Cincinnati?</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">A: Tell you why.</span> <span id="s3537">The idea was, when the visa finally came, through the Jewish institution HIAS, and you know, then there was a question where do I go.</span> <span id="s3538">So they assigned you where to go.</span> <span id="s3539">So my first assignment was Seattle, Washington.</span> <span id="s3540">You -- you won’t think I am so smart any more after I tell you that story.</span> <span id="s3541">What do I know about Seattle, Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s3542">Q: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3543">A: I had nobody to talk to that knew anything.</span> <span id="s3544">So I took out the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s3545">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">A: And I look, America, Seattle, ocean, Russia.</span> <span id="s3547">I want you to know, when we left Europe, since the end of the war til we left, we lived in a constant fear that the Russia is going to overrun Europe, that they are not finished.</span> <span id="s3548">So there was always a fear that Russia will overrun.</span> <span id="s3549">I was infected by that, too, stupidly.</span> <span id="s3550">So there is Russia, and here is Seattle, a inch on the map.</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">Q: So you really got afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3553">Three -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s3554">Q: It’s too close.</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">A: Next door.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">A: I said, I don’t want to go there.</span> <span id="s3558">Would you change, kindly.</span> <span id="s3559">They changed.</span> <span id="s3560">Next assignment came, El Paso, Texas.</span> <span id="s3561">I consult the map again.</span> <span id="s3562">And I look at the map and I see El Paso.</span> <span id="s3563">It’s the end of the States.</span> <span id="s3564">Mexico.</span> <span id="s3565">Cowboy coun -- Texas.</span> <span id="s3566">It’s cowboy country.</span> <span id="s3567">And beforehand I told the guys at HIAS, one thing I won’t go to is New York or Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3568">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s3569">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3570">Cause that’s Al Capone country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3571">Q: Both is Al Capone country?</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">A: New York had something else, but you know, those are -- you know, and I don’t want to be there.</span> <span id="s3573">I just want you to tell -- to know.</span> <span id="s3574">Before the war, the idea of going to America was a horrible idea for most Jews.</span> <span id="s3575">Only deserted of Russian army --</span></p> <p><span id="s3576">Q: Went to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3577">A: -- would go, or adventurers, or gamblers were going to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s3578">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">A: A nice girl like I would not go to America.</span> <span id="s3580">So New York, and Chicago were the biggest centers of that.</span> <span id="s3581">Well, anyway, El Paso I told them, that’s cowboy country, and I-I don’t know about that.</span> <span id="s3582">At that time friends of mine were already in Cincinnati, you know, with the same past history.</span> <span id="s3583">So we corresponded, and we -- I told them the story, and they said, why don’t you come to Cincinnati?</span> <span id="s3584">I said, how can I come to Cincinnati, I am dependent on HIAS and all that.</span> <span id="s3585">And they se -- nevermind, they will ship you to -- to New Orleans from -- from Hamburg, and when you are in New Orleans, we will call the leaders there, and they will ship you to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s3586">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s3587">We were entering New Orleans, and then we correspond -- I mean, there were telephones and so on, and they put us on a train from New Orleans to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s3588">Q: And did you have a job in a hospital, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">A: Oh, well, no.</span> <span id="s3590">We were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s3591">Q: You were just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">A: We were just there, in Cincinnati, no job.</span> <span id="s3593">And he -- he got a job, finally.</span> <span id="s3594">And you know the institutions, Jewish institution were helpful in the beginning, supportive, til he was making money.</span> <span id="s3595">And that’s how we start our life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3596">Q: So when did you start your practice?</span> <span id="s3597">A: I had to do my state board.</span></p> <p><span id="s3598">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3599">Did you speak English?</span> <span id="s3600">I just thought of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">Q: Of course you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">A: But I took one year English in school, as an additional foreign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: When?</span> <span id="s3605">Way back?</span></p> <p><span id="s3606">A: In high school, way back.</span> <span id="s3607">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3608">Q: And that was enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">A: Then I learned, I worked and I learned.</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">Q: And the medical terms, of course, are the same.</span> <span id="s3611">Or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">A: Different language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3613">Q: Different la --</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">A: Or the -- the Latin was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">Q: Latin’s the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3618">A: But different language.</span></p> <p><span id="s3619">Q: So when did you pass your boards?</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">A: I think ’55.</span> <span id="s3621">We came in ’51, I did my internship and residency in -- in medicine.</span> <span id="s3622">I could not take the board before because they had a problem with recognizing certain schools in Germany as worthy of -- you know, to acknowledge the graduation.</span> <span id="s3623">So it took them few years, and finally I got the news that your school is recognized.</span> <span id="s3624">So I took the state board, and then I was a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s3625">Q: Then you were a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3627">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s3628">End of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3629">Beginning Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s3630">Q: Did you start working as a doctor right after you passed your boards in ’55?</span></p> <p><span id="s3631">A: I opened my practice in ’57.</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">Q: And this was a family pract -- this was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s3633">A: Family medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3634">Q: Family medicine.</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">Q: So when did you decide to be -- to do psychiatry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">A: I was about, you know, close to 15 years in practice, in family practice.</span> <span id="s3638">And then I realized that I -- you know, I had a lot -- my practice was mainly women -- women and children, very few men.</span> <span id="s3639">Family, so the husband would come and so on, but mainly women.</span> <span id="s3640">And I was taken aback by observing how many women suffered from depression, deep depression.</span> <span id="s3641">And that was a well-to-do suburb of Cincinnati, where families were ma -- mainly coming to work with Cincinnati with General Motors, Ford company, PNG.</span> <span id="s3642">So they were -- the husband were -- had good jobs.</span> <span id="s3643">The wives were taking care of the house and children, and I would see them in my office, and they would come with all kinds of physical symptoms.</span> <span id="s3644">And we did the work and nothing showed.</span> <span id="s3645">So I would have to tell them that I could not find anything else, so I don’t know why you -- why you hurt here and there.</span> <span id="s3646">And try to sort of enlarge the questioning, what and how.</span> <span id="s3647">I was doing a lot of house calls, not because I was so generous, but maybe I wanted -- I was used to house calls back home.</span> <span id="s3648">But I wanted to get to know the country I am living in, and that was a very good way to do it, to see people’s homes, and how they lived.</span> <span id="s3649">So I know the ones -- one thing I knew that was very stressful, and that was the big companies were promoting people, but you paid a price for it.</span> <span id="s3650">The promotion would come and you had to move to another part of the country.</span> <span id="s3651">If you get the promotion in Cincinnati, you would be sent to the west coast, and from the west coast you would be sent to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s3652">So the family was always in a turmoil, having to live with the idea that every two years you have to move, if you want to move up the ladder.</span> <span id="s3653">And it was the wife that had to put in roots quickly, school, church, neighborhood.</span> <span id="s3654">I knew that that was a chore, but they were always sen -- saying that they are treated well -- they are treated well.</span> <span id="s3655">The husband really didn’t move.</span> <span id="s3656">He was still in the circles of national commerce, or productivity.</span> <span id="s3657">But the wife had to change totally her surrounding, and make it easy for the husband.</span> <span id="s3658">So I know -- knew that, but beyond that I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s3659">And I had friends, they were either in training of psychiatry, or psychiatrists, and they told me about it, and what -- and I didn’t know anything about Freudian psychiatry in Germany.</span> <span id="s3660">We were learning psychiatry, you know, but not about Freud.</span> <span id="s3661">So, you know, the dynamic psychiatry, it was fresh to me, and it was exciting, so I said, I ka -- I have to do it.</span> <span id="s3662">That’s -- I went into training.</span></p> <p><span id="s3663">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">A: And that was very exciting, and that was good.</span> <span id="s3665">Listen, I have to tell you part of my story that I omitted, and I ashamed of that.</span> <span id="s3666">But it is very hard.</span> <span id="s3667">And that -- I told you I had another son, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3668">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3669">A: I was -- when I came to America, I was pregnant -- you know, David was two years old and I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s3670">And then Charlie was born in ’51, still the same year we came.</span> <span id="s3671">And he was a lovely child, so I had two children, right, and fine.</span> <span id="s3672">He developed -- what can I say?</span> <span id="s3673">He developed psychological problems, was in therapy.</span> <span id="s3674">We did not recognize the depth of his depression.</span> <span id="s3675">Eventually he committed suicide.</span> <span id="s3676">He was 21.</span> <span id="s3677">So that is a thing I don’t like to talk about.</span> <span id="s3678">You understand why.</span> <span id="s3679">Big pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3681">Is that also one of the reasons why you d -- wanted to go into psychotherapy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">Q: It was quite separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">Q: Course it’s painful, it’s horrible.</span> <span id="s3688">And David is two years older?</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">A: Two and a half years older, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">Q: Should I ask you something?</span> <span id="s3691">I don’t -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: Yes, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s3693">Q: Did y -- did you understand und -- at any point before he died, how deep the depression was?</span> <span id="s3694">How -- how -- how much in pain he was, or was that too hard to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s3695">A: I knew some, but obviously I did not understand how deep it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3696">Q: Mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3697">A: And how dangerous it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">A: -- to his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3700">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3701">Did David?</span> <span id="s3702">His so -- his brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3703">A: Neither.</span></p> <p><span id="s3704">Q: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s3705">A: No.</span> <span id="s3706">He was in therapy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3708">A: But I don’t think the psychiatrist understood it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3709">Q: So it seems as if no one could have -- I mean, there were no -- there were not enough signs for someone -- and it’s not clear that one can do anything --</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">Q: -- under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s3712">And why did you say you were ashamed?</span> <span id="s3713">You were ashamed because you didn’t say it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3715">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">A: If -- to -- as if to deny his existence, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3717">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">A: Which I don’t want to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s3719">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">A: -- but it is too hard to talk about it, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">Q: And I must admit, I was hesitating to ask you.</span> <span id="s3722">I knew.</span> <span id="s3723">I didn’t know this -- I didn’t know any part of the story, but I was hesitating.</span> <span id="s3724">So it’s -- it’s very tough.</span> <span id="s3725">When were you divorced?</span></p> <p><span id="s3726">A: ’73.</span> <span id="s3727">Charlie died in ’73, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3728">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s3729">Wow.</span> <span id="s3730">So that was quite a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s3731">A: You can say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3732">Q: I don’t know, your life has these arcs of so many difficulties, and so -- and at the same time, accomplishments.</span> <span id="s3733">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s3734">A: I don’t know, I don’t treat it as accomplishment.</span> <span id="s3735">It was work that I had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3736">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3737">A: Work I had to do to survive the war in the ghetto, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3738">You know, to bear witness, which I am doing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3739">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3740">A: Just to tell the story that it -- it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3741">Q: And when did you start talking about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s3742">Did you talk with your sons?</span> <span id="s3743">I know you couldn’t talk with your husband, he -- he would not speak about any of his experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s3744">A: With my sons I talked, but very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s3745">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3746">A: Facts, giving facts.</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: But they didn’t know your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3749">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3750">A: Certainly not in details how we talk now.</span> <span id="s3751">So the silence was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3752">Q: Did you want to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s3753">A: I could not speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3754">Q: You couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3755">A: I could not speak.</span> <span id="s3756">I could tell them some, but then I -- I -- I couldn’t go any farther.</span> <span id="s3757">And people didn’t want to listen --</span></p> <p><span id="s3758">Q: I was going to ask, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">A: -- including my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3761">A: So that was a sort of silence over the whole experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3762">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3763">A: Individually, and as a Jewish experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">Q: So, the people that you met in Cincinnati didn’t say what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3765">A: There was a group of people, of Jews, that came here at the same time, about the same time, with similar experiences.</span> <span id="s3766">And I was involved with that group.</span> <span id="s3767">One was the friend that, you know, asked me to come, you know, from se -- from New Orleans here.</span> <span id="s3768">Where it was by and large not a comfortable group, the same way as my relationship with my husband was not because he was not on my level, and we had very little in common in communicating and talking about things, and -- but that group was the same cut of people.</span> <span id="s3769">We were celebrating holidays together, we had parties like, you know, for holidays.</span> <span id="s3770">The advantage of being part of the group was one.</span> <span id="s3771">We knew about our experiences, and we didn’t have to talk about it, where we from.</span> <span id="s3772">We all had the same experience, and i-it was just being together, and not to have -- to explain yourself, or listen to explanation.</span></p> <p><span id="s3773">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3774">A: But then, at the same time that I was contemplating moving away from my husband, my relationship with that group also broke off.</span> <span id="s3775">And it was funny and not funny how it did.</span> <span id="s3776">You see, that group was strictly Polish Jews of tradition and Jewishness, and patriarchy, and the woman is a woman and I am the man.</span> <span id="s3777">You know, in Jewish law, a woman cannot divorce a husband.</span> <span id="s3778">The husband always can divorce the woman, to the degree that if there is not a rabbi, he can tell the woman, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you, and that e-equals divorce, when you tell it to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s3779">But a woman cannot divorce a man.</span> <span id="s3780">I didn’t un-understand that for a long time, but then, after I divorced my husband, that wo -- group turned against me, they stopped talking to me.</span> <span id="s3781">And I didn’t understand why til I became c -- became clear to me that I did do the unspeakable, I divorced a man.</span> <span id="s3782">A woman divorced a man.</span> <span id="s3783">So I was not sorry about breaking off the relationship, but what made me very angry was realized why it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3785">So is the -- the -- the next -- the next person with whom you actually talk about your experiences Lanzmann?</span> <span id="s3786">Because that’s in the next couple of years, right?</span> <span id="s3787">Or is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3788">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">Q: And once you do that, once you give that interview, do you decide, okay, now I don’t have to talk about it again?</span> <span id="s3790">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">A: I don’t know, but in the time since my divorce and all that, I was more free to talk with my friends, many of whom were Gentiles, women we got sort of all together with a group of women that we were sort of compatible, and they are all Ge-Gentiles.</span> <span id="s3792">And I was free to talk with them about it, or even with other -- other Jews.</span> <span id="s3793">But how it happened really, maybe the impetus was the interview with Lanzmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s3794">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s3795">Have you spoken to students, or is this all very private?</span> <span id="s3796">Or synagogue groups, or church groups, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3797">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">Q: No, no public --</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">A: -- I never wanted to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3800">Q: -- no.</span> <span id="s3801">You didn’t want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3802">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3803">I did once in a school, you know, in a public school to a group, to a class, talked about it, and that was very unsatisfactory.</span> <span id="s3804">I didn't enjoy it, it was just not my --</span></p> <p><span id="s3805">Q: It wasn’t your cup of tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3806">A: Ye -- right.</span> <span id="s3807">So I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">Q: Do -- have people in the last 10 years, or m-maybe since the Lanzmann film, do they, when they meet you say -- ask you more questions?</span> <span id="s3809">They don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">Q: I guess I’m surprised at that.</span> <span id="s3812">In the last 10 years?</span> <span id="s3813">Not --</span></p> <p><span id="s3814">A: Be-Because they saw the -- the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">Q: Because they saw the film, or in the last 10 years, I mean, the Holocaust Museum in Washington opened, and then there was “Schindler’s List” and there seems to be more discussion about survivors, so I thought perhaps there was more discussion with you as well?</span> <span id="s3816">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">Q: But you s -- you said you -- when you were in the ghetto, that you felt you needed to bear witness, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">Q: So how were you going to do that?</span> <span id="s3821">I mean, how did you, in your own head, think about ho -- the Lanzmann was accidental, actually --</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">Q: -- if you hadn’t gone up to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3824">A: I didn’t have it formulated either in the ghetto, or -- or in Auschwitz to bear witness.</span> <span id="s3825">But thought was, you have -- you have to live through, you have to survive, be able to talk about the pa -- because people won’t believe if you don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">A: They won’t believe those stories.</span> <span id="s3828">So somebody has to tell how it was.</span> <span id="s3829">And I didn’t have any concrete things to talk or write about it.</span> <span id="s3830">But just to be alive, and show them you didn’t -- you know, I was not killed, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3831">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">A: -- almost done away with, but I am alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3834">A: And that really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3835">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3836">A: It was sort of more abstract by -- that was one way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3837">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3838">A: To survive to tell the story.</span> <span id="s3839">But very -- in a abstract way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">Q: So do you talk more with David now, or his seeing the Lanzmann interview ge -- it -- meant he didn’t have to ask you so many questions because you said so much in that interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">A: It’s not that he asked questions, but he -- we watched it together, and he told me how much he appreciate that, that we did it, and that I have done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">A: So we had a more unspoken feelings --</span></p> <p><span id="s3844">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">A: -- of understanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3847">A: Which is invaluable, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s3848">Q: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s3849">Well, I have to say that the first time I spoke with you, you said to me, absolutely not, you’re not going to do an interview.</span> <span id="s3850">And finally the second time you said yes.</span> <span id="s3851">So I just want to tell you how m -- I’m really, terribly grateful that you said yes, and it’s been more than a pleasure for me to be with you today.</span></p> <p><span id="s3852">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s3853">And it’s very important that we did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">A: I feel that’s another step to sort of clear my heart and clear my brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s3856">Q: Does it do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3857">A: I thinks so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s3859">I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3860">A: And also another thing.</span> <span id="s3861">I think I told that to Raye, maybe to you, that the trip to Poland, you know, to Lódz, the 60th anniversary that I participate in, shook me very much, to the degree that I was sorry I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">A: It really unsettled me unbelievably.</span> <span id="s3864">And I don’t have really all answers to that.</span> <span id="s3865">One thing was that it was the feeling like bearing witness to be there, established the fact that it really happened to me and to my family and to my people.</span> <span id="s3866">It’s sort of I put it to rest through the years, and being there at the anniversary --</span></p> <p><span id="s3867">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3868">A: -- it brought it, you know, physically --</span></p> <p><span id="s3869">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3870">A: -- that it really did happen.</span> <span id="s3871">And that was such a -- a reaction, physically and mentally my whole body and -- was totally unsettled for months now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3872">Q: This was 2005 in the summer, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3873">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3874">Q: 2005, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3875">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3876">Q: -- so it was recent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3877">A: August.</span></p> <p><span id="s3878">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">A: Yes, 60th anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3880">Q: And it -- you’re still unsettled from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3881">A: I’m still unsettled from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3882">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s3883">So you’ve clashed with your -- the self that put it behind, and then it got brought forward, it -- and of course it’s physical because you’re in the very place that you lived as a child, and lived under this horrible threat.</span> <span id="s3884">So I guess you won’t go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">A: I done my duty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3889">A: I don’t know if duty, but it is like going to a grave, you know?</span> <span id="s3890">To a grave of my previous life.</span> <span id="s3891">Family and my own life.</span> <span id="s3892">Ya -- 60th anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s3893">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3894">A: And of course, what else can you expect but a good dose of mourning.</span> <span id="s3895">That’s how I explained my -- to myself, what I was going through since August [indecipherable] of -- you know, of this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s3896">Q: Do you think you never had time to mourn before?</span> <span id="s3897">That you were so busy and so moving towards your future that you didn’t -- you couldn’t mourn?</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">A: You’re right.</span> <span id="s3899">It was a unfinished mourning.</span> <span id="s3900">Because you had -- and probably for all of u --</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3902">A: -- I mean, all survivors, you had to live against your wish to be dead --</span></p> <p><span id="s3903">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">A: -- with your -- with your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">A: To join, you know, the family that was dead.</span> <span id="s3907">So it took all energy to stay alive, and not to join them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3908">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3909">And now you were back.</span> <span id="s3910">Did you find your grandmother’s grave?</span> <span id="s3911">Did you even look?</span> <span id="s3912">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">A: I asked, there was no -- you know, the cemetery supervision was in total disarray.</span> <span id="s3914">They couldn’t find graves, so I gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3915">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3916">A: But I tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s3917">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3918">Well, I hope the mourning period doesn’t last.</span> <span id="s3919">That appear at so -- at some point it must stop, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s3920">A: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3921">Q: I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">A: And I think you know the interview with Lanzmann, and with you now, and talk with Raye has a lot to do with it.</span> <span id="s3923">To bring that feeling, or maybe of being free of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3924">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3925">A: Of the mourning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3926">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3927">A: I don’t know, but what can you do?</span> <span id="s3928">How did you find that subject with other survivors when you talked with --</span></p> <p><span id="s3929">Q: I don’t think they’ve talked about this in quite the same -- in quite the same way.</span> <span id="s3930">So I don’t -- I -- I don’t know how to s -- I don’t know how to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3931">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">Q: And I haven’t met anyone who went back to that anniversary and wondered.</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3934">Q: Maybe I’ll make a f -- a few phone calls and ask and see -- see how they are, based on that.</span> <span id="s3935">Well, thank you.</span> <span id="s3936">And we’ll shut the camera off, and then do your photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3937">A: It
