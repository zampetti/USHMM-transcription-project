we’re conducting an interview with Mr. Oscar Haber here in his home in Lexington, Kentucky and this is an interview for the Holocaust Survivors in Kentucky Interview Project, which is being sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, as well as the Kentucky Oral History Commission.</span> <span id="s3">We are doing an interview that will focus mostly on Mr. Haber’s experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed before by the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation.</span> <span id="s4">And there is a videotape that is available through the Shoah Foundation.</span> <span id="s5">My name is Arwen Donahue and this is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s6">Mr. Haber, let’s start with your date of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: March 8th, 1910.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: And you talked about, in your other interview and by the way if we ever repeat anything, we’ll try to just cover things that we haven’t talked about before.</span> <span id="s9">But I’m sure that you don’t remember everything that you said and didn’t say, so I might remind you sometimes if we’ve already talked about something.</span> <span id="s10">But in your other interview you did mention that you went, you had an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in a small town, in a shtetl and you were one of nine children, and you had an unusual opportunity to attend a high school, a public high school and eventually became a dentist.</span> <span id="s11">And I’m wondering how it happened that you had this opportunity to study in a public high school and where the high school was?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: The high school was in Debica, which is in the district of Krakow and that was about nine kilometers of my village where I was born.</span> <span id="s13">And we had, from the age of three, in our house, always a teacher, special for religious purposes.</span> <span id="s14">But by this same occasion we were studying normal classes.</span> <span id="s15">So in the age of four I could already go in the village to the first class of public school and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was.</span> <span id="s16">But I finished there the fourth year and my father decided I have to go into the small city, which was Debica there.</span> <span id="s17">In the same time, he put us in a quarter, that means to live in the house of a Rabbi, which was teaching us the Hebrew and the religious teachings.</span> <span id="s18">In the same time I went to the Polish public school.</span> <span id="s19">And that was a very difficult experience because we have to get up in the morning at six o’clock, sometimes earlier, and before we went to the public school in the morning for eight o’clock it started, we had already to pray and to learn Hebrew and to learn everything about religious life.</span> <span id="s20">And more and more.</span> <span id="s21">So, I was there about six years living with this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s22">At the same time after I graduated from the normal school, from the seven classes, I applied to the high school, but I was too young.</span> <span id="s23">Because it was already that you can go to school, start school only by the age of seven, and I was four years old.</span> <span id="s24">But I was somehow fortunate, my father knew the director of this high school.</span> <span id="s25">And he spoke with him and he said, “Well I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s26">He has to go normal now to the sixth class at least, at least and to repeat.”</span> <span id="s27">And my father said, “You know, make him a test.”</span> <span id="s28">And I got a test and I passed the test, but still he couldn’t take me.</span> <span id="s29">I had to repeat the seventh grade another year.</span> <span id="s30">And then I was accepted to the high school.</span> <span id="s31">And there I matriculated there and so I continued my studies.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: So, what language did you speak at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddish.</span> <span id="s34">My father was very religious and he want us to know the Yiddish, we are spoken.</span> <span id="s35">But we had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to speak Polish too.</span> <span id="s36">And surrounded by peasants who are speaking Polish and you have to knew the language.</span> <span id="s37">In the school was Polish of course.</span> <span id="s38">When I went to school in Debica there was in the fourth class was already German, too.</span> <span id="s39">So I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course, Hebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to pray.</span> <span id="s40">At the age of three we started already to learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alphabet and we knew to pray and most of the prayings until today, I know by heart.</span> <span id="s41">Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it.</span> <span id="s42">And the first when you opened eyes at the religious house, the first is to wash your hands, that’s the first things.</span> <span id="s43">And to make a blessing about the washing the hands and you make a blessing for the food and you have to thank God that you got up in the morning.</span> <span id="s44">That was the first Hebrew praying and that was at the age of three.</span> <span id="s45">At the age of four we started already to learn the Torah, which is the Bible, the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s46">And so we continued to, so therefore I am quite acquainted about religious Jewish life.</span> <span id="s47">And then later on, of course, in high school we learned about, in the public school we learned about history and that was very interesting, world history, too.</span> <span id="s48">And German literature.</span> <span id="s49">And therefore I, until today, I am quite acquainted with the world literature and especially the German literature and the Hebrew, of course.</span> <span id="s50">And the Yiddish.</span> <span id="s51">So, this is the way like it was.</span> <span id="s52">It was a very hard thing, because the distance to the town was like I said about nine kilometers, eight or nine kilometers.</span> <span id="s53">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s54">And for Saturday we used to go home, I mean to the village.</span> <span id="s55">And when we came to the village Saturday, there was the traditional Friday evening meal with the praying, with everything.</span> <span id="s56">In our house was there a minyan, which is the quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law.</span> <span id="s57">And my late father, by himself with his own funds, he founded a Torah.</span> <span id="s58">He let scribe it, and we had a new Torah in our house and there was a praying in our house and my father was the master of the ceremony.</span> <span id="s59">And the people from the villages around, which were few, not always was there the quorum of ten people.</span> <span id="s60">But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum.</span> <span id="s61">If it wasn’t quorum, so how many it was, but it was the normal pray.</span> <span id="s62">And we had to know it and to participate.</span> <span id="s63">And that was in afternoon, my father take a sleep one hour and he took us in the room, me and my brother, because my older brother was with me in the school at this Rabbi.</span> <span id="s64">He was sitting down and we had to repeat what we learned all the week.</span> <span id="s65">My father wanted to know what we learned and how far we are continuing to progress.</span> <span id="s66">And that was the way like it was in our house.</span> <span id="s67">Of course, Saturday was like in the Torah is resting day.</span> <span id="s68">And that was the religious way of life.</span> <span id="s69">Nothing was working, nobody was working, even the servants.</span> <span id="s70">Only to feed the animals, to milk the cows and that what was doing.</span> <span id="s71">But not working in the field, not other work was performed.</span> <span id="s72">Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: You mentioned that one of the towns nearby, Ropczyce, had a strong Hasidic tradition.</span> <span id="s74">Did your family have any Hasidic ties or traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My father by himself was a Hasid.</span> <span id="s76">But he didn’t go to Ropczyce because the old Ropczyce Rabbi wasn’t more.</span> <span id="s77">The founder of the Hasidic movement which was Reb Nafthali, which you know.</span> <span id="s78">And he was no more alive.</span> <span id="s79">There was already third or fourth generation there and there was no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there.</span> <span id="s80">My father used to go to Sans (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles.</span> <span id="s81">To go for holidays there to the Rabbi of Sans (ph).</span> <span id="s82">Also sometimes OfBobof (ph), which is also a little shtetl there in the surroundings of Sans (ph).</span> <span id="s83">They were the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this Rabbis is now here in the United States.</span> <span id="s84">They are siblings and family offsprings, which are continue this Hasidic movement of Bobof (ph) and of Sans (ph).</span> <span id="s85">And that was, my father was a Hasid of them.</span> <span id="s86">He wasn’t, by himself, he wasn’t a blind Hasidic.</span> <span id="s87">He wasn’t overdoing.</span> <span id="s88">But the basic religious things were holy for him.</span> <span id="s89">And that was my father.</span> <span id="s90">Of course my mother did everything what my father said to do.</span> <span id="s91">The thing was, my father, his first wife passed away.</span> <span id="s92">And from his first wife, gave birth a daughter and by the birth she passed away.</span> <span id="s93">He was a young widower.</span> <span id="s94">He was already thirty-five or thirty-six years old and a matchmaker found him a girl of sixteen years somewhere in another village there.</span> <span id="s95">And she came to live with him, and she was my mother.</span> <span id="s96">She gave birth to the nine children.</span> <span id="s97">And we were in touch with our sister, because Jewish law recognize it, one child, when it is from the same father, is a sibling, more even than one mother.</span> <span id="s98">That is the religious way and tradition.</span> <span id="s99">Interesting enough, our sister, she married a very interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our house, teaching us the religious ways.</span> <span id="s100">He was very educated in Jewish Talmudic teachings.</span> <span id="s101">And he married her, and he succeeded, he became quite a rich man.</span> <span id="s102">And she gave birth to eight children.</span> <span id="s103">And there are only two children survived and they are still living.</span> <span id="s104">One is ninety-two years old, lives in the United States.</span> <span id="s105">And the other one is eighty-five years, that’s the youngest one, eighty-four years old, lives in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: These would be your nieces and nephews actually.</span> <span id="s107">Right?</span> <span id="s108">Officially.</span> <span id="s109">Your sister’s children?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Are?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: They would be your nieces and your nephews?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yeah, they are my nieces and we are in touch with them and we are very much in good relations.</span> <span id="s113">And very interesting story about these two nieces.</span> <span id="s114">Both of them survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s115">The one married in the war and had a daughter in the war.</span> <span id="s116">And she escaped, run away, being pregnant from Debica, I mean this village there, to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s117">Then it was belonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this part of the country, of Polish country.</span> <span id="s118">And she, when she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent’s door.</span> <span id="s119">And was looking from far away what happened to this child.</span> <span id="s120">And she saw that a nun came out and she took in the child in the house.</span> <span id="s121">And then she ran away and she became a servant, as a Polish girl, as a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in Lvov.</span> <span id="s122">That was the older one.</span> <span id="s123">The younger one had a friend in Lvov.</span> <span id="s124">She was in Lvov studying sewing, to be a seamstering.</span> <span id="s125">Mother, very good seamster, which she was.</span> <span id="s126">And she met there a boy, before the war he was leader already of the trade unions.</span> <span id="s127">And when the Russian came in… in the beginning he was a very big shot.</span> <span id="s128">But when the Russians, when the German invaded, he went with the Russian back to Russia and there he joined the Polish Army, which was organized there by the Poles after their agreement, the Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize their Army, which was affiliated to the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s129">And they were fighting.</span> <span id="s130">And he was fighting the Germans until Berlin.</span> <span id="s131">And he put her on a Polish family.</span> <span id="s132">She was a seamster and she gave birth to a daughter, but that was already in 1945 when the war is going to end.</span> <span id="s133">When he came from Russia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight with the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s134">And then she gave birth to this daughter.</span> <span id="s135">And when the war was coming to an end, he became a governor of a part which was annected from Poland from the German territory there.</span> <span id="s136">And he took her there, and they had another two sons, but they not living as Jews.</span> <span id="s137">And they very talented boys.</span> <span id="s138">And when it came in Poland the time where Jews moved from Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it?</span> <span id="s139">Something like this.</span> <span id="s140">They came, first time she told the sons that they are Jewish and they were already both matriculated after high school diploma.</span> <span id="s141">And one of them was already studying engineering.</span> <span id="s142">And they came to Israel.</span> <span id="s143">But their father, himself, he in the meantime, being a governor he studied at the university at the same time to become an agronom… agronomy.</span> <span id="s144">And he came to Israel as an agronom.</span> <span id="s145">But because Israel didn’t have confidence to all these apparatchiks from Poland.</span> <span id="s146">I mean all this communist active parties, he couldn’t find a job.</span> <span id="s147">It was very difficult to find.</span> <span id="s148">And we were already at this time in Israel and I had some connection with people and to a member of the Israel Parliament.</span> <span id="s149">And I wrote to them and I warranted about him, that he’s not one of the Russian services and he got a job in agronomy.</span> <span id="s150">But he passed away about six or seven years ago.</span> <span id="s151">In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high, secret Israel Army factory.</span> <span id="s152">And the other son was also an engineer, but in the same time he was teaching in a school, in a vocational school.</span> <span id="s153">And married a girl from Venezuela.</span> <span id="s154">And one year ago they decided that they leave Israel and they came to the United States.</span> <span id="s155">And he got a job here in California.</span> <span id="s156">He must be very, very important engineer, because he got the, he made the green card and he can work and they bought a house.</span> <span id="s157">But they have one son, who is at the Israel Army.</span> <span id="s158">And just now I heard, two weeks ago, he went to Israel and asked to give him some off in the Army.</span> <span id="s159">And he came to visit him here to the United States.</span> <span id="s160">He will not stay.</span> <span id="s161">He will go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s162">But he decided, his wife and with the other two children to stay in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Sounds as if you’ve kept in pretty close touch with whatever members of your family have survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Oh yeah, whatever I have.</span> <span id="s165">I have two brothers.</span> <span id="s166">I have a second cousin, who was… they were all in camps.</span> <span id="s167">And they are living here in the United States.</span> <span id="s168">My brothers and my second cousins.</span> <span id="s169">Are we are trying to keep all together here.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Let’s go back to the time that we were talking about before the war.</span> <span id="s171">Did you end up going to high school then because your father wanted you to have oppor… special opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: That normally your other siblings wouldn’t have had?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: High school, further studies wasn’t the main purpose of my father.</span> <span id="s175">My father would have very much liked me to go on and study Jewish, maybe Rabbinical even studies.</span> <span id="s176">But I was very stubborn and I was in very difficult conditions, making my study very difficult.</span> <span id="s177">Often in hunger, often have to work and to gain my life.</span> <span id="s178">But I did it.</span> <span id="s179">And I’m happy I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: So it was really your, becoming a dentist was something that you really wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I, that was my idea.</span> <span id="s182">That was my idea and there was also an idea which I got from a cousin of mine who was a dentist in the other place there.</span> <span id="s183">And I liked the way like he was living.</span> <span id="s184">I was enjoying more the free life.</span> <span id="s185">This religious life didn’t match my character.</span> <span id="s186">I wasn’t never, never… even being young, following all the instructions and prescriptions, but I was never strictly convinced that that was what I want to do.</span> <span id="s187">I was always looking on the broad world, and life was for me, more interesting outside the religious life.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: You mentioned in your first interview that you were a Polish patriot.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Were you politically interested or involved in Polish… well, were you interested in Polish politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s192">I was, deep in my soul I was Jewish, but I found that we are living in a Polish country, this is Poland and this is our homeland and we owe to be loyal to our country.</span> <span id="s193">That’s wherever I am, I found my obligation to be honest and I could avoid serving in the Polish Army which wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s194">It wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s195">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s196">But it wasn’t voluntary, because Poland was an Army which was called to the Army.</span> <span id="s197">That was not a voluntary army.</span> <span id="s198">You have to go, by twenty-one everyone has to go to the army except that somebody is unable to fulfill the demand, sick and so forth.</span> <span id="s199">And a lot of my colleagues and a lot of Jewish people usually they started to do everything to avoid to go into the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s200">I didn’t try it even.</span> <span id="s201">And I did it full hearted and I think it was my obligation to do it, because I owe it.</span> <span id="s202">I understand that it is a common responsibility when you are a citizen of a country, you live there, you have to do what belongs.</span> <span id="s203">But politically I was never involved in any movement, never any movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Not…</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I loved Poland.</span> <span id="s206">I loved the country.</span> <span id="s207">It gave us opportunity and then that’s it.</span> <span id="s208">I did what I had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">End of Tape 1, Side A Tape 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Tape one, side B. Were you involved in any Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s212">It was a time I thought maybe one has to go to Palestine those times.</span> <span id="s213">I will not deny there was not in Poland anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s214">But you know anti-Semitism until today has many faces.</span> <span id="s215">There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a political anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s216">And for me and my observance, my conviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in Poland, it was more economic anti-Semitism, with some reasons, objective reasons.</span> <span id="s217">They were nobody’s fault, but the situation became so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn’t be, maybe it is nobody’s fault, but it was.</span> <span id="s218">I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s219">Well, there is in every nation, there are some extreme people, which they can get… and they are more doing it for personal reasons and for gaining something of it.</span> <span id="s220">And this is also the political anti-Semitism, which is to gain something to rule over people.</span> <span id="s221">You know?</span> <span id="s222">And Jews were more educated, absolutely more educated than the common people in Poland.</span> <span id="s223">Because as I told you before, I started to study when I was three.</span> <span id="s224">You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it gives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of eight or nine or ten even.</span> <span id="s225">Some of them didn’t go to school, the Polish people didn’t go to school ever.</span> <span id="s226">There was illiteracy, too.</span> <span id="s227">So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what they wanted.</span> <span id="s228">And the masses didn’t know.</span> <span id="s229">Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don’t know when they are going to vote, what they need and what they want.</span> <span id="s230">It is until today everywhere.</span> <span id="s231">But especially in a country like Poland, which was, which wasn’t so educated.</span> <span id="s232">There was a lot of people who didn’t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from promises and so forth, you know.</span> <span id="s233">And then Poland, I would need to go into the situation of Poland, how Poland became free after being occupied by three countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Well let’s not get into overall historical…</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah, I understand.</span> <span id="s236">I understand, but the Jews even, in each occupied party, had different opportunities.</span> <span id="s237">In the Russian occupied part they couldn’t progress like this we could make in the Austro-Hungarian or in the German occupied territory.</span> <span id="s238">So here comes the difference.</span> <span id="s239">Education, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point.</span> <span id="s240">And this gave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the Jews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is.</span> <span id="s241">He is anti-Semite, why and what, we didn’t analyze and that wasn’t important.</span> <span id="s242">We had to feel it and that what it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: When you were in the Army then, in 1935 and ‘36, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And how was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Ten percent was Jews.</span> <span id="s247">It was the same, approximately the same relative like it was, the population was about ten percent and there was about ten percent was in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: It’s difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you the time.</span> <span id="s250">You have so many things to do that you don’t have the time to play these games.</span> <span id="s251">But, but, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s252">What kind?</span> <span id="s253">They were so educated, they were so prepared.</span> <span id="s254">That was the elite.</span> <span id="s255">That they, but of course, they didn’t, they didn’t want to show up as anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s256">But you could feel it, you could feel it.</span> <span id="s257">Not everybody felt it.</span> <span id="s258">And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not able to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve.</span> <span id="s259">The rich Jews who didn’t want to go to the Army, there was always finding a way of bribery.</span> <span id="s260">To whom?</span> <span id="s261">To the Polish officers, to the Polish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and they are sick and they cannot serve.</span> <span id="s262">And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army.</span> <span id="s263">There were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army.</span> <span id="s264">And then there was another thing.</span> <span id="s265">After matriculation you are going to the officer’s school.</span> <span id="s266">And in the officer’s school, they didn’t want the Jews to become officers.</span> <span id="s267">They were there because they were, after matriculation that was the law.</span> <span id="s268">So usually they find always a way to send them back to the normal Army, not to live in the school to become an officer.</span> <span id="s269">There were officers, Jewish officers, but very few, very few.</span> <span id="s270">It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a high officer in the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s271">There were higher officers only medical officers, because they needed them.</span> <span id="s272">They have to take them and that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: So, by the time you were in the Service, you were a dentist, were you a dentist already?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the service and then get out.</span> <span id="s276">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s278">When the time came to go out, I got a phone from Krakow that one doctor who was by himself a Colonel in the Polish Army, doctor, dentist.</span> <span id="s279">He had private office.</span> <span id="s280">He was ready to retire and he had a private office.</span> <span id="s281">But he got a heart attack and they took him to hospital.</span> <span id="s282">And they phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out that position.</span> <span id="s283">So the last day in the Polish Army… and even the greatest anti-Semite in my unit, came to me, they make me a party, my departure, that was ad hoc make a party for me.</span> <span id="s284">He came to me, he said, “You know I am twenty years in the Polish Army.</span> <span id="s285">I am professional officer, high officer.</span> <span id="s286">I’m a major there.”</span> <span id="s287">He said, “You are the first Jew I know had such a good time in the Army like you have.</span> <span id="s288">Like you had.”</span> <span id="s289">And I said to them good bye, and I left.</span> <span id="s290">And immediately the next day I came to Krakow and I start to work because I had to fulfill this, this… later on he was released from the hospital.</span> <span id="s291">He survived and he came to the office, but I still was working with him.</span> <span id="s292">He couldn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s293">So I was working with him about a year and a half, something like this.</span> <span id="s294">And then I opened my own office.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: But you said you didn’t have such a good time in the… did you have a good time socially?</span> <span id="s296">Is that what he meant?</span> <span id="s297">That you got along with other officers?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s299">I had a good time, well I got along.</span> <span id="s300">They were all, needed me because I was there practicing dentistry.</span> <span id="s301">After the first, first recruiting, six months, then later on I organize a clinic and I receive patients.</span> <span id="s302">So they had their families and they were coming to me and I had really a good time.</span> <span id="s303">I came from the Army with some saved money, which the families of these officers paid to me for services.</span> <span id="s304">That was very, very, very little payments, but still I came with quite nice saved money.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: You mentioned in your other interview that you were involved with the underground army.</span> <span id="s306">The Armia Krajowa.</span> <span id="s307">How did you get involved with the army and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: In 1942, when we fled, went with the, on the Aryan papers, so-called.</span> <span id="s309">We came to a strange village there.</span> <span id="s310">And there the lady, which was the owner of the farm which we were given the address from the priest to go.</span> <span id="s311">That was his sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s312">Where I was there on this farm, there the Armia Krajowa started to organize herself.</span> <span id="s313">And we came there, and I went there as a refuge, refugee from the occupied territory, German-occupied territory which occupied Poland from Poznan.</span> <span id="s314">I said I am from Poznan, and I am hiding away because I was a Polish officer and I am hiding from the German Army.</span> <span id="s315">So when they became knowledge, they turned to me and maybe I will join them.</span> <span id="s316">And I said, “Well I cannot be a fighter to go and, with your fighting.”</span> <span id="s317">I went with them sometimes.</span> <span id="s318">But I organized a sanitary station, when some of them were wounded they brought them to me and I gave them some bandages or some treatments, which I had a sanitary station.</span> <span id="s319">And I also took care on the weapons which they had, and the magazine.</span> <span id="s320">They had some magazine in hiding in the shelter.</span> <span id="s321">And they had some weapons there, which they organize somehow.</span> <span id="s322">And I was taking, cleaning and taking care of it.</span> <span id="s323">And that was my function, I was going there and there, I was going close to every night I am going there and taking care of it.</span> <span id="s324">There were some actions which I am participating, but I was never going in the first line to go to fight with the Germans.</span> <span id="s325">Never, ever.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were you afraid at all or nervous that they would find, that they would check up on your story about having been an officer in Poznan and find out about your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: First of all, there was a case when somebody, the German has, in every village, in every town they had… will you lay down?</span> <span id="s328">Lay down…</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I have to…</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I will approach to you a little bit.</span> <span id="s331">They had their spies which are spying what happens to the Polish people there.</span> <span id="s332">What they are talking about and what they are doing.</span> <span id="s333">And some of them denounced that there is some activity, that they have some activity.</span> <span id="s334">And they choose Easter, 1943, yeah?</span> <span id="s335">1943 they choose to go to make an action and to arrest these Polish people who are in the underground.</span> <span id="s336">They knew from this people which they send in this Volksdeutsche and they took there ten people.</span> <span id="s337">Between them was the commandant of this base.</span> <span id="s338">His name was Bilig (ph), Biłig (ph).</span> <span id="s339">He was a student of law, of the third year, second or third year.</span> <span id="s340">He was the commandant of this unit there in this region.</span> <span id="s341">And there was other, there was a teacher and there was several people.</span> <span id="s342">And one was liberated by the Germans.</span> <span id="s343">That was suspected that he was collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s344">They released him.</span> <span id="s345">The other nine were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s346">This commandant was so beaten up that he couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s347">Because one of these people who was release, he saw him.</span> <span id="s348">That they took him from one room to other after hearings.</span> <span id="s349">They took him.</span> <span id="s350">He was all blooding.</span> <span id="s351">He didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s352">No one of them survived.</span> <span id="s353">So the commandant of this part was the brother of this woman where we were working on this farm.</span> <span id="s354">His name was Kostetski (ph).</span> <span id="s355">Max Kostetski (ph).</span> <span id="s356">And this lady, which we were there on this farm, she was a very fine, noble person.</span> <span id="s357">She knew that we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s358">She knew because when we arrived there, the brother of the priest was there, just there.</span> <span id="s359">And he was very angry.</span> <span id="s360">He said to the priest, “What did you bring these Jews here?</span> <span id="s361">Why did you do it?”</span> <span id="s362">And he run away very angry.</span> <span id="s363">And she knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] fine, noble person.</span> <span id="s364">And she tried to influence her brother.</span> <span id="s365">I am an officer and so forth.</span> <span id="s366">And she was helping us a lot with bread, with food, everywhere.</span> <span id="s367">Even when we later on, after the denunciation, we had to live in other place.</span> <span id="s368">She used to come to bring us bread and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s369">She did help us.</span> <span id="s370">I think maybe fifty percent of surviving we had to thank her.</span> <span id="s371">She was very, very, very kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Oscietska (ph), Stanislawa Oscietska (ph).</span> <span id="s376">Her father was anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s377">Her husband was a terrible anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s378">And the priest was also an anti-Semite and still that was the priest who helped us and gave us the paper.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: What was anti-Semitic about him?</span> <span id="s380">Why do you say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: He was anti-Semite, but he was, in my opinion he was economic anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s382">However, he didn’t have a business.</span> <span id="s383">But in the church he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish people, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish.</span> <span id="s384">And therefore Jews were calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s385">That was economical anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s386">They want to support their own people.</span> <span id="s387">I don’t find it wrong.</span> <span id="s388">I don’t find it wrong.</span> <span id="s389">I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people.</span> <span id="s390">How we didn’t like it, how we didn’t want it, but still it did hurt us economically.</span> <span id="s391">But he, as a human being and as a priest, he told us, “I want to help you because it comes a bad time to you.”</span> <span id="s392">So I cannot say he is a racist or he is a political anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s393">He was economical anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s394">He was anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s395">We are very sensitive.</span> <span id="s396">We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after thousands of years of discrimination.</span> <span id="s397">But still, if you have a little bit brain and you want to understand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving so, and not like you would like they will behave.</span> <span id="s398">We would like to be taken care on us as the Chosen People.</span> <span id="s399">But we are not the chosen, to take care on us.</span> <span id="s400">We are chosen because we have obligations.</span> <span id="s401">We choose to have the obligations.</span> <span id="s402">This is the chosen.</span> <span id="s403">We took the Ten Commandments, we took the Torah, we took everything, but we have to perform it.</span> <span id="s404">And if there is, you have to love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span id="s405">You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric.</span> <span id="s406">But you don’t have to harm your neighbor.</span> <span id="s407">You have to behave.</span> <span id="s408">And that, which in many cases we are missing.</span> <span id="s409">Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, “We are the Chosen People.</span> <span id="s410">You can do to other people this and this and this.</span> <span id="s411">You can take interest by non-Jews.</span> <span id="s412">You can do this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.”</span> <span id="s413">And that was a segregation which was in the Torah.</span> <span id="s414">There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation.</span> <span id="s415">This is the Chosen People, not only in the positive sense, a lot of things is negative.</span> <span id="s416">And therefore a lot of people who are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally.</span> <span id="s417">You make some selection.</span> <span id="s418">You have some humanitarian obligations as a human being, not blind to follow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other people.</span> <span id="s419">Which is very, very important.</span> <span id="s420">How do you respect others, so others will respect you?</span> <span id="s421">And this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life and so many readings and studying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings.</span> <span id="s422">Well it’s not a… if you know __________, introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom you are speaking.</span> <span id="s423">I think maybe sometimes I am going out of the framework which this has in mind, but I still am open-minded of everything what happens around.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Yeah, I think it’s valuable for the listeners to know who, who you are, what your beliefs are and where you’re coming from and how you developed those beliefs.</span> <span id="s425">So, but also I wanted to find out, just make little bit clearer the chronology and the geography of what happened from the years 1940 through 1944 or so.</span> <span id="s426">You were, you were, you told the story in the first interview about how you went away to the Russian front.</span> <span id="s427">You tried to join the Army, you kind of got caught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home village of Brzeznica?</span> <span id="s428">Is that right?</span> <span id="s429">And then I’m a little bit confused.</span> <span id="s430">You mentioned that you were working in an S, were you working in an SS camp?</span> <span id="s431">Was it a concentration camp for Jews that you were working in?</span> <span id="s432">Okay, what was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Pustkow.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Pustkow.</span> <span id="s435">And you were interned there as a prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s437">That was one of the miracles of this war maybe.</span> <span id="s438">There were no many Jews who are allowed to go in the camp and to leave the camp.</span> <span id="s439">And that was, by some miracle, maybe the reason was the German discipline, which they followed the orders of the Commandants, of the Führers.</span> <span id="s440">When I came to this camp, I volunteered.</span> <span id="s441">That was a working camp and therefore I was put into this camp as a dentist.</span> <span id="s442">There was no big dentistry and there was no big medicine, but still there was three medical doctors and there was rooms with beds, which in the beginning, which people when they got sick, even beaten when they were, they could come to the doctor.</span> <span id="s443">And they get care, they get care.</span> <span id="s444">In the beginning, even some times they were released from this to go to the town, to the little shtetl close to Debica there.</span> <span id="s445">There was other assignment to other works.</span> <span id="s446">But that was already not in their competence.</span> <span id="s447">In the beginning, how strange it would be, there was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of this health services there, Obersturmbanführer (ph) Schumacher was his name.</span> <span id="s448">And then, but he was maybe for two or three weeks and started only, that was only in ‘40.</span> <span id="s449">That was not yet nothing.</span> <span id="s450">That was the first beginning.</span> <span id="s451">And therefore the Jews were slowly getting in circulating.</span> <span id="s452">They took him so easy, they took him so by easy.</span> <span id="s453">They were voluntary, then later by force and later on by annihilation.</span> <span id="s454">They were going by themselves.</span> <span id="s455">That was the system.</span> <span id="s456">And then after two or three weeks, he left.</span> <span id="s457">But that was an order officer.</span> <span id="s458">A lieutenant officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">End of Tape 1, Side B Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: Tape two, side A. I’m sorry, will you repeat what you just said?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: The Jewish doctors, they were the first.</span> <span id="s462">But if there were some people unable to work, they couldn’t release them.</span> <span id="s463">It has to sign, the SS doctor has to sign.</span> <span id="s464">And that what he was doing another four weeks.</span> <span id="s465">But later on, they left it to the Jews, but the situation became worse.</span> <span id="s466">There was no releasing.</span> <span id="s467">Treating and to work, treating and to work, no release anymore.</span> <span id="s468">In this time I came to… when I organized this little dental clinic there, so called clinic, everything was provisional.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: When was it that you organized that clinic?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: In 1940 already.</span> <span id="s471">The end of 1940 I organized it there.</span> <span id="s472">And what could I do?</span> <span id="s473">If somebody has toothache, I could help, or to make an extraction, to pull out a tooth.</span> <span id="s474">And that was the things.</span> <span id="s475">There was no other things, no fillings.</span> <span id="s476">I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn’t want to go to the SS.</span> <span id="s477">They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a German.</span> <span id="s478">They had to go to an SS.</span> <span id="s479">But they knew that they will have a special treatment at the Jewish dentist, so some of them came.</span> <span id="s480">And that was a very difficult task, because I didn’t have, I didn’t have this equipment, which the German have.</span> <span id="s481">The German has the most modern and the most ___________ equipment.</span> <span id="s482">The SS had the most modern.</span> <span id="s483">And there was a lot of cases, which I couldn’t treat them at all, and I send them to go there.</span> <span id="s484">But they were insisting, they were insisting.</span> <span id="s485">And so in beginning, that was about a year.</span> <span id="s486">I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to the camp and I left.</span> <span id="s487">The bus was standing, I show only the ID and I left.</span> <span id="s488">In the beginning the doctors were also leaving, living in Debica.</span> <span id="s489">And coming only to work there.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: The Jewish doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The Jewish doctors, yeah.</span> <span id="s492">And even some of the workers were allowed to go Saturday and Sunday for a day home, but they have to come back.</span> <span id="s493">If they didn’t come back, they brought them by force and that was a terrible thing then.</span> <span id="s494">So, after a year approximately, there was an order to take the ID’s, SS ID’s from all the Jews.</span> <span id="s495">But I think, I am not sure, because I was there a volunteer, there was an order of the Commandant of this camp, of the head, Gillar (ph) SS Oberführer, who gave, day order, which he gives to the soldiers every day orders.</span> <span id="s496">He said, “The Jewish dentist can come to the camp whenever he wants.</span> <span id="s497">And every time when he comes to the post they will give him a post who bring him in the camp and when he is finished, he will come to pick him up and take him out from the camp.”</span> <span id="s498">That was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s499">That was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: Did that happen because he had a special fondness for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Because it was in the order.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s503">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s504">I cannot comprehend it until today.</span> <span id="s505">I cannot understand it why.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did you know him personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: No.</span> <span id="s508">No.</span> <span id="s509">I knew the Commandant, the head of the… I’ll tell you, I mentioned before, the Germans were strict in their orders.</span> <span id="s510">I was a volunteer, and I was assigned by the working office, the special working office, which gave the contingent for the camp, for the people.</span> <span id="s511">Bring them and give them to different works.</span> <span id="s512">And because of they gave me this job, I didn’t belong to the SS, I belong all the time to the working office.</span> <span id="s513">And the head of this working office was a German, he became German.</span> <span id="s514">He was a German from origin.</span> <span id="s515">But he was Polish all the time.</span> <span id="s516">Only when the Germans came in, he became a German.</span> <span id="s517">And he was an officer in the Polish Army with a German name.</span> <span id="s518">Eilmiss (ph) was his name, Jule Eilmiss (ph).</span> <span id="s519">And he was very good to me.</span> <span id="s520">I was very good to him.</span> <span id="s521">I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes.</span> <span id="s522">And maybe they respect because I was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I didn’t belong to the SS, I belong to the working.</span> <span id="s523">And that was the reason.</span> <span id="s524">And when I came to this post and I said, “I am the Jewish dentist.</span> <span id="s525">I need to go to the camp, please give me company.”</span> <span id="s526">And they give me an SS man, who brought me to the camp.</span> <span id="s527">By the entrance to the camp there was another SS man, but he respected this SS man, he gave me over to him.</span> <span id="s528">He opened the gate and let me in.</span> <span id="s529">And when I was ready, I went to the office and I said, “I want to go out.”</span> <span id="s530">They call to the camp, to the post, and the postman came and take me out from there.</span> <span id="s531">So, this is, everything is miraculous.</span> <span id="s532">Well, it is miracle that I am alive and that I am here.</span> <span id="s533">But that was something which was really extraordinary.</span> <span id="s534">I didn’t hear for a similar case in all my experience of camps and Jewish labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Were you treating Jewish patients only or were there other prisoners there, who were non-Jewish?</span> <span id="s536">I mean political prisoners or something, who you were treating?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: My treating was only Jews.</span> <span id="s538">There was close to it a Polish camp for political Polish prisoners, but I didn’t go in there and they couldn’t come here.</span> <span id="s539">They brought in, once they brought in two Polish prisoners, too, which I had to give them some treatment.</span> <span id="s540">But the SS Commandant sit down and took my treatment and the second Schaffner (ph) of the camp took my treatment.</span> <span id="s541">And other SS people came in my private practice home.</span> <span id="s542">Because I make in the house where I live like this Polish peasants, I make also a little clinic that what gives me my income.</span> <span id="s543">A barter business, people brought me food and I treated them.</span> <span id="s544">And so some of these SS people came in and they brought me also some tea, some coffee, because it was not on the market, even black market was not to get it.</span> <span id="s545">But the SS had everything.</span> <span id="s546">And they came in there, most of these SS people which were, plus they knew me, because I was going into the camp, out and in, and out and in, so I was really tolerated in this place like persona grata.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Okay, so you were doing that until 1942, when the area was evacuated and the Jews were ordered to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: The Jews were evacuated earlier.</span> <span id="s549">The only Jewish family was my family which allowed, which the Kreishofman (ph) allowed them to stay there.</span> <span id="s550">They allowed only me, but because the Polish officer didn’t understand German, so I take this opportunity and I left all my family there in this village.</span> <span id="s551">But there came the Final Solution and they want, nobody could, no Jew could be free.</span> <span id="s552">So I would have to go to the camp.</span> <span id="s553">My wife, Fryda, had to go with all the family together to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s554">From there they went to annihilation, as you know.</span> <span id="s555">Some of them went to the camp, to other camps, the brothers, my brothers.</span> <span id="s556">My three brothers came to other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So your, at that point your family, did they all go to the ghetto in Ropczyce?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Ropczyce and from Ropczyce they send them immediately to Senczyczow (ph), which was the next little town.</span> <span id="s559">And from there, about two weeks, they send them all to annihilation.</span> <span id="s560">I don’t know exactly until now.</span> <span id="s561">I think to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s562">I guess they went to Treblinka, all of them.</span> <span id="s563">Except my brothers which went to the other camp, to Rzeszow, from Rzeszow to Mielec.</span> <span id="s564">From Mielec there was the factory of airplanes, Hermann Göring Werke.</span> <span id="s565">And they were there.</span> <span id="s566">And there my oldest brother was killed there by the Germans.</span> <span id="s567">And these two brothers survived.</span> <span id="s568">And they were taken from there to Germany and they make all the marches and all the way through.</span> <span id="s569">And they survived in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: And your Polish, was your Polish good enough that you could pass well without worrying about language problems as a Pole?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: My Polish was better than all the Polish Polish.</span> <span id="s572">Our Polish was exceptional, very good.</span> <span id="s573">Otherwise the priests wouldn’t give us papers.</span> <span id="s574">That was the basic things, appearance and language, that was the things which was the most important.</span> <span id="s575">And there was no, any blemish in my language and so till today the Polish people who come here and we are friends, Polish people.</span> <span id="s576">They say our Polish is immaculate.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Did you have any, Fryda was talking in the interview that we did with her a little earlier today, she was talking about some of the challenges of being in church and having to adopt this persona, where you had to, everything had to be just right.</span> <span id="s578">Do you remember any trouble that you had with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Not at all.</span> <span id="s580">First of all, I adopted it very easy because living in a village, you are involved in the peasant’s life.</span> <span id="s581">You want, you don’t want, you don’t have the time even, but still.</span> <span id="s582">And so I knew about the habits and about everything how the Poles live.</span> <span id="s583">And we were living, even being Orthodox, my father was a very, very, very accepted in the community, in the peasant community.</span> <span id="s584">They respected him very well and they came and they lived together.</span> <span id="s585">And my father being an Orthodox Jew with ____________ you have seen.</span> <span id="s586">And he spoke immaculate Polish very well and so did all my family.</span> <span id="s587">And interesting enough, the children all were speaking Polish home, only when father wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s588">When father was in field, because we had a farm, so my father was usually, in the summer time always in the field.</span> <span id="s589">As you know in a village there is always work, never endless, endless work.</span> <span id="s590">When my father came, approaching the house, Yiddish, immediately Yiddish we have to speak at home, only Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: But your family was unusual then.</span> <span id="s592">I mean, I think it was common for Polish Jewish families to be pretty segregated and to just associate with other Jews.</span> <span id="s593">But your family was much more integrated it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Well the question of integration was more common in the shtetl, where there were around Jews.</span> <span id="s595">We didn’t have, our closest Jew was living a mile from us.</span> <span id="s596">A mile in Poland is like hundred miles here.</span> <span id="s597">Distances are different.</span> <span id="s598">And the other Jews were coming to us to study religious things by the teacher which we have in our house.</span> <span id="s599">And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews.</span> <span id="s600">It is difficult to describe.</span> <span id="s601">Well, in the last years, the situation improve.</span> <span id="s602">But I remember as a child I came in the house of one of the oldest citizens in this village that has Haskila Ascheim (ph).</span> <span id="s603">And he had two sons… three sons, one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the Polish Army, because it was just a change from Polish liberalization.</span> <span id="s604">It was a widow with five children.</span> <span id="s605">Of course, the sons came to learn in our house.</span> <span id="s606">Not too much, not too much, but the basic prayers, the basic prayers they learned.</span> <span id="s607">The other son had also five children and they were very, very talented children, very talented children, but they didn’t have the opportunity to go to school, only to the community school, I mean to the elementary school.</span> <span id="s608">But they were ___________, they studied by themselves.</span> <span id="s609">And this two sons became even writers and the lawyer in the village there.</span> <span id="s610">And one of the sons became a dentist.</span> <span id="s611">And the daughter married.</span> <span id="s612">Not that this is the point.</span> <span id="s613">The point is that this three sons with their families, in the beginning there was here two children, here one child, the other one also two children.</span> <span id="s614">They were living in one house, where there was only three rooms.</span> <span id="s615">Of course no bathroom, nothing like this.</span> <span id="s616">In addition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub.</span> <span id="s617">He was selling alcohol to the Polish people were coming, drinking there.</span> <span id="s618">Everything in this one house.</span> <span id="s619">Later on they move on, they somehow organize them, their living.</span> <span id="s620">And they have their own houses.</span> <span id="s621">No one survived, as far as I know, of all these families.</span> <span id="s622">No one.</span> <span id="s623">Of all these villagers, no one survived.</span> <span id="s624">Only one son and a son-in-law went to America.</span> <span id="s625">But I’m sure he’s not more alive and I don’t know if he had family.</span> <span id="s626">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s627">One grandson came also to America with a very tricky way.</span> <span id="s628">His father, who was already in America, sent him a girl from the United States, which he married there, so he could travel to America.</span> <span id="s629">But he’s not alive.</span> <span id="s630">He died.</span> <span id="s631">He was a sick boy.</span> <span id="s632">Lyman (ph) was his name.</span> <span id="s633">No one of all this family is around that I know, who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You went from, okay, so in 1942 you went to the Priest’s sister.</span> <span id="s635">I’m forgetting the name of the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: Jurkow (ph).</span> <span id="s637">Jurkow, by Szczow (ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: And that was near the time when you got involved with the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Did you, we didn’t get to just talk a little bit more about your experiences in the AK.</span> <span id="s641">Did you have any, do you want to tell us a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Well, I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s643">Thanks to this, my involvement in the AK, I could find a place after I had to escape because of the Gestapo which came.</span> <span id="s644">And thanks….</span> <span id="s645">the right place…</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yeah, it’s going to, so I’ll… you don’t have to hold it.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Oh, and your hand.</span> <span id="s648">I have to support your hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: I guess… sometimes I have to lift up my hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Therefore I wanted to take from you.</span> <span id="s651">I understand it.</span> <span id="s652">I give you support.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Tell me when you get tired.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Yeah, you’ll feel it.</span> <span id="s655">[Laughing.]</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Thanks to my involvement in the AK, I could find a place when I had to escape when the Gestapo came to pick us up.</span> <span id="s658">That was the positive thing what I have of it.</span> <span id="s659">Well, I didn’t experience too many fights except one when it was already 1944, when our unit was affiliated to a other unit and together we make an attack on a police station, German-Polish police station and the dam of Roznow (ph).</span> <span id="s660">Roznow (ph), that was a big dam which they built on the Danube River, not Danube, but Dunajec river.</span> <span id="s661">That was a big dam.</span> <span id="s662">There was a little one later of in Szczow where in the beginning the Jews built it.</span> <span id="s663">But that was only in 1941, ‘42.</span> <span id="s664">But later on they took away all the Jews in other camps.</span> <span id="s665">I don’t know what they did to them.</span> <span id="s666">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s667">And there was then a fight, which was quite a real fight with this police, but the Polish police hand over herself and the Germans, some escaped, some were killed.</span> <span id="s668">And that was the source where the AK gets more weapons there, from there.</span> <span id="s669">No, I am not.</span> <span id="s670">You can hold it.</span> <span id="s671">I have here support.</span> <span id="s672">That was really when I, by my walking in the nights to the base where we have the weapons there, I met some of the AK men, which usually no AK men knew more than other two.</span> <span id="s673">That was a conspiracy.</span> <span id="s674">And interesting enough, the main active AK man in our unit, which was really an active guy, he was doing by himself a lot of things, he was a released criminal prisoner from Polish prison.</span> <span id="s675">And from him I got also for myself a gun, which I had one, but I didn’t have enough ammunition for it.</span> <span id="s676">And he was the one who give me another gun and then I have some more ammunition, some more for security.</span> <span id="s677">[Phone rings.]</span> <span id="s678">I didn’t use it because I didn’t need it, but I was ready in case I will need it.</span> <span id="s679">I had a grenade and I had a weapon, I wouldn’t go into prison voluntarily.</span> <span id="s680">I will kill some Germans and myself, that was my preparation to do.</span> <span id="s681">Otherwise I didn’t have anything special.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Did you have any, I know that it was a challenge, the AK has a reputation for being very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s683">Did you have any trouble or close calls with that?</span> <span id="s684">With anybody finding out you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: The only thing which I know, which came through me in the place where I was living, in the neighboring village was another unit of AK and there was a commandant, and all the orders who came from the main office were passing from one unit to the other.</span> <span id="s686">And through me was passing from this unit, through me to my unit.</span> <span id="s687">And that was already in 1944, by the end of 1944.</span> <span id="s688">I usually tried to know what happens because I didn’t have a radio.</span> <span id="s689">I was relying on the news which I got from the acquaintance, what they get to me.</span> <span id="s690">But from this, from this orders who came, I found some orders what happens at the front.</span> <span id="s691">There was always messages what is to do and so forth.</span> <span id="s692">And the last message which I got, I opened it too.</span> <span id="s693">Then I close it and I send it farther.</span> <span id="s694">There was a message, the Russians are approaching, not to hand over, not to give them over our units.</span> <span id="s695">And before they come in to clean up all the rest of the units of the people which are, which you will find in the forests, whether it is Russian partisans or other kind.</span> <span id="s696">It didn’t mention exactly Jews, but who was there in the forest?</span> <span id="s697">That was the only thing which I have personally met.</span> <span id="s698">From person to person, I didn’t met, only I say the other two AK men and they didn’t know that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s699">They didn’t know.</span> <span id="s700">And they, we never spoke about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Were you afraid at all during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Well that is difficult to say, afraid.</span> <span id="s703">But you are always watching what you are saying, what you are doing, not to be different.</span> <span id="s704">You have to drink alcohol, the moonshine like they are and to do everything like they are doing when they come together.</span> <span id="s705">Even if you don’t know them, but you have to go on the way like this.</span> <span id="s706">And if they are cursing, you have to curse, if it is damn, or another.</span> <span id="s707">You have to be always, not try to be different, not try to be different, that’s the main point what you have to do.</span> <span id="s708">Scared?</span> <span id="s709">Of course, you are always scared.</span> <span id="s710">You know, when I was watching and going walking in the night from one village to the other, if I heard a frog jumping, my ears were so sensitive, I heared it.</span> <span id="s711">Because I want to know what happens around me, to be always prepared and always the hand on the gun.</span> <span id="s712">And I didn’t continue to go until I found out what is this noise, if it is not people.</span> <span id="s713">I find the frog and then I continue to go.</span> <span id="s714">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: How did you meet Frantiszek Muschau, who you talked about in your other interview?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: He was working on this farm… End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So you were working together, and you got him involved eventually in the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: I recommended to my commandant, I recommended my commandant to accept him.</span> <span id="s719">I also accepted the other one, who became the priest, the anti-Semite, which was.</span> <span id="s720">And this Muschau was a very nice man, very nice man.</span> <span id="s721">And he was not like the common peasant.</span> <span id="s722">He was already more civilized because he was working in France as a miner, several years.</span> <span id="s723">And he came up from France.</span> <span id="s724">He brought some furniture from France.</span> <span id="s725">And he was already more progressive.</span> <span id="s726">And we exchanged different opinions about the situation, the political situation.</span> <span id="s727">About the Germans, about the Russians, so forth.</span> <span id="s728">We were politicizing.</span> <span id="s729">He was inviting me in his home.</span> <span id="s730">We are drinking and eating there.</span> <span id="s731">And he invite the neighbor.</span> <span id="s732">He has a neighbor there, one Kilbasa (ph), who came also and they want to hear what happens in the world.</span> <span id="s733">And I have also some news from my fellow man.</span> <span id="s734">So they accepted all the news from me as an intelligent Polish officer and Polish patriot, of course.</span> <span id="s735">And that was always, with the alcohol, with moonshine.</span> <span id="s736">I drank moonshine in my life, maybe I could make a bath in it and swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Was that hard to get used to?</span> <span id="s738">Drinking that much without slipping when you were drunk?</span> <span id="s739">I mean, letting something slip?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I never allowed to be drunk.</span> <span id="s741">I always want to have my clear mind, because that was the most dangerous thing, to lose your mind.</span> <span id="s742">To be drunk.</span> <span id="s743">So when I felt, I run it out somewhere, I make like I am drinking another one, another one, but I didn’t drink it.</span> <span id="s744">But still it was quite a bit .</span> <span id="s745">I am happy that I could tolerate it as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: What happened towards the end of the war?</span> <span id="s747">Did you have, you had information about what was happening through your involvement with the AK that you knew where the Russian front was and whether they were advancing and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Well you could hear.</span> <span id="s749">First of all, there was a situation about four months, more than four months.</span> <span id="s750">The Russians stopped on the river, they didn’t cross the river Vistula to help the Polish resistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reasons.</span> <span id="s751">They want the Poles to be annihilated by the Germans and then will go and kill the Germans.</span> <span id="s752">That was a very courageous thing to make from the Russian side.</span> <span id="s753">But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s754">The Germans killed a lot of Polish people.</span> <span id="s755">And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which were fighting with the Poles, from the rest which remained there between the Poles.</span> <span id="s756">And we have all the news about the uprisings.</span> <span id="s757">There was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours, was sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from London, BBC, they have all the news and the movements of the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s758">And I knew in one day they brought to me, two English pilots, who escaped from the camp, from the German camp, and I had to transport them to the Russians, because the United States had air bases in Russia.</span> <span id="s759">Because the United States were already allies with the Russians.</span> <span id="s760">And I was already, I said already good bye to Fryda and I was already on the way to go.</span> <span id="s761">But in the meantime when they came to the next base they told me not to go farther because the field are mined everywhere.</span> <span id="s762">I will not be able to cross.</span> <span id="s763">So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to Fryda there.</span> <span id="s764">And we are waiting the other four months and then you didn’t need the knowledge, you heared the bombardment with the Russians started on the river there, from a distance to bombard artillery.</span> <span id="s765">And then they started to move.</span> <span id="s766">And that was it.</span> <span id="s767">And so we became so-called liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: One second before we go on, I just want to make sure I understand your… So, you were involved with the AK, but you were also working on a farm?</span> <span id="s769">Is that right?</span> <span id="s770">So how did you?</span> <span id="s771">When did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: In the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Oh, at night time you worked with the AK?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: The AK didn’t work in the day.</span> <span id="s775">They were always working in the nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Were you, you weren’t, were you getting any sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh well I came, it wasn’t until late at night.</span> <span id="s778">It was till twelve, one o’clock.</span> <span id="s779">And then in the day I was sleeping there.</span> <span id="s780">Where we had a shelter with Fryda there, over the pigs there.</span> <span id="s781">We had a shelter there and there we were sleeping.</span> <span id="s782">We had enough sleeping there.</span> <span id="s783">Enough sleeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Did the people who were sheltering you know that you were working…?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s786">They knew that I am AK, and that I am officer, but no, they are not suspicious that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s787">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s788">Because the son, which is studying for priest.</span> <span id="s789">He was by himself, he said, if I will catch a Jew, I will cut in pieces and they should salt on it.</span> <span id="s790">As I said, he was a very, very bad anti-Semite.</span> <span id="s791">His parents were not anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s792">They were very simple peasants.</span> <span id="s793">They didn’t understand and think about it.</span> <span id="s794">Well, they boarded Jews and they went to the shtetl, they had their acquaintance with Jews.</span> <span id="s795">But of course they preferred, they loved the Polish and the Catholic.</span> <span id="s796">It is normal, it is normal.</span> <span id="s797">But they didn’t hate especially the Jews.</span> <span id="s798">But the son, which was already studying priesthood and they knew already, they told him already, at this time they were still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus and so forth.</span> <span id="s799">So, this young priest, no wonder that he hated Jews.</span> <span id="s800">That was indoctrinated.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: So you mentioned the “so-called” liberation.</span> <span id="s802">Did you feel in any way as if you were free?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: It was a very, very, very mixed feeling.</span> <span id="s804">On one side you felt the Russians are coming, you will not be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger.</span> <span id="s805">And then came the reality.</span> <span id="s806">You find out what happened.</span> <span id="s807">Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they killed here, they killed here.</span> <span id="s808">But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were liberated.</span> <span id="s809">When you came to the big city, Krakow, which has before the war, in the war even, in the beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews.</span> <span id="s810">That was a trauma which you couldn’t, you couldn’t hand it.</span> <span id="s811">You were, and you were asking by yourself, why me?</span> <span id="s812">Why didn’t Anna do what I did?</span> <span id="s813">You start to analyze and to understand and those are things that you cannot understand until today.</span> <span id="s814">Because there were wiser people than me, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people.</span> <span id="s815">Why didn’t they survive?</span> <span id="s816">Why didn’t they choose our way?</span> <span id="s817">Was it right we did?</span> <span id="s818">And what is the role we have to play by being alive?</span> <span id="s819">Try to organize a Jewish life, or forget about it?</span> <span id="s820">No Jews, no Jewish life.</span> <span id="s821">You are Polish.</span> <span id="s822">Go on, be a Pole.</span> <span id="s823">And that’s what many Jews do it, did it.</span> <span id="s824">And there are until today Jews which are living as Poles.</span> <span id="s825">They said, “Forget about it.”</span> <span id="s826">But we couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s827">Our roots are too strong.</span> <span id="s828">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s829">We didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s830">We didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s831">We were poor like mices.</span> <span id="s832">We had to look, to find something to eat, not to speak about finding a way to organize your life, to start to be a human being.</span> <span id="s833">You are out of it, you are no human anymore.</span> <span id="s834">You start to realize you live surrounded in animosity.</span> <span id="s835">And you look for some Jews.</span> <span id="s836">And I found some.</span> <span id="s837">I remember the first night we didn’t have where to go.</span> <span id="s838">No home.</span> <span id="s839">But somehow we met somebody.</span> <span id="s840">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s841">I think I knew these people or recognize them as Jews.</span> <span id="s842">And I did ask him, “Who else is here?”</span> <span id="s843">He said, “Come with me.”</span> <span id="s844">And I went with him, or with her better.</span> <span id="s845">And we came in a dark room and there were already several Jewish people, survivors from all kinds of surviving.</span> <span id="s846">And we sit there in this room, in this dark room and started to sing Jewish songs, Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s847">All the Yiddish songs were sad, all were sad.</span> <span id="s848">But in this moment, they were healing.</span> <span id="s849">They were like Balsam on a wound.</span> <span id="s850">Remembrance for a moment, your heritage.</span> <span id="s851">And we passed this night, I don’t remember, on songs and somehow sleeping sitting on a broken couch.</span> <span id="s852">All together there were maybe six, seven people.</span> <span id="s853">And each one with his song, not with story.</span> <span id="s854">We didn’t talk yet about story.</span> <span id="s855">We, somehow, I don’t know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s856">Is it shame or is it… I don’t know.</span> <span id="s857">But we are here.</span> <span id="s858">We left everything behind and we are sitting here.</span> <span id="s859">Nostalgia, remembering Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s860">Don’t think even what to do, where to go farther.</span> <span id="s861">But we woke up in the morning, woke up.</span> <span id="s862">We didn’t take our work clothes.</span> <span id="s863">We were in the clothes which we had, these poor clothes.</span> <span id="s864">We find out from one of them that one of my friends survived.</span> <span id="s865">Where is he?</span> <span id="s866">Who is it?</span> <span id="s867">He was before the war, he was a lady beautician parlor.</span> <span id="s868">Father was a barber, and he had a nice sister.</span> <span id="s869">And I used to come to their house before the war.</span> <span id="s870">And he survived on papers.</span> <span id="s871">But he was already in the Russian intelligence.</span> <span id="s872">Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence.</span> <span id="s873">And somehow I met him.</span> <span id="s874">I don’t remember exactly how.</span> <span id="s875">And I asked him, “What is to do.</span> <span id="s876">Where to go?</span> <span id="s877">I don’t have a house.</span> <span id="s878">I don’t know where to go.”</span> <span id="s879">He said, “I got back my apartment.”</span> <span id="s880">There are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the third floor in the _______________ Jewish section.</span> <span id="s881">But he says, “You can go there.</span> <span id="s882">And somehow we will find there some way to sleep.”</span> <span id="s883">But there were already some people in, which survived Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s884">That was a girl, a boy, and another girl.</span> <span id="s885">And then came other people.</span> <span id="s886">I don’t know who this were.</span> <span id="s887">We all were there, but we didn’t have a bed to sleep.</span> <span id="s888">We slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s889">And I decided, we decided to look around, and we went to my village.</span> <span id="s890">To this older woman, who took us on.</span> <span id="s891">And she fed us, she gave us to eat.</span> <span id="s892">And we left in their house some of our clothes, some of our furnishes.</span> <span id="s893">And she was already, she, not her son, who lived nearby… because my mother, my grandmother, my brother’s sister lived in her house and I lived in the son’s house.</span> <span id="s894">There I make a little clinic there in his house.</span> <span id="s895">And we went there to sleep in the night in his house.</span> <span id="s896">In the night, somebody was knocking at the door and the window.</span> <span id="s897">And there’s, in Russian, “Kroy (ph)!</span> <span id="s898">Open!</span> <span id="s899">You have here Jews!”</span> <span id="s900">He said, “I don’t have Jews.</span> <span id="s901">They are Polish people like you, like we.”</span> <span id="s902">They came in.</span> <span id="s903">He opened, because this was soldiers which were in the camp, where there was once a camp.</span> <span id="s904">There was a field hospital for wounded Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s905">And this were wounded soldiers which were there in this, but they were strong enough to go in between the Poles and to make connections with them.</span> <span id="s906">And I understand, I am not sure, I am ninety-nine percent sure.</span> <span id="s907">They went to the rich Poles where we left a lot of things and he told them to go there, the Jews came here.</span> <span id="s908">You have to kill them, very simple.</span> <span id="s909">And for them to kill a Jew is like kill a German.</span> <span id="s910">They like a soldier, especially a wounded soldier, a front soldier.</span> <span id="s911">And they came in and said, “Are you Jewish?”</span> <span id="s912">And I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Polish Army where I served there were mostly Ukrainians there.</span> <span id="s913">I said, “There’s no Jews here.”</span> <span id="s914">“Who are you?”</span> <span id="s915">We had the papers.</span> <span id="s916">Said, “We are here, only sleeping here.</span> <span id="s917">We are Polish.”</span> <span id="s918">Well, okay, they left.</span> <span id="s919">They went to the house of the mother, the mother’s house and they the same.</span> <span id="s920">“Where are the Jews here?”</span> <span id="s921">“There are no Jews.”</span> <span id="s922">They gave some shots in the air and they left.</span> <span id="s923">In the morning we said to the son of our, we told him to help us to move.</span> <span id="s924">We want to move back to Krakow.</span> <span id="s925">But there was no communication, there was no train.</span> <span id="s926">And I want to take some of this furniture to have something to sleep.</span> <span id="s927">So, he took the horse of his mother and the other horse from a neighbor and a wagon and we started to move to Krakow.</span> <span id="s928">That is about sixty miles from, hundred kilometers, hundred ten kilometers, something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: What had happened to your house in Brzeznica?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Our house was burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: When did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: It was burned.</span> <span id="s933">It happens when we were there still.</span> <span id="s934">After we left, close to the house there was a railway and a spark of this coal fire fell on the house there and it burned.</span> <span id="s935">So, there were not house.</span> <span id="s936">And these Polish people, who used to live in the house, took over our house.</span> <span id="s937">He was living in the barn which was close to it.</span> <span id="s938">There was a horse barn and coal barn and he was living there.</span> <span id="s939">So for us he wasn’t moving out and I didn’t want him and I didn’t want to be there.</span> <span id="s940">So we started the way to go.</span> <span id="s941">And we didn’t want to go with the main road because there still the Russian Army was moving.</span> <span id="s942">And they were taking the horses from the Polish people for their use.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: About when was this?</span> <span id="s944">Do you know the approximate date?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: It was 22nd, no 25th of January, 1945, after the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s946">We start there the way to Krakow.</span> <span id="s947">It is not describable the conditions.</span> <span id="s948">We had to take food for the horses first because you couldn’t buy this.</span> <span id="s949">Nobody would sell it.</span> <span id="s950">The money didn’t have any value anymore.</span> <span id="s951">And the horses, if you don’t feed them, they will not go.</span> <span id="s952">And you have to have the food on the way back, too.</span> <span id="s953">So the most of the wagon was food.</span> <span id="s954">And we took also some of the furniture which we left there and some of clothings we left there, also.</span> <span id="s955">They took it out from the ground, they dig it out.</span> <span id="s956">And they give us back everything, everything.</span> <span id="s957">They were very honest people.</span> <span id="s958">On the way my wife was more dead than alive.</span> <span id="s959">She was fainting and I had to do, to work on her.</span> <span id="s960">And by the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure.</span> <span id="s961">_____________, where the army wasn’t going.</span> <span id="s962">I knew the Polish geography very well.</span> <span id="s963">I know how I will get to Krakow by longer, around ways.</span> <span id="s964">We came to an ort (ph), which was called Zakroczym.</span> <span id="s965">First of all we passed a place which is called Tochow (ph).</span> <span id="s966">At Tochow there used to live a sister of my mother, with her family.</span> <span id="s967">Her husband, her daughter with her husband.</span> <span id="s968">I don’t know how many children she had in the meantime.</span> <span id="s969">And the sons all run away to Russia, and they survived in Russia.</span> <span id="s970">The husband too, the old husband, too.</span> <span id="s971">But he died in Siberia, in Russia.</span> <span id="s972">They all were sent to Siberia to Infada (ph), to Sever (ph), to Jakutz (ph), or Jakutzia (ph).</span> <span id="s973">That was where they banished all the criminals in the older country revolutions there.</span> <span id="s974">With all the history there, there were trees which ten people have to surround it.</span> <span id="s975">Such a tree, such forest.</span> <span id="s976">And they brought them there and they said to them, “Here you have to live.”</span> <span id="s977">No houses.</span> <span id="s978">Their houses were from snow, and their windows were from ice.</span> <span id="s979">And they had to work there, but all right that’s about them.</span> <span id="s980">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s981">But I came to this Tochow.</span> <span id="s982">And I did ask the Polish people there because no Jew was there, “What happens?”</span> <span id="s983">They said, “All were killed and some remained they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.”</span> <span id="s984">That was the end.</span> <span id="s985">No one Jew was there.</span> <span id="s986">No one Jew.</span> <span id="s987">So I continued to the next shtetl which was Zakroczym.</span> <span id="s988">And of course we have to feed the horses.</span> <span id="s989">And we want to come down to move a little bit like I say to you, to try if we can go.</span> <span id="s990">We were sitting on the wagon all the time.</span> <span id="s991">And this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was with us, he was the foreman.</span> <span id="s992">And while we wanted to come down, Fryda fell down on the ground, fainted again.</span> <span id="s993">I save her.</span> <span id="s994">I put her on the ground laying down, make some exercises with her.</span> <span id="s995">Put her on the wagon back, she faint again several times.</span> <span id="s996">And when we fed the horses, we went to continue to go.</span> <span id="s997">But the night approach and in the night you couldn’t, you are not allowed because it is curfew.</span> <span id="s998">The Russians didn’t joke.</span> <span id="s999">Whom they found on the street they killed.</span> <span id="s1000">So, I went to the first Polish house there where there was a little bit space… End of Tape 2, Side B Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Our third tape, so this is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1002">So there came, a woman came out of the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: And she asked me what do I want?</span> <span id="s1004">Said, “We have to go to sleep, to take in.”</span> <span id="s1005">And I took Fryda from the wagon and I tried to put her in and the woman said, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1006">I said, “Well we have to warm her up a little bit, because she is sick.”</span> <span id="s1007">And she looked at her and said, “Well what do you think?</span> <span id="s1008">She is dead already.</span> <span id="s1009">Better one to put in the grave, like she is looking.”</span> <span id="s1010">But I took, outside I found a brick, an old brick.</span> <span id="s1011">I put it, make a fire and warm up the brick and I warm up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1012">And so at this house, on the floor, we slept through until the morning.</span> <span id="s1013">In the morning we start to go, and we went and we came to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1014">We went to this house of our friend there and we put what we have, these little furnishes on the dirt floor.</span> <span id="s1015">This guy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us.</span> <span id="s1016">And he went back with the horses, back to his home, he had to give back the horse to the neighbor.</span> <span id="s1017">That was sacrificing.</span> <span id="s1018">I don’t know how he did it or why he did it.</span> <span id="s1019">It was not human, that was angel work.</span> <span id="s1020">In this time to go back, to endanger the horses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a cart, but he did it.</span> <span id="s1021">And she gave us a little products, half a bread, which was the big peasant breads, and some beans, some barley, and we’ll have something to cook and to eat.</span> <span id="s1022">That was our food at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1023">And so we are being there with all this people around us, other people living there.</span> <span id="s1024">And Fryda went to the house, which was their house before the war, their apartment.</span> <span id="s1025">And there was the janitor of the house, which was the janitor before the war.</span> <span id="s1026">He was a carpenter working in their furniture store.</span> <span id="s1027">A dirty, drunk man.</span> <span id="s1028">And she said to him, “Maybe there will come some post here on this address.</span> <span id="s1029">We are here living…” and she gave the address where we are living.</span> <span id="s1030">And he, “And what will be if I bring you a post from your father?”</span> <span id="s1031">And she says, “Well, you will get a hug and a kiss.”</span> <span id="s1032">He said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s1033">A few days later he came with a card, post card from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1034">And he said, “Pana Fryda (ph), Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.”</span> <span id="s1035">And she give him a kiss and a hug.</span> <span id="s1036">“I got post card from your father.”</span> <span id="s1037">And we have this post card.</span> <span id="s1038">You saw it I guess.</span> <span id="s1039">And he is sick and he asks to come to pick him up.</span> <span id="s1040">In the meantime, I met another acquaintance of me.</span> <span id="s1041">He had a dental office, quite a primitive office, but a dental office in an apartment which wasn’t his.</span> <span id="s1042">It did belong to a Jewish woman before the war.</span> <span id="s1043">She was even the owner of the house.</span> <span id="s1044">And she and her daughter survived.</span> <span id="s1045">But in this moment, she wasn’t there yet.</span> <span id="s1046">She was in a camp somewhere.</span> <span id="s1047">And I met him and I said to him, “What are you doing?”</span> <span id="s1048">And he said, “Well I have here a dental office.</span> <span id="s1049">But I’m leaving this office.</span> <span id="s1050">I want to sell it because I am leaving to the once German territory.</span> <span id="s1051">There I will organize a modern dental office, an apartment and I will be living there.”</span> <span id="s1052">He married, he survived as a partisan.</span> <span id="s1053">He married a Polish, Gentile woman.</span> <span id="s1054">And he lived together with her.</span> <span id="s1055">I guess he had some children with her already.</span> <span id="s1056">But he was, he was a partisan in the Socialistic, not in the AK, in the AL, that was Armia Ludowa.</span> <span id="s1057">That was the Volks party.</span> <span id="s1058">And they were more lenient to the Jews.</span> <span id="s1059">And he was a good fighter.</span> <span id="s1060">He was a strong guy and he was really fighting there, in this army.</span> <span id="s1061">And he said, “My party will help me to organize there.”</span> <span id="s1062">I said to him, “Sell me your office here, for a begin, it will be good for me.”</span> <span id="s1063">He said, “I will not sell you.</span> <span id="s1064">I will rent it to you because maybe I don’t find nothing there.</span> <span id="s1065">I will come back.”</span> <span id="s1066">Said, Okay.</span> <span id="s1067">I can’t give you nothing.</span> <span id="s1068">I don’t have nothing.</span> <span id="s1069">But for the first money what I will make as a dentist I will send it to you somehow.”</span> <span id="s1070">And I start to organize a practice.</span> <span id="s1071">And I had first of all, a room to sleep, a nice room to sleep with a bed, with a couch, quite a nice room and a nice kitchen.</span> <span id="s1072">And that was for the moment a wonderful solution.</span> <span id="s1073">But I started to think, “If he did it, maybe I can do the same.</span> <span id="s1074">I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories, Poland occupies German territories.</span> <span id="s1075">And there were a lot of dentists and dentist equipment and I will organize my clinic there.</span> <span id="s1076">And to live there.”</span> <span id="s1077">And I went there, but I didn’t find nothing which I would like.</span> <span id="s1078">So I left Fryda there.</span> <span id="s1079">We met there another guy, a survivor who was already working for the Polish security, in the Polish security.</span> <span id="s1080">He wrote a book about it.</span> <span id="s1081">He lives here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1082">He became a very rich guy here.</span> <span id="s1083">And he became an officer.</span> <span id="s1084">He survived in his village there.</span> <span id="s1085">However they were trying to kill him from the AK, too.</span> <span id="s1086">But he survived somehow.</span> <span id="s1087">And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month there.</span> <span id="s1088">And the Polish units there sent him to an officer’s school and he became an officer in the Polish security.</span> <span id="s1089">And then when the Russians moved, he moved with them.</span> <span id="s1090">He came to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1091">And he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to the Polish security.</span> <span id="s1092">But while the Russians occupied the German part, they sent him to Wrocław as an officer there of their security.</span> <span id="s1093">And then they send him to Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were.</span> <span id="s1094">And where I was looking for some dental equipment, he was working in his job to look for Germans.</span> <span id="s1095">And we met.</span> <span id="s1096">And we make a recognition as a Jew and he as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1097">We didn’t talk too much about it.</span> <span id="s1098">He said, “What can I do for you?”</span> <span id="s1099">I said, “You can help me to find some…” He said, he’ll try.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: How did you, let me just interrupt briefly.</span> <span id="s1101">How did you make that recognition?</span> <span id="s1102">Was there some special way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: Well, I recognize him as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1104">His name was Polish, Zalewski (ph).</span> <span id="s1105">And when I met him, I said, “Zaleski, but what is your real name?”</span> <span id="s1106">And he was from Kolbuszowa, which was not far from my village, about twelve kilometer.</span> <span id="s1107">That’s about eight miles.</span> <span id="s1108">It was quite close.</span> <span id="s1109">And I knew people from Kolbuszowa.</span> <span id="s1110">And he told me, “My name is Zalschitz (ph), Nafthali Zalschitz.”</span> <span id="s1111">And he was called Tadek Zalewski, Tadeusz Zalewski (ph).</span> <span id="s1112">But I left Fryda with him, and I went back to Krakow to see how to organize life in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1113">I found some instrument which I can use there.</span> <span id="s1114">And when I came to Krakow, I found this, I have to go, well I mix up because I don’t go chronological.</span> <span id="s1115">Before we left I went to Auschwitz to take Father, her father from Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: You went actually to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: It was no more camp there.</span> <span id="s1118">[Phone rings.]</span> <span id="s1119">It was liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1120">That was a card we have that he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: So I went there with the Russian trucks, I went there with taking ammunition to the front.</span> <span id="s1123">There was still war, but Auschwitz was already liberated.</span> <span id="s1124">And he was the one who remained in the hospital there because he couldn’t go farther.</span> <span id="s1125">And he said better, they ask to leave, but he said he preferred to stay here to be burned and not to go.</span> <span id="s1126">And they shoot all the other people who went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Did you, before you, so this is around February 1945, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: It’s January, still January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Okay, did you know, did you know what had happened at Auschwitz at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Well, I knew from Polish accounting, but when I came there I found everything.</span> <span id="s1131">I found everything.</span> <span id="s1132">And when I saw him, I had all the history.</span> <span id="s1133">That was a man who was taller than me and he was fifty-six pounds, I guess.</span> <span id="s1134">I took in a blanket a heap of bones.</span> <span id="s1135">And I was waiting for a truck to take him to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1136">But that was before we left to the occupied territories there.</span> <span id="s1137">And Fryda took care of him, and he came to his quite normal.</span> <span id="s1138">But that was already February when we left for… even more later, maybe March already.</span> <span id="s1139">It is difficult now to remember the dates exactly.</span> <span id="s1140">So we left Father in this apartment where we lived.</span> <span id="s1141">We left to him.</span> <span id="s1142">And we went to look for, find some existence there with the idea maybe we’ll take him over there to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Can we go back?</span> <span id="s1144">I know you already did go forward, but go back to the Auschwitz experience and what you… you mentioned you really discovered what had gone on when you were there.</span> <span id="s1145">What did you experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s1147">All what Father-in-law told us.</span> <span id="s1148">I didn’t have the time and the courage to go to look what happens around.</span> <span id="s1149">But he had enough to recount his stories of what happens during the time.</span> <span id="s1150">But on the way back from this occupied territory to Krakow, I have a car accident.</span> <span id="s1151">And I have broken my leg, my hand here, and I was taken to the hospital instead to go home.</span> <span id="s1152">Somehow I could let know Fryda that I am in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1153">That was everything through people, which are communicating, commuting there and back.</span> <span id="s1154">So, she came back.</span> <span id="s1155">She decided to come back.</span> <span id="s1156">She didn’t have money, not even for to pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting with them.</span> <span id="s1157">But while she was at this friend’s house, he became our good friend, this officer, this Tadek Zalewski.</span> <span id="s1158">His wife, she was Jewish too, she survived also on Christian papers.</span> <span id="s1159">She said, “I can’t give you anything money.”</span> <span id="s1160">She want to give her some jewelry, but Fryda didn’t want to take it.</span> <span id="s1161">But while she was sleeping, she put in her bag a golden bracelet.</span> <span id="s1162">And Fryda when she got up, she said, “What is this yet?</span> <span id="s1163">I didn’t have a bracelet.”</span> <span id="s1164">She said, “Take it, you’ll need it.</span> <span id="s1165">Take it, you’ll need it.</span> <span id="s1166">I don’t need it now.</span> <span id="s1167">Someday you’ll pay me back.”</span> <span id="s1168">I don’t remember if she took it.</span> <span id="s1169">I guess she took it and she came back to me, to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1170">And she had to take care of this poor father and of this poor husband.</span> <span id="s1171">In the meantime, we got connection by mail with a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle Solomon in the United States.</span> <span id="s1172">And when he heard that his brother survived, that we survived, he open… in Krakow, an open account.</span> <span id="s1173">“How much you need, you can have and take.”</span> <span id="s1174">And there was the connection who gave us the possibility to survive further.</span> <span id="s1175">But that was already a few months later, because mail didn’t function so easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: At that time were you really thinking that you wanted to stay in Poland permanently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Well, I didn’t think so much about Poland.</span> <span id="s1178">I didn’t want to stay with the Russians.</span> <span id="s1179">I knew the Russians before.</span> <span id="s1180">Poland I wouldn’t mind, even, to stay, because I had my roots there, you know?</span> <span id="s1181">With all minuses I thought I would be able to organize a good life in Poland, even I thought in my dreams, on our farm.</span> <span id="s1182">I said, I will keep the farm.</span> <span id="s1183">I’ll keep a clinic there, help the people.</span> <span id="s1184">And having a nice living on the farm.</span> <span id="s1185">I love the farm too.</span> <span id="s1186">We have a big farm, a nice farm.</span> <span id="s1187">And it was the nicest farm in the village.</span> <span id="s1188">I thought sometimes that will be okay.</span> <span id="s1189">But when I thought about the Russians and the system of their, when they bring in, I would not have the farm and I would not have my freedom so I start to think to move from Poland somewhere.</span> <span id="s1190">Somewhere, the nearest approach was to Belgium, where Fryda has a brother of her father.</span> <span id="s1191">In the beginning we want to go to Germany, because one of my brothers, who lives now in the United States, came to visit us in Poland.</span> <span id="s1192">He couldn’t take us.</span> <span id="s1193">When he came only for two or three days.</span> <span id="s1194">And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could.</span> <span id="s1195">And he said, “Come in Germany we have apartment.</span> <span id="s1196">You’ll make a living there for time being.</span> <span id="s1197">Come there.”</span> <span id="s1198">And we found a way where they were repatriating German families from Poland to Germany.</span> <span id="s1199">So there was a woman, she came to our house.</span> <span id="s1200">She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish woman from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1201">And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to go to Germany with the German repatriates.</span> <span id="s1202">We left our apartment.</span> <span id="s1203">We went to Katowice, which was on the border to Germany.</span> <span id="s1204">But when we came there, we were there two days, there was no transport going to Germany.</span> <span id="s1205">They already, the last transport left.</span> <span id="s1206">And you have to wait another month or two and I couldn’t wait in Katowice there, so we decided to go back to Krakow there.</span> <span id="s1207">And in Krakow we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a connection which somebody make passports with a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar each passport.</span> <span id="s1208">And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five hundred.</span> <span id="s1209">But we could get a transit visa through Belgium, because there was no straight flights.</span> <span id="s1210">There was no flight at all.</span> <span id="s1211">You have to go by train to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1212">And from Belgium you could have gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica.</span> <span id="s1213">But when we came to Belgium, we remained in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1214">And we stayed in Belgium for five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Were you originally planning on making the entire trip to Costa Rica or was your intention to just stay in Belgium and not go any further?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: My intention was to stay in Belgium, but even in Belgium I didn’t want to stay.</span> <span id="s1217">1948 when Israel was declared independent state, I was doing everything possible to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1218">I said I don’t want… the uncle sent us papers, everything to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1219">He wanted to pay for my studies here and to upkeep us until I make my diploma here, but I didn’t want to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1220">I want to go home, because after all I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1221">There we have a state.</span> <span id="s1222">I don’t want anymore to be a stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Did you ever consider making aliyah before Israel was a state and going illegally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: To be candid, we in our villages, it’s more my nephews, organized a Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s1225">And I was quasi a member of this organization.</span> <span id="s1226">But my brother was an active member and he even made ha-shorah (ph).</span> <span id="s1227">He was a farmer and he wanted to go before the war.</span> <span id="s1228">But my mother, even before the war, somehow she said, “There is no future in Poland for Jews, let us go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s1229">It was not yet Israel, still Palestine.</span> <span id="s1230">Said, “You are a farmer,” she said to father, “and the farmers are well off there.”</span> <span id="s1231">It was another kind of farming there.</span> <span id="s1232">“We will make somehow money here from our farm.”</span> <span id="s1233">We could make then, that was a lot of money for our farm, ten thousand dollars.</span> <span id="s1234">With ten thousand dollars in Israel you could do a lot, you could do a lot.</span> <span id="s1235">But my father said, “No, I don’t want.”</span> <span id="s1236">He was much older than my mother.</span> <span id="s1237">My mother was young.</span> <span id="s1238">With so many children he said, “I’m sure it will be difficult and impossible to make existence there.”</span> <span id="s1239">And he didn’t want to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s1240">He was orthodox Jew.</span> <span id="s1241">He said, “I will go to Israel when Messiah will come.”</span> <span id="s1242">No Zionists.</span> <span id="s1243">And my brother was prepared to go, but then there came the war and he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1244">And so my nephews wanted to go and no one of them did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">End of Tape 3, Side A Tape 3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Okay, it’s now May 30, 2000, and we’re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber.</span> <span id="s1247">And why don’t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your liberation.</span> <span id="s1248">And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how afterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s1249">And then you described going back to your hometown and then back to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1250">The thing that I wasn’t sure about, that I didn’t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the town where you were after liberation?</span> <span id="s1251">And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were staying with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which we had.</span> <span id="s1253">We were, as I told you, living as Christians.</span> <span id="s1254">And the liberation came.</span> <span id="s1255">We couldn’t enjoy our liberation or country.</span> <span id="s1256">It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our lives.</span> <span id="s1257">That was the liberation.</span> <span id="s1258">And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences between people who survived camps and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very different.</span> <span id="s1259">We have two things to overcome.</span> <span id="s1260">The first is, which we had all the time, that was the fight for existence and how to survive, of course.</span> <span id="s1261">And the next, when the liberation came was the shock to find the reality.</span> <span id="s1262">You don’t have where to go.</span> <span id="s1263">You couldn’t find nobody you know, or anybody of your people.</span> <span id="s1264">You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the place where you were.</span> <span id="s1265">We were in a village, not in a town.</span> <span id="s1266">We were in a village.</span> <span id="s1267">And if I… realize it was a hostage village.</span> <span id="s1268">They were not sympathetic to Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s1269">However I survived, not a Jew, but suddenly I felt that I am back a Jew.</span> <span id="s1270">But I couldn’t officially declare it.</span> <span id="s1271">I had to stay on my Aryan papers.</span> <span id="s1272">And how to go and where to go?</span> <span id="s1273">Because to go to my other village where I was born there, I wasn’t sure that I will be accepted.</span> <span id="s1274">And I wasn’t sure to go to Krakow, for example, because I didn’t have where to go.</span> <span id="s1275">Even not where to sleep at night.</span> <span id="s1276">And you don’t have money.</span> <span id="s1277">And you don’t have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out whatever you had.</span> <span id="s1278">So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so-called liberation was the terrible hit of the reality.</span> <span id="s1279">You were hit with the reality.</span> <span id="s1280">Not where to go and not what to do and how to start.</span> <span id="s1281">Will you be accepted as a Jew?</span> <span id="s1282">You cannot go on and to say you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to the places where I used to live.</span> <span id="s1283">And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were before, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer.</span> <span id="s1284">To watch the horse and the cows.</span> <span id="s1285">In reality I was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1286">I want to go back.</span> <span id="s1287">I didn’t have nothing with me, but I have to go to start to look for our existence.</span> <span id="s1288">And as I said before already that part, I went to the village where I was born, and then later when they went with us to Krakow, all this trouble I have with Fryda and when I came to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1289">But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very simple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together.</span> <span id="s1290">But when I came to Krakow, when I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different places, start to organize my life.</span> <span id="s1291">And with the help of the uncle which came, we went to Belgium as I said.</span> <span id="s1292">And in Belgium we became refugees.</span> <span id="s1293">We became as one of the United Nations refugees.</span> <span id="s1294">We registered there and I have my register card as a refugee from the United Nations.</span> <span id="s1295">And I got the permit because I had a visa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through Belgium.</span> <span id="s1296">But because I was recognized as a refugee, they gave me time to stay three months there.</span> <span id="s1297">In three months I had to renew my stay in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1298">And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the etranger (ph), police etranger.</span> <span id="s1299">And they gave us another stay of three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Okay, before we go on into Belgium, I just wanted to ask another question about the liberation time.</span> <span id="s1301">I’ve forgotten the name of the family that was sheltering you right at the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1302">What was their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: The Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Soltys.</span> <span id="s1306">Soltys.</span> <span id="s1307">That was a woman, a widow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: They were the ones in your hometown, right?</span> <span id="s1309">But at the time of the liberation what was the name of the woman that you were staying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Oh that was a man, that was Muschau.</span> <span id="s1311">He was recognized as a righteous man, the righteous between people.</span> <span id="s1312">I gave him to Yad Vashem, and he is recognized.</span> <span id="s1313">He was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1314">He helped us all the time, even the time when he didn’t suspect us as Jews, he was all the time very human and very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: I thought you were staying with his sister right there.</span> <span id="s1316">You were actually staying with him right at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: We stayed with the sister, but it was a very terrible accident.</span> <span id="s1318">The last, the last bullet, the Russian bullet got his hand, his left hand.</span> <span id="s1319">Because his house was on the, on the border.</span> <span id="s1320">Where the front was standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was the Dunajec river.</span> <span id="s1321">And he was close to this river, not far.</span> <span id="s1322">So he decided, the frontier between the Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to this place.</span> <span id="s1323">And his house was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he opened the door, a bullet cut his left hand.</span> <span id="s1324">And he was bleeding and because he knew that the underground station, sanitary station was in my place, so he decided that the neighbor took him on a wagon and he brought him to me there to give him first help.</span> <span id="s1325">And I cut him.</span> <span id="s1326">It was hanging on the skin, this hand.</span> <span id="s1327">I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn’t bleed out and I went back with him together and brought him to his house.</span> <span id="s1328">And there I found out a really surgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house.</span> <span id="s1329">I gave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chloroform.</span> <span id="s1330">But most anesthesia was I gave him alcohol.</span> <span id="s1331">We had there moonshine, moonshine.</span> <span id="s1332">And he was drinking so he was out of conscious.</span> <span id="s1333">And this surgeon bind him, all these veins and arteries.</span> <span id="s1334">First of all, he cut him a little bit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it there it started, it is very fast process.</span> <span id="s1335">He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he survived.</span> <span id="s1336">And then I didn’t go more to the place of the sister, but I stayed with him and took care on him all the time.</span> <span id="s1337">So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to him.</span> <span id="s1338">So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Was Fryda with you then too?</span> <span id="s1340">With him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: No, for the first two days she stayed still with the sister there.</span> <span id="s1342">But later on she came here, we brought here.</span> <span id="s1343">The front was standing there for a moment.</span> <span id="s1344">There was a fight there.</span> <span id="s1345">The Germans run away.</span> <span id="s1346">They left only some guns, automatic shooters.</span> <span id="s1347">And these were not origin Germans.</span> <span id="s1348">This were Russians which were collaborated with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1349">And they were making the last fights with the German.</span> <span id="s1350">And there in this house just, we were there.</span> <span id="s1351">The Germans caught the first Russian soldiers who came in, and they bind them together and they put a grenade between them and they kill them there, on the garbage there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Did you see that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: I saw it later, after I saw them there.</span> <span id="s1354">The Germans came in, you can come take in the shoes if you need from this people.</span> <span id="s1355">And then the Germans escape, of course.</span> <span id="s1356">That was the end of this fight there.</span> <span id="s1357">And after several days we went there, to the sister there.</span> <span id="s1358">We took a little bit of what we had, our clothings and we left there, from there.</span> <span id="s1359">And then we are looking on occasion somehow to go to Krakow and to go to my village there and to organize this life like I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: But even though the war had ended and you were supposedly liberated, you didn’t tell these people that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No, I didn’t tell them and for a long time they didn’t know, until… I don’t know exactly when they started to realize that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1362">But when the war passed my village where I was, the war continued.</span> <span id="s1363">It was January twenty-one and the war was continued until, as you know, until May.</span> <span id="s1364">So here was all the time moving Russian trucks and armaments and soldiers.</span> <span id="s1365">That was the only way, with the soldiers for a bottle of vodka, which we could have some commuting to Krakow or to the other villages.</span> <span id="s1366">It was also very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1367">They were also not very sympathetic to Jews.</span> <span id="s1368">Sometimes Fryda stand in the line to get a ride to the village there for some food to these Polish people.</span> <span id="s1369">So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride.</span> <span id="s1370">So the Russian driver which was taking said, “You yes, you can go.</span> <span id="s1371">You yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1372">But you no, no Jews, no Jews, no Jews.”</span> <span id="s1373">Even the Russian soldier.</span> <span id="s1374">So there is no big difference between one and the other one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: So you really didn’t feel then that the Russians were any safer to live with than the Germans had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: First of all, they didn’t realize who is a Jew or no, except that they really recognize by physiognomy, they saw it is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1377">And then in reality they were not more, well they didn’t have in their program to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s1378">That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don’t know, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or Lithuanians or Latvians.</span> <span id="s1379">There were all kinds of soldiers there.</span> <span id="s1380">So that was more individual and then it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew.</span> <span id="s1381">The Russians didn’t hesitate to kill a Jew, too.</span> <span id="s1382">However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit in the Russian Army.</span> <span id="s1383">In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many… five was many.</span> <span id="s1384">Because we used already without Jews here in this side, the German side.</span> <span id="s1385">But there were some Jews and the times when the Jews didn’t hear, you could hear… I understand Russian and Ukrainian, too.</span> <span id="s1386">So, I could hear how they were expressing themselves anti-Semitic even to their officers and to their sergeants.</span> <span id="s1387">“These dirty Jews,” and so forth.</span> <span id="s1388">So this is the reality like it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: Okay, then you were saying a little earlier about Belgium, then.</span> <span id="s1390">And you were there as refugees and you had to be registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: In this village, I came to my village where I was origin.</span> <span id="s1392">And I told you already before in this story, that they send in somebody to kill us.</span> <span id="s1393">And I didn’t go back there to my village anymore.</span> <span id="s1394">Fryda went several times for food, but she never slept there.</span> <span id="s1395">She went to the shtetl and in the shtetl were already three or four Jewish families.</span> <span id="s1396">And between them was one, my niece, she lived there.</span> <span id="s1397">She came there back to the shtetl there, and she had already a room there and she slept with her.</span> <span id="s1398">And the next day she came back to Krakow.</span> <span id="s1399">When she left I wasn’t sure I will see her tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1400">It was a difficult time even after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1401">Even after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: You mentioned last time about the group of people, the group of survivors that you were together with.</span> <span id="s1403">Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: That was already in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1405">Well, you cannot say group, they formed a group.</span> <span id="s1406">They find each other and because one of them has a place, so we came there.</span> <span id="s1407">We could there sleep at night.</span> <span id="s1408">And with no soldier, we were sitting and singing old Yiddish songs because we couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s1409">The horror on our heads was so terrible that we couldn’t sleep even.</span> <span id="s1410">Like taking, by the time, how to spend the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Were these people that you had known before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1413">I never knew.</span> <span id="s1414">I never knew these people.</span> <span id="s1415">I never knew these people.</span> <span id="s1416">That was only two or three days, until, as I told you, we find the place of my friends there, which they were already coming survivors from Auschwitz after the liberation.</span> <span id="s1417">Young people which were living together there.</span> <span id="s1418">Sleeping there on the floor for a time.</span> <span id="s1419">Somehow that you have, because in the evening there was curfew.</span> <span id="s1420">You couldn’t go in the street, you have to be someplace.</span> <span id="s1421">So that was the place where we could run away.</span> <span id="s1422">And that was a very happy occasion to go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Okay, do you want to skip ahead then and talk about Belgium?</span> <span id="s1424">Because we talked, that’s where we left off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Well when we came to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1426">We founded there, because we came with Fryda’s father, he found there his brother, who survived in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1427">And he used to live in Antwerp before the war and he was in Antwerp quite a known person.</span> <span id="s1428">He was in the diamond business.</span> <span id="s1429">And he was poor, but he already contact his other brother, younger brother in Holland, in England.</span> <span id="s1430">The youngest brother, who changed his name from Himmelblau to Hill.</span> <span id="s1431">And then he became recognized by the Queen as a British officer, decorated.</span> <span id="s1432">And he already makes good business.</span> <span id="s1433">He was quite already a rich man.</span> <span id="s1434">And he did help him.</span> <span id="s1435">And also this uncle from the United States, he opened us a place in Antwerp where we can take the money, how to survive our time.</span> <span id="s1436">But I didn’t want to be supported.</span> <span id="s1437">I organize, even illegal, a little clinic, and I treated Jewish patients, refugees who came there.</span> <span id="s1438">And there was a yeshiva, an orthodox yeshiva, which I treat without money this all students there.</span> <span id="s1439">And I don’t know if I told you, one day came in a student.</span> <span id="s1440">And you know whoever it comes you started to talk, “Where from are you?</span> <span id="s1441">How do you survive?</span> <span id="s1442">Where did you been?”</span> <span id="s1443">And there came in a yeshiva boy.</span> <span id="s1444">A nice, pretty wonderful boy.</span> <span id="s1445">And I ask him, “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s1446">And he said, “Well, I am from Krakow.”</span> <span id="s1447">“From Krakow?</span> <span id="s1448">We are also from Krakow.”</span> <span id="s1449">“Yes?”</span> <span id="s1450">He was happy to hear that we are from Krakow.</span> <span id="s1451">“Where did you live in Krakow?”</span> <span id="s1452">He said, “Well in Diver (ph) Street, number four,” and this house was the Himmelblau house of the house of my wife’s family.</span> <span id="s1453">And I remembered his father.</span> <span id="s1454">And Fryda knew his brothers and sisters, they were living in the same house for so many years.</span> <span id="s1455">And he started to cry and Fryda started to cry.</span> <span id="s1456">I called in Fryda.</span> <span id="s1457">In my clinic, I had a corner in my bedroom where I put in an engine, a foot engine and actually did the patients, somehow.</span> <span id="s1458">But slowly I make a living off it and I had a possibility to make a decent living.</span> <span id="s1459">So, I stopped the help of my uncle.</span> <span id="s1460">I didn’t want to be supported.</span> <span id="s1461">In the meantime, as we have been there for close to two years, Israel was established.</span> <span id="s1462">And I was already connected with the Zionist organization there in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1463">I was a member of the committee there.</span> <span id="s1464">So I said, “I want to go to Israel.”</span> <span id="s1465">Well, Fryda’s father didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1466">He preferred to stay in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1467">Well, he knew the languages and he had his brother there and he had the support from this two brothers, so he decided he will not go with us.</span> <span id="s1468">In the meantime, our son was born.</span> <span id="s1469">He was already two years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Henry Edward.</span> <span id="s1472">He lives now in Texas, in Austin, Texas.</span> <span id="s1473">He grew up in Israel.</span> <span id="s1474">My uncle from the United States sent us a visa and he even want us to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s1475">And he’ll pay our upkeep, my studies, so that I will be independent and we can live in the United States.</span> <span id="s1476">But I found that our place, after all we survived and surpassed, my place is Israel.</span> <span id="s1477">This is the only place for a Jewish person to live.</span> <span id="s1478">That was my conviction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">End of Tape 3, Side B Tape 4, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: This is tape number four, side A.</span> <span id="s1481">Did you, did you have, what kind of experience did you have in Belgium, just as far as… were you just working all the time?</span> <span id="s1482">Or were you having any leisure time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Oh yeah, leisure time enough.</span> <span id="s1484">And as I said, I was an active Zionist, too.</span> <span id="s1485">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: How were you active?</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">A: Well, organizing young people who came there, many refugees from Poland, from Russia, from Germany.</span> <span id="s1488">They start to come from all places there.</span> <span id="s1489">And then they came from Israel.</span> <span id="s1490">There was the Israel soldiers which are serving in the British Army.</span> <span id="s1491">They were in Europe and Germany and everywhere there was fighting against the Germans.</span> <span id="s1492">And they are the people who helped us to organize the people to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1493">And quite a number of them went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1494">Some of them remained in Belgium, some went to Australia, some went to America.</span> <span id="s1495">But as I later heard, many of these young people who went to Israel became soldiers, even they were unexperienced soldiers, only to fight for freedom.</span> <span id="s1496">And most of them were killed in this fight because they were not experienced soldiers.</span> <span id="s1497">But Israel need everyone there in this time.</span> <span id="s1498">It was a very hard time there in Israel, too.</span> <span id="s1499">And when I decide we are going, we organize.</span> <span id="s1500">We brought everything, because in Israel we knew there is nothing, refrigerators and the stove, furniture, hardware, what we need for the kitchen for a living.</span> <span id="s1501">We took everything.</span> <span id="s1502">We took several lifts and we went to Marseilles by train.</span> <span id="s1503">And from Marseilles we went by boat, by the Kadma (ph).</span> <span id="s1504">It was quite a nice boat.</span> <span id="s1505">And that was my son’s second birthday on this ship.</span> <span id="s1506">The captain make him a party, well, kind of party, a reception for our son there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Q: What was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: That was April the 6th.</span> <span id="s1509">My son was born April the 6th.</span> <span id="s1510">So, we left Marseilles April the 5th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: 1948.</span> <span id="s1513">No, 1951, excuse me.</span> <span id="s1514">1951, because ‘49 our son was born.</span> <span id="s1515">When Fryda was pregnant we didn’t want to go for this experience.</span> <span id="s1516">We were waiting that he will be able to make this transport.</span> <span id="s1517">In April of ‘51 we left for Israel.</span> <span id="s1518">We were so far fortunate that our friend from Antwerp, who is also from Krakow, left for Israel a year before us.</span> <span id="s1519">And he rented a house there with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1520">And they invited us that we would be able to stay with them for the first day until we find a place to stay.</span> <span id="s1521">Because that was no other way.</span> <span id="s1522">And we came to them, we stayed with them.</span> <span id="s1523">And the lift arrived.</span> <span id="s1524">There was a yard there, we could put the lift there.</span> <span id="s1525">We were searching for an apartment.</span> <span id="s1526">And we rented an apartment, which was a living room and a bedroom, a hall, a kitchen and a bathroom.</span> <span id="s1527">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: What town was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: What town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Givataim, a suburb of Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1532">We didn’t want to go to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1533">First of all, it’s a big town and everybody was going to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1534">And that was a settlement which was in development and that was, to compare, a little bit cheaper.</span> <span id="s1535">And I didn’t have enough money to buy an apartment.</span> <span id="s1536">We rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s1537">And we organized there.</span> <span id="s1538">I organized in these three rooms, the hall was the waiting room, the bedroom was the clinic.</span> <span id="s1539">And there was a bed which was in the day, closed like a cabinet.</span> <span id="s1540">In the day I could accept patients.</span> <span id="s1541">And the living room was the bedroom for us.</span> <span id="s1542">We were sleeping there in the bedroom.</span> <span id="s1543">And the child was there.</span> <span id="s1544">There was a terrace.</span> <span id="s1545">It was nice.</span> <span id="s1546">After working there about two years we rented, just close, became free another big room and a kitchen and a little hall.</span> <span id="s1547">So we rented this, and… excuse me.</span> <span id="s1548">We bought it.</span> <span id="s1549">I bought it.</span> <span id="s1550">In the meantime I bought this apartment where you are renting.</span> <span id="s1551">I bought this apartment.</span> <span id="s1552">And I made of both of them one bigger apartment and a separate clinic.</span> <span id="s1553">And life became more comfortable.</span> <span id="s1554">We organized a very nice apartment and a very nice living in this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: When you said you came to realize that the only place that you as a Jew could be at home was in Israel, what had happened after the war that made you come to that conclusion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Well maybe it is not known in the world and people are more concentrated on Poland and Polish anti-Semites in Germany.</span> <span id="s1557">But Belgium, which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish case… in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an apartment for rent, it was in the windows written, “Not for foreigners.”</span> <span id="s1558">And that meant not for Jews.</span> <span id="s1559">In some of the apartments was written exactly what I said, “No Jews.”</span> <span id="s1560">And I in the meantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was more French.</span> <span id="s1561">But Antwerp was Flandria.</span> <span id="s1562">That was the the part of… Belgium has two nations, Valonia and Flandria.</span> <span id="s1563">The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic.</span> <span id="s1564">They were German oriented.</span> <span id="s1565">Valonians were more French oriented.</span> <span id="s1566">And Jews which were saved in Belgium, they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian.</span> <span id="s1567">In Flandria there was impossible to survive.</span> <span id="s1568">We came, rented an apartment.</span> <span id="s1569">And still we were all the time renting there.</span> <span id="s1570">And that was a nice apartment.</span> <span id="s1571">We love it.</span> <span id="s1572">And the administrator showed us the apartment and the conditions where it was not expensive.</span> <span id="s1573">It was nice and the place was nice.</span> <span id="s1574">And when it came to write the lease, he says, “Yes, but you are not strangers.”</span> <span id="s1575">And we said, “Yes, we are strangers.</span> <span id="s1576">We are from Poland.”</span> <span id="s1577">And he said, “But you are not Jews?”</span> <span id="s1578">I said, “Yes, we are Jews.”</span> <span id="s1579">So, “I am sorry, I have instructions from my… I am not the owner, from the owner, no Jews.</span> <span id="s1580">I am sorry, no Jews.”</span> <span id="s1581">And that gave me a lot to think about it.</span> <span id="s1582">Around you see no friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews.</span> <span id="s1583">So that means there is no place to live here for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1584">However there is a lot Jews remained there and lived there.</span> <span id="s1585">They didn’t care about it.</span> <span id="s1586">But I was, I don’t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem.</span> <span id="s1587">I said, “No, I don’t want to be, that can happen the same everywhere.”</span> <span id="s1588">And therefore I decided to go home.</span> <span id="s1589">I said, “That’s the one place where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live.</span> <span id="s1590">You have all the rights.”</span> <span id="s1591">And that was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Was there a particular organization that you were working with in Brussels?</span> <span id="s1593">A Zionist organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Yeah, it was the general Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s1595">General Zionist movement.</span> <span id="s1596">Not labor, not revisionist, general Zionist.</span> <span id="s1597">That was in this time a general Zionist organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: You mentioned in your last interview, I believe, that you had spent some time studying in Germany as well.</span> <span id="s1599">Was that, did that happen after you had gone to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1601">After I became involved in my profession.</span> <span id="s1602">In the dental association I became one of the active members in the management of the organization.</span> <span id="s1603">I became vice-president of the organization of the dental association in Israel.</span> <span id="s1604">And because a big part of Jewish dentists in Israel, their origin was countries where they spoke German.</span> <span id="s1605">If it was Czechoslovakia, even Poland, they spoke more German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German.</span> <span id="s1606">And there was a necessity, there was not world literature in Hebrew in this profession.</span> <span id="s1607">And we were interested as these people became more educated and more acquainted in the profession, which made progress terrible.</span> <span id="s1608">Progress during the five years and then later on and on all the time.</span> <span id="s1609">And there was English literature, which the people didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1610">I spoke already a little bit English, but not enough to be fluent in literature or to give a lecture in English.</span> <span id="s1611">The University has some professors which were lecturing in English.</span> <span id="s1612">But for the mass, I mean for the majority of the dentists it wasn’t understandable.</span> <span id="s1613">So we needed German-speaking lectures.</span> <span id="s1614">And time by time, we start to bring in from Germany lecturers, professors.</span> <span id="s1615">And so I became acquainted with these professors.</span> <span id="s1616">And we started to exchange normal relations between them.</span> <span id="s1617">So we started organize even at the universities in Germany, some courses for the occasion, for progress, for professional progress.</span> <span id="s1618">So we make a course in Bonn.</span> <span id="s1619">We make a course in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1620">We make a course in Munich.</span> <span id="s1621">We make a course in Marburg on the Lahn.</span> <span id="s1622">It was in Frankfurt also some courses.</span> <span id="s1623">Some from time to time there were a group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it, who are going only for education there.</span> <span id="s1624">And that was the reason.</span> <span id="s1625">And so I went with this group there.</span> <span id="s1626">And I went to Bonn where I stayed for three months there.</span> <span id="s1627">And I make my, my graduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg.</span> <span id="s1628">That was the two universities.</span> <span id="s1629">Marburg was a general university and Bonn was only a dental school.</span> <span id="s1630">So here we got a dental license as a dental practitioner license and here you make your doctor up in Marburg.</span> <span id="s1631">So you are a doctor and a dentist, both of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">Q: So up until that point you hadn’t actually been a doctor until you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">A: No, I haven’t been a doctor until this time.</span> <span id="s1634">I be only a dentist, a licensed dentist in Poland.</span> <span id="s1635">A licensed dentist in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: And how did it feel to, as a Jew, to be doing these studies in Germany after what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: In general, the staff of the university, of each of these universities, they were very, very forthcoming and they were very gentle and very willingly to help us.</span> <span id="s1638">Even we knew that some of them were with a Nazi past.</span> <span id="s1639">The more Nazi they were before the war or during the war, the more forthcoming they were after the war.</span> <span id="s1640">They didn’t know, they said, about anything what happened before.</span> <span id="s1641">And they were always good with Jews and they had good relations and even there at the university there were professors Jews and so forth.</span> <span id="s1642">In Bonn, for example, the head of the school was Professor Kirkhaus, which was known that he was a member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s1643">And he was the first one who quit the Jewish professor who was there.</span> <span id="s1644">I don’t remember this moment what his name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: So you’re there for three months and you’re studying in a German university.</span> <span id="s1646">Did you feel angry?</span> <span id="s1647">Or did you form any friendships with any Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: I can hardly say that you were angry, because nobody forced you to go.</span> <span id="s1649">You have to, to have your attitude, you come there, you have to accept the reality.</span> <span id="s1650">Of course, you knew exactly that you are stepping on the burning ground.</span> <span id="s1651">You know this is not the place where you should be.</span> <span id="s1652">But it is not only there.</span> <span id="s1653">You start to think with the real terms even then already.</span> <span id="s1654">This is the reality of life and this is the future of life.</span> <span id="s1655">If you want to separate and if you want to be somebody else, chosen for something.</span> <span id="s1656">There is no place for you on this world.</span> <span id="s1657">You have to accommodate it to the future life.</span> <span id="s1658">And this is the future life.</span> <span id="s1659">This is the future.</span> <span id="s1660">Now you see what happens.</span> <span id="s1661">Israel has relations with Germany, with France.</span> <span id="s1662">However we know there are still a lot of anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1663">And they are everywhere.</span> <span id="s1664">They are everywhere.</span> <span id="s1665">But they are not because they are special anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1666">There are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians, there are anti, all kinds of antis.</span> <span id="s1667">This is the reality of the world now.</span> <span id="s1668">You know, it sometimes is for me difficult to accept the general view of the Jewish world about the Polish anti-Semites, about Poland.</span> <span id="s1669">I born in Poland.</span> <span id="s1670">I got my education in Poland.</span> <span id="s1671">I lived there.</span> <span id="s1672">And I was a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s1673">And so were many, the majority.</span> <span id="s1674">There were some Jews which didn’t accept never that they are Poles.</span> <span id="s1675">And to say that the Poles were all anti-Semites, I will not put this category, put them in this category.</span> <span id="s1676">There were some interests.</span> <span id="s1677">And people are behaving very often, very different in different situations.</span> <span id="s1678">But to say a priori all the Polish are anti-Semites, it is exaggerated.</span> <span id="s1679">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s1680">It’s not true.</span> <span id="s1681">But the same you can say about Jews.</span> <span id="s1682">They are anti-Arabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this.</span> <span id="s1683">There are Jews who are anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1684">Everything exists.</span> <span id="s1685">But mainly I don’t know how to categorize it, even with my most sophisticated thinking, I think in every human body there is some anti, some anti.</span> <span id="s1686">Anti- this, anti-him, anti, is it anti-blacks or some blacks?</span> <span id="s1687">Or anti-yellows or just some yellows?</span> <span id="s1688">Anti-Asians.</span> <span id="s1689">There is in every human being, there is an anti.</span> <span id="s1690">But you have to come to some point that you are living in this world, which is very differentiated and if you will not accept this, there is no place for you.</span> <span id="s1691">Because every day brings surprises.</span> <span id="s1692">We are not done with wars.</span> <span id="s1693">We are not done with discriminations.</span> <span id="s1694">It was, it is and it will be forever, forever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: When you first moved to Israel did you feel, I mean there you were among your own people, did you feel a sense of relief or a sense of being at home as you had hoped to feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Well, this question is a very sensitive question.</span> <span id="s1697">When you came to Israel, how difficult it is to say, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in Israel and newcomers in Israel.</span> <span id="s1698">Like everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger.</span> <span id="s1699">You are a stranger for a while until you are not accommodating to the reality.</span> <span id="s1700">And then some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after establishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there’s still differences between born Israelis, longest living Israelis and new coming Israelis.</span> <span id="s1701">Is it good?</span> <span id="s1702">It is reality.</span> <span id="s1703">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1704">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1705">Maybe it is human nature.</span> <span id="s1706">It’s this kind of jealousy.</span> <span id="s1707">But in the beginning when you came in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in Israel, living in Israel, not born in Israel, but living in Israel for many years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland, Russia, maybe Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1708">Some came from Germany, too.</span> <span id="s1709">Zionists.</span> <span id="s1710">They felt the elite, and you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive?</span> <span id="s1711">You must have done something which is not right, that you could survive the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1712">Because my parents, my uncle, my grandparents, my brother, my sister, they were killed.</span> <span id="s1713">Everybody.</span> <span id="s1714">Nobody is here.</span> <span id="s1715">And you survive.</span> <span id="s1716">You must be guilt of something.</span> <span id="s1717">You have to feel this guilt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: Did people actually say that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: I heard it.</span> <span id="s1720">It wasn’t meant maybe special straight to me, but I heard it.</span> <span id="s1721">I heard it in a quite clear voice.</span> <span id="s1722">These people who survive, they were collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1723">And that gave you a very, very strange feeling, very bad feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Will you say a little bit more about how you dealt with that?</span> <span id="s1725">I mean you had such high hopes of finding a place where you would really be at home.</span> <span id="s1726">Did you, how did you deal with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: I was maybe more fortunate than the majority of this newcomers.</span> <span id="s1728">First of all, because I was involved in the Zionist organization and secondly because I knew the language.</span> <span id="s1729">And that gave me a very great advantage not to be singled out.</span> <span id="s1730">That was worse with people who couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s1731">And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in German, and the Israeli-born children didn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1732">They didn’t want to speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1733">I think they’re quite chauvinistic.</span> <span id="s1734">I think they are quite chauvinistic.</span> <span id="s1735">And the same thing can be said about the long living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1736">They were maybe not so chauvinistic as they were the best one, the good one.</span> <span id="s1737">“We came here and we built this country.</span> <span id="s1738">We fought for this country and we gave us a country.”</span> <span id="s1739">You know, that was also a very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1740">A very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1741">But with the time you got used to all kind of treatment in your society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">End of Tape 4, Side A Tape 4, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: This is tape four, side B.</span> <span id="s1744">Who were your friends then, mostly other refugees when you were in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: It’s not only me, but usually people are always closer to their landsmen.</span> <span id="s1746">Coming from Poland, get with the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1747">Coming from Hungary, are living with the Hungarians because of the language.</span> <span id="s1748">I cannot say.</span> <span id="s1749">We had people from different, from Hungary, from Romania, from Czechoslovakia, from Germany.</span> <span id="s1750">And in reality, the most educated people which we met in Israel, which were the leading intelligentsia in Israel, they were original from these countries.</span> <span id="s1751">From Germany, coming from Germany.</span> <span id="s1752">Because the aliyah which came to Israel from the Arab countries, they were merchandise mostly.</span> <span id="s1753">Very, very, very few which were professionals.</span> <span id="s1754">They all business men, all handy people, making something for a living.</span> <span id="s1755">But in general, there were the poor people who came, that were the first who came into Israel.</span> <span id="s1756">That was the big problem.</span> <span id="s1757">They didn’t have the language and they didn’t have the… for them life was very difficult when they came poor.</span> <span id="s1758">So there was difficult for apartment.</span> <span id="s1759">They built temporary shelters for them.</span> <span id="s1760">And they were living in these shelters for several years until they somehow came out there.</span> <span id="s1761">There are some of them living until today.</span> <span id="s1762">Some of them built houses on the places where the shelter houses were.</span> <span id="s1763">They allowed them to build, so they gave them… because most of the land were belonging to the Keren Kayemeth.</span> <span id="s1764">So they allowed them, these people to settle on this places because the government wasn’t able to give them stable living.</span> <span id="s1765">So there are some slobs until today and there are some which built nice houses.</span> <span id="s1766">And of course, with the time, the new generation there went to school and they make progress.</span> <span id="s1767">And a lot of them came with their religious leaders, with their Rabbis.</span> <span id="s1768">And then they settled in their own circles.</span> <span id="s1769">And this is now Israel’s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem.</span> <span id="s1770">With the Sephardic, Sephardic those are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people.</span> <span id="s1771">They don’t have nothing to do with Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from Spain.</span> <span id="s1772">But generally they are Arabic Jews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1773">And they arrange their life very nice.</span> <span id="s1774">And they make terrible progress, very, very nice progress.</span> <span id="s1775">But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never be solved in my opinion.</span> <span id="s1776">That’s war… my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War.</span> <span id="s1777">And that was one of the main reasons that he left Israel.</span> <span id="s1778">He said he had enough of wars, when he came to the United States for studying his business, so he found that he would be better here.</span> <span id="s1779">And he stayed here.</span> <span id="s1780">And therefore we are here.</span> <span id="s1781">We came after him, otherwise we wouldn’t be here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1782">I would be here in Israel until today.</span> <span id="s1783">And I’m not sorry that I did it, because I’m not sorry of one step in my life.</span> <span id="s1784">I don’t look backwards.</span> <span id="s1785">I take the reality.</span> <span id="s1786">I am here happy.</span> <span id="s1787">I live happy.</span> <span id="s1788">And so is my son.</span> <span id="s1789">I have two grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1790">My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky.</span> <span id="s1791">But she lives also to Austin, Texas, where my son lives.</span> <span id="s1792">And our grandson is in Virginia Beach.</span> <span id="s1793">So now we are without children and without grandchildren, but we have here very good friends.</span> <span id="s1794">And we are happy here, making our life here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: When your son was growing up in Israel did he ask you about your past and about the Holocaust years?</span> <span id="s1796">Or did you tell him about what had happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Well the first years, I myself couldn’t talk about it, neither could my wife.</span> <span id="s1798">And she is until today not so outspoken.</span> <span id="s1799">And for her the language barrier in Israel was very difficult, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1800">She learned the daily language, but usually she couldn’t live a cultural life, except going to concert and eventually from time to time with me to the theater.</span> <span id="s1801">But usually it was a barrier for her.</span> <span id="s1802">But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German.</span> <span id="s1803">And we had very wonderful company, very good friends.</span> <span id="s1804">And then concerning our son, it came when he went to school, to elementary school.</span> <span id="s1805">He asked in the first grade, he asked about whether we could help him with something in his homework.</span> <span id="s1806">And mother told him, “I’m sorry but go to Father because I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1807">So he ask a very simple question, “Mom, did you ever go in your life to school?”</span> <span id="s1808">So it is difficult to say that we spoke with him about the Holocaust because it was a painful thing to go on to put it on your children.</span> <span id="s1809">But of course when he growed up, when he went to high school and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some questions.</span> <span id="s1810">But not too many, not too many, not too many.</span> <span id="s1811">And I think until we came here, to the United States, he learned more about all of this than all his staying in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: So it wasn’t so much a part of cultural life in Israel then to even talk about it, even though it’s a society mostly composed of Jews?</span> <span id="s1813">People weren’t, the children weren’t being taught necessarily about what had happened in Europe with the Nazis’ extermination of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for.</span> <span id="s1815">My culture life in Israel was very, very developed.</span> <span id="s1816">First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I studied a lot.</span> <span id="s1817">And except of which I went to concert and I went to theater, all Jewish theater, I mean Hebrew theater.</span> <span id="s1818">I understood and I could take it.</span> <span id="s1819">And then I had a very rich library in Hebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my first, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish language which you have your basic education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: My question was more about whether your son, your son was… or even in this, I would maybe have guessed that in the schools he would have been taught about the Holocaust because he’s living in Israel.</span> <span id="s1821">But from what you’re saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: You are right.</span> <span id="s1823">In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1824">Later on bit by bit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world, with all other countries in Europe and the United States.</span> <span id="s1825">And the Jews from the United States, tourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding.</span> <span id="s1826">And there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was always the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families and friends from shtetl.</span> <span id="s1827">Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing that they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to Australia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want, you have everywhere people in the world.</span> <span id="s1828">So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of course, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about Holocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the door to more knowledge about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: How long did you live, oh, here’s what I wanted to ask you.</span> <span id="s1830">How segregated were you from your Arab neighbors?</span> <span id="s1831">Did you have any interaction with them at all?</span> <span id="s1832">Or were your lives just completely separate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: My personal life was never involved with any Arabs.</span> <span id="s1834">With any ____________ Arabs, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1835">Well, I can say that I knew nothing, but from the press and visiting to go to the South to Beersheba and passing some villages where Arabs was living going to Nazareth.</span> <span id="s1836">If you go to see the country, you met the Arabs and their way of living.</span> <span id="s1837">But in my place where I lived there was no Arabs at all.</span> <span id="s1838">At that given time there was no Arabs.</span> <span id="s1839">In Tel Aviv, for example, there was a section which was Jaffa, the port of Jaffa, the old port of Jaffa is the oldest port in the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s1840">There are living Arabs until today.</span> <span id="s1841">The majority of them are Arabs and they are Christian Arabs and there are Muslim Arabs.</span> <span id="s1842">There are churches, there are mosques.</span> <span id="s1843">So when you are going to Tel Aviv, because there is not separation between Tel Aviv and Givataim, Givataim was on the rand (ph) of Tel Aviv, that’s like a suburb of Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s1844">And then when you want to go for a good meal, you went to Jaffa there.</span> <span id="s1845">Good restaurants.</span> <span id="s1846">Were Arab restaurants.</span> <span id="s1847">And Oriental Jews opened oriental restaurants.</span> <span id="s1848">So this is the way where you came together with the Arab world.</span> <span id="s1849">You want to go to buy some fresh fish in the harbor there.</span> <span id="s1850">So you could buy it at Arab fishers there.</span> <span id="s1851">There were Jewish fishers, too.</span> <span id="s1852">But generally we didn’t have any, any, any connection and live together with the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1853">We knew from the press and we knew from the medias how they live and where they live and what their problems are, but we didn’t have nothing in common, nothing in common.</span> <span id="s1854">You came to Jerusalem, of course, after the Liberation, I mean after the Six-Day War there, western part of Israel, or Jerusalem which they annected.</span> <span id="s1855">So you learned something.</span> <span id="s1856">When you came to Jerusalem before when it was divided, you came always to the gate, where we saw the Arabs here.</span> <span id="s1857">It was always a danger to approach close because there were shootings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">Q: When did you first go back to visit Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A: I went to Poland after, to be exact, about after fifty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Fifty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: After fifty years I went to Poland.</span> <span id="s1862">The second time I went after three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: So it was about 1995 that you first went to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">A: Something like this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Will you talk about that, that trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: We decide to go, when the parents of our good friends which live here in Kentucky came to visit here.</span> <span id="s1867">It was a very old Krakow family which knew the business of Fryda’s parents and he by himself helped one Jew to survive.</span> <span id="s1868">And they are very, very nice people.</span> <span id="s1869">We met them and became friendly, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1870">They really embraced us and they asked us to come to Poland, to be their guests there.</span> <span id="s1871">And to see, you will see it is not so bad.</span> <span id="s1872">Just try, come and you will see your sights.</span> <span id="s1873">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s1874">The other thing was we wanted to see our savior, this Muschau, who got his righteous papers there, and his family.</span> <span id="s1875">We wanted to see him because he was older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still.</span> <span id="s1876">We supported him from Israel.</span> <span id="s1877">We were sending parcels and money from time to time.</span> <span id="s1878">And we supported him and he was very thankful.</span> <span id="s1879">They were not rich people, very poor peasants.</span> <span id="s1880">And he also wrote us that he will be happy to see us.</span> <span id="s1881">So we decided we will go, we will see how it is.</span> <span id="s1882">We went there and as I told you maybe before, I was a member of Rotary International in Israel and I became a member of Rotary here in Lexington, too.</span> <span id="s1883">And as a Rotarian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you go.</span> <span id="s1884">You should go to meet.</span> <span id="s1885">Rotary have to come together, whoever it is.</span> <span id="s1886">The Rotary in principle, Rotary has to have the best people.</span> <span id="s1887">That’s what the principle of Rotary is.</span> <span id="s1888">And we went there to see Rotary in Krakow on their meeting.</span> <span id="s1889">And one of the members was a Jesuit priest, who was a professor at the University there.</span> <span id="s1890">And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor of philosophy.</span> <span id="s1891">A very bright person.</span> <span id="s1892">After I had my speech there, at Rotary they are always asking guest Rotarian to give his impression and his greetings from his club to bring there.</span> <span id="s1893">He came to me, and we became very friendly, very friendly.</span> <span id="s1894">So that even when I came back to the United States, we were writing to each other.</span> <span id="s1895">I have maybe fifty letters from him, which he wrote to me and I wrote to him exchanging of some ideas.</span> <span id="s1896">He was very fond of the Jewish religion and of Judaism.</span> <span id="s1897">Which I, I have studied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and Talmudic Judaism.</span> <span id="s1898">So I could give him some answers.</span> <span id="s1899">We had some very, very interesting talks about this subject.</span> <span id="s1900">We had a very good time there.</span> <span id="s1901">We went there to the village.</span> <span id="s1902">One of our Polish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the University of Kentucky for a year.</span> <span id="s1903">We became friendly and he invited to visit him in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1904">And he went with his car with us to these villages where we used to be in hiding there.</span> <span id="s1905">And we went there and met the people.</span> <span id="s1906">There was a very exciting experience.</span> <span id="s1907">And we really enjoyed to see this everything from perspective, it gives us some good feeling that we could do it.</span> <span id="s1908">And therefore we went for the second time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Had you kept in touch with anybody in Poland apart from Muschau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: Yes, we saw Muschau for himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: No, had you kept in touch with anyone other than Muschau during the years that you were not in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.</span> <span id="s1913">Except these people here from the United States which we met here and this people who visited here and the Jesuit priest which we visited, otherwise we didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: So, Mrs. Soltys or her son, did you see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: Oh yeah, we saw them.</span> <span id="s1916">We saw both sons.</span> <span id="s1917">They were, well, they were very touched.</span> <span id="s1918">Madame Soltys didn’t live anymore, she was gone.</span> <span id="s1919">The second time we were even the Soltys son, the oldest son passed away, too.</span> <span id="s1920">Only the youngest son, Kazimierz Soltys, which writes us until today and we send him from time to time some money.</span> <span id="s1921">Otherwise no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: What about, there were people who, I assume you had left Poland and they didn’t know at the time that you were Jewish, but you were friendly with them, such as the people who hid you.</span> <span id="s1923">Did you have any encounters with people like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: No, I didn’t meet more people.</span> <span id="s1925">I will tell you, I didn’t want these people to have different feelings, that I was Jewish and they couldn’t know and could even help me, maybe they will be sorry that they did it.</span> <span id="s1926">I don’t want to put them in this conflict.</span> <span id="s1927">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1928">You can never know human thinkings, human spirits, human soul.</span> <span id="s1929">You never know.</span> <span id="s1930">I don’t want to hurt people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">Q: But overall your visit was very good it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">A: Yes, my visit was very good.</span> <span id="s1933">Short.</span> <span id="s1934">Very good.</span> <span id="s1935">Well, we experienced one a very, very peculiar experience while we were walking in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1936">In the market place, in the most important place in Krakow, in the most beautiful place in Krakow and I am not sure that the person who did it knew that we are Jewish and it wasn’t directed to us.</span> <span id="s1937">I think because this person run away from the market, screaming, “Death to the Jews.”</span> <span id="s1938">And that was a very, very strange feeling, very, very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s1939">I couldn’t blame my friends.</span> <span id="s1940">I couldn’t blame nobody.</span> <span id="s1941">Maybe some crazy.</span> <span id="s1942">You never know what people are able to do and who they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">End of Tape 4, Side B Tape 5, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Oscar Haber.</span> <span id="s1945">And you wanted to mention about your visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Because I was talking about Krakow, about the unpleasant what happens to me, I will try to make some remarks about the Sharoka (ph) which is called the high street.</span> <span id="s1947">And there is the oldest synagogue in Europe, called before the world the Alte Shul.</span> <span id="s1948">And there is now a Jewish museum.</span> <span id="s1949">There is another thing there on this street, which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too, maybe in the same time.</span> <span id="s1950">I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1951">The Remu Shul, the shul which is named after Reb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am not wrong.</span> <span id="s1952">There is still a shul and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying in Shabbas.</span> <span id="s1953">And they’re of course coming curious.</span> <span id="s1954">And there is always a meeting of Jews who come visit Krakow.</span> <span id="s1955">They are always coming there.</span> <span id="s1956">And the site of this shul is the old cemetery which a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi Isserls.</span> <span id="s1957">They called the shul and they called the Rabbi “Remu’.</span> <span id="s1958">Rabbi Moshe Isserls.</span> <span id="s1959">About him, used to say, “From Moses, to Moses was not like Moses Isserls.”</span> <span id="s1960">Was a very great Rabbi, who corrected one of the main Jewish religious books, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life.</span> <span id="s1961">That was included every point of life from the Jews.</span> <span id="s1962">But I will go back to the museum.</span> <span id="s1963">There are remnants from Jews in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1964">There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of religious utilities.</span> <span id="s1965">And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1966">And we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the Remu Synagogue which I mentioned before.</span> <span id="s1967">And there were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from Canada came to visit Poland and they were visiting this shul and sitting all the pray and praying.</span> <span id="s1968">And another thing which is to see of Jewish life, there is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel (ph) Street.</span> <span id="s1969">A foundation of Canadian Jew, a _______________, and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the past and the present Jewish life.</span> <span id="s1970">And they are cultural meetings.</span> <span id="s1971">There are coming writers and meeting there and presenting their books.</span> <span id="s1972">And there are Jewish books there in this unit there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: Did seeing all of this inspire you at all to, to think about the possibility of Jewish life continuing in Poland?</span> <span id="s1974">Did you ever consider living there yourself again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: To answer this question is not easy.</span> <span id="s1976">From a historical point of view I’m sure Jews will live in Poland.</span> <span id="s1977">First of all because of the root, of the roots.</span> <span id="s1978">It may be even second, third, fourth and fifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to the sources.</span> <span id="s1979">This is one thing.</span> <span id="s1980">The second thing is, of the globalization of the world.</span> <span id="s1981">The world is globalizing.</span> <span id="s1982">It has united Europe.</span> <span id="s1983">In another few years if it will continue this way there will no be borders between European countries.</span> <span id="s1984">It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in Europe and will live in Europe.</span> <span id="s1985">We have the best example, Spain.</span> <span id="s1986">The Jews were driven in the fifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews living there.</span> <span id="s1987">There is a Jewish life in Spain.</span> <span id="s1988">And there will be everywhere.</span> <span id="s1989">There is Jewish life in Germany.</span> <span id="s1990">We may not like it.</span> <span id="s1991">We may not want it.</span> <span id="s1992">But life is stronger than all our views.</span> <span id="s1993">May it be political, philosophical, whatever it is, life has his right.</span> <span id="s1994">Bread is easier.</span> <span id="s1995">Where life is easier, people will always go.</span> <span id="s1996">And that’s my view.</span> <span id="s1997">Maybe I’m wrong.</span> <span id="s1998">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1999">But I am sure and I know that the last visit of the Pope in Israel gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Catholics and Jews.</span> <span id="s2000">It is maybe ironic that in general even in the United States, people, Jewish people in general are more involved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic.</span> <span id="s2001">Because there is a minority of Catholics.</span> <span id="s2002">But Poland is ninety percent Catholics.</span> <span id="s2003">And the Pope, his origin is Wadowice in Poland.</span> <span id="s2004">And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite.</span> <span id="s2005">And he now with his visit in Israel and his approach to the problem of Jewish–Christian connection, I think opens more the door for Jews to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s2006">Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right.</span> <span id="s2007">It is still a stereotype of American Jews which have a guilty feeling that they didn’t do nothing, nothing in time of the Holocaust to help their brothers.</span> <span id="s2008">That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish people.</span> <span id="s2009">I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in the Polish territory.</span> <span id="s2010">But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier for the Germans to make it where the biggest concentration of the Jews were.</span> <span id="s2011">There was, in Poland was more Jews than all over the world.</span> <span id="s2012">So instead to go to Holland or to go to Belgium or to go to Germany, of course they didn’t want to take them because they were ashamed to bring the Jews to Germany.</span> <span id="s2013">So I mean to this other little countries, to bring million of Jews it was for them impossible.</span> <span id="s2014">Impossible.</span> <span id="s2015">Physically it was impossible.</span> <span id="s2016">Maybe it would be good if they had come to this idea.</span> <span id="s2017">But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in Poland That’s my opinion.</span> <span id="s2018">Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason.</span> <span id="s2019">And of course, there is something to it that in Poland were no many objection to it.</span> <span id="s2020">But there is another answer, Poland was the biggest country of this all occupied territories except France.</span> <span id="s2021">But France has its own Anti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: So, if you knew that you had another hundred years to live, could you conceive of living in Poland, moving back to Poland for part of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: It is like I said, it’s a very, very difficult answer.</span> <span id="s2024">Maybe yes, maybe no.</span> <span id="s2025">The yes is I would like to be the first one, not the second, not the third, not the fifth.</span> <span id="s2026">But if I live fifty years and there will be a community of a million Jews, I am not sure if I would not prefer to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s2027">Well of course, my first priority is Israel, but I don’t know what will happen to Israel in the next future.</span> <span id="s2028">I am very worrying and it is one of my greatest pains to think about, about a bad outcome of this situation.</span> <span id="s2029">I don’t want to be a prophet and I don’t want to put my words in tapes or in history.</span> <span id="s2030">But I am very afraid of the, what happens in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: How do you feel about life in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: It is the same question like you ask me before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Hard to answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: If I am living in the United States, it is the most wonderful place to live.</span> <span id="s2035">If you ask me to live between Jews and the United States, I am not comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s2036">I was more comfortable in Jews to live in Israel or to live in Poland.</span> <span id="s2037">And there is a reason to it and it is very difficult to raise out from history the past and the relations between American Jews and world Jewry at all.</span> <span id="s2038">It is a very difficult task.</span> <span id="s2039">And even now, with their best will, with their greatest contribution to Israel—which is a feeling of guilt, of course—the relations between old American Jews and the new American Jews, except this which became very rich and involved in commerce and science and so forth, but the Jewish volks, volks… that means the Jewish Jews.</span> <span id="s2040">The Jewish Jews which are speaking still Jewish, which are reading Jewish books and they have the Jewish folklore and they still have the memory, the heritage of European Jewry, is still differentiated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Do you consider yourself an American now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Yes, I’m an American, loyal American, a loyal citizen and I know about what happened in the United States, politically and socially and I am very involved.</span> <span id="s2043">I mean spiritually, because physically I can’t more.</span> <span id="s2044">But I was a member and I still am a member, but not so supportive as I was, I am a Republican.</span> <span id="s2045">I cannot say I don’t like Democrats because they are democratic.</span> <span id="s2046">But I don’t like Democrats because they are more socialistic.</span> <span id="s2047">And whatever smells of socialism or communism is for me, a red flag.</span> <span id="s2048">And this is also a part of my Israeli past, which was the Labor party, which was the priority movement for many years.</span> <span id="s2049">And still they are trying to be, I don’t know what the outcome will be.</span> <span id="s2050">Barak is a Socialist and a member of the Socialist Labor party.</span> <span id="s2051">And so are many of the desert members.</span> <span id="s2052">And I don’t like the religious extremists in the same way like I don’t like the liberal extremists.</span> <span id="s2053">I am used to a middle way, to a way of tolerance and living in harmony with everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">Q: When did you come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">A: In 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: And did you come directly to Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Do I come?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Did you come directly to Kentucky?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: Yeah, because my son was living in Kentucky, I came to Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: Do you remember your first impressions of the United States and of Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Well, I came to the United States before I came to Lexington.</span> <span id="s2062">I came to New York several times.</span> <span id="s2063">And I make tours in Canada and California and Florida.</span> <span id="s2064">I make Caribbean.</span> <span id="s2065">And I knew about American life and I met American people.</span> <span id="s2066">I had my own idea about America.</span> <span id="s2067">And my idea about Jewish America didn’t change from the beginning until today.</span> <span id="s2068">However my two brothers are living here since ‘48, here.</span> <span id="s2069">But they are still Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s2070">They are Americans, but they are Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s2071">That’s what I meant before what I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: What is your idea about, what is your idea about Jewish America?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Jewish Americans are Jews which speak Yiddish, love Israel, enjoy their life in the United States, are good citizens here and live a Jewish life.</span> <span id="s2074">It mustn’t be Orthodox, it mustn’t be strictly religious, but humanitarian Jewish life, with everybody humanistic.</span> <span id="s2075">That is my Jewish life, very humanistic.</span> <span id="s2076">Our great Rabbi and teacher, however it is a Rabbi, but a great Rabbi, the Orthodox Rabbi, when it came to he, to him one famous gentile person.</span> <span id="s2077">“I will become a Jew if you will teach me the Torah, how long I will stand on one leg.”</span> <span id="s2078">He says, “No problem, love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span id="s2079">This is whole Jewish religion and whole Jewish Torah, the most important thing.”</span> <span id="s2080">And that’s what it is, what I mean, a Jewish American or an American American or a Polish American.</span> <span id="s2081">Love the people who you are live with and you have to live with and everybody to see a human being.</span> <span id="s2082">That’s my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: Are you a member of a synagogue here in Lexington?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Yes, I am a member of the conservative movement.</span> <span id="s2085">I accept it.</span> <span id="s2086">There were asked about many things which they change in the meantime when I approach the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2087">There were no women called to the Torah.</span> <span id="s2088">There were no women Rabbis.</span> <span id="s2089">Now there is.</span> <span id="s2090">But if they ask my opinion and I said, I will not be an exception.</span> <span id="s2091">I am for the majority.</span> <span id="s2092">You decided that you want it this way, I will agree.</span> <span id="s2093">But not that I am fond of it, not that I like it.</span> <span id="s2094">And that it my opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: You think that women should have the same traditional roles that they had in Orthodox Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: No, they have to have more liberal.</span> <span id="s2097">But I still cannot accept a woman going to the Rabbi, because it is against the Halachic teachings.</span> <span id="s2098">I mean, I accept it, but I don’t find it nice.</span> <span id="s2099">And the teaching there is, if a woman is not clean, she shouldn’t come between the community.</span> <span id="s2100">She is not clean, that means when she has her menstruation.</span> <span id="s2101">Only after she goes, she has menstruation, after she finished and take a ritual bath, she is clean.</span> <span id="s2102">And she is even with everybody.</span> <span id="s2103">I don’t say she is not even, I don’t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it’s against the teachings of our sages.</span> <span id="s2104">And if you go on to take off barriers one by one, officially as permissible, you take the balance off Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s2105">One of the two.</span> <span id="s2106">You want to be Jewish you have to follow the teachings.</span> <span id="s2107">Even when you don’t follow, but you don’t have to revolutionize it.</span> <span id="s2108">That what I think.</span> <span id="s2109">I am not kosher, for example.</span> <span id="s2110">I am not doing a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2111">I am riding on Shabbat.</span> <span id="s2112">But my opinion it is in those times, Shabbat there was no cars to ride on Shabbot.</span> <span id="s2113">There was no electricity to light.</span> <span id="s2114">There was many things which I found it.</span> <span id="s2115">But that’s for me, but I don’t say it is permissible.</span> <span id="s2116">It is not permissible, but I find it, I can do it.</span> <span id="s2117">If somebody doesn’t like it, it’s not my problem.</span> <span id="s2118">It’s his problem.</span> <span id="s2119">But I can do it.</span> <span id="s2120">I can do everything which I found, in my opinion, it is an answer which is logic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Do you have friends here in Lexington, who are Jewish or non-Jewish or what kind of community do you have here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Well, I can say really friends are non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s2123">This is the majority.</span> <span id="s2124">Maybe there are some numbers really which I can say they are not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2125">Three, four families maybe or something like this.</span> <span id="s2126">But not to count as a really friend.</span> <span id="s2127">These are really the Polish people, which are helping me in need, when I had to go to an emergency, I call to the Polish people.</span> <span id="s2128">They come even in the middle of the night and they bring me to Emergency.</span> <span id="s2129">My wife is not driving and they bring me.</span> <span id="s2130">I don’t have to go in ambulance.</span> <span id="s2131">And other things also, they are really good friends.</span> <span id="s2132">So, I really don’t differentiate it.</span> <span id="s2133">Because you ask me I say they are accidentally Polish or Christian or Catholics and they are accidentally not.</span> <span id="s2134">But they are my friends and they are my friends, but not because of they are Polish, because they are Catholics or they are Christians.</span> <span id="s2135">I don’t know if I have even one Catholic, exception of Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Has it been important to you at all, did it, was it… let me start over.</span> <span id="s2137">Was it ever important to you to talk about with other people your experiences during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2138">Did you get to a point where you felt like I really have to tell people that’s what I experienced and to be around people who understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: I was talking several times in school, whoever invite me to give them, I give them my own experience.</span> <span id="s2140">But there was now a Remembrance day in the St. Luke church where there are members, two or three Christians which are my friends.</span> <span id="s2141">And they are always counting on me that I will be the speaker.</span> <span id="s2142">And I for nine years will be making the Remembrance.</span> <span id="s2143">They make it this year, too and I went to them, I don’t know I show it to you or you have it?</span> <span id="s2144">No?</span> <span id="s2145">I promise you to give it to you, my talk.</span> <span id="s2146">I have to make a copy.</span> <span id="s2147">I forgot to make a copy.</span> <span id="s2148">I will give it to you someday if you will ask for it.</span> <span id="s2149">And they make it in such a honorable day that was really a pleasure to talk to these people and to explain to them, this time I spoke generally about the situation.</span> <span id="s2150">In the previous I gave from my personal experiences.</span> <span id="s2151">And they are always anxious and they are… End of Tape 5, Side A Tape 5, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: Well, you asked me if I spoke to people.</span> <span id="s2153">I must tell you, to my disappointment… I don’t know, maybe not disappointment, but take the reality like it is.</span> <span id="s2154">I didn’t have occasion to say my opinion or even something about the Holocaust to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2155">If they invited me to the Temple when there was Remembrance Day, they were asking me to light a candle.</span> <span id="s2156">That was all.</span> <span id="s2157">And they were making some prayers.</span> <span id="s2158">And the same was here in our synagogue, when they make.</span> <span id="s2159">And they come such a small number of people that it is really not worth it even to open your mouth to talk to them.</span> <span id="s2160">But I wasn’t asked to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2161">I wasn’t asked.</span> <span id="s2162">They talk, they make some prayers and that’s all.</span> <span id="s2163">And that was very miserable, miserable.</span> <span id="s2164">I was ashamed that I was a part of this Remembrance Day.</span> <span id="s2165">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s2166">Jews are not interested in it.</span> <span id="s2167">Maybe they have it enough in books.</span> <span id="s2168">Maybe they read about it, if that’s possible.</span> <span id="s2169">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2170">But even when it is written, even when they read about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an opportunity to hear it from the first source.</span> <span id="s2171">They should ask to hear of it, they should.</span> <span id="s2172">But I don’t know why they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2173">Very ignorant, very ignorant.</span> <span id="s2174">And then they are not interested.</span> <span id="s2175">The people, the few people who survive, they are not interested, because they know the same, they have their opinion.</span> <span id="s2176">And the other people are here, born here or for years are here, they are already, they are already accustomed of the American habits, of the Jewish habits.</span> <span id="s2177">That’s what it is.</span> <span id="s2178">They are not interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: Do you feel that the people who were born here and who are from here, are less, have been less receptive to you personally than have the newcomers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: Well, I feel it, I feel it maybe personally, but I don’t blame them.</span> <span id="s2181">Maybe they were expecting more involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn’t do, first of my age, secondly my language is not good enough to expose my… it is maybe improved already, but in the beginning my English was good to read, to understand.</span> <span id="s2182">But to speak with my accent, to talk about my experience and to be active in their community, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s2183">It was maybe difficult.</span> <span id="s2184">I even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday school maybe.</span> <span id="s2185">But he never asked me.</span> <span id="s2186">And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like that.</span> <span id="s2187">Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that’s not my specialty.</span> <span id="s2188">I will not do it.</span> <span id="s2189">And that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s2190">The other thing is, which one influential person told me, that they feel humiliated in my company.</span> <span id="s2191">That I am too special for them, so therefore they are hesitating approach me.</span> <span id="s2192">Well, I don’t know what is true, what the reason is, but this is the reality what I told you.</span> <span id="s2193">I am a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger.</span> <span id="s2194">However they are friendly.</span> <span id="s2195">If I approach them they answer my questions, but that’s all, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2196">What can you do?</span> <span id="s2197">That’s the reality.</span> <span id="s2198">And you have to live with it and we take it.</span> <span id="s2199">And we learn after so many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each reality.</span> <span id="s2200">This is the main source of our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life.</span> <span id="s2201">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Last time after we finished our interview you mentioned off tape, something about the “business” of the Holocaust or the business that the Holocaust has become and I wonder if you would say something about that.</span> <span id="s2203">Does it bother you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been overly commercialized?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: Again, I don’t know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in this field.</span> <span id="s2205">You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in itself is maybe a nice deed.</span> <span id="s2206">But who will come to this museum?</span> <span id="s2207">I think the Holocaust museum which is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important.</span> <span id="s2208">And it fills all the spectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war.</span> <span id="s2209">Maybe there are some nuances which come out which are not of value.</span> <span id="s2210">But to make so many, I think people will not be interested to go to the main museum where they have everything.</span> <span id="s2211">And this happens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United States.</span> <span id="s2212">It has to be a society, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be members of the board and so forth and so forth.</span> <span id="s2213">Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is good, maybe.</span> <span id="s2214">But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the paperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs the help.</span> <span id="s2215">That is what I think.</span> <span id="s2216">And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take thousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these thousands you will make one book which includes everything.</span> <span id="s2217">So there is no need, in my opinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in… I don’t know, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2218">Of course, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very famous.</span> <span id="s2219">But I don’t want to criticize them.</span> <span id="s2220">I don’t want to criticize nobody.</span> <span id="s2221">But I think it is a crime if somebody makes it only for the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">Q: I’m coming to the end of my questions.</span> <span id="s2223">Is there something that we haven’t talked about that you’d like to talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it.</span> <span id="s2225">It doesn’t mean that I don’t have, in general, what to say about.</span> <span id="s2226">And especially to the future generations of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2227">Maybe somebody will listen to it.</span> <span id="s2228">Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of view.</span> <span id="s2229">But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life with joy and suffering.</span> <span id="s2230">It is like one Jewish sage said: “It is good to be born a Jew.</span> <span id="s2231">It’s good to die a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem.”</span> <span id="s2232">From the beginning until the end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or communities don’t have.</span> <span id="s2233">Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the center of cultural life.</span> <span id="s2234">Even in the world.</span> <span id="s2235">Not only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia or in Palestine or Spain or in the United States.</span> <span id="s2236">Everywhere where the Jews were the center of civilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles.</span> <span id="s2237">Jewish Nobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in medical field, in general science are not compatible to no one other people.</span> <span id="s2238">Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of other people brings them to hatred.</span> <span id="s2239">I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn’t concentrate of all this progress and culture and civilization.</span> <span id="s2240">A country they have to do everything possible what brings progress to the world.</span> <span id="s2241">But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric religious or national use.</span> <span id="s2242">To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways.</span> <span id="s2243">This is my advice and this is my way of thinking.</span> <span id="s2244">And that, and we will remember this, this can maybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world.</span> <span id="s2245">That we will not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until today.</span> <span id="s2246">To avoid it, listen what I said.</span> <span id="s2247">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Conclusion of Interview Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel from 1999 to 2001.</span></p>
