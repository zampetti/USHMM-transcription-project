Gaudian and my mother was Dora Wilhelmina Gaudian.</span> <span id="s31">And he was born in Germany and he came over to the United States when he was nine years old, and when he was, I believe, 32 he was in the Army in World War I and went over to Germany, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: And what –</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: He was a bugler in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Do you know what part of Germany he came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: It's PomeraniA:</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Ah, yes, Pommern.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Right.</span> <span id="s38">I think that's where it was, right.</span> <span id="s39">My mother was born in Chicago.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: So you're actually first generation American on your father's side?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And did he still speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s46">In fact, we went to a German church.</span> <span id="s47">I also learned to speak German because he had a brother living with us who spoke German and I sort of learned as I went along.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: And I took three years in college and it worked out very well for me, because I knew a lot of vocabulary.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: At home did your mother know German?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So did they speak German at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: They did at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: They did at the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: And then, of course, when the '30s came, when the thing happened over there, they didn't like that in the United States, you know, so they cut out the German service.</span> <span id="s56">But originally when I went to our church, Lutheran church, they had German, they had English for a few years, right, in the 20s, I imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Did you see yourself as -- I mean, it may sound like a strange question but did you see yourself as German, German-American, or just an American who had some sort of roots in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: That's what I would say, American, right, right.</span> <span id="s59">I don't know -- I imagine we -- he still had relatives over there, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s60">About nine children came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: It was a big family.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: And why did they do that?</span> <span id="s64">Why did he come over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, I think they just wanted to get the good life over here, I think, you know.</span> <span id="s66">They wanted to give -- and some of the children died of that flu that came around, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Oh, in 1918?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Right.</span> <span id="s69">They didn't make it.</span> <span id="s70">They lost several, two or three, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s71">Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And did they all settle in Iowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s74">My father, I believe, he was a carpenter, most of his life, but his father farmed.</span> <span id="s75">In fact, his father passed away when I was about three or four years old, and at that time when someone died, they had them in your parlor, in your own home, and I had never seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: So your grandparents were also there?</span> <span id="s77">It wasn't just your father who had left?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No.</span> <span id="s79">My grandparents, right, and he started the farm, and then my father moved to this small town and became a carpenter, contractor.</span> <span id="s80">He only had about a fourth grade education, but he learned it all by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Was he a good carpenter?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yes, he was.</span> <span id="s83">I worked for him for years before I went into the army after I graduated from high school for years -- for one year, I guess, and we built many farm buildings: Barns and corn cribs and hog houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Right.</span> <span id="s86">Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: So you grew up in -- can you tell me the town's name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: PaullinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: PaullinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: P-A-U-L-L-I-N-A, right, PaullinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: PaullinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I guess it was named maybe after a Paul and a Lina, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: It could very well be.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I have an aunt named PaullinA:</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: My mother's name is unusual, WilhelminA: A good German name, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: So we both were in the war.</span> <span id="s99">He was in World War I. I had a picture taken with me with my uniform and him.</span> <span id="s100">I wish I would have brought that and showed that.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s102">Did he talk about his service in World War I?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Not -- well, he mentioned that in the trenches he did get some of that experience and he was a bugler.</span> <span id="s104">I mean, he talked about that.</span> <span id="s105">He still played the bugle.</span> <span id="s106">When he was home, he would entertain us with that once in a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did he ever talk about it feeling a little strange or did it feel strange to him that, you know, he came from Germany and he was fighting on the American side against Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: You know, I never heard anything about that.</span> <span id="s109">I think of that now, but never, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No.</span> <span id="s112">They didn't mention that at all, that they were fighting...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Do you know what year he came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">It was -- let's see.</span> <span id="s116">I think it was about 19 -- 1906 maybe, somewhere right around.</span> <span id="s117">He came through Ellis Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: He did?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Right.</span> <span id="s120">Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: I'm sure you could find him on the ship lists up there because they have a wonderful museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s123">I gave them a donation once and I guess my name is there somewhere, too, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And your mother, tell us a little bit about your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well, she was born in Chicago, and then she was one of these a farmer -- let's see, how was that?</span> <span id="s126">Her mother wasn't married at the time.</span> <span id="s127">I guess he left them or something and so she wanted a husband, and that's a time when they used to write letters to Iowa, and there was a man there who had accepted -- you know, wanted her to come and be his wife, and that's what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Her mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Her mother.</span> <span id="s130">And then she came with her, of course, and so she was a half sister to four other full sisters.</span> <span id="s131">And that was a big family, also.</span> <span id="s132">I think there were eight of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s135">It's a real large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you know your aunts and your grandparents on her side?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, I only got to see the father, grandpA: The mother was gone.</span> <span id="s138">I can't remember her, no, I cannot.</span> <span id="s139">Then my mother went to a German school in Germantown was the name of a town where she was, but it was a farming community.</span> <span id="s140">Very small, but it had a church, a Lutheran church, in German.</span> <span id="s141">They spoke German there for a while.</span> <span id="s142">But then when she came to Paullina, then it switched over.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: And how did your parents meet?</span> <span id="s144">Did they ever tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s146">Well, he had a brother, I guess, and they both found the two sisters, I guess, and that's how it happened, uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: What year did your parents marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: They were married -- let's see, they were married in 19 -- what was it?</span> <span id="s149">1920, I think it was, or '19.</span> <span id="s150">Right after he came back from that.</span> <span id="s151">He was a little older, too.</span> <span id="s152">He was 32, I believe, and she was about 20 or 21.</span> <span id="s153">She lived to be 92.</span> <span id="s154">He lived to be 99 --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: -- my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s158">Those are ripe old ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: He had a brother who was 99 also.</span> <span id="s160">And the other sisters all made it into their 90s except one, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Tell me a little bit about the town.</span> <span id="s162">Did your mother stay home?</span> <span id="s163">Was her job raising the kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s165">She was a homemaker, very good cook, and she sold and had clothing clubs and that was about it, I guess, right.</span> <span id="s166">She was a real homemaker.</span> <span id="s167">She taught me how to make cakes and bread and how to make ___+.</span> <span id="s168">I appreciate it now, because my wife teaches piano and so once in a while I make the meals now.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: She must appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s171">And her coffeecake was super.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Tell me a little bit about the towns.</span> <span id="s173">You mentioned before they were small and people was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Right, about 900 to 1,000.</span> <span id="s175">Maybe today it might be just a shade over, but it was -- well, let's see, they had one or two grocery stores is all and then one bank, and most of them were farmers.</span> <span id="s176">They would come in on Saturday nights, that was a great night in a small town.</span> <span id="s177">You know, the band played.</span> <span id="s178">I played in the band in high school, and we would be on the center of the town, you know, playing, and people were walking the streets.</span> <span id="s179">And Saturday night was a real get-together for everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Could you say that you knew everybody in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Almost everyone, right.</span> <span id="s182">Yes, just about.</span> <span id="s183">You did, yeah.</span> <span id="s184">And they're all gone now.</span> <span id="s185">Almost everyone that I knew, I think, they're all gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: So we'll keep on going.</span> <span id="s187">Hang on a minute.</span> <span id="s188">In the town were there -- was it mostly a Lutheran town?</span> <span id="s189">Was it mostly people who were German immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I would say it was very heavy on German immigrants.</span> <span id="s191">Very heavy, I believe.</span> <span id="s192">Yes, it would be, uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: And were there any other denominations?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Although there were -- yes.</span> <span id="s195">There were Methodists, Presbyterian.</span> <span id="s196">We had Norwegian.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Norwegian?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Uh-hum.</span> <span id="s199">Those four.</span> <span id="s200">You had Presbyterian, Norwegian, Methodist, Lutheran, uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Any Catholics?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: No, no Catholics.</span> <span id="s203">Not in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: There's one nearby, though, I guess, in Primghar, I think it was.</span> <span id="s206">Uh-hum, that's right.</span> <span id="s207">There was none, no Catholic church.</span> <span id="s208">No, not in our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Any Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Any Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Maybe one or two.</span> <span id="s213">I think so.</span> <span id="s214">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s215">Possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Irish.</span> <span id="s218">A few Irish.</span> <span id="s219">But let's see.</span> <span id="s220">What else?</span> <span id="s221">Let me think.</span> <span id="s222">That's about it.</span> <span id="s223">It was strong on the German side, right, uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: But I would take it that there wasn't a synagogue or a Catholic church or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So no larger communities there?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: So mainly farmers, mainly German, not entirely, Norweigian as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Right, and small businesses like the lumberyard and painters and carpenters, whatever, several besides my father.</span> <span id="s230">And, well, we had a small high school.</span> <span id="s231">Now it's a consolidated.</span> <span id="s232">They took three towns and put them together, I guess.</span> <span id="s233">I graduated in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: You graduated and so you were 17, 18 years old in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Right.</span> <span id="s236">I was a little older.</span> <span id="s237">I was 18, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: You were 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: What did you do after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well, then I worked for my father about two years carpentering and then I was drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: When were you drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I went in in 1943, April of '43.</span> <span id="s244">I spent three years and one month altogether, I think, in the Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Can you tell me about -- you have an older brother and an older sister; is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: My older brother, he was in the Coast Guard.</span> <span id="s247">He rode a horse along the North Carolina shores watching for bodies that washed up when the German submarines were out close to our coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And did he find them?</span> <span id="s249">Were there bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Once in a while he would find a body coming in and he had to report things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Well, how about -- and explain to me more if there was a German submarine along the coast, does that mean if there was someone walking along the beach that they would shoot them?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Possible.</span> <span id="s253">It could be.</span> <span id="s254">Yes, he did carry a gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: He did carry a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yes, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: But where did the bodies come from?</span> <span id="s258">From the submarine?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: From the ships that were sunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: And even when I shipped out from Boston, we had the same scare.</span> <span id="s264">We went out too far on a big convoy ship, they spotted a German sub even in '43 quite close, and we had cruisers going around our Liberty Ship and they did drop some depth charges later, but I don't know if they ever got the sub or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: So your brother, when he entered the Coast Guard, did he volunteer for the Coast Guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, he did volunteer, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: And then my other younger brother was also -- he ended up in Belgium.</span> <span id="s269">In fact, one time we were very close together, I guess, but didn't know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: So you had three sons [sic] in the U.S. military?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: One in the Coast Guard, two in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: My daughter -- other daughter was in the Air Force as a nurse.</span> <span id="s274">So two, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: By three sons, I meant your father's sons.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: All three of us boys were in the service, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Your elder brother, though, he signed up before 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s279">I think it was '42.</span> <span id="s280">He was one year ahead of me, right.</span> <span id="s281">He's three years older than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: What about the other boys in your class?</span> <span id="s283">Were most of them drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s285">Two of them shipped out with me when I went in and I ended up in Kearns, Utah, and they went on to CaliforniA: So I was chosen for the Air Force first and they went to the Infantry, I guess, in CaliforniA:</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: And when you were drafted, was that the first time you left Iowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: For any long it was -- for trips is all I had taken, Des Moines, the capitol, our senior class went there, and that's about it, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Your senior class went, too, but did you go out of state someplace before?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s290">We went to South Dakota once.</span> <span id="s291">There was a radio station there that my mother liked in Yankton, South Dakota, and she used to listen to the broadcast from there and she wanted to go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s294">Never made it to Chicago, though.</span> <span id="s295">I didn't.</span> <span id="s296">That was it though, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: That was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Well, you said earlier that in the '30s, when things started happening in Germany, something changed in the atmosphere and so your folks didn't speak German at home as much or --</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: -- there wasn't a service in German anymore?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Do you have any memories of how that happened, because if the town was heavily German background –</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, let's see.</span> <span id="s305">It was just -- I guess they were afraid of what other people were thinking.</span> <span id="s306">That was it.</span> <span id="s307">Now, some people probably were turned off by that, you know, that we still had a -- I don't think they rioted or anything or had posters on the street corners but that would have happened perhaps in a larger city.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Did you have news of what was going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s309">How much international news did you get?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Well, not very much, really.</span> <span id="s311">Well, we had the Des Moines Register, which was a good paper but it -- oh, yes, we did have it there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: And were your main news sources that newspaper or other sources?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s314">The Des Moines Register, we had the Sioux City Journal, and, of course, our local, but they printed occasional articles from what the World News would say, but, you know, other than that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: What about radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Oh, yes, radio was strong.</span> <span id="s317">Right.</span> <span id="s318">Yeah, we would sit there and listen to those programs, Andy Gump and all of those old one.</span> <span id="s319">Amos 'n' Andy, that was a favorite, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: I'm trying –</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: And music, we liked -- she liked the music from there.</span> <span id="s322">Lawrence Welk.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: In fact, he came to our town.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: That must have been an event.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: He played in our town when he had about six or seven people.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Lawrence Welk, right.</span> <span id="s329">In that little town of Paullina he became famous, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: He became a millionaire, billionaire, right.</span> <span id="s332">And that was a Saturday, I remember that, and he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: When you were drafted, the war had started but the United States hadn't been involved yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: And you were drafted before Pearl Harbor; is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: No.</span> <span id="s337">After.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s339">You were after --</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: After Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: You were drafted in June of '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: I was probably -- I was signed up already right away.</span> <span id="s343">You know, we had to sign up at 18, I think it was, or whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Excuse me, so I confused it.</span> <span id="s345">You graduated probably before Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Right, so they held off two years before they called me.</span> <span id="s347">I'm surprised in a way that they called all three of us from one family.</span> <span id="s348">Today they probably wouldn't do that anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: But we were all three.</span> <span id="s351">And my mother had three stars on the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: She must have been pretty scared, too.</span> <span id="s353">Proud and scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: She was, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Can you tell me, do you remember news of Pearl Harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s357">I remember exactly where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: I was coming out of a movie theater in our town, it had been a western or something, and I get to the middle of the street and someone yells out, "we've been attacked."</span> <span id="s360">I know exactly where I was on that street.</span> <span id="s361">I can put an X there.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And so it really stuck in your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: In what way?</span> <span id="s367">What did you feel when that that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well, the trouble was we weren't following the news close enough what was going on.</span> <span id="s369">We should have almost known that something was going to happen, but in this little town I don't think many people there either got -- really got it, put it together, so it was a shock, yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: And then, of course, they said, ut-oh, that means you'll probably be going soon, and people were talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: Were there -- oh, go ahead.</span> <span id="s373">You wanted to say something?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: We left from a -- when I left, we left from a small town about 10 miles from our home town on a bus to Des Moines, go there early in the morning, about 4:00 or something, and we had to take a test right away.</span> <span id="s375">Q: And how many people left on that bus?</span> <span id="s376">Was it a special bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: There were about six of us going for the Army and there were other people on there just going to Des Moines.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So it was a regular public bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Uh-hum.</span> <span id="s380">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So you said good bye to your folks at the bus stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, my father came.</span> <span id="s383">I said good bye to my mother, and that was something.</span> <span id="s384">And we got -- we stayed there about two days before they assigned us, to put us on the trains.</span> <span id="s385">Quite an experience for a young person, you know, leaving like that, but at that age I don't think that we gave it as much thought as we should have, you know, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Do you remember any of your thoughts going through your mind at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Not a whole lot, but when we left, it sort of had gotten away from me, but I know the test was early in the morning and we were tired, but I must have scored quite well because they picked me for the Air Force, and I figured --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: That's a pretty good place.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: -- that's a little boost, right.</span> <span id="s390">I guess I had enough left.</span> <span id="s391">And I did graduate.</span> <span id="s392">I won the allegiant award for the person who was supposed to be successful in the class.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So tell us a little bit about that?</span> <span id="s394">So you took the test in Des Moines, and then what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: I went to Kearns, Utah, and stopped there.</span> <span id="s396">We stopped along as we dropped them off all alongthe way, but I was the first one dropped off, I guess, at Kearns.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: By bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: On train.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: By train?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Right.</span> <span id="s401">That was a train -- it was an old base that they changed into a training base for the Air Corps.</span> <span id="s402">And then they sent me to school in Colorado, Fort Collins.</span> <span id="s403">I went to a six-week school there and I worked for -- I mean, the airplane supply when I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and that's where I was stationed for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: So let me retrace these steps.</span> <span id="s405">Do you remember the day you were -- not drafted but the day you left home to start your Army service?</span> <span id="s406">What month was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: April.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: That was April, 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And so you're in Des Moines for two days and then you're in Kearns, Utah?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Kearns, Utah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And stayed for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Probably six weeks, eight weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How large was Kearns, Utah?</span> <span id="s415">How large was the base?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Oh, it was a big base.</span> <span id="s417">I would imagine there was over 20,000 there probably.</span> <span id="s418">It was quite large.</span> <span id="s419">And each of us was assigned a drill master, you know, for a group in our barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Did people already assume that the U.S. is going to go to war with Germany in Europe, or were you thinking more or less you would be shipped out somewhere in the Pacific?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s422">I think the Pacific was more in the minds of people.</span> <span id="s423">I think it was Being (?</span> <span id="s424">marry?)</span> <span id="s425">and all in that part, but then sometimes they would ship you from California to go the other way, from the other direction to go that way, that was hard to figure out sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: You're in the Army now?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: Right.</span> <span id="s428">And then when the bombs came -- I don't know if you want me to tell you about it now.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Oh, I do, but I'm going to get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: I'm going to get there.</span> <span id="s432">I want to get a sense of -- I want to get a sense of what various stops you were on in your Army service, on your military service.</span> <span id="s433">So we're starting with the Air Force and you went from Kearns, Utah –</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: To Fort Collins, Colorado, by train again, and had about a two-month course there.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: On what?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: An Army course for the Air Corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: For the Air Corps?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: For working in a maintenance area where you supplied the supplies for B-17s.</span> <span id="s439">Yes, it was a B-17 base, and then I worked there two years.</span> <span id="s440">I got my promotions in one month, three months in row.</span> <span id="s441">It starts out PFC and then corporal and sergeant, right up the ladder.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Well, pretty fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: It was quick.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: And then I went over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So you went from Fort Collins then you go to Fort Dix?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: No.</span> <span id="s448">Fort Collins -- yes, yes, that's right.</span> <span id="s449">First I went to Mitchel Field up in Long Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: What's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: That was an air base there.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: But then I was only there a few days.</span> <span id="s454">They needed someone in Fort Dix, New Jersey, so they shipped me back down there, but I did get to go up there and see -- long train ride up to Long Island.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: And at Fort Dix, that was still Air Force?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes, that was an Air Force base for B-17.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: For B-17s?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: It also had Army there, too, I guess.</span> <span id="s459">It was divided sort of half and half.</span> <span id="s460">They had this big airfield there.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: So if you were there for two years, how did you spend your time?</span> <span id="s462">What was a typical day like?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Well, it was a lot of drilling we did at times.</span> <span id="s464">We had to keep our physical -- keep in shape.</span> <span id="s465">And then I worked in the supply center it was.</span> <span id="s466">We had to organize all of the equipment, and when a plane came in and needed a part, we had to get it and deliver it to them.</span> <span id="s467">So that was mainly what I was doing, the technical supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And that was two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes, two years about.</span> <span id="s470">Maybe a little short of two but -- because I spent a little over a year in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: So it was from April of '43, April '44, and then was it from Fort Dix that you left for Germany, that you left for Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: No.</span> <span id="s473">Then I went to Texas.</span> <span id="s474">They gave me another six-week refresher on more like infantry training, you know, in case we would have to join the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: But you were still Air Force at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: Right.</span> <span id="s477">More or less, right.</span> <span id="s478">Uh-hum.</span> <span id="s479">Right.</span> <span id="s480">And then they assigned me -- well, when the (?</span> <span id="s481">bomb?)</span> <span id="s482">came, then they assigned me to the engineer battalion, 15th Engineer Battalion, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So that's where the switch came from Air Force to Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Okay, and that's when you were in Texas?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Okay, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: You see then -- well, then I get the order, I guess, I get to go home on a little vacation, or furlough they call it, and then it's over to Boston, I guess, and we shipped out on Liberty Ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Was that the first time you were in a big city?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Yes, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: What kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Trenton.</span> <span id="s493">Trenton was, I guess, yeah, would have been the biggest one.</span> <span id="s494">I went there every weekend.</span> <span id="s495">Oh, and the fortunate thing, there the minister of our church there, Lutheran church, he was a classmate of my brother in our high school, so I stayed with them once in a while on weekends.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: In Trenton?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: That was nice.</span> <span id="s500">Imagine having someone from your hometown, you know, right there.</span> <span id="s501">Oh, and I had another experience.</span> <span id="s502">Walking the street -- this is unusual.</span> <span id="s503">Walking the street one Saturday night I passed the tavern and out of the tavern comes this man.</span> <span id="s504">I'm walking by, I'm going to his house, the pastor's house, and he says, "Hello, Marty," a man from my hometown, and he's being shipped over to Germany real fast.</span> <span id="s505">They had to leave immediately.</span> <span id="s506">They all came out of that tavern and he said, "We've gotta go, we're leaving," and he ended up getting burned -- he was a cook, and he got burned all over his face and his arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Did he survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: He carried the scars with him.</span> <span id="s509">Right, uh-hum, yes, in PaullinA: He worked in the grocery store.</span> <span id="s510">But just seeing him, that was unusual.</span> <span id="s511">That was one in a thousand maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And this was still in Trenton?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: This was still in Trenton?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So from Texas you get shipped -- you know that you're going over to Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: You have a furlough to say good bye.</span> <span id="s519">Do you remember what that was like, being at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: That was just -- oh, guess what?</span> <span id="s521">I had to walk home.</span> <span id="s522">It was in December.</span> <span id="s523">I had to walk home in the middle of a snowstorm, and I started walking from where I ended up on a train in a small town or something and here I'm walking in this cold weather and here comes a snowplow, and he recognized me from Paullina, so he picked me up on the snowplow and brought me home, and that was wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: And your brother wasn't there?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Your older brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No.</span> <span id="s528">Brothers were gone.</span> <span id="s529">You know, he was in Carolina and the other boy was -- the other boy probably hadn't quite gone yet.</span> <span id="s530">He left after -- he was younger, so he probably went in the next year, maybe after I did so... Let's see, where are we?</span> <span id="s531">Okay, then –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: We're at your parents and you're at home and it's before you leave for Europe, and do you have any memory of that good-bye trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Well, I remember my mother made me my special banana pie.</span> <span id="s534">It was very touching.</span> <span id="s535">I mean, they took it quite well, I guess.</span> <span id="s536">They said, "Well, the Lord will take care of things," you know, so -- right.</span> <span id="s537">Then I went to Boston, I told you, that's where we shipped out on the Liberty Ship.</span> <span id="s538">We actually loaded at night and when we woke up the next morning, here we are out in the Atlantic Ocean with a hundred ships, I would guess, around us, Liberty Ships, all kinds of ships, a big marada -- what do they call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Armada?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Armada of ships, yes, and then all of these cruisers going around, and then we knew there was some problem, and then our captain told us, yes, they had sighted a submarine and they're making sure that everything is secure.</span> <span id="s541">So we could have been hit I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Now, in Boston, you were there for just --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Just -- right.</span> <span id="s544">It was so quick.</span> <span id="s545">At night we loaded --</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And then you were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: -- and then we were gone.</span> <span id="s548">We were out.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: And do you remember the first time you saw European soil?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s551">It was -- here again I was sleeping, and when I woke up after the end of the journey, here we are in the middle of the English Channel and the bells they have out in the water was ringing, and that was the most beautiful sound even though the war was not over yet, you know, not quite, and here we are sitting there and waiting to go ashore.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Lahar.</span> <span id="s554">They put us on a truck and then we went to this first stopping point, some little town.</span> <span id="s555">I remember we ended up there in a train -- first we took a train across French -- that's right.</span> <span id="s556">A___+.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: So when did you -- do you remember the date you landed?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s559">I've got it on my records, but let's see.</span> <span id="s560">Oh, boy.</span> <span id="s561">I think it was -- I think it was April again, somewhere around that time, April.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: April '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s564">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Or was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I think it was April '45, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Because --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: It was very close.</span> <span id="s569">I was close to it, but it was over when I got over there, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: So April of '45 you take a train across?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: We were crossing France.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Then they put us on a truck, an Army truck at some point, and then we went to this small town in Germany first, but we didn't stay there very long.</span> <span id="s574">Then we went to another little town for a while, Furstenfeldbruck or something and then we ended up going to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: You were going to tell me something about Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Well, that's when they -- that's when I actually went, was drafted, you know.</span> <span id="s577">Like, it switched over to the Army from the Air Corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Because of that battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Because of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Because of the Bulge?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: That's why.</span> <span id="s582">They needed extra reserves just in case because that was a serious point, so they were building up the forces to make sure that...</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Did it matter to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Not so much, no.</span> <span id="s585">I just took instructions -- I guess I was young enough to take it in stride.</span> <span id="s586">Now I think about it, you should have been a little bit afraid maybe.</span> <span id="s587">Not really.</span> <span id="s588">Well, that's a normal thought, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Yes, it's very normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: And I knew that a lot of my friends already -- one of my -- the fullback on my football team had been killed over in Germany.</span> <span id="s591">He started out in Alaska, but he wanted to get into the fighting, so they switched him over to Germany, and he died there in the Bulge, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Can you tell me, do you know how many boys from Paullina were drafted in the end, how many served in the army during World War II?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: How many?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: From my class or --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: From the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Oh, boy, let's see.</span> <span id="s598">I would bet there would be -- there were a lot of them.</span> <span id="s599">I would say 20 or more.</span> <span id="s600">20 or 30 probably, right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: That's quite a lot for a small town?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Right, it was a lot.</span> <span id="s603">Because I see the names now, you know, on the list that died, the Veterans, and there's a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: And was he the only one you know of who didn't survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Well, let's see now.</span> <span id="s606">Yeah.</span> <span id="s607">All the others were either killed in the war or they're gone.</span> <span id="s608">In fact, you won't believe this, on my football team, I'm the only one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s610">Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: And I was a center for the team, and everybody's gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Well, tell me a little bit about some of the others that were killed in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Well, this one was a fullback on our team.</span> <span id="s614">His father ran a grocery store in the town.</span> <span id="s615">And the other one was one of my best friends that played with us when we were children.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: He was in the infantry.</span> <span id="s618">He was killed over there, too, somewhere.</span> <span id="s619">I don't know exactly where.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Wayne Poreman.</span> <span id="s622">And then --well, there was another one, Martin Poreman, another one, same thing, but he died later, though.</span> <span id="s623">He survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I'm looking at those who died in battle or died in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: There's another one on our team -- no, he didn't die in the battle.</span> <span id="s628">I would say there were just two that I remember, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: The rest, they made it back.</span> <span id="s631">My brother made it back, too.</span> <span id="s632">My younger brother from Belgium, he made it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: When you had landed in France, do you remember your first impressions of what you were seeing?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Gee.</span> <span id="s635">Well, I remember when we were on the train we were going along and this one must have been a farmer, somebody, he waved at us and there, the people along the way were waving at us.</span> <span id="s636">We had the big door open, you know, so we could look out.</span> <span id="s637">And then the big experience is when we came through Munich.</span> <span id="s638">And I think I mentioned in my letter that it had bombed, the railroad station there, and there were hundreds of mailbags -- did I tell you that -- on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Tell me now.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Hundreds of mailbags, you know, the huge -- and the letters were strewn all over.</span> <span id="s641">I wish I had brought some of those letters with me, but maybe that wouldn't have been the right thing to do, either.</span> <span id="s642">But I did look at a few that were torn open.</span> <span id="s643">It was from German mothers sending pictures of their children to their husbands out on the Russian front.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So you could read German and you could know what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: A little.</span> <span id="s646">I got a few things out of there, right, that I could understand, that they were expressing their thoughts.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: What did you feel when you saw those?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: That made a very -- not a hateful feeling and yet, you know, in between there that, yes, these are mothers that are -- they may not have had anything to do with this mess here, you know, of Hitler and his...but that –</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What did you know about Adolph Hitler, because I'm trying to get a sense of how much people knew in the United States, how much the guys in the Army knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Well, you know, they would always talk about it and they would say a joke about it.</span> <span id="s651">They would say, "Go get that guy."</span> <span id="s652">And they gave him a name.</span> <span id="s653">I can't remember what it was.</span> <span id="s654">It wasn't a good name.</span> <span id="s655">"Go get him," that's what they would say.</span> <span id="s656">That's about all I can remember.</span> <span id="s657">People will tell you, they didn't follow it close enough either, you know, that it was going to happen.</span> <span id="s658">I don't think anyone really –</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Did you see during the time -- if you went over in April of '45 and you're going through France and you end up in one small German town and another and then eventually through, did you see any battle?</span> <span id="s660">Did you see any corpses, did you see any --</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: When we went by this one bridge there, there were bodies hanging over the railing.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Was this in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: As we passed through Munich going on, there were bodies hanging over, and I saw one man standing on the bridge, and he must have had convulsions or something because just imagine from that distance I could see how he was coughing and spitting up blood or something, and it was just -- I remember that.</span> <span id="s664">That must have made an impression on me seeing him there, but these bodies are –</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Were those the first bodies that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Yes, those are the first ones there --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: -- hanging over.</span> <span id="s669">And then -- but those mailbags, though, that hangs with you.</span> <span id="s670">You don't forget that, because, ooh, I wonder whatever happened to those, if they picked them up and...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: If they ever got delivered?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: That's what I wonder.</span> <span id="s673">It would have been nice to have a couple of them, really, I could have given them to here.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: So you were passing through Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: And then where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: All of these little towns.</span> <span id="s678">First Wasserburg was another one, Furstenfeldbruck, and then we were in a wooded area somewhere, I don't know where that -- that was in Bavaria somewhere.</span> <span id="s679">And then one of the singers from America came over to entertain, one of the famous singers from the band, when they had the bands, and I remember that.</span> <span id="s680">But then there was this little town.</span> <span id="s681">I was -- at night I had to go to this little office and make the roll call for the morning and things.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: That was going to be my next question.</span> <span id="s683">What was your job when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: That's what I did.</span> <span id="s685">I was the morning clerk, more or less, because there was no engineering work to do yet, so they kept me over there.</span> <span id="s686">And one night I was going there walking on the sidewalk and a big flowerpot fell about that far ahead of me, and I don't know if it was an accident, but they did check it out the next day and they never found out anything about it.</span> <span id="s687">But otherwise I noticed this one young girl that lived across the street from where we were staying and she'd always look out the window at us, you know, and she was kind of -- one day I saw her walking on the street, and I just said, "Hello Fräulein."</span> <span id="s688">We weren't associated with them, but she was so scared.</span> <span id="s689">She just walked by real fast.</span> <span id="s690">And they were afraid to come out in a way in the daytime even though we wouldn't have done anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: So you felt a certain kind of distrust, a fear of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Right.</span> <span id="s693">At times, right.</span> <span id="s694">Otherwise the older folks many times, they'd just ___+, but we didn't see too many of them, either.</span> <span id="s695">They didn't usually -- not that many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Then I got to go see King Lutheran's Castle one weekend.</span> <span id="s698">That was a nice trip we took.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: In all of this, when do you eventually get to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: That was probably after Wasserburg and we loaded up, and 20 of us, I think, were on this truck.</span> <span id="s701">Or two trucks.</span> <span id="s702">I think there were five in each side.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Do you know what you were supposed to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: You were just told to --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: They didn't tell us anything, really.</span> <span id="s707">And here -- I think back on it now, here I am going in this peaceful countryside of Bavaria and suddenly I'm going to be dropped off at a place where the most inhumane things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Tell us what happened.</span> <span id="s709">Tell us what you saw when you went there.</span> <span id="s710">You're in these two trucks, about 20 guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s712">Okay, we pull in there, at first I don't see -- it looks like a peaceful city, you know.</span> <span id="s713">Here we are on the ground area and I get out -- we get out to stretch our legs, but the minute I turn, I'm facing that way and I see this boy, eight to ten years old, and he's talking to a soldier, and he has something in his hand, and I go -- naturally I wanted to see what's going on there, and so I go over there and I see the furnace immediately with the door open.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: So you're inside the camp already?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: Yes, and this was up by the building where we were finally housed.</span> <span id="s716">And he's showing these pictures, and he had them all -- in all stages of being gassed and piled bodies and being brought to the furnace.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So they were photographs of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Actual photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: I wonder where he got them.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: And where he got those -- I wish he had -- and that boy disappeared that very day, I don't know -- when we were called to go check in for our baggage and our housing, he was gone and never found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Do you remember what he looked like, how he was dressed?</span> <span id="s722">What --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: He just had on regular pants and a shirt and he was about -- and that soldier bought these from him, the pictures.</span> <span id="s724">I wonder where he got them.</span> <span id="s725">I think about it so many times, where did he get those pictures, but they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Did he look like he was a local boy from the town who had come there?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: That's what I'm -- I'm thinking he was either from Dachau or he was from that thing that I called the hospital.</span> <span id="s728">Now, I'm not sure if that was the hospital back there, because on the map that I was sent, it showed the hospital in a more area where there were all buildings around it, but that wasn't the case where I landed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Well, tell me --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Oh, by the way, that furnace door was open and I could see hair all over.</span> <span id="s731">It was just filled.</span> <span id="s732">Big clumps.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Did you -- so this was the first time you see what was going on in Dachau, and what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Oh...I had read about it and heard, you know.</span> <span id="s735">I said, well, here, look, I'm looking at where it actually happened here, you know, here it is.</span> <span id="s736">I could see ashes in the furnace.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Do you remember the hair color?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Do you remember the color of the hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Gray.</span> <span id="s741">Lots of gray hair.</span> <span id="s742">And some were kind of black, you know, but they were big, and the door was open.</span> <span id="s743">And then I turned around the other way and there was the water tower, and it wasn't a typical water tower where you would get drinking water from.</span> <span id="s744">I'm sure it wasn't.</span> <span id="s745">I'm sure it was a collecting tower for water where they could perform those experiments that I read about, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Well, tell me what you had read, because I was trying to get a sense of how much you knew what you were going to see, and it seems that you didn't know that there were some things that were going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: So when was the first time you heard of what might have been going on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: That was months before I read in the paper and people talked about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: In the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s752">We got -- well, we just heard about it over there even.</span> <span id="s753">We knew that it was going on, right.</span> <span id="s754">And that water tower, it had no top on it, either.</span> <span id="s755">That made me think, oh, this is where they performed those -- you know what they did, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Well, I want you to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: I would like for you to tell me what –</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: I read where they actually took them, the bodies, and put them in there alive to test how long they could survive in the cold water.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: And how high was that water tower?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: It wasn't -- well, it was probably -- the stands were probably about 8 feet and then it was maybe 10 feet tall, I would guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So it wasn't one of those water towers that's way up high?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: No.</span> <span id="s764">No.</span> <span id="s765">It was one where there's plenty of water in there that would freeze and collect water from the rain and everything else, and I'm just sure that -- and I could visualize this area was perfect for this set up, because when I went to the big -- then the other building that was there, the huge warehouse, I wish I knew the whole history of that thing there, but when I first went there, there's this entryway, and the first thing I see is these shelves filled with the jars, you know, with all the human parts of the body.</span> <span id="s766">And I said --</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Were they labeled?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: What?</span> <span id="s769">No, but I could tell what they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: You could tell what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: You want me to name them?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Hands, complete hand, fingers, ears, eyes, breast, a penis, liver, kidneys, intestines -- everything.</span> <span id="s774">It sticks.</span> <span id="s775">You're not going to forget that.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: I saw that and then I knew -- I says right away, well, this would be the spot maybe where -- this house where we're going to be staying, maybe there were doctors in there, you know, with a few SS troops because they had the angora hutches there, two hutches with rabbits.</span> <span id="s778">And I also read that they used that fur for the colors for their uniforms in there.</span> <span id="s779">And I don't know who fed those rabbits.</span> <span id="s780">I never saw anyone feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: And there were still live rabbits there?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yes, there were rabbits in them.</span> <span id="s783">And then the big -- that building was so huge.</span> <span id="s784">I think it was longer than a football field.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Which building was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: As you went through the entryway into a big warehouse behind it.</span> <span id="s787">There was a big opening door and you go in there and that's where the tables were with all of these instruments that were manufactured, and I believe –</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: What kind of -- I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I think the Holocaust victims might have made those.</span> <span id="s790">But I saw no machinery in there at the time because we didn't get to stay there long enough.</span> <span id="s791">We only saw the first table, but I'll bet there were a hundred tables in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: But tell me what kind of instruments are you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Oh, there was compasses, pliers.</span> <span id="s794">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Pliers, compasses, wrenches, all kinds of drafting material.</span> <span id="s797">Beautiful, beautiful things they were.</span> <span id="s798">And I wish I could have gone in -- and you know what happened the next day?</span> <span id="s799">We never went in there again, so I think the thing was locked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Well, tell me -- let's step back a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: What was the name of the town that you were in before -- Wasser something?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I think it was Wasserburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Wasserburg, okay.</span> <span id="s805">So when you're going from Wasserburg and you're on a truck and you're being told you're going to go someplace but you're not being told where?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Not really?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Okay, and you're not told why, either --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: -- what you're going to be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: And so your first impression is when you see this little boy and he's showing these photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: And when he shows the photographs, by that point do you know that you're in Dachau Concentration Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Oh, definitely, yes.</span> <span id="s817">We knew that.</span> <span id="s818">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: And that's inside the camp.</span> <span id="s820">So your truck must have gone into some kind of fenced enclosure?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s822">It was -- well, it wasn't.</span> <span id="s823">Then did I tell you about the women in that stockade that I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: I would like -- let's bring that -- we'll get to that, but I would like to get a sense of what you saw when you got into the camp and you're on the road and then all of a sudden you're somewhere else, and what was it that -- you know what did you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Well, first the boy, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Were there walls?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Oh, there, okay.</span> <span id="s828">We were fenced in.</span> <span id="s829">We got the building there and then there are trees.</span> <span id="s830">All around us there's trees, so you don't see much other than the building that I mentioned and the water tower.</span> <span id="s831">We're hemmed in.</span> <span id="s832">And the Danube was right behind our building.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So, in other words, you've driven into an enclosure?</span> <span id="s834">The trucks have gone into an enclosed area?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: More or less with the trees, if you count the trees.</span> <span id="s836">There was no fences.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: There were no fences?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: I wish I could spot it on that map, but I just can't find the location.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s842">That's okay.</span> <span id="s843">And you get off of the truck and you see that there is this kid talking to one of the soldiers and the soldier buys the photos from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: And then when you look around, you see -- what else do you see?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: The tower.</span> <span id="s847">I start tying everything together, and then that building with the annex to it with the shelves and all of the –</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: There's no sign that says Dachau Concentration Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: By that point does somebody come to you and say why you're there?</span> <span id="s851">Do you figure out why you're supposed to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Not even yet, no.</span> <span id="s853">It took a few days and then finally one morning the lieutenant said we're going to dig out here.</span> <span id="s854">He put me in charge and we started digging some holes for the posts.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: For posts?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Posts for a little stockade, I guess, we were going to build.</span> <span id="s857">For whom I don't know.</span> <span id="s858">They didn't tell us that, either.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So you're digging and there are 20 of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Right, about 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: And you're the one who is responsible for them to make sure that they dig properly?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: Right, I was supposed to make sure that they did the digging.</span> <span id="s863">I did some of the digging and the lieutenant said, "You don't have to do that, you're in charge of this," but I kept digging anyway.</span> <span id="s864">I like to work.</span> <span id="s865">But then about two or three days later is when I saw that stockade in the other direction, and then all of a sudden all of these women appear looking through the fence, but you can't see many buildings because of the trees again.</span> <span id="s866">But then on this side you could see a little part of a building there, so maybe they were in that building the day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Do you know who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: Were they prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: They were prisoners.</span> <span id="s871">They were all dressed in these brown skirts and brown blouses.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Did they look well fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Not real well, no.</span> <span id="s874">They looked a little haggard, but they had been fed, I'm sure, yes.</span> <span id="s875">They weren't -- nothing like the Holocaust victims, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s876">I bet they were political prisoners or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: So they still had been prisoners of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: It wasn't Germans who became prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: No.</span> <span id="s881">Evidently they were from different countries because they looked a little different, not all alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: I wish I knew who they were, but then we lost track of them.</span> <span id="s884">They were gone again after a while.</span> <span id="s885">Maybe they left at night or something.</span> <span id="s886">That camp was weird in a way that there were ghosts there.</span> <span id="s887">There was no traffic in or out after we came.</span> <span id="s888">I can't remember a single truck or anything coming in.</span> <span id="s889">And the people at that hospital, that I call a hospital, about a hundred yards down the line from our building, all I saw there -- we weren't supposed to go there either -- were nurses evidently because they had the white uniforms on, and I felt, well, maybe they're nursing some of these Holocaust victims who couldn't move or be transferred.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you see -- but you saw -- you saw -- you saw former concentration camp inmates as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Where did you see those, those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: No.</span> <span id="s894">They were down there.</span> <span id="s895">Sometimes you would see one come out, I think.</span> <span id="s896">I'm sure they were because we couldn't tell from a distance, but I assumed they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: I guess part of me is a little confused because I always pictured that Dachau as a concentration camp had to be enclosed because otherwise people would escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s899">Hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: But that's not what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Not our area, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Unless the Army removed it, you know, but I doubt that.</span> <span id="s904">But they had removed all of the bed and things, I'm sure, from all the trains and everything.</span> <span id="s905">We didn't see any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: What date was it that you entered?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: This was a little later.</span> <span id="s908">I think we came there in June and then we stayed into July.</span> <span id="s909">So it was over a month after they had been cleared.</span> <span id="s910">But that's what I figured was going on down there at that hospital, that they were treating survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: They were treating survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yeah, and that would fit in perfectly there.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Now, had you -- but you didn't meet any survivors?</span> <span id="s914">You didn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: No.</span> <span id="s916">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: No.</span> <span id="s919">You didn't see anybody except we were the only ones there.</span> <span id="s920">No German, nothing.</span> <span id="s921">It was weird in a way.</span> <span id="s922">That boy, that's about the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: What did he look like?</span> <span id="s924">Was he blonde?</span> <span id="s925">Was he --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: He was sort of brown, a mix in a little blondish, if I can remember correctly.</span> <span id="s927">And I did know a little German, so I think I said, "Vater and Mutter," and then he been pointed, you know, I think, is how I got that message that he -- but I wonder what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Well, they wanted us to get organized in our place where we were going to stay, so they took us away.</span> <span id="s930">And the same thing happened from the big building.</span> <span id="s931">We didn't go back there again, either.</span> <span id="s932">That was locked up.</span> <span id="s933">Maybe they didn't want us to see in there anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: What was the place where you stayed?</span> <span id="s935">What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: It was a brick building.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: It was a brick building?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: With individual rooms, with a cafeteriA: You know, I don't even remember eating a meal there, but look at all I remember about the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: I don't remember eating a single meal there.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: But you had to have eaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: I can't remember sitting down to eat.</span> <span id="s943">Nothing.</span> <span id="s944">It's all gone, but that first day is right there 100 percent.</span> <span id="s945">And even the second and third day.</span> <span id="s946">Well, that one weekend we went to the Danube, wading and swimming in the water.</span> <span id="s947">These girls -- I told you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Tell me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: They came from Dachau, I think, and at the time I guess they were 17, 18 years old, so I -- they would put on their bathing suits and stand there and kind of wave at us, but all of a sudden we would wave or something and then they would go back and have their coats on quick.</span> <span id="s950">They did that two or three times.</span> <span id="s951">They would switch back and forth and then they were gone, and we just wadded in the water there.</span> <span id="s952">It was kind of -- cool off in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: It was hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: But I assumed that before Hitler that that was their place where they could come on the weekend and go in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: So you think these were local town girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: From the town of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: From Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: From Dachau town?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I'm sure there were about eight of them, I think.</span> <span id="s961">They hid behind the brush.</span> <span id="s962">There were narrow bushes there and they sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: So it sounds kind of isolated.</span> <span id="s964">Like you 20 guys were kind of isolated there.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: We were.</span> <span id="s966">Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s967">Well, we were setting up home there for a while.</span> <span id="s968">It was weird.</span> <span id="s969">It really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: And somebody told you to go dig those holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: So did you meet other U.S. military people in the camp at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: No.</span> <span id="s974">We were the only ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Who was it that told you to dig this stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: The lieutenant, our lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Who had come with you on the trucks?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Right.</span> <span id="s979">He's in charge.</span> <span id="s980">He was in charge of setting everything up.</span> <span id="s981">The cook was there and we had the cook, and it was really something.</span> <span id="s982">But those ladies, too, on the camp, I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s983">They took them out at night and they moved them because we never saw them again, but it was like ghosts were there in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: How did you feel that?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: In what way did you feel like it was ghosts?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well, that's why I think I buried those tools, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Tell me about the tools that you found.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s990">I found those and there were about four of them, pliers and compass and a few other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Excuse me that I'm interrupting, but where did you find them?</span> <span id="s992">Tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: They were out on the ground.</span> <span id="s994">They were sort of laying in a rag thing in plastic, and I picked them up, and I don't know why I didn't -- when I was a kid, I always buried things.</span> <span id="s995">And I do it now with our kids.</span> <span id="s996">We buried the box in our garden.</span> <span id="s997">We still haven't dug it up again.</span> <span id="s998">So I think that's why I did it, was to sort of put this whole thing to rest, as if I'm burying what happened here.</span> <span id="s999">I think I did that maybe.</span> <span id="s1000">And if I could be there, I possibly could find it.</span> <span id="s1001">I don't know, though.</span> <span id="s1002">Those trees were awful large then already, and I didn't bury very deep.</span> <span id="s1003">About that deep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: Where do you remember having buried them?</span> <span id="s1005">Was it under a tree?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Yes, it was by the tree.</span> <span id="s1007">About that far away from the tree.</span> <span id="s1008">And the ground was a little hard, but I got them covered up about that high maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: By "that high," you're talking about how many?</span> <span id="s1010">About a foot, about 8 inches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yeah, about 8 inches probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: About 8 inches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: And I leveled it off sort of nice.</span> <span id="s1014">I don't think any of the other guys knew that I buried them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: Did other guys find things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1017">One man -- I don't think they did.</span> <span id="s1018">No, I don't think they did, because none of them ever told me anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: Did you guys talk amongst one another about what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Not much of that either, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: No.</span> <span id="s1023">Well, I mean, this one man, when I went up there, we talked about -- we were shaking our heads and we were getting nervous and we couldn't believe this boy, that young boy there, but that was terrible, but then we were told not to go -- oh, yeah, not to go over to those ladies over there.</span> <span id="s1024">One guy wanted to go over there and go and talk to them, oh, no, no, you better not, you'll get in trouble.</span> <span id="s1025">I don't know why we couldn't go to that hospital down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: So you were just told to stay away from things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Uh-hum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And the building where you went where you found the jars with all the human parts, did you go there again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: I would have.</span> <span id="s1030">I would have loved to go way in deep there, but it was closed evidently because we never went in there again, and I know I would have gone in, and I don't remember -- because I know we couldn't go in there again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Who would have closed it?</span> <span id="s1032">Your lieutenant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Probably the lieutenant maybe got orders or someone from the other area there at the hospital maybe was in charge or something.</span> <span id="s1034">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1035">I wonder where all of those tools ended up.</span> <span id="s1036">That just bothers me something terrible.</span> <span id="s1037">What happened to that?</span> <span id="s1038">Why -- and who was feeding the rabbits?</span> <span id="s1039">It was just a puzzle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: And you never saw any corpses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: By that time in June there were no more corpses or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: No.</span> <span id="s1044">Everything was -- but that furnace showed me enough, though, about what happened there.</span> <span id="s1045">And why there was only one furnace, that would be perfect, though, for experimentation, wouldn't it?</span> <span id="s1046">They only needed one because they would take an individual -- they even inoculated some of them with bad diseases and then they disposed of the bodies, I would imagine, right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: When you had read this stuff back still in the states that there were things like this going on, do you remember how you reacted?</span> <span id="s1048">Was it kind of like disbelief or was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I think it was more disbelief than anything.</span> <span id="s1050">Who could do that, you know?</span> <span id="s1051">I mean, you start hearing about enough of it, you know, and you say, well, how can our people be doing that?</span> <span id="s1052">Here we have the ancestry sort of and, you know, how can...</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: You asked yourselves these kinds of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Did you ask yourselves those kind of questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Sort of, yes.</span> <span id="s1057">And then, you know, the people they say there in Daubner, they said they didn't know this was going on, but that's impossible.</span> <span id="s1058">They had to know this was going on.</span> <span id="s1059">The smoke was in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Did it smell funny when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: No.</span> <span id="s1062">That seemed to be quite gone, but I'm just sure -- I read about that also, how the smoke was drifting terrible.</span> <span id="s1063">I'm sure it's in all those places.</span> <span id="s1064">But I can say that there was no fence around us but these trees hemmed us in.</span> <span id="s1065">We were hemmed in and we just never -- and why we were given a pass to get out of there, I don't think that anybody ever left the camp other than the Danube River there a little bit.</span> <span id="s1066">Where would you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Where would I go?</span> <span id="s1069">I don't want to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1070">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1071">There might be a sniper there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: I turned it off because I sneezed.</span> <span id="s1073">You're saying it was weird, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: That really was.</span> <span id="s1075">We didn't really go -- want to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1076">I don't know where you would go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: It is strange.</span> <span id="s1078">So you're there, you're isolated, and you're there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: I would guess it's probably three weeks at least.</span> <span id="s1080">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: And your job was to build a stockade?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s1083">And then all of a sudden after we just leave it unfinished, too.</span> <span id="s1084">I remember that: It wasn't finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Well, what did it look like?</span> <span id="s1086">How much had you built?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: We just had some posts in there.</span> <span id="s1088">And the holes took a long time to dig, you know, because it was all by hand and shovel.</span> <span id="s1089">We didn't have the equipment, you know.</span> <span id="s1090">That's all we did.</span> <span id="s1091">I think we had about three or four of those holes dug, and, oh, we're going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And that was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: That was it.</span> <span id="s1094">On that map, though, it has to be one of the corners up in that map there, I think is where it is, where the river goes along, and that has to be the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Tell me how did that -- did it change?</span> <span id="s1096">Did you feel like it changed you when you saw this stuff?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1098">I mean, I can't imagine people doing -- it's just -- I mean, you pray to the Lord about it, you know, how could this happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: And did you while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Oh, yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s1101">I pray today that it never happen again.</span> <span id="s1102">Humanity to man, it's something -- even though I was young, I mean, you had that -- it's even more now.</span> <span id="s1103">Now you realize, you know, what it was really.</span> <span id="s1104">It builds on you.</span> <span id="s1105">It builds up the older you get.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Do you think having seen something firsthand it brought it home to you in a way that if you'd only read about it, it would have been different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: I think so, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1108">When I saw that furnace, you know, and that door open with that hair, and that boy, those pictures, then you knew what you knew, that that was Dachau.</span> <span id="s1109">I mean, that was -- I think that's why during that -- the more I think about it now, I'm glad I did that.</span> <span id="s1110">I sort of buried the inhumane things I did there in that hole.</span> <span id="s1111">That's the feeling that I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Those instruments that you buried, you said there were four pieces?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: About four.</span> <span id="s1114">Four or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Do you remember what they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1117">Well, I told you.</span> <span id="s1118">One was a compass sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Oh, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: -- a protractor and a wrench, I think, and pliers maybe and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: And do you think those were things that prisoners might have made or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: I really do.</span> <span id="s1123">I think so.</span> <span id="s1124">I mean, I think they were made by -- I'm sure they would unless this was a staging area where they brought all the tools.</span> <span id="s1125">But why would they bring them there and then ship them out or -- I don't know.</span> <span id="s1126">It just doesn't seem right, but it was a huge warehouse so it could be used for something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: So instead of the first day when you saw the warehouse and it had all kinds of tables and tools on it and items and things like that, it was similar to what you saw in that warehouse, those four things that you buried?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Yes, yes, oh, yes, plus a lot of others probably if I could have gone in there and looked at the other hundred tables.</span> <span id="s1129">Oh, there was -- you could see all the shiny -- you know, every table was filled, just filled.</span> <span id="s1130">And that was -- it was as long as a football field I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Did you meet anybody Jewish while you were in Munich or in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Let's see.</span> <span id="s1133">I think in that one town, maybe, one little town where we were up in a room and there is a boy -- a couple of boys that always came down, I think they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1134">They always came down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: What time was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Oh, gosh, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1137">Furstenfeldbruck maybe or one of those.</span> <span id="s1138">He'd come up to -- this one man had met them before we got there, and the boys would come up there and I would ask them about school and things, and he spoke a little English, too.</span> <span id="s1139">They talked in English, I guess, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1140">That's the only time, though, that I think that I really came in contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: So when you guys were taken out from there, you still didn't talk about it much with one another, those –</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: No.</span> <span id="s1143">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s1144">I'll bet we did.</span> <span id="s1145">I just can't remember.</span> <span id="s1146">I'm just sure we did, or unless we tried to put it all out of our minds, but I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1147">I think we talked about it, yeah.</span> <span id="s1148">I'm sure we did, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Where did you go from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Then I ended up in another wooded area, I think it was, where we had just barracks.</span> <span id="s1151">There was no real headquarters or anything.</span> <span id="s1152">It was just in the woods, because I remember spending a lot of days just sitting on a log in the woods and I remember thinking, well, where am I going to be 50 years from now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: I remember I thought that, saying here I am in Germany, the war is over now and I wonder what's going to happen now, what my life will be, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Can you tell me where -- do you remember the moment you heard that the war had ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Well, let's see.</span> <span id="s1157">Oh, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1158">Where were we?</span> <span id="s1159">Oh, boy, that was -- we were counting -- I'll tell you, I can't exactly.</span> <span id="s1160">It's unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: But when you landed in France, the war wasn't over yet, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: No.</span> <span id="s1163">Well, we must have heard.</span> <span id="s1164">It must have been the real happy moment right then.</span> <span id="s1165">It had to be, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s1166">I just can't put my finger right on it exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Did you ever -- from the time you landed in Europe, the bells that you heard in the water and then in Le Havre where you landed, did you ever feel like you were in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1169">When we were on the train there even we heard some sniper shots, rifle shots coming over, and we can still –</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Okay, so the war wasn't over then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: No.</span> <span id="s1172">No.</span> <span id="s1173">They said, "Oh, boy, there's snipers out there, you keep moving."</span> <span id="s1174">So we kind of got inside the car a little more, you know.</span> <span id="s1175">I was even a little scared in Munich when I got out of there on the tracks there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: And you saw ___+.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1178">A little bit.</span> <span id="s1179">Well, it's an 18-, 20-year-old fear, I guess.</span> <span id="s1180">I guess we're a little brave at that time, in some ways we are, but you do have a feeling.</span> <span id="s1181">And then I think back now when I walked in some of those woods there, what if they hadn't cleared all the mines up?</span> <span id="s1182">I never thought about them but now I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: You know, and even at Dachau.</span> <span id="s1185">And I often think with Dachau, I wonder if I'm standing on ground where people spent the last moment of their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: Very possibly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: That's what I was -- that bothers me a lot.</span> <span id="s1188">I'm thinking my feet stood right there where someone maybe was spending their last five minutes on this earth.</span> <span id="s1189">And I was even thinking when we were digging there what if they had been buried there, but no sign of anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Did any of your superior officers engage in conversations or explanations as to what Dachau was?</span> <span id="s1191">Anybody from U.S. military afterwards or during talk with all of you guys who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s1193">No, they didn't.</span> <span id="s1194">They didn't express any -- too much -- a lot of this -- you know, it's gone.</span> <span id="s1195">I don't want to say that they didn't because that would be very important.</span> <span id="s1196">I'm sure we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: But it sounds like so much of what was going on and from the memories, it was a vacuum of information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: It was.</span> <span id="s1199">Well, they don't tell you a whole lot, that's true.</span> <span id="s1200">We did not know what we were going to do there for a while, no.</span> <span id="s1201">And they didn't tell us about -- well, I guess they assume we all knew what happened, but he didn't warn us or anything, you know, to be careful.</span> <span id="s1202">I can't remember him telling us to be careful.</span> <span id="s1203">But those things bother me.</span> <span id="s1204">I wish I could have even have gone to that hospital there, you know, talked to people there.</span> <span id="s1205">There I bet I would have met some survivors.</span> <span id="s1206">I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">End of File One Beginning of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: And they didn't tell them about -- I guess we assumed we all knew what happened, but he didn't warn us or anything, you know, to be careful.</span> <span id="s1209">I can't remember him telling us to be careful.</span> <span id="s1210">But those things bother me.</span> <span id="s1211">I wish I could have even have gone to that hospital there, you know, talked to people there.</span> <span id="s1212">There I bet I would have met some survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1215">But we just never got the opportunity to do that.</span> <span id="s1216">And going in the big warehouse again, I would have loved to have gone in there and see if there were any machines in there, the back part of it, where they could have been working, you know, to produce those, because I'm sure they did use a lot of the Holocaust people to -- you know, they did work, made them work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Were you -- afterwards, in kind of retrospect, were you surprised that you were sent to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: Yeah, I mean, it was -- right, it hit me right away, you know, and I knew what had happened there, yes, right, and we really didn't do a whole lot there, did we?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: A couple of posts?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: But look what we saw.</span> <span id="s1221">Enough to make you get the full impact.</span> <span id="s1222">I almost got the full impact of what happened.</span> <span id="s1223">I can visualize now what was going on in the rest of the camp, you know, where they really had all of those -- one place they said they had a hundred rabbit hutches, I guess.</span> <span id="s1224">They must have gone –</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Do you remember about how many rabbits there were in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Here at my place is about four is all, but inside on the map it showed these hutches.</span> <span id="s1227">Man, they had them all built together or they must have had a lot going on with them.</span> <span id="s1228">And that's where most of the people were, I guess, the victims, weren't they, in the barracks and a huge section in the middle, and parts there were no barracks around our area either other than that one I showed you.</span> <span id="s1229">You know, that's all we could see is part of it, and there may have been some beyond that but the trees hid everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Well, the brick building that you were staying in, do you know what that was used for before during the time there was a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: I assumed it might have been used even by the SS or the doctors.</span> <span id="s1232">It was a perfect setup for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: For medical experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Right, I would say so.</span> <span id="s1235">There were separate rooms, you know, where they had -- where they put them.</span> <span id="s1236">And then the cafeteria, there was a little place for an eating areA: I would say it was a perfect setup, everything, and with the water tower and the display on the end, everything tied in together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: When you went back -- skipping ahead here a little bit, when you went back to Paullina, did you tell people about what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: You know, I didn't say too much.</span> <span id="s1239">Now I'm telling more, and now they're all asking me when they found out, you know, that I went on that Honor Flight, now they're saying, "You mean you were there," but they say most people don't talk -- they didn't talk about their World War II experience.</span> <span id="s1240">That's why they're doing these other _, I guess, people are opening up a little more now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Tell us about your Honor Flight because I think people wouldn't know about it.</span> <span id="s1242">Tell us what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Well, they want to get everyone there before they're gone, you know, and passing away.</span> <span id="s1244">What is it, a thousand a day or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: You mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: The World War II Veterans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Who wants to -- and what are the Honor Flights?</span> <span id="s1248">What are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: It's a group -- one man -- actually, the radio station announcer, he got people to give money for this and someone organized it is the president of the group now, and he gets the money, collects it, and when they have enough, they send another group, and they're almost through in our area now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: And they send them where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: To Washington here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: To Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: To see the monument, mainly the World War II and the other monuments, all of them, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So little by little all World War II vets can come to Washington to be able to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: You know what they should include in that is this museum right here.</span> <span id="s1256">I wish they would do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: So when you were on the trip here, you started telling some of the people you were with about Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: Oh, yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s1259">In our congregation, I brought it up at Sunday school.</span> <span id="s1260">At Bible class meeting I brought it up and told them.</span> <span id="s1261">Yes, I mentioned it.</span> <span id="s1262">Another friend of mine, he wants to get together with me, he wants me to tell him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: What about your folks, your parents, your brothers, your sister; did you talk about it when you got home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: My brother said, too, "I didn't know all that," he says, "Why didn't you tell?"</span> <span id="s1265">But they just say we haven't talked about enough things, even what happened in the war, you know.</span> <span id="s1266">Right, that's why we're doing these Honor Flights.</span> <span id="s1267">I mean, you're getting people to open up.</span> <span id="s1268">And they even asked these questions there when we were in Washington in May.</span> <span id="s1269">You know, "Where were you, what did you do"?</span> <span id="s1270">Now they're starting to open up more, and that's what we need, isn't it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: But how anyone can deny it is beyond me.</span> <span id="s1273">Like Iran, is that one of them denying it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Yes, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1276">So I'll be doing a lot of talking now, I think.</span> <span id="s1277">I'm going to tell my pastor about it and get him to express it to the people.</span> <span id="s1278">I know he mentioned it in his sermon already, too, about what the nation has gone through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Tell me, after you had left Dachau, what were -- how much longer were you in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Well, let's see, after Dachau, okay, let's see.</span> <span id="s1281">Okay, July -- man, I was there another five, six, seven -- about seven months after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: In one place or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: A couple of different places.</span> <span id="s1284">Like those wooded -- where we would just shift from one to another there sort of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: And what were the things -- what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: There wasn't a whole lot to do, believe me.</span> <span id="s1287">It was kind of a bad time.</span> <span id="s1288">You know, you were waiting for your points to pile up so you could go home, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: What does points mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: It went on the point system.</span> <span id="s1291">You had to have 35 I think -- you got so many for each month in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: And that all entered in.</span> <span id="s1294">When you went in, you had to have three years, I think, so I hit that mark, and then when I went over it, I guess then they put me up -- as we were going -- going home, another one was coming the other way, occupation forces, they passed us.</span> <span id="s1295">But when we were going to France, too, another one went the other way, they were coming home already.</span> <span id="s1296">Even though the war wasn't over, they were going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: They may have been wounded, you know, wounded soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: So did you stay around southern Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: It was all Bavaria, right, and I shipped off from Bremerhaven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Which is pretty far north?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Right, way up north, on a South American ship they borrowed from South AmericA:</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Did you have any kind of contact with the Germans while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: I tried to talk to one of them once, but he couldn't understand my German.</span> <span id="s1305">I said, "Wie heist dieser stadt."</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: That sounds pretty clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Not too bad, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Okay, and he didn't know -- by the way, that's a time when we were staying in a little house.</span> <span id="s1310">I didn't mention that.</span> <span id="s1311">We were in some German house.</span> <span id="s1312">We took over someone's house, I guess.</span> <span id="s1313">I don't know where they were, they weren't there.</span> <span id="s1314">A little plane landed, a Piper cub landed right in the field behind their house, and they came -- I don't know who that was, either, but that's the house where I was outside on the ground, I found this nice picture of that SS that you have, I found that laying there, so I picked that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: And you sent us a picture of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: You got one of those, yes.</span> <span id="s1317">It's a beauty.</span> <span id="s1318">I hate to say it -- well, it's a clear picture of the SS sniper, I think it was.</span> <span id="s1319">It's in there.</span> <span id="s1320">I think you have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: It's a sniper, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Well, I'll take a look later.</span> <span id="s1324">I don't recall if it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: Oh, there's a map.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: There's a map.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Let me see.</span> <span id="s1328">I had the corner spotted, I think.</span> <span id="s1329">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1330">Where was that river now?</span> <span id="s1331">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1332">I sure had it spotted one -- let's see.</span> <span id="s1333">This?</span> <span id="s1334">No.</span> <span id="s1335">This isn't the river up here, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: It looks too straight a line to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: No.</span> <span id="s1340">Let's see.</span> <span id="s1341">Beng -- no, that wouldn't be it, either, then.</span> <span id="s1342">But I know it was on one of the corners, I'm sure.</span> <span id="s1343">It was on one of the corners.</span> <span id="s1344">It was on one of the corners, I know.</span> <span id="s1345">I would say somewhere up in that areA: You see all this here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: Yes, that looks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: We weren't anywhere near this.</span> <span id="s1348">We had trees, trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: So when you talk about Dachau, do you mean the town of Dachau or do you mean –A: The camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: -- the camp?</span> <span id="s1351">You mean the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Even if it's still trees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: It's the camp, right.</span> <span id="s1355">Uh-hum.</span> <span id="s1356">Yup.</span> <span id="s1357">We were right on -- uh-hum, on the corner.</span> <span id="s1358">I don't know how big the town of Dachau is.</span> <span id="s1359">I don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s1360">It's not huge.</span> <span id="s1361">It's not large.</span> <span id="s1362">It's just a little...</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: It's now a suburb of Munich.</span> <span id="s1364">Munich has in the decades after the war grew enough that it may not be exactly part of the city, but it's so close to it, considered so close to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Didn't they make all the people go to Dachau to see?</span> <span id="s1366">I think they went along to pass through there, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: I know Boekenbon had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: I think I heard something about that, that they did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: So after that you stayed in southern Germany and when did you ship out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: I think it was April.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: April '46?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: '46, and then I ended up in New Jersey again somewhere, and then train to Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, where we're living now in Wisconsin.</span> <span id="s1373">I didn't think we would be living there, but we moved from Iowa, and then I got discharged there in probably about a week and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And you went home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Discharged home, right.</span> <span id="s1376">I took the train and they picked me up about 20 miles from home.</span> <span id="s1377">I could only get within 20 miles because our train didn't run anymore in our little town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: I used to deliver papers from there, from the train, but they closed it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: So your folks came to pick you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Right, came to pick me up, and that was a joyous moment there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: We all made it home, all three of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: And your parents, did they ask you about your impressions of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1386">They said, "Well, where were you?"</span> <span id="s1387">you know.</span> <span id="s1388">They hadn't had the education that we had, you know, so they were a little behind on that, but they knew enough about it.</span> <span id="s1389">And my father says, "Well, I was way up there and you didn't get up there," he said, and I said, "Yeah, but I shipped out from Bremerhaven," and he knew about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: He knew where Bremerhaven was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1392">And he had all his brothers came from there.</span> <span id="s1393">You know, two -- oh, one of his brothers was even a soldier in -- who was it that Germany had before Hitler?</span> <span id="s1394">Was it king, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Oh, no, it was a chancellor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Chancellor, yeah.</span> <span id="s1397">He was in his army.</span> <span id="s1398">He had his whole uniform with that point on the top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: With that old, blue uniform.</span> <span id="s1401">He was in that army, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Well, the Prussian king, Kaiser Wilhelm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: That's it I'll bet.</span> <span id="s1404">It was Wilhelm, yeah.</span> <span id="s1405">He was in that uniform, but he didn't -- well, he was older.</span> <span id="s1406">He didn't go into World War II then.</span> <span id="s1407">My father...</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: In general, in what way do you think your Army experience -- did it change you?</span> <span id="s1409">Did it shape you in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Well, in a way I always say to myself it was a great experience for me, in a way it was, to grow up, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: You felt like you grew up in the Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: More about the world, right, what people are like.</span> <span id="s1413">Read, write.</span> <span id="s1414">I often say, well, it was kind of tough at times, but I wouldn't want to give it up.</span> <span id="s1415">It was a valuable thing.</span> <span id="s1416">It really was.</span> <span id="s1417">Learning to live under certain conditions and the way you had to eat sometimes and training was even dangerous at night.</span> <span id="s1418">When it rained and poured in Texas, then our tent blew over, our pop-up tent blew away, and we didn't know what would happen.</span> <span id="s1419">We got soaked, you know.</span> <span id="s1420">Wake up in the morning and they served you some oatmeal and it's raining and, I'll tell you, it was -- and then you had to crawl under the wire fence during the machine gun shooting over you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Is this during training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Yes, during training.</span> <span id="s1423">The only mission -- well, they were pretty close.</span> <span id="s1424">They tried to make it realistic and you had to keep low, keep your head down.</span> <span id="s1425">Well, I really hope I answered a lot of your things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: I think so.</span> <span id="s1427">I think so.</span> <span id="s1428">I appreciate –</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: There's a lot of things that I wish I just knew more about, you know, like what happened to that boy –</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: -- where he came from, and those tools, what happened to all that and who made them, and why didn't we finish that what we started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: A lot of unanswered questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Right, and what happened to those women over there in that prison, why didn't we see them stockade -- or when did they come, why didn't we know more about that?</span> <span id="s1434">Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: I think those are terrific questions.</span> <span id="s1436">I mean, it's sort of like you see something and it stays a mystery until you have an answer for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: And here you were in a place for about six or seven weeks and there was no one who answered all of these mysterious –</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1440">But I've put it all together myself now and I'm so sure that's what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1441">It was a perfect setup for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: For the medical experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1444">When I looked at those jars, you don't have parts like that on display if you're just a hospital or something.</span> <span id="s1445">I wonder why they left them there.</span> <span id="s1446">I was surprised at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Were there like hundreds of jars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Oh, there were at least 20 or more, 30.</span> <span id="s1449">I would say at least three shelves.</span> <span id="s1450">I can just see them as if I'm looking at them right now.</span> <span id="s1451">And you wouldn't have that on display unless it was something unusual, like, why did they leave them there?</span> <span id="s1452">Maybe that's why they locked the building.</span> <span id="s1453">Maybe somebody came through.</span> <span id="s1454">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1455">I wonder if this area where I was if it even is a visitor's place now.</span> <span id="s1456">I wonder if it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Have you ever been back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: You've never been back to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: No.</span> <span id="s1461">Never went back.</span> <span id="s1462">That would be sort of interesting, but my age and my health isn't quite up to that anymore.</span> <span id="s1463">I would start digging if I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Maybe you would recognize where you were in relationship to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1466">I think if the furnace was still there, I can spot the place, I believe.</span> <span id="s1467">I know just about where I went from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: It sounds like Dachau was one of those moments that stays in your memory like where you were when Pearl Harbor was attacked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1470">Well, it did, because I told you I don't remember what I ate.</span> <span id="s1471">I can't picture a single meal.</span> <span id="s1472">I don't know when I went to bed, how I slept.</span> <span id="s1473">It's all gone.</span> <span id="s1474">And most of the days are just a blank, but that first day and that other day when I saw that other thing, the wire enclosure, those things stuck.</span> <span id="s1475">And then the girls at the river, you know, because the first time I saw any humans other than us.</span> <span id="s1476">But I think there were only about 20 of us, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Have you kept in touch with any of those others who were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: No.</span> <span id="s1479">We never got addresses.</span> <span id="s1480">We should have done that.</span> <span id="s1481">A lot of groups get together.</span> <span id="s1482">They do.</span> <span id="s1483">They're probably all gone now, though.</span> <span id="s1484">If they were a year older, they might have -- I shouldn't laugh about that -- I didn't laugh, but there aren't many of them around anymore.</span> <span id="s1485">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">Q: Well, I appreciate that you have shared your thoughts and your memories with us today.</span> <span id="s1487">Is there anything else that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: Well, I think I've covered it pretty well, I think.</span> <span id="s1489">I just wish we could have talked with more people though, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: -- the victims.</span> <span id="s1492">Never got to.</span> <span id="s1493">Never did.</span> <span id="s1494">The ones that survived were gone from us.</span> <span id="s1495">They were gone, taken care of evidently.</span> <span id="s1496">And I didn't know about that march, either, that they had from Dachau where they took -- we never heard about that, anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: It sounds like there was -- that there was very little information that you got while you were in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1499">The officers didn't tell us much about anything like that, never.</span> <span id="s1500">Nope.</span> <span id="s1501">They should have maybe, shouldn't they?</span> <span id="s1502">But my guess -- yeah, but someday if I ever find out where I was, I'll have to write you and tell you.</span> <span id="s1503">I've got the maps at home yet, so I'll try to spot it.</span> <span id="s1504">I'll try to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s1506">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1507">In that case, I will say thank you for your time, for your memories, and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Martin Gaudian on February 16th, 2011.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: Thank you for listening to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Conclusion of Interview Interview with Martin
