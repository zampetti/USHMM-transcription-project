name, your parent’s names, the details of your birth, and your siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s19">My name -- oh, you are holding it?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My name is Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s22">Actually, f -- at home they used to call me, because I come from an Orthodox home, Moshe, Moshe Kornberg.</span> <span id="s23">And I was born in Poland, in Chadbush.</span> <span id="s24">My father’s name was Menachem Rafar Rafael.</span> <span id="s25">Menachem Rafael.</span> <span id="s26">My mother’s name was Yentla.</span> <span id="s27">Her maiden name was Malkavietska.</span> <span id="s28">My -- the oldest in our family was my sister Sarah.</span> <span id="s29">She was married.</span> <span id="s30">Her husband’s name was Moshe Alexander.</span> <span id="s31">They had three kids, the oldest was a girl, and she had two boys.</span> <span id="s32">Then was my oldest brother, his name was Haim.</span> <span id="s33">He was managing -- my father was semi-retired, and he took over the business, and he managed the business until -- as long as I remember, until the war started, and I didn’t see him any more.</span> <span id="s34">Next I have another brother, his name was Ayah.</span> <span id="s35">He left Poland, he was in a kibbutz in Poland, he left Poland, he went to Israel to build Israel up.</span> <span id="s36">And this was probably in 1933.</span> <span id="s37">Then next I have a sister, she was still single, and her name was Miriam, in Polish used to call it Manya.</span> <span id="s38">She was at home, living with the family.</span> <span id="s39">Then I had another brother, his name was Abraham, and he was still single, he was three years older than me, and I was the youngest in our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: So there were six of you altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Right, six brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: I’m correcting that because much of the Holocaust material said seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Any time that you have any question, I’d be glad to answer it.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: And both your parents were -- were Jewish, and brought you up in -- practicing a sort of Orthodox Jewish faith.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Right, exactly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: I was interested in the fact that you were educated privately --</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: -- and I wonder if you’d tell me more about -- more about that, and also the fact that after the age of 14 or 15, you were given more freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Yes, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s50">I -- I was raised in a strict Orthodox family, more or less my father belonged to Hassidim.</span> <span id="s51">And -- but the only difference was, he was not a fanatic either.</span> <span id="s52">We had been home -- three brothers and sister, we always brought home Zionist organization’s books.</span> <span id="s53">We had to do always -- parents, my father’s j-job was to keep us busy.</span> <span id="s54">So we could do anything.</span> <span id="s55">Our education, he never rejected it, or tell us he want us to read.</span> <span id="s56">And actually, what we used to bring home, always books, and all those brothers and sisters, he practically read all books, although he was more a model Orthodox person.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And was it usual to give young men much more freedom when they reached the age of 14 or 15?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: More or less.</span> <span id="s59">I think this what it was.</span> <span id="s60">Til 14 - 15, actually, we had to go along always, like the services, special on Shabbas, on holidays, we always went along with my father, and it would be not nice for us not to go along, so we went along.</span> <span id="s61">But after we had been 15 years old, we still went for education, Jewish religion, and higher learnings.</span> <span id="s62">But my father had enough, was wise enough to see that the world is changing, and you cannot stay always in -- how he would like it, so he gave us more -- all brothers and sisters, freedom.</span> <span id="s63">After fif -- 15, we could d -- go our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: I wonder if you’d also tell me how you viewed your family’s position.</span> <span id="s65">In the -- the videotaped interview, your -- you cover your family history, but would you tell me whether they should be regarded as urban or rural?</span> <span id="s66">As middle class, as a better off family?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Oh, our family was a very great family, with lots of love.</span> <span id="s68">Kids for parents, and vice versa, parents for kids.</span> <span id="s69">Our economical status was fairly good, better than average.</span> <span id="s70">And the most of all, it cannot go higher with regards in us to our parents, and vice versa, the parents to us.</span> <span id="s71">I feel that love like this cannot be greater, and will never be greater, at the times what I spent home, and close the circle with our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And I assume that it’s that family background that enabled you to -- to cope with life.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: This is a question actually, I cannot answer too good of it, because under the circumstances, I practically gave up life the day when I was arrested.</span> <span id="s74">This was in January, must been around July or August, and I was integrated for Gestapo, and beaten unmerciful, but I was -- the most fear was, for me actually, beating, because they used to beat me when I was interviewed by Gestapo, til I passed out.</span> <span id="s75">When I passed out, they didn’t have running water, over there at the police station, they dragged me out to a well, where they poured water on my head, and I was revived, dra -- dragged back inside, and again beating, and beating.</span> <span id="s76">And this was my biggest fear of it was beating.</span> <span id="s77">And I begged the officer who interviewed me to shoot me on the spot.</span> <span id="s78">He laughed, and he told me, “You don’t have to worry about this.</span> <span id="s79">You don’t nec -- you don’t have to expect tha -- that you will live.</span> <span id="s80">But we finish you off not when you want it, we finish you when we want it.”</span> <span id="s81">This was the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Did you ever know why they were questioning you, and what information they wanted to get from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Yes, it’s a big story, I gonna try to -- just to tell you in more details.</span> <span id="s84">We had business, all kind of bus -- my parents started actually, with a grocery store, good business.</span> <span id="s85">But when my mo -- my oldest brother, Haim, when he was more or less in his 20’s, early 20’s, and he slowly took over business by our parents, and he always looked at a food store, little grocery store, we could make a living, he made a living, but he couldn’t make money all the -- actually for a better life.</span> <span id="s86">So he started it, he -- he was a representative -- in our town, small town in Chadbush was four smaller factories.</span> <span id="s87">They all produced the same product, more or less, like knives, forks.</span> <span id="s88">And the mostly of it, it was not expensive, it wasn’t the most cheapest actually, tableware, what you can have it.</span> <span id="s89">And this used to be shipped to Galeetsia, farther down near the Russian border where we had it.</span> <span id="s90">And my brother used to supply raw materials, and apparently, I don’t know exactly, but he made always so much percentage on the supplies profit.</span> <span id="s91">And this got better and better every time, with more -- and the season mostly in those factories, smaller fat -- f -- smaller factories was about four or five months of the year, where business were real good, and about six, seven months were slack.</span> <span id="s92">And they had a rough time to meet payrolls for the workers what they kept on.</span> <span id="s93">And my buth -- my brother used to borrow money, actually to those factories, not for a favor, but actually to make some money, too.</span> <span id="s94">So they paid so much percentage per month, or whatever, I was not familiar, I was too young to know about business.</span> <span id="s95">Then finally he invested in one particular factory, it belongs to a Gentile in out town, his name was Rochinsky.</span> <span id="s96">And he had a little bit rough time to repay it, whatever he owed us, so he took -- he proposed my brother to be a partner in the factory.</span> <span id="s97">And this went on til war time [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s98">In 1939, when the Germans came in, my brother realized it’s another -- a different era already.</span> <span id="s99">We -- as being well and everything, but we realized that we shouldn’t show that we had any interest in the factory, because we know it, that Jewish property was confiscated right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s100">Nobody went down, because before the war, since 1937, my brother send me over to the factory to get the fa-familiar with the procedures, how to deal with the people who worked in the factory, and how to deal with customers who buy -- bought our merchandise; to get familiar with it.</span> <span id="s101">But since -- when the Germans came in, this stopped, so my brother said, “Don’t mention any more, you stay home like anybody else.”</span> <span id="s102">And take -- in 19 -- the end of ’39, we had to go in to live in a ghetto.</span> <span id="s103">So we lived in the ghetto, and life got terrible expensive because Jewish people never got any rations, because rations for Gentiles -- they used to get the food cards every month, but didn’t got.</span> <span id="s104">So the Black Market was very high.</span> <span id="s105">If you want buy a loaf of bread, you have to buy -- you have to pay 10 times the value, and so any other products.</span> <span id="s106">Well, life got to get very expensive until 1940.</span> <span id="s107">In 1940, they arrested the owner, Rochinsky was arrested for Gestapo, because he was more or less a intelligent person.</span> <span id="s108">They had been scared, the Germans didn’t trust the more intelligent people.</span> <span id="s109">And he was taken in the 40’s, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s110">After two, three weeks -- we didn’t know much about the Auschwitz in 1940, but after two, three weeks, came a telegram that he’s not any more alive, and his clothing was sent back to his widow.</span> <span id="s111">And my brother said -- we have been three brothers at home, and the oldest brother, he had already like a green band, instead had the white arm band with the Star of David, he used to have a green band with the Star of David.</span> <span id="s112">The green band meant actually that you are privileged.</span> <span id="s113">A Jew was not allowed to dry -- to ride the train, or go out after seven o’clock from the ghetto, to be seen on a street.</span> <span id="s114">They had still curfew for Jews.</span> <span id="s115">And everywhere, wherever, you couldn’t move freely, but if you had a green band, you could ride the train, you had been -- you could move freely, you could go out after seven o’clock actually.</span> <span id="s116">And this was a -- of course, the German government required if you would supply some metal products, even scaret of metal.</span> <span id="s117">So many pounds, was -- I don’t know exactly, they gave you a green band that you are privileged Jew, and you could go more or less freely, wherever you wanted.</span> <span id="s118">He saw it that my -- otherwise we have it -- used to be any Jew from 18 til 55 was a -- forced to perform some labor for the city, otts -- clean cities, or whatever.</span> <span id="s119">I was assigned in a quarry, a stone quarry, actually, and was very -- pretty hard work, but it -- in the evening, after eight hours, or 10 hours, I don’t know exactly either, how many hours we worked, we could go home and spend with our family at home.</span> <span id="s120">This went on, but still my brother said that he going to see a very -- that I get a green band, too, that I will not have to go to the slave labor every day, to the quarry.</span> <span id="s121">True, he had some connections in a larger city with some Jewish, more or less, leaders from the Jewish community, and they had connection, they had been able to bribe Gestapo, and SS.</span> <span id="s122">Bribing, if you gave money or some products what they wanted it, you could get favors from them, and they did it.</span> <span id="s123">When my brother arranged the same way, he had to pay money for it, that I will be assigned, to start to be as -- to go every day to labor in the city, that my assignment will be to put in labor in the factory, to work in the factory, to perform labor, whatever it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s124">At this time the factory was idle, because Mrs. Rochinsky, she was -- she had three girls, and she was not able to manage a factory, she didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s125">Besides this, when the German came in, they right away, they froze all salaries.</span> <span id="s126">Practically anyplace where s -- they had [indecipherable] employees, they couldn’t pay any higher wages than -- than pre-war wages.</span> <span id="s127">And this was a problem, because whatever they have to buy, food for themselves, even with rations, or you wanted to buy something better, was sayvay four or five times as much as pre-war, [indecipherable] nobody wanted the war.</span> <span id="s128">When I -- when I had the permission to go down perform my job in the factory, my brother set me up, that I should get in contact with the employers who used to work before the war, and tell them if they come to work, they will be able to earn three times, or four times as much as they earned b-before the war.</span> <span id="s129">And they should be -- come to work to do their job, and we will pay them real good.</span> <span id="s130">I started to organize, and this -- people started to come back, until I opened the factory and started to produce.</span> <span id="s131">But, it was a problem.</span> <span id="s132">You had to have books, because you never know when the German government going to come to check your books.</span> <span id="s133">So e -- we have been forced to have double bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s134">One set of book was actually what we did pay them.</span> <span id="s135">Same way we used to get -- we used write [indecipherable] what we sold to dealers, we sold mostly to Jewish merchants, and we gave them a bill, the price like before the war, and they paid us the same way, two, three times this amount.</span> <span id="s136">But the point was we still had to keep double bookkeeping, until one of those days, and this was apparently in ’41, one of the employee, he was not mad at me, he work over there a long time already, and he knows me, and he saw me before the warm I was in the factory involved.</span> <span id="s137">And he got a -- with a disagreement with the owner in -- in the place, and he went to Gestapo, and he told them that the factory actually belongs more to us than it belongs to her, it’s a Jewish factory, and he told all kinds.</span> <span id="s138">For example, we used to have, when we finished merchandise before, we shipped it out to those merchants who bought our merchandise, we always had been afraid that someday the Gestapo will come, and they will confiscate everything.</span> <span id="s139">And where we used to keep finished merchandise, not far away from the factory in a village, and it used to be hidden aboll where we could always ship this merchandise, because we never know if -- when they will come to confiscate the factory.</span> <span id="s140">And he told the Gestapo everything, what is going on, that the merchandise is in a aboll in the next village.</span> <span id="s141">And finally, one day, like I said, must have been July or August, a policeman came to our home, and he said that I should come down to this jontamarie, where they had their headquarters.</span> <span id="s142">Normally, our town was a small town, we didn’t had, actually, Gestapo, SS in our town, only jontamarie we had it.</span> <span id="s143">But once in -- every few weeks, two, three weeks, what I don’t know exactly, they used to come in a larger town, SS, they -- if they had any complaints to take care cases, this when they come in to take care the -- of those business.</span> <span id="s144">And iva the policemens told me I am called to the jontamarie, to come down.</span> <span id="s145">And I remember, and I can remember it exactly like today.</span> <span id="s146">I looked at my mother, and I saw her face, and it didn’t help me that I have to go down, but it help me the suffering in my mother, and so my father, too.</span> <span id="s147">I went down in a sleeveless shirt --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Let me go back and ask --</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: -- ask you to describe your mother’s expression.</span> <span id="s151">Because that would be something that’s always stayed with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Expression of my mother was -- it’s unforgettable, because like I just said, it’s exactly -- I can see it with my eyes right now, how her expression was -- she felt scared.</span> <span id="s153">She didn’t know it -- what it will happen to me.</span> <span id="s154">And I could read anything what she had in her mind, I saw it with my eyes.</span> <span id="s155">I saw my father -- I was sleeveless, I didn’t took even my jacket, and I told them, I ha -- I practically shivered, and I said, “Please don’t worry about it, I will be back in a couple hours.”</span> <span id="s156">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Also, have you thought about why they -- why they took you?</span> <span id="s158">Was it because you were younger, and might speak more freely?</span> <span id="s159">Why they took you, and not your older brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Because I was in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: And your older brother, Haim?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: My older brother, he was still traveling around, and he dealed with raw materials.</span> <span id="s163">Yeah, but I was in the factory [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: I see, so you did know more.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: -- actually.</span> <span id="s166">And so the -- everything -- whatever he mentioned it, he mentioned me as a -- you know, the double bookkeeping, and everything that I was involved.</span> <span id="s167">And so this why they called me.</span> <span id="s168">And I went down, it was a pretty warm day, and I came down over there, and I was called in in a room, where I saw a very high officer.</span> <span id="s169">I couldn’t tell his rank, I’m not familiar, but he was a very high officer.</span> <span id="s170">And I looked, he had a stack of papers, maybe two, three inches high, and he start to ask me questions, if I am in the factory over there, if I help manage the factory.</span> <span id="s171">And right away I realized, when I saw this stack of papers, I realized what the questions are, that he knows more than I myself know, because of I realized that it’s no use to lie, and I start to tell anything fully -- fully to cooperate with them.</span> <span id="s172">But this was not a big deal, cooperation did not help to save me.</span> <span id="s173">He called in two strong guys from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s174">Young guys, strong guys.</span> <span id="s175">And they had like a special chair, like to lay down on it, not to sit, but -- on my belly to lay over there, that my back, everything is exposed.</span> <span id="s176">And they came in with -- the -- the SS and Gestapo, they used to carry, when they went on the street, made from leather -- I don’t know even how they call this in English, I don’t recall, exactly, whatever.</span> <span id="s177">You know, for beating somebody, just on the street.</span> <span id="s178">They saw a Jewish kid, or whatever, they beat over the head with it, something like this.</span> <span id="s179">And they told me to lay down on my belly on this chair, whatever it was, it was built special for this purpose, actually.</span> <span id="s180">And in both sides, right and left, kept on pounding in my body, actually.</span> <span id="s181">And actually, it’s impossible.</span> <span id="s182">I was young, and strong at this time, maybe, but beating like this, I don’t think any human can take it.</span> <span id="s183">And I used to pass out.</span> <span id="s184">When I passed out, they dragged me out to the well, they pumped water on my head.</span> <span id="s185">As soon I came back, they dragged me back in, and again and again and again.</span> <span id="s186">And I always was more on the floor anyway, especial with the beating, I couldn’t stand straight any more.</span> <span id="s187">They didn’t give you a chair to seat, and so you had a choice, all to be on your all four on the floor, or actually -- you know, to stay, you couldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s188">I was always on the floor.</span> <span id="s189">I went -- he was sitting at the table, he had very polished, high boots on it, and I remember I practically was very -- pretty close to his boots.</span> <span id="s190">And I told him in German, “Please shoot me.</span> <span id="s191">Please finish me off.”</span> <span id="s192">And he laughed, looked in my eyes, he said, “You don’t have to worry about this, but we finish you off when we want it, not when you want it.”</span> <span id="s193">And this went on hours and hours.</span> <span id="s194">This was actually -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s196">This is tape number one, side B. I have a question about an earlier time, and that is that when the Germans invaded Poland, and you fled to the woods for a few days --</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What would be the reason why your home was spared, when much of the town was burned?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: This is a -- this is the same way, this -- you cannot ans -- for a question like this, this just happened to be that the -- first was burned the synagogue, what this was once in the -- famous all over the world, not in Poland, but all over the world, was a famous for art, and beauty, and anything what is possible, actually, to describe this synagogue.</span> <span id="s200">And the reason was actually the synagogue was near a river what it went through our town, the Pilitsa.</span> <span id="s201">And it was a bridge, and the bridge actually was a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s202">It was not a heavy structure, a wooden bridge.</span> <span id="s203">And when the Germans invaded, I remember it was on a Friday, the first of September was on a Friday when they c -- yeah, it was a Friday, and Saturday they have been already over there.</span> <span id="s204">And so the first thing what they did, they tried to secure the bridge, they -- they can come in and cross wherever they wanted with their armies.</span> <span id="s205">So they put the bridge on fire, after they went in, and this was near the synagogue, and because the structure was a wooden structure, apparently -- I don’t know, maybe they put bombs -- firebombs actually on it before -- this i -- I don’t know either, because I actually, myself, and so the -- mostly of the town, the whole town, run away in the woods.</span> <span id="s206">So we didn’t know exactly, but we know it right away the next day, that the synagogue was burned.</span> <span id="s207">Actually, it was nothing left over from the synagogue.</span> <span id="s208">This -- this all as I can recall, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: I should say on tape that we -- we -- I changed the subject abruptly, but I should let listeners know that your detailed story of your arrest and beating by the SS officer, is told on the March 1990 videotape --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: -- at the Holocaust museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: And I want to fill in some gaps from that earlier interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Okay, go ahead, whatever you ask, I will -- if I can answer [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s216">One of the questions was when you were living in the ghetto, was that in Chadbush?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Chadbush, the main place, actually, was Chadbush it was the name, but Chadbush was the -- a divided.</span> <span id="s218">On one side of the river -- of the Pilitsa, where the bridge was, was the one side was Chadbush, when you crossed the bridge, they called it Vidamma.</span> <span id="s219">Actually, it was the same town, but it still, this was Chadbush, and this was Vidamma.</span> <span id="s220">In the ghetto, when they had to leave everything, the houses, and anything, and go, the ghetto was actually made in Vidamma.</span> <span id="s221">The reason was because it was already a little bit out of the town, and it was easier to petition it off with wires, or whatever, to make it that you cannot just walk out of the ghetto as a free person.</span> <span id="s222">And this was the easiest thing, cause of the German decided that Vidamma wi -- will be the ghetto, and this actually where all Jews, including my family, lived.</span> <span id="s223">In Vidamma, in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I want to fill in another -- another gap, or clarify something, and this is moving ahead to when you were in -- I think it’s pronounced Javishavitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Yavishavitz.</span> <span id="s226">This is actually -- I was four weeks -- probably it’s mentioned the same way, my first tape.</span> <span id="s227">I went -- after the beating, they took me down, back to the factory, and I didn’t know it even at this time, that the widow from the owner, actually, she was a -- she was not Jewish, a Gentile, and she was arrested too, for the same crime like me, that we had double bookkeeping, that we had hidden finished merchandise, whatever.</span> <span id="s228">So she was arrested, and I never knowed it -- that -- til he -- until four weeks later.</span> <span id="s229">But I -- I was -- first they put me in a jail in Chadbush.</span> <span id="s230">And Chadbush was not a official -- a big jail, was a very small -- in fact, they used to call it -- I don’t know the name, accosa.</span> <span id="s231">A big jail is like jeminale, you know, but this was a small -- it was just for drunks, or whatever.</span> <span id="s232">Not too much, you know, criminals.</span> <span id="s233">And they hold me overnight.</span> <span id="s234">When I came to this jail, -- oh the first -- this was the first time in my life I came in a jail, but we used to hear stories, if you have been a newcomer in a jail, they made jokes with you, all kind, a lot of time even beating, or whatever.</span> <span id="s235">This was the fun -- this how -- it used to be a custom, and -- when you was a newcomer in a jail.</span> <span id="s236">When I came in over -- to this jail, actually, they probably realized I couldn’t walk straight, and mine back, everything, was black practically.</span> <span id="s237">But for some reason, they didn’t perform all those jokes, what they used to do it for a newcomer.</span> <span id="s238">And they felt more or less like sorry for me, you know, that I was all beaten up, so they let me alone.</span> <span id="s239">Little bit later on, came in the one who was like a policeman, he was in charge of this small jail.</span> <span id="s240">And he knowed my parents, or he knowed me, too.</span> <span id="s241">So he came over to me, he wa -- they was P-Poles, not a -- not Germans, but a Pole, and he came over, and he asked me if I want write home something to m -- to my parents about me.</span> <span id="s242">At first I hardly could even take a pencil, my hand to write any words, but I -- I said it’s necessary to write home.</span> <span id="s243">And I wrote home in the same way I think on the ID cards what they distributed in the Holocaust museum, what I took part those -- they have this saying in sayvay things like this you cannot forget.</span> <span id="s244">I wrote home, and I said in my few words what I was writing, I told them please -- twice I said please, please forget about me, I be all right.</span> <span id="s245">Go on with your life, noble.</span> <span id="s246">Just forget about me.</span> <span id="s247">This was in Chadbush still.</span> <span id="s248">This was my last word to my parents and family.</span> <span id="s249">The next morning they took me -- they brought me -- it’s just 40 kilometers from Chadbush, and the name is Koinsket.</span> <span id="s250">This is a larger town, and they had over there a -- a large -- a k -- prison -- a prison for the -- for -- mostly for people who don’t obey the law, whatever, but it was much, much larger.</span> <span id="s251">I was brought in over there, first they took me to Gestapo in Koinsket, and I was real -- really concerned.</span> <span id="s252">I-I didn’t care, I was afraid just for more beating, that I couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s253">So I -- every minute I was over there, I just kept on looking when they start -- going to start to beat me again, but they never did.</span> <span id="s254">They brought me over to the jail.</span> <span id="s255">When I came into the jail, I was released, that -- at least I wasn’t beaten any more, I came in over there.</span> <span id="s256">And the same thing, I know the procedure again, that those all in jail gonna make -- have fun, whatever.</span> <span id="s257">And they saw me coming in, and the same way they felt sorry for me, and they know it that I’m not a criminal, and they realize that -- why I am over there, because it was involved for politics too, because the bookkeeper from our factory used to always to give me a -- handle over some mimeographs that used to come from the underground, from the -- England, to tell you how the front goes on over there.</span> <span id="s258">And so he told them that I -- I have knowledge about the underground, too, was a -- this was part why I was arrested, actually.</span> <span id="s259">And they kept on coming, talking this over, how I behaved, and -- and I did whatever they told me.</span> <span id="s260">We have been in a cell, probably was over there the same way, between 30 and 40 people, and everybody has a -- like in a corner, in a straw sack he had over there where you rested overnight to sleep, actually.</span> <span id="s261">In the same way it was no modern facilities in this jail.</span> <span id="s262">We used to have a large can, real huge, and everybody -- what a human has to do it, or -- they did everything the whole night, in this large kettle -- can, whatever.</span> <span id="s263">And in the morning it was always they changed it.</span> <span id="s264">Two people, they used to carry out, and take care, and then was to sc-scrub the floors, to keep it clean, everything.</span> <span id="s265">I recall after a f-few days that -- certain the third day, the fourth day, it was -- I was in the line to carry this out, and scrub the floors, and so far.</span> <span id="s266">And I went over to do it, I didn’t look that somebody should do for me any favors, I went over like any other prisoner.</span> <span id="s267">And then one Pole came, and pushed me away, and he said he will do this for me.</span> <span id="s268">I -- I didn’t want to fight it, I let him do it.</span> <span id="s269">And the same way, after a few days, maybe after a week, the one who was in charge, like the warden in jail, he was not German, he was Polish, too.</span> <span id="s270">So he called me in his office, he came to me, I went down from that cell in his office.</span> <span id="s271">And he told me, “Don’t be upset, you probably -- your brothers are working for you that you going to be released.</span> <span id="s272">You will probably be -- be released if not this week, is next week, a third week.</span> <span id="s273">But they work for you, to release you.”</span> <span id="s274">It meant that they going to bribe the Gestapo for it.</span> <span id="s275">And he says, “I know -- they are in contact with me, and I will see that you get food.</span> <span id="s276">You don’t have to eat that food from the jail.</span> <span id="s277">Somebody will bring in every day, food for you.</span> <span id="s278">And so you going to have private food, not from jail.</span> <span id="s279">But,” he said, “just -- this is a secret.”</span> <span id="s280">This is a very dangerous thing, I should never tell nobody what happened, what had happened.</span> <span id="s281">He will see that I will be supplied with food.</span> <span id="s282">And I noticed that actually that it changed a little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s283">I felt more comfortable, and so were all those other in the cell, the other person thas this -- they didn’t know it, where I was exactly, but -- this was a secret when I called into the office, to this warden.</span> <span id="s284">But they saw something goes on, so I didn’t say a word, but they felt that I am better treated like anybody else, more or less.</span> <span id="s285">And so they tried, actually, always, what I had to do, they jumped in, pushed me away, and they used to do it for me.</span> <span id="s286">And we got along fairly well.</span> <span id="s287">This was -- actually, in jail over there, in Koinsket, I was four weeks.</span> <span id="s288">I remember one day they brought in two Jewish people, because I was the only Jew on the -- in this cell.</span> <span id="s289">But they brought in a couple Jewish people, I know them.</span> <span id="s290">They have been in Vidamoff, in the ghetto, they lived in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s291">They used to be butcher -- butchers, and they got caught by the German authority that they butchered a cow, or whatever.</span> <span id="s292">They took them, they put them -- they brought them over to the jail.</span> <span id="s293">And I can recall normally they have not been so religious people, a butcher, whatever, but one had along with him a prayer book, and the whole night he didn’t do nothing else, except he kept on praying from the prayer book.</span> <span id="s294">Prays -- was it -- to me it was not strange, it was familiar, everything.</span> <span id="s295">And I ask myself, he’s not such hot religious person, why does he pray so much?</span> <span id="s296">What is happen, early in the morning, maybe five o’clock, still was dark, they called off their name, they took them out, and we heard a few shots.</span> <span id="s297">The others in the cell told me, “You know, they got shot.</span> <span id="s298">They killed them.”</span> <span id="s299">Over there, outside the jail.</span> <span id="s300">I didn’t know now -- think I didn’t know it, if they are dead, if it’s true what they told me, but I know it -- it’s fa -- was not just calling off a name.</span> <span id="s301">We heard shots.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Do you know why they were killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah, because the same way, it was not allowed to butcher anything, especial on the kashrut you know, by a rabbi, and everything, this was their things, you -- this was not allowed.</span> <span id="s304">In fact, it was those -- the ghetto was so crowded, if a Christian, a Pole, start to bring in food to sell on -- for -- for profit, on the black market, whatever, and he got caught by gendarmarie, whatever, they put them in jail, too.</span> <span id="s305">R -- they didn’t dare to -- even to bring in food, even to make money, they been scared for their own life.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: You said something that inter -- interested me earlier, which was that the Gestapo may have felt you had knowledge of the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Yeah, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Tell me more about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: The bookkeeper in the factory, he was probably -- oh, probably eight or 10 years older than me, because he was married, and had I think, two, three kids already.</span> <span id="s310">And he used to like, you know, to drink a little bit.</span> <span id="s311">He was -- he was a brilliant man, a brilliant mind, very brilliant.</span> <span id="s312">His name was Levandoski, and he for some reason, he liked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Was he a Gentile, or a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: A Gentile, yeah, a Gentile.</span> <span id="s315">He liked me, and they didn’t know it at home, he used to take me along to restaurants, where he used to buy -- h-he -- he da -- was not so well off, you know, but he used to buy me that I drink with him together, and I used to do it, actually, because he wasn’t much older than me, and young people -- young boys like me, I was at this time 20 -- 19 years old, so it was for me a privilege.</span> <span id="s316">I used to come home, my parents used to think that I am sick, because they served dinner, and I didn’t eat it, I was not hungry, because I ate with him in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s317">And the ta -- same way that he had touch with the underground, actually.</span> <span id="s318">He used to take me home, even home, what is not allowed heah to foreign language -- foreign countries, and he used to, on short wave he get always, he got BBC, and plus he used to get once a month, a mimeograph, a little thing, they told you on the front what is going on.</span> <span id="s319">And he always shared with me, he really kept me -- I don’t know why, but like I would be his closest buddy.</span> <span id="s320">And he actually was arrested, too, before me.</span> <span id="s321">They send him to Auschwitz, the same way, after a week, two, he came a telegram, he’s not alive any more.</span> <span id="s322">We didn’t know really what Auschwitz means, what Auschwitz is, but we always was thinking, okilly, as soon you go over, a week later comes a telegram you dead, so it’s -- must be more than what anybody knows about Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: So, in fact, you wouldn’t really know for sure who told the SS about -- about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Oh yeah, yeah, I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: It was the disgruntled employee?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: It was a -- an employee, I knowed him very well.</span> <span id="s327">His name was Novokowski.</span> <span id="s328">He knowed me well, we got along real good.</span> <span id="s329">I don’t know -- he didn’t meant actually to hurt me, so much.</span> <span id="s330">He was trying to hurt the widow in the factory, because he was mad at her.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Yes, but the -- the widow, in fact, sounds as if she always was very honorable in her dealings with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Oh yeah, she respect us, she respect our family.</span> <span id="s333">She knows how much money we have in -- it’s involved -- what we have over there in the factory.</span> <span id="s334">Plus, she felt at this time, you have been a woman, a lady, something, you have not got involved in business.</span> <span id="s335">You was involved to raise th -- your family, the three girls, nobody’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: And so she was happy to see that I take over the duties.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yes, I wondered if that good relationship was unusual?</span> <span id="s339">I know that there was much anti-Semitism in Catholic Poland, but perhaps because they were somewhat part of the intelligentsia, she and her husband?</span> <span id="s340">A: Normally, actually, what it is, sure the anti-Semitism was a real great big, big, and every day got bigger actually, the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s341">This actually why br -- mine brother left in ’33, he saw it -- what is coming, more or less.</span> <span id="s342">And he say he doesn’t want to stay in Poland, doesn’t want no part, so he just -- and he was a patriot to build Israel, this was the reason.</span> <span id="s343">We thought he is not normal, he goes away from the -- from the good home, and he used to say he’s ashamed that we are making money easy, you know, he believe more you have to work for your money, not just from business.</span> <span id="s344">So far -- he was very, very much patriotic, but the -- with me, actually, I didn’t know it, I was over there four weeks in jail, and then suddenly, about -- after four weeks, I remember, yeah, somebody called my name.</span> <span id="s345">And I recognize right away this was the widow from the factory, Mrs. Rochinski, and she in Polish calls me, you know, and -- and so if she’s -- and she -- I responded, “Yeah, I am here, in this cell.”</span> <span id="s346">I don’t know if -- where she know it, or apparently she know it.</span> <span id="s347">And so she told me that she is released, she --after four weeks -- she was four weeks in jail, and she said she -- they released her, she goes home.</span> <span id="s348">She told me that I shouldn’t worry, I will go home.</span> <span id="s349">They had already the release for me, but they need a signature from a higher officer, and they have to go to another town for this high office signature.</span> <span id="s350">“So you probably will be released tomorrow,” she told me.</span> <span id="s351">And they all -- the other inmates in the cell where was -- I was with them, they all heard it, and everybody was happy for me, I going to go home tomorrow.</span> <span id="s352">And they gave me addresses to go to their families, and their wives, tell them how they are, what they this.</span> <span id="s353">It was a -- like a holiday already, the day when she called us.</span> <span id="s354">But the next morning, early in the morning, this what the procedure [indecipherable] in the morning, they called off my name, they called off other inmates name, but I -- something didn’t sound to me right, because they kept on calling too many names.</span> <span id="s355">Because they used to do every few weeks, every month or two -- but I don’t know the same way, exactly how often they did it.</span> <span id="s356">They emptied the jails for new inmates.</span> <span id="s357">In other word, they took those jails, and they send them to concentration camps, like Auschwitz or whatever, and -- but when they took us, they tied our -- our hand to the back, and -- just with a piece string, like, actually, nothing, and they put us on trucks, and they drove, I don’t know how many kilometer -- I never know even til today where I was.</span> <span id="s358">I think -- I assume it was Kelsa, because from Koinsket, biz -- Kelsa was not so far, and took about a couple hours in a truck.</span> <span id="s359">And then they brought us to a market over there on the -- we have been told -- we saw all around SS, with machine guns, rifle gu -- whatever, circled around us, and they kept on bringing to another jail, so I don’t know [indecipherable] else, until they get it, a large quantity of people the same way and it -- it must have been several thousand, actually.</span> <span id="s360">Took quite a number of hours, until when we all have been, and you have -- lay on the floor, on your knees, you could not raise your head, if you raised your head, your -- they told us, then you will be shot.</span> <span id="s361">You know, your -- right away they watched with rifles around over there, or machine gun.</span> <span id="s362">Well, we all laid on the -- on the f -- on the ground over there on this market, until actually they had the amount of people, or whate -- what they expected to have it on the jails, and they put us on cat -- those cattle wagons, in the same ways.</span> <span id="s363">We used to see the one who guarded some of them have been Wehrmarkt, and so we have been more friendlier, because you couldn’t just talk to one from the SS, he finished you on -- off on the spot.</span> <span id="s364">But we saw [indecipherable] they ask him where they take us, where we going to go, where we going.</span> <span id="s365">“Oh,” they used to say, “oh, you go probably where you going to have to l -- be over there, do some work, labor.”</span> <span id="s366">[indecipherable] all, and we didn’t know it until we arrived around midnight, probably, over there, and the first thing I saw it when they brought in, they opened the gate, and it said, the gate said abait bakt fry.</span> <span id="s367">And I didn’t know that this was a g -- in Auschwitz a gate, didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s368">But as soon we -- we got off in restraints, although it was guarded off -- they have a bi -- large ramp -- ramp, and both sides have been guarded by SS.</span> <span id="s369">And they had sticks, irons, all kind things, and when they chase you out, and everything was schnell, schnell, fast, fast.</span> <span id="s370">And so you got -- wherever you move, wherever you go, it didn’t make any different.</span> <span id="s371">They hit you over your head, or your back.</span> <span id="s372">It depends how lucky you have been, and we had to keep on moving.</span> <span id="s373">And this what we did, and then we saw people, like kapos in uniforms, striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s374">We didn’t know it -- they start to talk, and they said, “Here’s Auschwitz,” you know?</span> <span id="s375">And some of them have been only over there from those kapos what they -- they want to kill you practically on the spot.</span> <span id="s376">Any move, whatever it was, it didn’t make any different.</span> <span id="s377">It was only, you know, to make you so miserable, that you will give up li -- living.</span> <span id="s378">The truth is, I gave up right away the first day when I was arrested.</span> <span id="s379">I figured this is the end.</span> <span id="s380">And I could see it right away, wherever I was, that it’s nowhere in the world -- you know, the dreaming that I will go home, see my parents, see my family, or be free.</span> <span id="s381">A lot of -- the first thing when I gave up, I figured what’s the use to fight?</span> <span id="s382">You cannot fight this, and why suffer?</span> <span id="s383">So you -- no use to suffer either.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Well, what went wrong, do you suppose, in the plan that your brothers were working toward?</span> <span id="s385">It seems you came so close to being freed?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah, this is -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s387">In fact, Jewish people have not been allowed to visit a jail if they have somebody -- like some other -- if you have been Gentile, you have been allowed, I don’t know, every two weeks, or every -- to see some relatives or friend, but for Jewish people was not allowed.</span> <span id="s388">One time, the warden from the jail arranged that my older brother from me I was the youngest, but next to me, his name was Abraham, that he come to see me, he can speak with me.</span> <span id="s389">So I wait, he called me out to come to his office, took me out from the cell.</span> <span id="s390">There I was in his office, and he told me, look, this a -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s392">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: And he said he does it, but it’s not legal, it’s not allowed for a Jewish person to have any visits [indecipherable], but he says, “Your brother gonna come to this window,” and he hold me over there by the window, and he said, “You talk to your brother.”</span> <span id="s394">And I went in the window, I saw my brother, and he said, “Moshe.”</span> <span id="s395">And I said, “Avrum.”</span> <span id="s396">We called each other’s name.</span> <span id="s397">And then the warden, he watched it pretty careful, and he saw through the window that a s -- ess -- SS car coming closer, and he didn’t know where they come, but right away he said, “Back -- quick, back to the cell.”</span> <span id="s398">I went back to the cell, and I never saw nobody any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Too great a risk for the warden.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah, and the next day, this when they called off and they brought us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s401">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: I had wanted to ask, after you were -- you had been moved to Auschwitz, would your family have been able to trace where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Probably not.</span> <span id="s404">No way, I mean you -- this was so secretly arranged, that nobody could trace nobody.</span> <span id="s405">No, this was not -- never -- impossible.</span> <span id="s406">This I know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s408">And your information about your family after that, were you able to find out anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: I never heard it, and I never met -- I never saw nobody, not s -- ever.</span> <span id="s410">Nothing.</span> <span id="s411">In the same way, even when I was in the Auschwitz, and I saw this is the end of the w-world, and everything, but I never could forget not that I’m suffering -- this was out of the question, I just felt for their suffering, sorry you know, but it didn’t help me much.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: So, despite much questioning, I -- I know that you’ve checked whether any Jews had survived in Chadbush, and there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: None.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: -- there were none left.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: None.</span> <span id="s416">Zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: So, of your family of six, only your brother in Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: -- is known to have survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Do you have any other -- any other information at all about members of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: I checked when they had one time -- the Red Cross arranged one time a reunion with other who have been with me in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s423">And so I had left all names, and all whatever the questions what they gave me to fill out, and for awhile they send me a letter that they have everything, they keep on checking.</span> <span id="s424">Then, maybe six months later, or a year later, they send me another letter, they did their best, but they can never could place it -- any -- any of the names that I requested.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s426">In the years since then, have you ever gone back to that area, or ever felt a wish to?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: You mean my birth home?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s430">This was in 1945.</span> <span id="s431">Finally, I was -- the last dead march -- I -- I made more than one dead march, that was made in the end of December, between Christmas and New Year.</span> <span id="s432">The first dead march was from Auschwitz over Yaveeshavitz to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s433">Then, from Buchenwald I’d say where I was in a subcamp from Buchenwald, the name was Traylitz, this is near Leipzig.</span> <span id="s434">And around early April, or the end of March they say the -- the allied forces start to get closer.</span> <span id="s435">Well, the first thing, they put us for a recreation, too, they kept on.</span> <span id="s436">They kept us in two weeks what is -- you know, I don’t want go into details, because y -- it -- I will never be able to even finish, even if you stay a whole week.</span> <span id="s437">It was -- I did survive the dead march.</span> <span id="s438">They kept us on trains, we used to go in the woods for a day.</span> <span id="s439">I just found out later that they used to, every day, from one place to the other place was maybe 10 - 15 kilometers, th-the -- they have been -- our train was on a one track line.</span> <span id="s440">We didn’t go nowhere, we just went from one place, and the next day we went back to the other place.</span> <span id="s441">And we thought -- we didn’t realize that this is the same place, we didn’t go nowhere.</span> <span id="s442">And I have been, for two weeks -- not me only, but all of us who survive what actually -- in a few thousand they started off when they evacuate us, until to the end, maybe was 50 - 60 left.</span> <span id="s443">In thousands, the all other been on the -- on the roads and the ditches, their bodies was laying because they have been shot, they have been exhausted from walking, whatever, and automatically, if you couldn’t walk, automatically the guard shot you.</span> <span id="s444">Doesn’t make any difference.</span> <span id="s445">But I survived over there.</span> <span id="s446">So the last thing, I arrived in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s447">And this was -- the same way, you know, I -- I -- must be early of April.</span> <span id="s448">And at this time, when I arrived in Theresienstadt actually, I was probably 99 percent point nine dead, actually.</span> <span id="s449">I have very little signs that I’m alive, actually.</span> <span id="s450">And in fact, it was in -- a coincidence that -- even that I reached Theresienstadt, because in Litenritz, one night, when they -- those all who -- who still have been alive, they brought us first the night before -- we have been in I think the camp called Litenritz, and this was terrible condi -- conditions.</span> <span id="s451">And being two weeks without food, without water, even the little food what we used to get, but without this [indecipherable] it didn’t -- we have not been far away in 100 percent to be dead.</span> <span id="s452">And what had happened in this Litenritz actually, that they said in the morning they going to serve us coffee, a hot, liquid something, whatever.</span> <span id="s453">And over there the barracks didn’t had even floors, and laying in mud, you didn’t had no bunkbeds, nothing.</span> <span id="s454">If you laid down for the night to rest, or to sleep, how you call it, you laid in the mud.</span> <span id="s455">But nothing to -- less, and nothing more but in the mud.</span> <span id="s456">And this was a terrible things, without everything, but a human, if you have anything, any instinct being a human, you know that this doesn’t go farther.</span> <span id="s457">I didn’t slept even the whole night, but probably I would have been fall asleep, and waited actually that I’m going to get -- I know it would be a little bit dark, mud, whatever they called it, they called it coffee, but we get it.</span> <span id="s458">And we used to carry always a can, a rusted can if they found it, if somebody going to give us something, that we have a can to take the food.</span> <span id="s459">And early in the morning, they called you, coffee.</span> <span id="s460">And I was trying to be from the first, because I know it if I don’t go to the first, I will never reach any more what they gave you.</span> <span id="s461">I was among the first, and they gave me the amount what -- in my rusted coffee, and I just pour it in -- in my body, whatever they gave it to me.</span> <span id="s462">I -- I don’t know til today what it was.</span> <span id="s463">I just poured it in.</span> <span id="s464">And took a few hours, and they told us that the guards will come, they will take us to the next camp.</span> <span id="s465">We heard about Theresienstadt, we know that Theresienstadt is not actually a concentration camp, it’s a model camp.</span> <span id="s466">We -- we had not been afraid, we cannot go -- we cannot lose now, see, it cannot be worse than it is.</span> <span id="s467">And we have been happy that finally -- that we will -- we will reach Theresienstadt, but not always what you think is happening.</span> <span id="s468">For some reason, after this, I got diarrhea, and this was outside, actually, I didn’t -- I don’t think they even had toilets in this camp, wherever.</span> <span id="s469">And I -- I was dehydrated, I could tell, I mean, I didn’t had it before because I was two weeks without food, without water.</span> <span id="s470">I was fairly dehydrated and I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s471">My friends, what we -- I know them from Auschwitz still, they came by and they said good news, [indecipherable] you know, we going to come to Theresienstadt in the next hour or two.</span> <span id="s472">And I told the one that I know them very well, w-was intimate friendship in Auschwitz, in Yaveeshavitz.</span> <span id="s473">His name was Yankey.</span> <span id="s474">And I told him, “Yankila, it’s too late for me.”</span> <span id="s475">And he said, “In the all suffering what you know what you had in Auschwitz, in the coal mine, and everything,” he said -- he said, “don’t make me leave you here.”</span> <span id="s476">And they actually risked their lives, two of them, and they practically carried me in to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s477">But still I never had any hope that I will be able to walk, or for freedom.</span> <span id="s478">I realized it’s too late even to have any hope.</span> <span id="s479">[indecipherable] show it, actually, when we came to Theresienstadt we look like animals, we act like animals.</span> <span id="s480">Those who still could walk were -- whatever they start to give us some rations, some of them who have been stronger, they used to see that -- used to pass by wagons that went to the kitchen for the supplies, and they used to highjack those wagons and steal everything out, bread, or potatoes, or whatever they have over there.</span> <span id="s481">And those people from Theresienstadt, those inmates, they have been scared of us like wild animals, and it’s not just [indecipherable], we have been.</span> <span id="s482">We look like animals [indecipherable] but after they too start to get help more or less, that some ladies, nurses came in, and they start to clean us up, because I still had the same clothing, the same shirt, or whatever, when I left Auschwitz, this was the end of -- of December.</span> <span id="s483">And I never had another -- never changed nothing, and this was already practically the end of April, where they took everything what we took off they burned it on the spot, and they gave us some clothing, more or less.</span> <span id="s484">And they bathed us, and shaved us.</span> <span id="s485">I mean, they cleaned us up, they disinfect us, more or less.</span> <span id="s486">And then we heard it already, that bring in in Switzerland, in Schwietz, they used to send food o-over to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s487">Not only food, [indecipherable] the best food, you know, white bread, and cheeses, and -- and ham, sausage, oh, the best from the best practically.</span> <span id="s488">But people -- people kept on dying like flies, actually.</span> <span id="s489">When they start to eat, this was the end of it.</span> <span id="s490">I actually, the beginning, I -- I felt that I ate, and I could take food, and I got -- felt that every day I’d get stronger and feel better.</span> <span id="s491">And for some reason too, I don’t know why, they picked me over there in Theresienstadt to be in charge of the food supply.</span> <span id="s492">To give out, to see how many rations to prepare were there -- for the people who have been over there.</span> <span id="s493">There a certain amount of barracks, you know.</span> <span id="s494">One barrack was also -- they called it a hospital, but the truth is it was like a dump.</span> <span id="s495">It was a matter, you know, they put you in, you couldn’t walk any more, they put you in in the bed.</span> <span id="s496">They know it, not in a matter of a day, but in an hour, you will be dead, so they throw you out, and they put in another body in the bed.</span> <span id="s497">And so went on -- actually 99 percent all died, actually.</span> <span id="s498">Was no doctors, no nurses, and -- and I could feel that I get better and everything, but suddenly, I don’t know what went bad, or what went wrong, or maybe because I was in close contact, I used -- I had to go in in this barrack every day and count people who have been still alive.</span> <span id="s499">And the -- to know, you know, we need for this hospi -- the hospital, they called it a hospital.</span> <span id="s500">We need 50 rations, 60 rations.</span> <span id="s501">I used to, you know, the dead have been on the g -- floor already, on the ground, I don’t know even if it was a floor over there.</span> <span id="s502">On the ground, and the living -- so I count the living so there’s how many rations to prepare.</span> <span id="s503">And I don’t know, in a matter of in a week or two, I just caught something like a th -- a disease, but I -- I cannot explain it, I don’t know, and I will not know even, what had happened.</span> <span id="s504">For some reason, if it’s good food, whatever it was over there, and I could have as much as I desire and everything.</span> <span id="s505">It was in a certain day, was like my mole was sealed off everything.</span> <span id="s506">I couldn’t take it, I couldn’t look it.</span> <span id="s507">I used to go ahead, and take a nice roll, white roll, and put down all kind cheeses and sausage, whatever.</span> <span id="s508">And I told them -- this was -- not far away was a park over there, I says I going to sit on the bench in the park, and I will get an appetite, eventually, I believe.</span> <span id="s509">Nothing helped.</span> <span id="s510">So I start to go right away, backwards, and it doesn’t take long.</span> <span id="s511">Whatever I gained, I lost much, much quicker than it took me to gain.</span> <span id="s512">And I couldn’t walk any more either.</span> <span id="s513">And [indecipherable] say well, you have -- said you -- you go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s514">I know it, what it is, but it was not -- it didn’t matter to me, it was no difference.</span> <span id="s515">I realized whatever it is, it’s too late for me.</span> <span id="s516">I went to the hospital, as I mentioned.</span> <span id="s517">It was no nurse, it was no doctor, I mean nothing.</span> <span id="s518">I just laid, the same way, waiting, until they dump me out right there on the floor with the dead.</span> <span id="s519">Why and what [indecipherable] behind my understanding, and how to tell, how to explain, I did got over it.</span> <span id="s520">I did survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: When you were close to death before, and your two friends saved you --</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: -- your friends from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s524">Was there anybody who could assist you at this time in the hospital, and keep you going [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No, I never saw them any more.</span> <span id="s526">I mean, they came.</span> <span id="s527">I -- later I heard about it, that they -- they lived in Munich, around, they -- they did a lot of business like -- like now, whatever, they’ve been fairly wealthy.</span> <span id="s528">They made money already, but I never did.</span> <span id="s529">I -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s530">To be honest, I was too naïve, or too spoiled.</span> <span id="s531">I didn’t -- if you have been from a family, a needy family, and been poor, actually, you had ambitious to go try to make some money, to have a nicer life.</span> <span id="s532">But us, I know it, it went from generation to generation, the kids get older, the parents are tired, and you know, you take over.</span> <span id="s533">And I didn’t realize, you know, that you have to work, even, for a living.</span> <span id="s534">I -- I thought it -- it comes automatically, like this -- and special when I saw what had happened to our family, and to our wealth, and to our money, I practically hated money, and I didn’t want to have no part of it.</span> <span id="s535">I was not smart enough.</span> <span id="s536">And later, when I came to the United States, I regretted it, I saw it, I made a mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: We’ll get to that, but when you -- when you were close to death in Theresienstadt, there were -- really, you just recovered on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You became able to eat.</span> <span id="s540">There was no friend to help you, or to keep you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: There’s nothing what you could help it.</span> <span id="s542">Over there was like I mentioned it, it was strictly a matter of waiting until actually you disappeared, you know, you -- you died.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Or, as in your case, you slowly gain strength.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: In my case, I don’t know how you -- I don’t know why, I just didn’t drop dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: What kept you going, do you think?</span> <span id="s546">You must have thought a lot about this during all --</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: To be honest -- to be honest, and I ha -- I was asked qu-questions, the same questions which you ask me right now.</span> <span id="s548">As far as I can recall, I try a lot of the time to recall things from home, the normal things, until I was arrested, until I -- I came to Auschwitz, and I could never figure out, and I don’t think I did ever actually fight for my life.</span> <span id="s549">And actually what I had experienced, after I was liberated, I suffered more when I was liberated, and -- and I -- I am alive, than being actually in Auschwitz, and working in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s550">Because over there you didn’t -- you didn’t think about nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What did that feel like?</span> <span id="s552">You’ve mentioned that before, that feeling, the realization that you’d survived, and that you’d lost everyone else.</span> <span id="s553">I don’t know whether it’s guilt, or coming to terms with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Very, very bad.</span> <span id="s555">Very bad.</span> <span id="s556">I have always questioned why me.</span> <span id="s557">I have brothers, an other one have been much nicer in anything, you know, with feelings, or poor people, whatever, and I, to be honest with you, I was not as smart as my brothers, you know, with feelings.</span> <span id="s558">And this bothered me, questioned me, why did I survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Did you come to terms with that in any way, sort of feeling, well it -- I’m -- I’m here, and can tell the story, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s561">No, in fact, when I worked, I worked here in the same company since I came here to the States, and I worked 38 years, and -- and -- in the office is management, was a lot of Jews, but in the factory where I worked actually, was very few Jews, and later when I -- in the beginning I couldn’t speak English, but actually it was maybe a favor for me.</span> <span id="s562">But later used to come people who know it a little bit about the Holocaust, and the concentration camps, they used to ask me if I was mistreated, or if I didn’t had enough food.</span> <span id="s563">And I always told them no, and the reason was simple.</span> <span id="s564">It’s in mine character, this actually how I was raised.</span> <span id="s565">I hate to see that somebody has sympathy for me.</span> <span id="s566">I rather see somebody will help me, and have physical feelings, than somebody will tell me he has sympathy for me because I suffered.</span> <span id="s567">This I cannot take.</span> <span id="s568">Pains I can take it, but not this sympathy, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Now, you spoke of Mr. Wolfe, who was the -- the boss, I think, of the company.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yeah, he was the boss, yeah, mist --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Is he still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: He is alive.</span> <span id="s573">I know, more or less like friends.</span> <span id="s574">He treat me like in the family.</span> <span id="s575">On all occasions, Jewish holidays, if he makes anything for his family, we always on the list.</span> <span id="s576">In his home, or in a hotel, or whatever.</span> <span id="s577">In fact, when I got sick, he didn’t hear it from me -- I used to come visit the factory every few weeks.</span> <span id="s578">He didn’t heard from me, he called home, he mentioned it right away, I know it’s not right.</span> <span id="s579">And finally I told him the story.</span> <span id="s580">But i -- it cannot be a nicer person than Mr. Wolfe is.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: We -- we should perhaps move forward to that -- to that time when --</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: -- would be 50 years ago, almost -- almost to the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah, it -- that’s right, in October, I think the 26th of October, 1949, I arrived in Germany, on a military boat.</span> <span id="s585">The boat’s name was SS General Howe.</span> <span id="s586">It took us 16 days from Bremen to touch the soil of the United States.</span> <span id="s587">And I remember when I was in Germany, I -- I worked -- I always -- I did -- I mentioned it.</span> <span id="s588">When I got in touch that I found my brother, he is in Israel, and he kept on writing me letter, don’t do foolish things, don’t play the black market.</span> <span id="s589">Don’t do nothing, cause it’s not legal, he warned me.</span> <span id="s590">He says, “You come here, you going to have everything.</span> <span id="s591">You don’t have to worry now, think about nothing.</span> <span id="s592">You come here.”</span> <span id="s593">And finally, I was prepared, actually.</span> <span id="s594">I bought things -- necessary things, because in Germany I worked for the ira -- UNRRA.</span> <span id="s595">I always made fairly good money.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: That’s the United Nations relief agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s598">I made money, and I didn’t made money, you know, just to have extra money.</span> <span id="s599">I made real nice, and I bought up -- if I go to Israel, to be established there, have things necessary, electrical things, or whatever.</span> <span id="s600">And I had, I think, three cases, three large cases already nailed up to go along, and I was, the last year actually, in ’48 -- before I was in a sanatorium, in Dagaloff, this is the outskirts of Stuttgart, a very beautiful place, but later they liquidated this camp, and the Stuttgart was a camp in the Reinspookstrasser, which is famous.</span> <span id="s601">I have a book they actually gave it to me, you know, the whole thing, the activities, what it was, in sh -- Reinspookstrasser.</span> <span id="s602">And there have been respectable people, and because the other [indecipherable] was liquidated, so they called me, and they ask me if I want to take over food supply, and to be in charge like a chef, they call it a boss, over there on the Reinspookstrasser.</span> <span id="s603">I -- I didn’t know, you know, to deal in black market, but I know it that I have to ha -- get a job.</span> <span id="s604">So I accepted it, and I was very respected by them, and they tried to do anything, whatever possible, to satisfy me.</span> <span id="s605">I was [indecipherable] alone.</span> <span id="s606">Finally it happened one Sunday.</span> <span id="s607">I was not working, but I came -- I used to live -- I lived still in Dagaloff, and I came down to the Reinspookstrasser, but this was the DP camp in Stuttgart, and I notice what I didn’t like.</span> <span id="s608">I noticed that they -- they have over there, in every DP camp, they have their own police.</span> <span id="s609">It was Jewish policemen, what been -- like you had a job, whatever it was necessary to keep everything in order.</span> <span id="s610">And they -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s612">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: They used to take boys from 18 years, even mine age.</span> <span id="s614">I was at this time 26 year, 25 -- 26 years old, and they used to l-like round them up, get them, they put them in a room like a -- in a jail more or less, took them away, and the next day trucks from the Jewish brigade come, and they took you to Bremen, whatever, to send them to Israel.</span> <span id="s615">And this I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Oh, they were involuntary?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Involuntary, exactly.</span> <span id="s618">Involuntarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And I -- didn’t know this went on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: And when I saw this, it reminded me too much of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: They were in fact giving them a good life, and these were displaced persons, but why --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: But why did they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: -- they have been told.</span> <span id="s625">From the -- you know, from the Israeli government, whoever was, you know, that this is the only way to get the young people away from the black market, you know, just to bring them to Israel, they needed soldiers, I -- I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s626">But when this -- I saw it then on the spot, I said, “Force, that’s -- it’s out of the question.”</span> <span id="s627">And then I tried to think -- I almost was ready to leave to go to Israel, and then I came -- you know, when you think about this, come to you other things.</span> <span id="s628">And I know it that my brother is not a ha -- a wealthy person, he worked for the government, he had a good job, a high position, everything, but far from saying, you know, he’s able, yes, like he wrote in the letters, you don’t worry, you’ll be taken care of, everything.</span> <span id="s629">And in -- they had already at this time, they had a boy maybe four or five years old.</span> <span id="s630">He was born in ’40, actually he was six year -- no, older than this, seven, eight years, right?</span> <span id="s631">Yeah, he was born in ’40.</span> <span id="s632">And -- and they keep on th -- my thinking -- yeah, I said, “If I will come over there, you hadn’t bought even a bed already, where I gonna sleep?”</span> <span id="s633">He said he gonna take away from his wife, and his kid, you know, and try to give it to me.</span> <span id="s634">And I said no, this will not work.</span> <span id="s635">I’m not the type.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Did you at the same time long to be with him, since you’d lost all your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: In one way, yes, in the other way I was afraid he gonna think that he owns his life for me.</span> <span id="s638">I got scared, I said there’s no way in the world, it will not work.</span> <span id="s639">And then I figured another thing.</span> <span id="s640">If I come to Israel, and Israel was a lot like my brother from my home town, what that lived over there, so they knowed me, and they knowed the family.</span> <span id="s641">And I figured, you know, I was not -- I didn’t had no trades.</span> <span id="s642">I was not educated practically, nothing.</span> <span id="s643">And I said whatever I going to do, you know, you should be -- and especially you come from a small town like me, that this job is suitable for you, this is your -- if in a too good home, to take a job, you know, like cleaning, I don’t know streets, or other thing.</span> <span id="s644">I said, the best thing is maybe to go to the United States, nobody knows me, I don’t have no relatives, and I don’t [indecipherable] this to be over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: But that was scary, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: And how.</span> <span id="s647">This was more scary, and what more was thinking -- I thought to myself, what will I do over there?</span> <span id="s648">I cannot speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s649">I don’t have no trade.</span> <span id="s650">Yeah, what?</span> <span id="s651">Again go for charities -- you know, Jewish organizations to support?</span> <span id="s652">I said, I’m not the type for it.</span> <span id="s653">I -- how can I do it?</span> <span id="s654">But I had a friend, he left in ’46 already.</span> <span id="s655">He wa -- I was with him in Buchenwald down in Traylitz, actually, and he survived.</span> <span id="s656">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Bernard Fedderman.</span> <span id="s659">I was with him in Traylitz all the time.</span> <span id="s660">In fact, later even in Theresienstadt, when survived, and then he came to Stuttgart also, and Dagaloff, and then we used to live together.</span> <span id="s661">He -- he wrote me -- he was constantly in contact with me.</span> <span id="s662">We w -- we have been actually -- we had a room, both of us together.</span> <span id="s663">So he already had a kid, a first kid was born.</span> <span id="s664">You -- he -- he left, she was pregnant.</span> <span id="s665">He had had already a kid.</span> <span id="s666">And he was a bookbinder here, because his parents had a bookbinder shop in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: He -- when di -- when did he marry in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Oh, he married in Stuttgart, actually, I was his witness, actually.</span> <span id="s669">His best -- we have been the closest friend, actually.</span> <span id="s670">You know, we both survived the impossible.</span> <span id="s671">He married in ’45.</span> <span id="s672">I remember a chaplain in the army and everything.</span> <span id="s673">And just [indecipherable] called the name [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Did he -- did he marry a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s676">Yeah, he married a survivor.</span> <span id="s677">In fact, he ask me -- he is a very naïve person, honest, naïve -- I -- to compare, was a crook.</span> <span id="s678">Things that he did a little bit here and there, I was -- he send me, you know, he wouldn’t do it, the things.</span> <span id="s679">He was something [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s680">And so he -- he ask me what I think, if he should marry her.</span> <span id="s681">When I okayed, this when he married her.</span> <span id="s682">He had a ver -- very naïve person.</span> <span id="s683">Very nice, decent, person.</span> <span id="s684">Really, it’s hard to find a person like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Now, in that time, immediately after liberation, and during the time people spent in displaced person’s ca-camps, many marriages took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: It was very natural.</span> <span id="s688">But you were unusual in -- perhaps because you were shy, in waiting a while?</span> <span id="s689">Or you just had not met the right person?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: It’s a -- okay, I had -- this I answer for you -- can answer in -- really nice, and I answer for you with honesty what it was.</span> <span id="s691">I come from a good home, and to be honest, a lot of maybe special survivors who survived will not like it.</span> <span id="s692">But I didn’t do nothing, I didn’t made money in Germany, and if any girl from a better home, you know, was plenty boys who had a lot of money and everything.</span> <span id="s693">They bought them clothing, jewelry.</span> <span id="s694">They took practically the -- the best of the crop, you know?</span> <span id="s695">Just to tell you in plain words.</span> <span id="s696">I was falling behind, and because I was raised, and how it was, and I didn’t want the -- to go a little bit too deep in, you know, where -- where normally -- in normal circumstances, I would never be associate, so I hold myself back.</span> <span id="s697">This is the reason, you know, I was not married, actually.</span> <span id="s698">I didn’t look.</span> <span id="s699">If a Jewish girl what I actually -- she came from a better home a little bit, you know, like me, I didn’t look for nothing more.</span> <span id="s700">She had the better offers than me, you know, financially speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Do you think, too, that you wanted to begin to rebuild your life before you settled down, was that part of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: I -- to be honest, I didn’t know it, what to do, what not to do, where to go, where I will not go.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: It was just what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s705">One thing, actually, I was scared about America, wh-what will I do.</span> <span id="s706">But my friend Bernard Fedderman, he kept -- I mean we -- we lived together for over a -- he left in ’46, in beginning.</span> <span id="s707">We lived together, actually, for a whole year, so we know each other very well, and he know that I’m not a lazy type, you know, I’m willing to do anything.</span> <span id="s708">And I will learn anything, although he kept on writing me, you don’t have to be afraid for the United States.</span> <span id="s709">If you have [indecipherable], if you come here, if you want to work, you can always find work.</span> <span id="s710">So he in -- is the one who encouraged me to come, and I think this actually why I did come, actually, his [indecipherable] encouragement, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And did he help you when you were here?</span> <span id="s712">Was he in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I came -- I was sponsper -- sponsored from the HIAS in Baltimore, and actually when I came to the States, right away somebody, you know, from the HIAS, they waited for us with the boat when we landed, then they took us on trains, and they shipped us -- and the train embarked us in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s714">I had been in Baltimore, and it was, for me, you know, special where I was -- I was living in Dagaloff, the outskirts of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s715">And, you know, I was used to nice, clean, life.</span> <span id="s716">And to me it felt -- Baltimore -- filthy, very bad.</span> <span id="s717">And I -- come to my mind I did make the biggest mistake.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: And this -- in Baltimore you were in the care of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: -- immigration and naturalization service.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Right -- I mean -- no, the HIAS, actually [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s723">Explain what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: The HIAS is a Jewish relief organization.</span> <span id="s725">They took care of Jewish immigrants, no, and this had nothing to do with naturalization, only Jewish immigrant, if you didn’t had nobody to sponsor you, and so they sponsored, and they took the responsibility.</span> <span id="s726">And they have been real, unusually nice, you know, when we got off in the trains, they waited for us, and right away they took us to hotel, you know.</span> <span id="s727">Not the best, hi -- but still a hotel, and -- and they came every day, they ask you what you need, what you don’t need.</span> <span id="s728">And they offered me, you know, you need clothing?</span> <span id="s729">And I told them no, I don’t need clothing, I have two suitcases, big suitcases.</span> <span id="s730">I have clothing, I had tailor made suits in Germany, over there.</span> <span id="s731">He said, “Shoes?”</span> <span id="s732">And then he told me, “Over here, you know, there’s a li -- clothing is a little bit different.</span> <span id="s733">Why don’t you -- you know, we give you money, go buy yourself.”</span> <span id="s734">I says, “No, I don’t need to buy, and I don’t take.”</span> <span id="s735">They offered me s-schooling, I can go -- they know that I don’t speak English, and so they said, “How about we gonna give you -- not in the hotel, we gonna rent you a room in a house, you live over there in the house.</span> <span id="s736">We will pay all expensive -- all what you need, food and everything, we will pay.</span> <span id="s737">You go to school and learn English.”</span> <span id="s738">I said, “No, I don’t want to go to school.</span> <span id="s739">I -- I’m not educated, and I will not -- I will not -- not looking to get educated in the United States.”</span> <span id="s740">[indecipherable] what you wanted.</span> <span id="s741">I says, “I want a job.”</span> <span id="s742">Well, they took me to several places here and there, and it didn’t worked out.</span> <span id="s743">And a lot of places even the owner was Jewish, he said all his employees are non-Jews, and they don’t think it will work out.</span> <span id="s744">And so di-didn’t get.</span> <span id="s745">They kept on -- said oh you be pensh -- patient, we take care of everything, you just stay over there.</span> <span id="s746">And I disliked everything.</span> <span id="s747">Baltimore, and the du -- whatever they asked me, I refused to take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: How long did --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: I never took it, and I’m proud of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: And how long did this period go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: This went on actually, like for two weeks.</span> <span id="s752">And then my friend, Fedderman, he was already established, they had one kid, a boy, and all this.</span> <span id="s753">And he lived already in a house.</span> <span id="s754">He made fairly good money already, you know, for me, I thought, you know, I-I’d be a king if the -- if I be able to make as money -- much money as him.</span> <span id="s755">And no -- he came over to Baltimore, and he realized that I am miserable, and he said, “Why don’t you come with me to Washington?”</span> <span id="s756">And he says, “We have a extra room.”</span> <span id="s757">They had a three bedroom house.</span> <span id="s758">He says, “You can live over there in the house with us, you eat with us, and every,” -- he say, “until you get a job, and you have some money.”</span> <span id="s759">He say, “You can pay me later, whatever you feel to pay me for -- for this,” to live over there.</span> <span id="s760">So actually, I lived over there with them for more than a year, actually over a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: And where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: In Washington.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: I was just wondering what part of the city, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Oh, he used to live -- the first house where he had, that he lived was on Shepherd Street, northwest.</span> <span id="s765">Was not far from Georgia Avenue, Shepherd.</span> <span id="s766">Sh -- I think Shepherd, and let’s see, 12 - 13, maybe Seventh Street was Georgia Avenue.</span> <span id="s767">Around nine -- ninth s -- Ninth Street, north Shepherd, nine northwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: A sort of tree lined streets, Washington neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yeah, yeah, and I thought he’s a king, you know.</span> <span id="s770">I would never expect, you know, that he has such nice life, you know, he married, and he has a kid, and he has a house, and he has a job.</span> <span id="s771">In the beginning, actually, he told me if I wanted, he said, “You don’t have to do nothing cause I tell you.”</span> <span id="s772">But if I wanted, he can tell -- take me where he was by this bookbinder.</span> <span id="s773">And he will ask him ahead of time if he can bring in, you know, somebody, a helper, or -- I didn’t know nothing about bo-bookbinding.</span> <span id="s774">And so he took me along where he worked, and the owner was Gentile.</span> <span id="s775">And he was a elderly person, probably in the upper 70’s.</span> <span id="s776">But he was very, unusually nice, and friendly, and he showed me things to help around over there, all kind jobs, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: You were a nice looking young man in a very good suit.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: This -- this I don’t know.</span> <span id="s779">This I couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s780">But he was very, very pleased.</span> <span id="s781">Whatever he told me, I -- I tried to do it the best what a human can do, tried to please him.</span> <span id="s782">And he recognized this, and so he right away, he had the respect, you know, that I’m not just coming in.</span> <span id="s783">What had happened was over there a big [indecipherable] actually he paid me well, like paid me actually in 1949, about a dollar an hour, what this was a -- a lot, actually, it was good money.</span> <span id="s784">But it got slow.</span> <span id="s785">I couldn’t speak English, and I was over there a day, and so he told me to clean up the supply where they kept, and this probably was never cleaned.</span> <span id="s786">So I really did a job what nobody would do, you know.</span> <span id="s787">[indecipherable] or not, I don’t know, it doesn’t make any difference, but nobody would do it, something like this.</span> <span id="s788">I took everything out, and dusted, and I ate -- my dust choked me, but I did it.</span> <span id="s789">And when he came, it was clean.</span> <span id="s790">His face was smiling, he looked at me.</span> <span id="s791">Tha -- si -- comple -- he didn’t recognize even, but it was, I cleaned it out so.</span> <span id="s792">And it was on -- very slow other days.</span> <span id="s793">I told my friend, I said, “Bernard, tell Mr. Gruver that I don’t want that he pays me if I don’t do no work.”</span> <span id="s794">If I don’t work, I don’t want it that he pays me money I didn’t deserve.</span> <span id="s795">Well, he went over, and told him, and he came back, and he laughed and -- and he said, “Oh, don’t worry,” you know, “you’ll be slow another day, it will be here plenty work for you, come and work.”</span> <span id="s796">I was over there maybe a whole week longer, and it didn’t come in too much work, and I was still doing nothing practically, here and there something.</span> <span id="s797">So I told him I don’t want him that he pays me if I didn’t work for it.</span> <span id="s798">And I left.</span> <span id="s799">And then I went to the Jewish social organization, actually they used to be not far away from Shepherd Street, even over there.</span> <span id="s800">I forgot the street, but it was pretty close.</span> <span id="s801">And I told them I want a -- a job.</span> <span id="s802">So they called up the American Wholesale where Mr. Wolfe is.</span> <span id="s803">He was -- at this time, his brother-in-law -- he married to the family from the owners.</span> <span id="s804">His name was Krepshaw, David Krepshaw.</span> <span id="s805">And he called up them if they have an opening, and they told him yes.</span> <span id="s806">They told me how to get there, and whatever.</span> <span id="s807">So I went over there, they used to be located on Rhode Island Avenue, Fourth Street.</span> <span id="s808">And I went over there, and they had somebody, an American who is Polish descent, so he -- he translated here, because I didn’t -- couldn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s809">So right away, the -- the same way, whatever I did, I tried to do my best because somebody would tell me to move a house, and it wouldn’t be hard for me, I would probably move it.</span> <span id="s810">I did my best, and they had recognition.</span> <span id="s811">They saw it was right.</span> <span id="s812">They start right away to advance me.</span> <span id="s813">They told me that I will be a foreman, a working foreman, and they will learn me cutting.</span> <span id="s814">Course, it’s a mattress company, you know, Serta, and they will learn me to be a cutter.</span> <span id="s815">It sound to me all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Cutting metal?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: No, mattress fabrics.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: For mattresses, covers.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: I was, and they assigned me the sewing room, what most of them have been women actually, worked over there.</span> <span id="s822">Well, they learned me do the cutting, and they told me all the -- they start me off with 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s823">You know, he told me that s -- 75 he does only because I’m in a concentration camp, you know, a refugee.</span> <span id="s824">Because he pays -- he start off the people normally, with 50 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s825">So he gave me 75, and -- and from time to time he told me -- he came over there, they liked it, what I did, whatever.</span> <span id="s826">And he gave me like full charge, he says, “You can work overtime in the evening.</span> <span id="s827">You want stay, stay as long as you want.</span> <span id="s828">I’m going to have one and a half, you know.</span> <span id="s829">And if you want come in Saturday to clean up the place, so you come in Saturday, and clean up the place.”</span> <span id="s830">And I really cleaned, really, not like these other people.</span> <span id="s831">And I made myself [indecipherable] even at 75 cents, by p-putting in extra hours.</span> <span id="s832">Every day an hour, and Saturday five, six hours.</span> <span id="s833">It was alright, but I never figured anyway that I will stay in a factory.</span> <span id="s834">It was a little bit out of my line, I would never use, you know, a brain thing, and I have to work for somebody.</span> <span id="s835">But what can you do?</span> <span id="s836">I -- I couldn’t do nothing better, either, so I kept on staying here, but they kept on raising always a little bit here, a little bit there, this holiday.</span> <span id="s837">And [indecipherable] I figured I start from the beginning, start again from the bottom, I don’t know, so I -- I tried to stay with them.</span> <span id="s838">And I stayed with them until actually -- took a little while, and they made me a supervisor over there, the -- the sewing room was under my charge completely.</span> <span id="s839">And they let me do anything that I wanted to do, you know, and well, this made me feel better, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: So you were in -- supervising a number of other people as time went by?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: Yeah, about 25 people, yeah.</span> <span id="s842">Men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: A fairly responsible job.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: It’s not easy.</span> <span id="s845">But I know it, you know, if you have to do it, it doesn’t make any different.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: And is that where you s -- you spent your w -- your career, with that same company?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Yeah, I retired after 38 years, 38 years I was with the company, never worked for nobody else, except a couple weeks in the bookbinding shop where my friend Fedderman worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: It’s quite a story, really.</span> <span id="s851">They were -- they were lucky to have you, and I’m sure you --</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yeah, they have been very pleased, especially Mr. Wolfe was at this time, like a manager in the division, they had other divisions, too.</span> <span id="s853">They used to have appliances distributors.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And with the group -- the area you were with, that was called American Mattress?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Wholesaler.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Oh, I see, American Wholesale Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yeah, yeah, American Wholesaler, because they have several divisions in -- well, the management was pretty smart, very, very smart, because if one division didn’t do business, then the other division covered.</span> <span id="s858">And this was very well organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: And your -- your comfort in English just developed over time?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I used to go to the Americanization school, nights, over there, and in the beginning I thought I will never learn.</span> <span id="s861">But you know, I always used public transportation, like I used to go with streetcar to work, and back, and always people tried [indecipherable] say it, and I used to tell them I cannot speak much English, what it all, it’s true, oh and they made me compliments, oh you speak so good, so nice.</span> <span id="s862">I -- I know this was a compliment, this was not the truth.</span> <span id="s863">But eventually, it took a few months, then suddenly, you know, what more I tried to talk English, the more I realized I -- it comes.</span> <span id="s864">You have just to be patient.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">Q: And you moved out of your -- your room in Bernard Fedderman’s home in time?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Yeah, they bought another home, and it was a little bit smaller.</span> <span id="s867">So I moved out, I did appreciate, you know, I stayed with him this time, and meanwhile, I got involved, you know, I had my wife, she’s actually from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s868">And she was like a girlfriend, but we always have been in contact with each other, we all glad to see each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: You met at a -- at a -- at a bus stop.</span> <span id="s870">Is that right, in 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: -- w-would that have been in 1940 -- ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: Six, yeah, in 1946 I met her.</span> <span id="s874">You know, I was lonesome.</span> <span id="s875">Nothing even -- you know, I had a job what I was pleased, I was the chef in the supplies, and everything, but I still was alone, you know.</span> <span id="s876">I di -- didn’t had no relatives.</span> <span id="s877">I didn’t have nobody, just some boys, you know from the concentration camp, we used to be friends, this was all.</span> <span id="s878">And when I met her, actually, she was a -- more than just a g -- really good looking girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Actually, tell me -- tell me that -- your wife’s full name, and more about her family background.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Her full name is Herta, and her birth name is Nagel, N-a-g-e-l.</span> <span id="s881">And -- I mean, I didn’t know it actually, until went a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s882">We had a date here, and there, and then she invited me to her home, and right away her mother was paralyze -- par-paralyzed, she had a stroke.</span> <span id="s883">But, win -- wonderful people, real nice.</span> <span id="s884">Her father was very much involve anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s885">He was picked up, e-even was jailed, he almost went to Dachau, the same way, for talking, you know.</span> <span id="s886">If you talk there too much --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: And were they a -- were they a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s890">I had assumed they were.</span> <span id="s891">So this is interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, no, no, isn’t a Jew, but very decent people.</span> <span id="s893">And I come over there, I felt a little bit, you know, what I was missing.</span> <span id="s894">A home, more or less.</span> <span id="s895">And in fact, she used to take care like even my shirts, underwear, whatever, she took it home, and washed it, and they pressed it, and brought it back.</span> <span id="s896">They got the touch.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Tell me what they felt like, because you would be so desperately alone, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Oh yeah, I was very desperately alone, no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s899">And when I was here, in the beginning I came -- I used to go to the Jewish community center, and I used to meet the Jewish girls, too.</span> <span id="s900">And I went out with them here and there.</span> <span id="s901">Was one time I remember I went out with a Jewish girl -- no -- yeah, it was in the Jewish community center.</span> <span id="s902">And we talked, and talked, and you know, it’s almost was time to leave the center, and she asked -- she ask me, “Where’s you car?”</span> <span id="s903">And this right away gave me a pretty bad feeling, an impression.</span> <span id="s904">I was happy I had to pay a token, not [indecipherable] a car.</span> <span id="s905">And I didn’t felt right, actually.</span> <span id="s906">And li -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s908">This is tape number three, side A. Continue to tell me the story of your meeting your wife, and your marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Oh, well actually, I kept on -- have more feelings from time to time.</span> <span id="s910">When I left Germany, actually, I figured I don’t want to take responsibility to be married over there, bring here somebody, you know, because I didn’t know to -- how -- even being alone, how I will be able to get along.</span> <span id="s911">But later, I felt that I’m missing, actually, I missed her very much, to a great extent.</span> <span id="s912">And the beginning actually, they said in the Americanization school, they used to help me, the principal over there, he ask me, you know it, and I told him I have over there a girlfriend, she’s in Germany.</span> <span id="s913">So he used to write to the consul about it, and especially Cy Wolfe actually, he wrote letters to the consul too.</span> <span id="s914">And she ha -- was registered already, you know, she had a uncle here in Long Island that she wanted to co -- times were bad in -- in Germany, wa -- so she wanted to come here, so finally with the help and Cy Wolfe, well, she had a chance.</span> <span id="s915">She came two years later.</span> <span id="s916">When she came here, she had -- right away she got a job, and she made more mon -- better than me.</span> <span id="s917">She worked in the House office building.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: You -- that was -- she would in fact herself be -- being so brave to make that trip, to start a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s920">You know, she had a -- her father was a older -- I mean, elderly person.</span> <span id="s921">You know [indecipherable] stayed because they have to take care of their parents.</span> <span id="s922">Her mother was paralyzed, and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Did she have brothers or sisters?</span> <span id="s924">Did she have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Yeah, she had one sister, and she was 18 years older than her, you know, she had a -- one sister.</span> <span id="s926">But in the beginning they didn’t like it that she leaves, but eventually -- you know, her mother knowed me, and everything, and she thought with somebody else that she wouldn’t know it, she wouldn’t let her go.</span> <span id="s927">But because she knowed me, so she agreed, you know, that she can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s929">Did either you, or your wife’s family have any reservations because you were -- she was Gentile, and you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: I wrote this to mine brother, and -- about it, and he answered me, he said in -- you know, we are from a strict Orthodox family, he wrote me this letter, as much suffering I had to go through, I can do whatever I feel, he feels, you know, that it will be justified [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s931">And then when she came here, actually, I got in touch -- what do they call them?</span> <span id="s932">The -- the Hebrew congregat -- you know, the Reform synagogue, actually.</span> <span id="s933">And I met over there sh -- he was assistant rabbi, Rabbi Schiff, I don’t know if he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s934">He was teaching in the -- I think Harvard School, too, as a professor, you know, a nice person, he was from Germany.</span> <span id="s935">And I met him, and Rabbi Gerstenfeld too, you know, he was the main rabbi.</span> <span id="s936">And Rabbi Schiff married us, actually, in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: ’52, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Oh, ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yeah, ’52 [inaudible].</span> <span id="s941">She came in ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: And you’d corresponded during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Oh yeah, yeah, constantly, you know.</span> <span id="s944">We write [indecipherable] she right away, second week she came, she went, took a job, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And did she speak any English when she came?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No, but she did all this -- a -- a lot of -- she did typing, and typing actually, this for her -- she was trained in Germany.</span> <span id="s947">In Germany, actually, if you are trained, you know what you are doing, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: They are really good training.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: It’s not here.</span> <span id="s950">And [indecipherable] respected her work, actually, he liked it very much.</span> <span id="s951">And she had a chance, because she typed the whole day, which she learned [indecipherable] coming home, you know, watch TV.</span> <span id="s952">Yeah, she didn’t go to the Amer-Americanization school, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Yeah, and by then, you we -- you were speaking English --</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: -- the language --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s957">I don’t speak good English today, but I still am speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: Tell me more about the things that you and your wife shared in common.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Oh, in the beginning was pretty hard life.</span> <span id="s960">I mean, we didn’t had nothing, but we didn’t felt, you know, that it will not be hard.</span> <span id="s961">We both shared.</span> <span id="s962">She was working, and I was working, and tried to save.</span> <span id="s963">And the reason for saving was not so much that I liked to save to get -- to put a lot of things was I wanted, and fe -- and have feelings that I cannot afford to satisfy this, but I know it can come a time when are -- you are not able any more to do work, whatever it is, and you fall -- want to fall a burden or nothing.</span> <span id="s964">But this was mine strongest point for the -- that it is necessary to save.</span> <span id="s965">When the time comes that I cannot afford, that my health does not allow me, that I still have to look for my savings to support me.</span> <span id="s966">And we actually, this way, thanks God with savings, we got adjusted to a nice life, not to waste, or not what -- what it was necessary.</span> <span id="s967">So we did some saving.</span> <span id="s968">And I’m proud to say, actually, that since I was involved with the Holocaust museum, and I was -- I felt that the museum is a great institution for -- not only for survivors, but for human -- humanity, for everyone.</span> <span id="s969">And I never dreamed that I will -- we will be able to afford to contribute, but thanks God we did contribute hundred thousand dollars to the Holocaust museum.</span> <span id="s970">This, at least, makes me proud of myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: That’s -- I didn’t know that, and that’s really quite wonderful that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: -- that you -- that you could.</span> <span id="s974">Cause I can think of -- [indecipherable] I -- I really think that is -- think the museum performs this wonderful role --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: I think so, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: -- of making sure it won’t happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: I think it’s the best institution, actually.</span> <span id="s978">It’s a safeguard for the next generations.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s980">Now, both you and your wife, although you had different faiths that you’ve grown up in, probably --</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Yes, she has -- she actually accepted the Jewish faith, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Yeah -- no, I meant that your -- your childhood would have been spent in different faiths, but you would -- you would ha -- after your marriage, you’ve shared the same faith, and also a -- probably both of you had known some degree of hardship.</span> <span id="s983">Even your wife had experienced the war.</span> <span id="s984">So probably your values were similar.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: She was very cooperative, actually.</span> <span id="s986">She had feelings, you know, to follow myself, so we never had any complications.</span> <span id="s987">Even we have not been the same faith, in the beginning, but she accepted to follow me.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s989">I’m -- I’m asking these questions, too, knowing that a great many of the survivors with experiences something like yours, perhaps for shorter periods, tended to marry survivors.</span> <span id="s990">And that’s really why I’m probing with these questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Right.</span> <span id="s992">Yeah, this is true, but like I mentioned, actually, I had bad experience when I had a friend to me what -- she was devoted to me, and this -- and I miss her very much, so this makes a strong friendship, and this why actually I was waiting until she had a chance to come over here, and to share a life together, that we do share, because we have been married in ’52.</span> <span id="s993">It’s actually 47 years actually are married.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s995">Now did you -- you don’t have children, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Unfortunately, my wife was one time pregnant, but we didn’t have the experience, you know, how to be careful, whatever, in the pregnancy.</span> <span id="s997">She had a miscarriage, and it upset us both, but in the other hand, it didn’t change our life, either, actually.</span> <span id="s998">I always figured, if something doesn’t go our way, we have to accept it, because we never look -- she was trying to get medical help, and everything, but it didn’t succeed, and so finally we gave it up, to take it as it comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1000">I ask that only because I -- I understand some survivors have, because of their suffering, not wanted to have children, and you don’t seem to be one of those people who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: No, it was not our intention.</span> <span id="s1002">We wanted, actually, very bad.</span> <span id="s1003">In the beginning, the first years, we couldn’t afford to have it.</span> <span id="s1004">We didn’t feel, well if we gonna bring in a life, and we have hardship to survive, but we always figured, when the time get better, we save a little bit more, then we start it.</span> <span id="s1005">And then we started, and it was too late, or whatever it is, it just did not materialize.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1007">Tell me about reli -- what your religion means to you, and do you go to synagogue regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: About religion, as I mentioned before, I was raised Orthodox, and I always felt in my heart that the Jewish religion is the only practically religion, that you can believe in it, it has a ground to -- to believe in it.</span> <span id="s1009">I -- b-but I respect any religion.</span> <span id="s1010">I respect any person who can hold up his custom, his religion, I respect very much.</span> <span id="s1011">I am right -- no I am not a particular -- I wouldn’t call myself I’m a religious person, but I am very traditional.</span> <span id="s1012">In the past I remember the nice holidays, [indecipherable] and other things, in a clean, nice life.</span> <span id="s1013">And I still try, you know, to resume those things.</span> <span id="s1014">And to be honest [indecipherable] I was asked by kids in the school, and I lecture to them about the Holocaust, and they ask me if I believe in God.</span> <span id="s1015">To answer this, it’s very hard.</span> <span id="s1016">In one way, it’s pretty hard to believe, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: I interrupted.</span> <span id="s1018">You were telling me about the children asking do you believe in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1020">To answer you straight, what -- what the Jewish people -- nation, suffered, it’s actually hard to believe in God, but I take mine whole strength in to believe, and I’m not so highly educated to be able to say that -- to believe, or not to believe, though I acc -- I accept that the easiest thing actually to believe, and continue believing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: And you followed all the traditions?</span> <span id="s1022">They’re part of your -- of your marriage and your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: More or less.</span> <span id="s1024">To tell the truth, more or less I follow it, and I enjoy it, but we don’t run constantly to the synagogue, but on the high holidays, we always attend the services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1026">What about friendships in your life?</span> <span id="s1027">You spoke of different ones during the years when you were in camps.</span> <span id="s1028">Have th -- have your friendships been enormously important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Oh sure, it’s important, actually, when -- I cannot lie, because I don’t have nobody left.</span> <span id="s1030">And so friendship is actually the most what we still have left over.</span> <span id="s1031">I continue to be in friendly terms with old friends [indecipherable] around here.</span> <span id="s1032">I feel I’m blessed that we have friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: In the early years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Yeah, in -- in the -- in your first years in this country, were you -- was your social group very much a group of survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: More or less, yes, but we have a -- a lot of friends, you know, they’re not been survivors, and a lot of Gentile families, what are very nice people, and decent people, and we enjoy very much to spend time with them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: I was -- in -- in thinking about how you, I think, managed to -- to endure those years of suffering, of extreme brutality and so on, and yet to come out of it and be able to be a sort of loving, warm person, I’m guessing -- I -- I’d like you to -- to tell me whether you’ve thought about how you were able to do that?</span> <span id="s1038">Was it the -- the upbringing you had?</span> <span id="s1039">The friendships?</span> <span id="s1040">I -- I mean, there must be things that you thought of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: As far as I know -- it’s a very good question, but for me it’s actually easy to answer it.</span> <span id="s1042">They are up there, I think, my whole family, all brothers and sisters, how we have been raised by our parents.</span> <span id="s1043">My parents, especially my father was very strict in behaving, but I’m really thankful for his -- that he raised us in a strict way, that I can have the -- to understand, and to know the difference between good and bad.</span> <span id="s1044">And we have been raised -- and I think all my brothers know in our family, have been more or less actually, raised the right way, and to respect where we supposed to respect.</span> <span id="s1045">And I feel that I was blessed with a family like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: I asked that question, too, knowing that many -- many survivors have found it difficult to adjust to -- to life because of how much they suffered.</span> <span id="s1047">Others too, have had full and rounded s -- remarkably successful lives, but do you think that you often suffer because of your earlier suffering?</span> <span id="s1048">I was thinking about, does it show up in great anxiety, about your wife, for instance?</span> <span id="s1049">If she’s late coming home, do you feel, do you think, more concerned than somebody else might be?</span> <span id="s1050">Are you more anxious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: It’s no doubt any survivor, I don’t care who it is, who had to go through so much humiliation, and suffering, and taking away the dignity from being a human being, if we want it, or we don’t want it, something is missing in us, and -- and I mean not in myself, but in any survivor.</span> <span id="s1052">And this can never be fulfilled, even if you are successful in business, and family life, and everything, always will come to haunt you about your past, about your suffering.</span> <span id="s1053">But in other hand, I accept it, the philosophy, if I want it, I don’t want it, I have to go on with my life, either way.</span> <span id="s1054">If I think too much about my past, and those all good things what I lost, is the only way to bury myself alive, not to know.</span> <span id="s1055">But the -- so long I keep on continuing with my life, I have to be strong enough to take life and accept life as it comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Do you find that in the -- decades ago, in the early years, that you had to deliberately block out those thoughts, and -- and look to your future in order to cope?</span> <span id="s1057">I ask that question because I know that you’ve given interviews like this in latter years, but not -- not earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: The same thing, actually.</span> <span id="s1059">As much that I remember those old horror stories, and they can never be told, but not a human being, I -- but my past from the suffering, but I have always thinking, not of a great deal about future success, but accept life how it comes.</span> <span id="s1060">And I think this holds me going the way how I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: I wonder if when you and your wife were first together, would you tell her at great length of -- of what had happened during those earlier years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yeah, with my wife, I always discussed, and I always used to tell her.</span> <span id="s1063">And she was trying to protect me, like for example when it used to come the worst horror stories, and documentary on TV, she was trying, and not succeeded that I shouldn’t watch it.</span> <span id="s1064">But for some reason, I tried never to miss nothing.</span> <span id="s1065">And to be honest, when people -- strange people, or friends even, who were not -- had those horrible experience from being in a concentration camp, I watched them constantly, and -- and most of the time, I don’t know why, this is actually, it’s a sickness, I hardly was moved by it.</span> <span id="s1066">I felt I’m more like a piece metal, a stone.</span> <span id="s1067">But now in -- nothing ca -- can move me, actually to those old, horrible memories from the past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Do you think that’s because that’s how you coped then, by -- by -- by becoming numb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: I accepted that I cannot choose my life -- things what is coming to what is not coming.</span> <span id="s1070">I lost everything, the best and the dearest.</span> <span id="s1071">I lost everything.</span> <span id="s1072">And then I actually made up my mind, and realized that this is only a way not to complain, and not to think too much about it, but you cannot forget, but to keep on going, as long as possible with my life I had, and take it as it comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Have you, in your -- your 50 years now in America, are there been -- are there particular causes, and interests that you’ve had?</span> <span id="s1074">You’ve told me how you supported the Holocaust museum, that would be more recently, but are there other political or social things that are dear to your heart?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: No, I never was a political person, and I realize, you know, even if you want get involved, you cannot change.</span> <span id="s1076">You have to accept how it comes, and I didn’t have no problem, actually, in accepting, and behaving myself, actually, to be a good citizen, and to obey all rules, whatever a citizen should obey.</span> <span id="s1077">I -- I cannot give you much more about this, than those things.</span> <span id="s1078">I try to be the right way.</span> <span id="s1079">See a lot of things -- in every country, and the United States is not an exception, it’s good things, and bad things, but you still have to obey, as a good citizen, the law of in the land.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: When you came here, did you experience any discrimination?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Sure, I felt discrimination.</span> <span id="s1082">I remember in 1953, when we had been married -- or in ’52, and at this time went out to get an apartment.</span> <span id="s1083">We lived in a furnished room, we lived in [indecipherable] an apartment, so finally we decided that we -- we going to get an apartment, buy our own furniture, establish our own.</span> <span id="s1084">And the first experience was we looked at an apartment, and we liked it over there, and when I made an appointment with the lady, the owner, and I came in, and she asked me questions, so she realized that I am Jewish, and I’m not an American, cause I couldn’t speak good English yet, and actually she refused to rent it me.</span> <span id="s1085">But this didn’t discourage me, and I was not mad.</span> <span id="s1086">I felt this is her apartment, she -- and she has hundred percent, full right, to choose to whom she rented, yes or no, I never -- I -- I didn’t feel I was discriminated because she didn’t want to rent me the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">Q: But of course, that’s one thing that would have changed today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: I da -- I don’t think it will change.</span> <span id="s1089">You cannot force nobody to love you, to like you, or to do whatever.</span> <span id="s1090">Some people have their own way, and I feel they have their right to do their own judgment, and even without in-interference from a government or force you to rent to the person even if you don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1091">I feel this what a free country should be.</span> <span id="s1092">If you are the owner of it, you have any right to choose who want to rent your apartment, and not be told by the law -- you know, but the government, he has to -- you have to rent them.</span> <span id="s1093">If he doesn’t want it, there’s plenty other apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Were there a lot of other instances of -- that were of that kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: No more or less -- I never had any.</span> <span id="s1096">In fact, I used to socialize with Gentile people in America, and they didn’t have to go through a Holocaust, and most of the time I behaved with good manners, and this how -- I behaved how I was raised to behave to be among people.</span> <span id="s1097">And I got always the biggest respect.</span> <span id="s1098">The other people who hardly know me, and they always respect me, and they wanted to socialize with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Now, wha -- I wonder if your wife ran into any dis -- problems of discrimination?</span> <span id="s1100">Was there anti German sentiment in those years after the war, or would that have been negligible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yeah, it was anti sentiment, and -- during the war, and you cannot blame them, I think it’s a good things, actually.</span> <span id="s1102">Because whatever the world did anything, had feelings about German brutality, that it was more than justified.</span> <span id="s1103">And I actually couldn’t see that Germany, whatever they did it, I don’t say everybody, but wa -- the majority -- and they didn’t know it, and they claim they didn’t know it, but they did know it and everything, should deserve to have it [indecipherable] the nicest life.</span> <span id="s1104">[indecipherable] Europe actually, was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1105">But normally things like this, it will happen if you want it, or you don’t want it, but if you don’t make an issue of it, it just goes away.</span> <span id="s1106">It comes, and it goes away in no time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Do you think that this society had improved in it’s sort of acceptance of different faiths?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">[Side B blank] Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s1111">This is tape number four, side A. My question was, do you think there is less anti-Semitism in 1999?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: I don’t know exactly, you know, how to answer this question, but my mind is if somebody want to be anti-Semitic, then I don’t -- I don’t think actually, if you have rules, regulations from the government, you -- you -- about discrimination, but if you -- somebody doesn’t want to get friendly with you, it’s no use -- if you try to force it, it just backfires on you.</span> <span id="s1113">And then you really -- you can increase anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1114">I was always in my vi -- my thinking, if somebody doesn’t like me, I going to have nothing against this person, he doesn’t have to like me, and I will find somebody else who will like me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: So it’s not something you can --</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: -- im-im-impose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: No, not -- not -- nothing, I mean, I don’t like to be imposed, or to -- if somebody to you is imposing, you know, to like you, or whatever -- I don’t go for it, no.</span> <span id="s1119">I think if it doesn’t come freely from you inside, it will never get the person the knowledge I -- to -- to change.</span> <span id="s1120">They only change if you show your respect, that somebody doesn’t want you, just leave him go, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1121">Not particular fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Earlier in the interview, when you were talking about those years of the Holocaust, you mentioned getting news through the BBC, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: This was in Poland [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Well, this was still in Poland, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: My question was -- I -- I wanted to ask you more about that.</span> <span id="s1127">Did you continue ever, to get BBC news in those years when you were in the camps?</span> <span id="s1128">I assume there would be no way then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: No, no, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1130">No, this was impossible, and in fact, even I worked in the coal mine, we have been with Poles, Gentiles, together always, but it was not allowed, apparently, and never had a chance even to hear news, or even to look in a piece -- a newspaper piece, or even what it was months or years old.</span> <span id="s1131">No, we never knowed much.</span> <span id="s1132">We know it only -- in the camp we used to have feelings, if they treated us bad, beatings, or really torturing, well, we felt this a good things, that they have losses on the front.</span> <span id="s1133">This -- this was our policy, you know, to know what is going on.</span> <span id="s1134">When they have been nice to us, we felt they have too many successes on the front.</span> <span id="s1135">We like rather to suffer, and to be humiliated by the guards, and beaten by the guards, kicked by the guards; then we had hope that maybe a change can be soon.</span> <span id="s1136">But we never expect to be free people, or be in -- humans any more, anyway, but this gave us some hope that eventually, sometimes, that maybe will be a survivor.</span> <span id="s1137">You never figure that I will be the survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Was there any basis, though, for your accepting that when you were suffering, things must be going badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: Oh yeah, I mean, this was the truth, actually.</span> <span id="s1140">Yeah we -- you -- you get used, and you realize, you know, when they treat you bad, that they have losses on the front.</span> <span id="s1141">The front didn’t go bad, and we never made any mistakes, and this was true.</span> <span id="s1142">Sooner or later some of the conversation with guards, actually, what has not been too nasty, and then we realized they had big losses, and we realized why th-they treated the inmates so bad.</span> <span id="s1143">[indecipherable] discuss the policy, this was the newspaper, how we have been treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1145">Then i-in 1945, would you be getting news then of what was happening, and that liberation may be close?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: In 1945, [indecipherable] liberated, if anybody who could walk, or move around, whatever, the only thing what we as -- as survivors in camps, we only thought about, you know, how to get food.</span> <span id="s1147">And another that you -- you are able, if you feel hungry, that you can slice a slice of bread, and eat as much as you wanted.</span> <span id="s1148">Otherwise the whole world didn’t exist yet, and our -- we still have been numb like you mentioned it, numbness.</span> <span id="s1149">We have been numb, we didn’t come to realization that we survived, and we are humans, and we had to go on as a human being.</span> <span id="s1150">No, we never had anything else to think, only about hunger was about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: And when you had no food, you’d mentioned having fantasies about it, tell me what that was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: It -- it’s not a pleasant things.</span> <span id="s1153">We used to get a ration of bread, where we used to discuss with each other, what -- how is the best thing to digest the ration?</span> <span id="s1154">To eat up, and make you feel that you satisfied your hunger, or take a bite now, and save it, and take a bite later?</span> <span id="s1155">This -- we always have discussion what is the best.</span> <span id="s1156">But a lot of times we realized if you don’t eat it up, you never know somebody will steal from your pocket, or when you go to bed you have been hiding, somebody steal away, so you didn’t -- never satisfied, y -- and you don’t -- cannot expect to get a ra -- other things, actually, wherein normally, 99 percent -- I was among those 99 percent, when we got a ration, we had a chance, we ate what we got, and we didn’t had no worries to save it, to keep it in a safe place, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1158">And you’d -- you’d have fantasies, is that right, about -- you’d be -- sort of dream of wonderful foods when you were close to starvation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Not about fancy food, never had any fantasies, we just had fantasies how to satisfy the hunger.</span> <span id="s1160">Not suffering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1162">Now, I wonder to what extent you’ve been left with a hatred of any waste in food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: Yes, still today.</span> <span id="s1164">I cannot see waste of food whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1165">I myself, where we live we have extra acreage, and I have a -- a large garden, and I have the garden, thanks God, not for income, whatever, I can afford buy seeds, or whatever labor it’s involved.</span> <span id="s1166">It costs me money, and whenever I have to harvest, I just hated to see that anything goes to waste, at home, or in the garden, cause a lot of times, if nobody comes to pick up some vegetables from the garden, I will go out of my way, and even travel hundred miles around trip, to give some friends from the garden.</span> <span id="s1167">This hurt me, to see food go to waste hurt me very, very much, and this will never change.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: And y-your land, perhaps, has that extra meaning for you, as a kind of security?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Not only about security very much, the land means for me actually that since I retired -- I’m already 10 years retired, that I don’t sit on a chair, just keep on resting.</span> <span id="s1170">I always loved to work, and physical work even when it’s hard for me to be more physical, I still love it, and I do it, and I think this keeps me alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: You know, there’s a pattern too, of your surviving in prison, in slave labor camps, in Auschwitz, of you’re always, perhaps being helped to survive by the fact that you could work and work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Actually, some work even in the coal mine, their heaviest work.</span> <span id="s1173">This is like being a human, actually.</span> <span id="s1174">If you see you accomplish, even for your biggest enemy, it give you satisfactory.</span> <span id="s1175">If you could accomplish -- if you have been able to do it, where actually, if you work, the satisfactory is larger than the hard work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: And do you think that -- I wonder if you have health problems today because of the -- all that heavy labor, or has that -- or is that the reason that you’re in such good health?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: This is a very hard to answer, but one thing actually.</span> <span id="s1178">When I was liberated in Theresienstadt, this was probably the end of April, or beginning of May, in ’45, and I was so sick and ill actually, what I never expect to be alive, and I never saw a doctor, whatever, to check me if I’m healthy or I’m sick, until I came to Prague, Czechoslovakia where they accepted me in a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1179">This was the first time a doctor examined me and check whatever they -- the sanitorium over there, the management, they strictly took in only DP’s, Displaced Persons who had been in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1180">And they treated us -- royalty is maybe the proper word to say.</span> <span id="s1181">And the first medical doctor, he examined me, and he examined me, he told me that I have an enlarged heart.</span> <span id="s1182">Even without knowing any medical terms, or whatever, I don’t know, I just happened to be that I asked this doctor, “Will this stay with me forever?”</span> <span id="s1183">And he said in medical terms, it’s hard to tell.</span> <span id="s1184">Sometime, if you live a normal life, it goes back to normality, it will disappear, and a lot of times it’s will stay with you your whole life.</span> <span id="s1185">So far, thanks God, I felt if I worked physical, it helps me to stay alive, more or less.</span> <span id="s1186">So I continually -- my doctor told me that fairly I’m in good shape, and whatever you do, he told me not to change the formula, keep on doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s1187">And well, I’m doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: How would you get news today of world affairs and so on?</span> <span id="s1189">Do you follow particularly carefully, or are you not interested in papers, TV news, radio news?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: I’m interested, and I follow it, but I know not me even, because popular people, what know the politics and everything, it’s politics, to be honest, personally, I think it’s a dirty trade.</span> <span id="s1191">Nobody’s honest.</span> <span id="s1192">Very rarely you can find somebody who tells you the truth, whatever.</span> <span id="s1193">This how I feel.</span> <span id="s1194">And in the other hand, as a little, ordinary person, you cannot change those things, either, so you just let them go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: I -- I wondered, you know, wh-what -- what your attitude was, because you can argue the opposite viewpoint, and say that what happened in the 1930’s was because -- I think you can argue this -- was because the people who should have been involved in politics were standing by and allowing the, you know, things to change, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: We showed you actually, that the -- not people, but countries, and I hate to criticize the United States, United States did a great deal for me, whatever, and -- and I -- I feel that I try my best to be a good citizen, actually, but on the other hand, you read about the past, and you call it a world of civilization.</span> <span id="s1197">In the whole world -- I don’t want to mention name, but this is including the United States, where I’m a citizen, and I try to be a honest, good citizen, that the whole world could stand by and see those horror, brutalities -- I don’t have the proper word to mention about it, and I don’t think the dictionary has even the proper words.</span> <span id="s1198">And I don’t think you can express the proper words to -- to express about those past, and doing nothing, this actually, you lose the belief in any civilization.</span> <span id="s1199">There’s a part of me, it’s hard for me to believe that a civilized world exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Do you find it -- do you find it hard in relationships with people to trust them?</span> <span id="s1201">Do you think you’re -- you’re different?</span> <span id="s1202">I’ve known no suffering, and that trust -- trusting other human beings might be easier for me, or whether, in fact, you’re just the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: To me, actually, you know, trusting or not trusting, it’s har -- very hard to trust people in general, but you feel more trusted when you come along to a Holocaust survivors, what they had the same experience as me, and then I realize they understand.</span> <span id="s1204">But a average person, if you’re Jewish or Gentile, it doesn’t make any different to me.</span> <span id="s1205">But I realize right now, after 50 years, being more or less a normal person, that it’s hard to believe that it was so much suffering for those people who have been in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1206">And -- and even somebody would say, you know, it never existed, it’s just a hoax.</span> <span id="s1207">A lot of times I -- I feel I’m not mad about it, but I feel as a normal person, with normal thinking, you have to believe it’s a hoax, it’s not true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: Because it’s unbelievable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Th -- th -- exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: It’s unbelievable, I mean, this is the proper word.</span> <span id="s1212">A lot of times I will in po -- in ger -- in English, and hard to express me the proper words, but like you said, it’s unbelievable, in the same way, with as much as you talk, or videos you interview, but the true story will never come out.</span> <span id="s1213">And I hope that we never come to a point where the true stories of new sufferings comes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: Because it goes on and on.</span> <span id="s1215">You know, I wonder if you’d talk a little about the length of time that you were imprisoned, or in a camp.</span> <span id="s1216">The term survivors used for people who were briefly in hiding, it’s a term that covers many different cases, and I think you’re unusual in the period of time that you were held, or -- or suffered.</span> <span id="s1217">Would you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: I can talk as much as possible for me.</span> <span id="s1219">I mean, those things you don’t forget actually.</span> <span id="s1220">I was actually, when I came to Auschwitz at this time, being Jewish was 100 percent impossible to s -- to live a day or two.</span> <span id="s1221">Gentiles who come to Auschwitz in ’41, a maximum, I would say, you know, you could live a day or two, and because the horrors were so great, was impossible.</span> <span id="s1222">But in my case, actually, in fact this is actually why I survived; I was in Auschwitz only -- direct in Auschwitz, I was only one day.</span> <span id="s1223">The second day the Germans needed real bad -- around Auschwitz is a lot of coal mines, and they needed real bad people to go to the mines, but they didn’t trust Poles, who came to -- to Auschwitz actually, because you have to work with Poles, civilian Poles in the mine, they smuggle you out, or whatever, so they never took Poles to the mine.</span> <span id="s1224">The only who they took to the mines was Jewish, or Germans -- not Jew -- Germans we -- we were -- who have been the same way, have been prisoners in the camps.</span> <span id="s1225">And the second day, actually, the same eight people who wa -- we have been stepped out being Jewish, we have been called again to be on the appelleplatz.</span> <span id="s1226">And we came back, and a doctor came in Auschwitz, and we have been in Auschwitz, a doctor came and told us to take off our clothing, and everything, and examined us, our health, our -- and then he said, “You going to be sent to Yavishavitz,” and Yavishavitz was a coal mine camp.</span> <span id="s1227">And this was a brand new camp, and at this time when we went to Yavishavitz, we couldn’t believe it that we are in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1228">Even Yavishavitz was a subcamp of Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1229">But it was no kapos, we have not been mistreated too bad.</span> <span id="s1230">And the director from the coal mine came, and he spoke to us, and he says he’s only interested in one thing, this is to be good workers in the mine.</span> <span id="s1231">And he promised us if we will behave, we will do good work in the mine, he will look into it that we are not mistreated, and we will be getting proper food.</span> <span id="s1232">We’ll be able -- I was night shift, and he said, we -- you’ll be able to sleep during the day.</span> <span id="s1233">And in the beginning, was actually true everything, it was not so terrible, I mean, you could survive.</span> <span id="s1234">The only thing was the hard work in the mine, but I used to talk to the one that was in charge in the mine, he was a Pole, and I used to ask him how long can you live in the mine?</span> <span id="s1235">He said, “Oh, people work here 20 and 25 years.”</span> <span id="s1236">And he told me you can survive you working in the mines.</span> <span id="s1237">And he showed me how to hold the shovel proper, what is actually -- make it much easier to work on it.</span> <span id="s1238">And it was good until actually, til ’42, when they start with Jewish transport.</span> <span id="s1239">And then when they start with Jewish transport, they had so many people -- Jewish people, actually, and the most highly intelligent people fen Germany, French, Poland, Belgium, Italy.</span> <span id="s1240">They come, they’ve been professional doctors, professors, very high tech people, and they send them in the mine, they last a day or two, this was all.</span> <span id="s1241">And they looked only a way how to dispose people.</span> <span id="s1242">They didn’t look any more for workers, because they had too many of them.</span> <span id="s1243">In the camp when I came to Yavishavitz was maybe 300 people.</span> <span id="s1244">When the Jewish transport come, the -- in the same camp, in the same barracks, they had 3000.</span> <span id="s1245">And actually every week, used to come a truck in the crematoriums in Auschwitz, and picked up those who broke down.</span> <span id="s1246">It didn’t took too long, actually for people, highly intelligent people to break down.</span> <span id="s1247">I don’t know even it took a week, took days.</span> <span id="s1248">They all got to the point of not being able any more to work, and -- and the rule of the camp, especially in Auschwitz was, if you are not able to work, you don’t have a right to live, and so you -- they automatically -- you know it, if you cannot work, you go to the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: You know, I read that -- and this I think was in some museum materials, that those who had been in the ghettos, and had experienced longer periods of hardship, seemed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Survive longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: -- survive longer.</span> <span id="s1252">I mean, wha -- wha -- you found that to be true?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1254">It’s exactly this, the full truth.</span> <span id="s1255">Number one, you know, I was in the 20’s, and I was fairly healthy, and even at home, you know, I’m raised in a home, even we had the -- and enough money and everything, you know, being this 20 year old boy, to enjoy life, maybe I been raised really restricted, that the same way is nothing, just run around, you have to do to get the feeling and understanding if you are a human being, alive, you have to perform something.</span> <span id="s1256">It doesn’t mean anything but physical work.</span> <span id="s1257">If you read books, was okay with my parents, but doing nothing was not all right.</span> <span id="s1258">So I was used, actually, to let -- not coal mine labor, but I still was used to keep myself busy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Pulling your weight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: -- and to do work.</span> <span id="s1261">And later, when actually I came to Yavishavitz and worked in the coal mine, and somebody explained me how to manage to have it easier, this helped me a great deal, and this actually -- this made me survive.</span> <span id="s1262">Later on actually, you know, when Jewish transport came, everything finished, but they used to get the rations for 300 people, it’s 3000.</span> <span id="s1263">It was just too bad, you know, those rations have been distributed among 3000 people.</span> <span id="s1264">And it started getting rougher and rougher and rougher.</span> <span id="s1265">They didn’t even looked any more for labors, for good labors, they just looked how to dispose those people who -- without a bullet, without the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1266">This how it went on all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1268">Wasn’t Auschwitz itself quite new when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s1270">Brand new, practically.</span> <span id="s1271">The ausch -- when I came in ’41, was only existed -- I don’t think a year old even, less than a year old, practically, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: What are your thoughts about that, when you see the -- the map of Auschwitz, and the -- the many, many subcamps?</span> <span id="s1273">This sort of mankind making this giant killing machine, you -- i -- i -- i -- course, you said it before, it’s unbelievable, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: I be honest, I mean from the beginning we didn’t know it, actually, what had happened.</span> <span id="s1275">Later we heard stories a little bit from here, and from there, and then we realized what is going on.</span> <span id="s1276">And automatically we know it, you know, like our parents didn’t had a chance, you know.</span> <span id="s1277">We know it, they have been destroyed in the crematorium before we even -- if you have been young age, you know, between 18 and 30, you had a chance maybe, they put you in for working, that you will work.</span> <span id="s1278">But things actually, to thinking about the Germans, they have been so organized, everything.</span> <span id="s1279">People who read the past about concentration camps, they think it’s just came by accident.</span> <span id="s1280">It didn’t come by accident.</span> <span id="s1281">I realized now even, you know, before when I was there, I didn’t think about it, but now I can recall, and I realize that everything was so planned.</span> <span id="s1282">As soon as you come to Auschwitz, they took away your identity, you didn’t had a name any more.</span> <span id="s1283">You been like a dog, you got a tag, a number, and you wear uniform, and they don’t call you anything no more, and they -- they call you -- they call you by the number.</span> <span id="s1284">I remember even myself, when I got the number --</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: That’s the number on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah -- no, I didn’t -- was not tattooed when I came to Auschwitz, I was a political prisoner, so my clothing went in a bag like any other person.</span> <span id="s1287">I was photographed I don’t know how many times, several time, you know, turn your head and bumps here and there.</span> <span id="s1288">And -- and another thing, whoever was documented -- they called us, you know, like we come from a prison, and we came, they have document, you know, like the transport had a list.</span> <span id="s1289">You know, some kept the list, and some throw it away the list, because know it -- they know it -- End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s1291">This is tape number four, side B.</span> <span id="s1292">You were documented?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Yeah, and being a document, I don’t know why -- why they have been afraid, those SS or Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1294">Normally, as a rule in every camp like a -- I mean, I can tell only where I was in Yavishavitz, that had they called it a ravia, it was like first aid.</span> <span id="s1295">You know, I mean, sickness didn’t exist, I never heard in a camp that somebody got sick.</span> <span id="s1296">Not [indecipherable] you never heard of it.</span> <span id="s1297">Oh, you dropped dead, so -- a -- a normal thing, actually, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1298">But sick, this didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s1299">I never was sick.</span> <span id="s1300">Neither other thou -- other thousands that is, but if you went in for some help, in this ravia, there are doctors, you know, they all have been prisoners, also haftlinger, and okay, they kept you til one night.</span> <span id="s1301">If yo -- the other day, you have not been able to go out -- go to y -- to the coal mine, or other commanders what they have working commanders, if you have not been able to go, th-then, it was no more time left, so the next day come a truck from the crematorium and picked you up, and -- and this was the end, or so you -- this more or less, everybody was afraid to go in the [indecipherable] been sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: And that’s why one person might help someone else to -- to get back from the mine and hand in their lamp.</span> <span id="s1303">Anything to keep going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Oh, this is a -- with the last strength, whatever you had.</span> <span id="s1305">I remember one time, he was from -- from Bendine, Paul Oberslazin, more or less, a Jewish middle aged, he was much older than me.</span> <span id="s1306">He must have been in the late 40’s.</span> <span id="s1307">And every second week, I think, there used to come from Auschwitz a doctor -- and you have been told to take off your clothes, and -- and he examined you, he looked at your body, how your -- how your are with your health or whatever.</span> <span id="s1308">Not examined, but he just looked at the body.</span> <span id="s1309">And normally what they looked is on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Bottom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: -- bottom, like, yeah.</span> <span id="s1312">And if it was in, you know, you’re not been out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: The bottom got in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Well, they called it a musselman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: And they said --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: I never understood the musselman [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Musselman, yeah.</span> <span id="s1321">This meant that you’re not capable to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: You’re so malnourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: M-Malnourished, or whatever, you’re not capable to work, and they put you -- took your number off, and they put you on the list, and the next day the wagon come from the crematorium, and they have to go.</span> <span id="s1324">At this time, because I was over there, one from the oldest prisoners, inmates, and you know, you’re always have been already prefare -- pre -- you know, prepared, actually -- more privileged than a regular person, you know, they know it.</span> <span id="s1325">I was over there in ’41, you know, so everybody looked me.</span> <span id="s1326">And one time I had a chance o -- the one who took the -- put down the numbers, the same way, you have been forced to put down the number on the list, whatever they have to know it.</span> <span id="s1327">I know him, I was with him together.</span> <span id="s1328">So he came over to me, he knowed me by name, he called me with -- by name, he says, “Please help me.”</span> <span id="s1329">And he was on the list to -- I don’t remember even his name.</span> <span id="s1330">He says, “I’m a rich man, you know.</span> <span id="s1331">I have a lot of wealth, and everything.</span> <span id="s1332">I’d do anything in the world if you can save my life.”</span> <span id="s1333">I told him, “How can I save your life?”</span> <span id="s1334">He says, “See that they take me off in the list.”</span> <span id="s1335">And nobody dared to do things like this, you know.</span> <span id="s1336">Anyway --</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Whatever wealth --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: He couldn’t -- he saw I cannot help him, so he tried -- for some reason he smuggled himself in to the day commander, you know, who march to the coal mine.</span> <span id="s1339">He smuggled himself in -- they counted always, they saw it, they know how many people they have to send to the mine, how many.</span> <span id="s1340">If it was too many, they -- they didn’t let out nobody, they waited until they got straight.</span> <span id="s1341">I don’t know how he did it, but he did it, he smuggled himself, and he went in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s1342">You know what those beasts did?</span> <span id="s1343">When the wagon came, he picked up those all from the list, and they saw he was missing, and apparently wherever they realize, you know, they had a plus, and they knowed exactly in which mine he is, whatever.</span> <span id="s1344">They took the wagon -- the truck, and they went in the mine, they brought him up to the -- in the mine, and took him to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1345">This how a -- and you know what else, how accurate they have been, how planned everything was?</span> <span id="s1346">This is unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1347">As little they fed us, but -- but it belonged, you know, for every prisoner, a ration of bread, if you got a hundred grams, 200 grams, whatever, this -- they have been responsible, this belongs to you.</span> <span id="s1348">They have those people on the truck, and they gave everyone a ration, what it belonged.</span> <span id="s1349">He still was alive, and so he was entitled to the ration.</span> <span id="s1350">They gave him the ration.</span> <span id="s1351">This how, you know, [indecipherable] comes to me how well everything was organized.</span> <span id="s1352">And whatever it came, it didn’t come just happening, you know?</span> <span id="s1353">Everything was planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: It’s really the sort of -- I think this is much written about, but the -- the nature of evil, it’s like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: It’s a little bit more than evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: It’s a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1358">And they -- the first step in the Nazis was actually when you came to a camp, they dehumanize you.</span> <span id="s1359">They took away whatever you could.</span> <span id="s1360">The physical, and then they went mentally, and they realized the only way, you know, they will not give you enough food, and so your brain cannot think nothing else except food.</span> <span id="s1361">And then they con -- control you, they don’t have to afraid that somebody will run away, or somebody will stand up, you know, and say I’m getting killed anyway, I kill a -- a -- a guard, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1362">It didn’t make any different.</span> <span id="s1363">They know that the next hour he will get killed, so what’s the different?</span> <span id="s1364">But they took everything away what a human being have inside in him.</span> <span id="s1365">And then they know it, we will follow all this, and everything what they ask.</span> <span id="s1366">They don’t have to watch you, even.</span> <span id="s1367">And this was everything planned, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Yeah, so that you’re broken, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Exactly, broken is the proper word.</span> <span id="s1370">Yeah, they broke down you completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Physical because you have to work hard, and they don’t give you enough food.</span> <span id="s1373">This they broke right away, this was easy.</span> <span id="s1374">Mentally was a little bit harder, but if they keep on breaking little bit and little bit, then mentally you lose everything, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1376">You know, I wonder other everyday things that give you sort of traumas.</span> <span id="s1377">I’m thinking of coffee, and the fact that that would be the only way you could wash at sa -- at -- at some stage.</span> <span id="s1378">I think of another time when you could barely stand, and you were given raw carrots, and s -- almost miraculously --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: -- you had the strength to stand.</span> <span id="s1381">But s -- do you sometimes find that some little -- some material thing you’ll see in front of you nowadays that will bring back a flood of horrible memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: [indecipherable] in general, actually, even if I can’t afford, I just like being too much comfortable, a luxury.</span> <span id="s1383">Even if I can’t afford, I just -- I feel suffering a little bit release in -- in myself, you know, that I’m survived.</span> <span id="s1384">Even if I go to a doctor, you know, doctors trying to give you -- I never want to take medicine, everything, and whenever it comes to anesthetic, I tell the doctor, don’t worry, pains I can take, you don’t have to worry.</span> <span id="s1385">They have me all on record, Morris refused to take medication, or something to relieve pains.</span> <span id="s1386">Yeah, they have me on the record [indecipherable] and this how actually I -- I feel actually, if I suffer, it feels me a little bit release from the pressure what I lost.</span> <span id="s1387">I-It’s hard to explain, but this how he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1389">I-I -- I -- I just -- you have -- do you sometimes have disturbed nights, when dreams come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Comes back pretty often.</span> <span id="s1391">You trying to ignore, you talk yourself in, you know, just keep on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Was the -- is that -- if you look back over 50 years, does that happen -- does it happen more recently, or ki -- have you -- I wondered, have you been able to bury it for parts of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: It’s no -- no way -- I can speak for myself what I think this is for anybody who survived.</span> <span id="s1394">It’s no way in the world that you can bury it.</span> <span id="s1395">If you want it, or you don’t want it, it will surface.</span> <span id="s1396">If it doesn’t surface hundred percent, it surface 50 percent, 60 percent.</span> <span id="s1397">But just to ignore it, no way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: It’s too -- too profound a part of your life, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Probably, yes it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: Actually, it’s a question I should ask.</span> <span id="s1401">You know, looking back, what was the best time of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: All my family, and feeling the love, that I was loved.</span> <span id="s1403">And we, all kids, all of our brothers and sister, we had sense enough respect our family, and try to give back our love the same what their love was to us.</span> <span id="s1404">This is a way -- you cannot forget those things.</span> <span id="s1405">And this what [indecipherable] you know, what makes life so miserable, why I don’t want to enjoy life, even I can afford.</span> <span id="s1406">I just don’t feel proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1408">Also -- also, I think you’d -- you’d see how material things are so -- sort of flippant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1410">I -- I never believed, and I never expected to material things, actually, until I come to the United States, and then I realized if you have money, you treat it better, y -- and anyway -- and I saw I missed the boat.</span> <span id="s1411">I didn’t do it like some other did, but I still don’t regret it.</span> <span id="s1412">It’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: I hope we’re not completely materialistic.</span> <span id="s1414">But that makes me think of those young, Jewish women, who sounded as if they were so materialistic just after the war, when their -- they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: -- they go after the boyfriends who could provide well for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Yeah, this is mostly, actually, people.</span> <span id="s1418">People who didn’t had [indecipherable] nothing, you know, had been poor and everything.</span> <span id="s1419">And they looked out, and they succeeded.</span> <span id="s1420">It was a chance, this was the only chance after the war to succeed.</span> <span id="s1421">If you missed, you missed the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1423">You know, you spoke earlier in -- in -- in telling a story, y -- but you mentioned the can that you carried, that I think all -- all of you would have on you, so that if there were any food --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: -- you could get it.</span> <span id="s1426">And I just felt that was especially meaningful to me, and I wonder if you’d -- d -- do you remember the years that you had that, and what it looked like, and -- and when you no longer carried it with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: What, the can?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Oh, this was in the camp all the time.</span> <span id="s1430">I mean, in Auschwitz, we was more organized actually.</span> <span id="s1431">You know, they looked at you that you are -- kept yourself clean.</span> <span id="s1432">They killed you if you didn’t kept yourself clean.</span> <span id="s1433">But later, in the later camps, actually, in Buchenwald, where you have been in [indecipherable] was so filthy and dirty, I never had a -- another shirt when I left Auschwitz til actually I was liberated, you know.</span> <span id="s1434">And I mentioned actually in the tape to -- we didn’t have no water, you couldn’t wash yourself actually.</span> <span id="s1435">The same way it was just organized to make your life so miserable actually, that you will give up life, and this what did happen, this was true.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Did you ever, after the Holocaust, have any counseling?</span> <span id="s1437">I think most -- a-any sort of psychotherapy, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: I understand most survivors have -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: No, never [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: -- you know -- never had any formal --</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Never had anything.</span> <span id="s1443">I know it one thing, that counseling will not help, you have to have the strength to help yourself.</span> <span id="s1444">I never believed it -- too much in the counseling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1446">That’s -- that was what I thought, but I -- I j -- I just thought I would ask it.</span> <span id="s1447">You told me that you had returned to your birthplace.</span> <span id="s1448">Would you tell me a bit more about family --</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: I tried to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Yes, you tried to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: It was 30 kilometers from my hometown, and I came by train over there, and I figured, because I had brothers -- I was the youngest, but I still had brothers that had been pretty young, and my oldest sister had three kids already.</span> <span id="s1452">The oldest girl was at this time -- before ’39, she was probably 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1453">In ’45 she was 17.</span> <span id="s1454">And I figured maybe because we had been respected by Gentile people, too, you know, maybe they’re -- somebody hid them, or wherever.</span> <span id="s1455">I had hope that I find somebody.</span> <span id="s1456">I -- parents we didn’t dream, we know what had happened, so we -- we gave up automatically, but -- but the brothers and sisters, we always had any hope.</span> <span id="s1457">And as soon I was able to walk in Theresienstadt, I took a train, and traveled to the home, to the nearest hometown -- like I mentioned, we didn’t have the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1458">The closest railroad station was Rodonsko.</span> <span id="s1459">And I got off in Rodonsk, and I ask those people, any Jew survivors?</span> <span id="s1460">They -- they didn’t s -- know it exactly, whoever I ask, I don’t remember, even.</span> <span id="s1461">So they told me the only way is you have to go out on the road and see where -- if the road leads n -- to Chadbush, be there, and just ask to take you along.</span> <span id="s1462">It was no -- at this time was not too many cars, a car was a novelty, very hardly saw it.</span> <span id="s1463">We saw buses, maybe, to take passengers, but the most -- the other way was by horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s1464">And I went on the road, and stood over there, and suddenly see somebody with the horse and buggy comes, and I looked, and his face looked familiar to me.</span> <span id="s1465">So finally, what closer he got, the more I could see who it was, and I called him by his name.</span> <span id="s1466">Bentkofsky was his name.</span> <span id="s1467">I said, “Bentkofsky.”</span> <span id="s1468">And he looked, and looked, and he stopped the horse [indecipherable] and looked at me.</span> <span id="s1469">And he says, in Polish, “Ti zheerz?”</span> <span id="s1470">It means, you are alive?</span> <span id="s1471">You know?</span> <span id="s1472">And I realize how he greet me.</span> <span id="s1473">And then, you know, then he ask me if I know that those eight people who survived not the camp, who survived, they have been hidden somewhere, whatever, that they all have been killed.</span> <span id="s1474">They lived all Jewish home, and they all have been killed.</span> <span id="s1475">I didn’t know nothing, this was the first time.</span> <span id="s1476">He told me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: And he told you the names?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: He told me the name, and I knowed every one of them, whoever they told me.</span> <span id="s1479">And I got really hysterical.</span> <span id="s1480">I start to cry, and -- and I told him in Polish, I spoke in Polish.</span> <span id="s1481">And I said, “You know why I went through Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1482">I didn’t go as a Jew.”</span> <span id="s1483">He know it probably, because he wa -- he worked in the factory, you know, like I told you, he used to carry finished merchandise to be shipped.</span> <span id="s1484">He took it to the railroad [indecipherable] he was -- he knows me, and the family.</span> <span id="s1485">He knows everything about it.</span> <span id="s1486">I said, “You know I didn’t go to Auschwitz as a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: But as a Pole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: As a Pole, yeah, political reasons.</span> <span id="s1489">Probably he know it about the factory with the double bookkeeping, cause that was in.</span> <span id="s1490">And I was so moved, I couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s1491">I think I spit on him.</span> <span id="s1492">I didn’t know what to do, what not to do, but I think it this was I did.</span> <span id="s1493">And then came out a woman, was near a building also, and she came out and I -- she must have been -- told me that she was Jewish -- she is Jewish too.</span> <span id="s1494">And she ask me what’s going on, what’s happened.</span> <span id="s1495">She saw me, I was crying.</span> <span id="s1496">I told her the story.</span> <span id="s1497">She said, “Please, one thing.</span> <span id="s1498">You cannot go back to Chadbush.</span> <span id="s1499">Go to Lódz, Warsaw, larger town.</span> <span id="s1500">Over there goes some Jewish people, you meet survivors, not survivors.</span> <span id="s1501">Go over there more or less you safe.</span> <span id="s1502">But the Chadbush,” she said, “you don’t go to Chadbush, no way in the world.”</span> <span id="s1503">And she told me about the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1505">Why?</span> <span id="s1506">Because she feared if this could happen once --</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Because [indecipherable] for my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Yeah, in -- that’s what I meant, if this horror could happen once --</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: -- it could be repeated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s1512">And she figured, you know, I thought actually I come over there, and maybe I stay in Poland.</span> <span id="s1513">I didn’t had nobody in any country, relatives or not, where should I go?</span> <span id="s1514">I was born over there, we had houses over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Had hopes that your brothers were alive kept you going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1517">I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: So which -- so you know, on -- at that moment, it was as if y -- this was like a final blow, I assume.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Sure, it was the final blow, and the woman took me into her house, and she told me I should stay overnight over there, and say the next day, go wherever you wanted, but you have to go to a large city.</span> <span id="s1520">A small town is not safe for you to go.</span> <span id="s1521">She begged me, I remember, I don’t know if she gave me food.</span> <span id="s1522">Well, a poor woman, too, actually, I remember.</span> <span id="s1523">But I slept over there, and the minute I saw daylight, I just walked off, out the door, I didn’t thank for nothing, I didn’t say goodbye, or not goodbye.</span> <span id="s1524">I just walked out.</span> <span id="s1525">And I went straight to the railroad station, and I didn’t know -- I didn’t know where to go or what to do.</span> <span id="s1526">But finally I said I’d try to go back maybe, to Theresienstadt, or whatever, see other friends, and where they go, I will go.</span> <span id="s1527">I -- I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1528">And I took the train, I went back to Czechoslovakia, and came to Prague, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Why Prague?</span> <span id="s1530">Was -- or was this really just it could have been anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Anywhere, yeah, exactly, I mean Prague meant the same like I don’t know, like Brazil, or you name it.</span> <span id="s1532">I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1533">I was -- never was in Prague, and I never traveled too much in Poland, and so I didn’t know it -- the different between one country and the other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Except that you mentioned having a dislike of the thought of going to Russia, or -- or -- or being in the care of Russians --</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Well this -- this I left.</span> <span id="s1536">I -- I was raised -- we have not been -- our -- our whole family, actually, because being business people, we never have any sentiment or likeness for Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: What was that based on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: That Communism was as bad as Nazism, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1539">Over there you are told what to wear, what to eat, and what this.</span> <span id="s1540">You know, the Nazis, you know, it was another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: -- it was no different between each other, they’re just a different color is about all [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1543">This was actually bef -- when I came back to -- to Prague, and I didn’t know nobody in Prague.</span> <span id="s1544">It happened to be on the railroad station the same way, by accident, I see a familiar face.</span> <span id="s1545">He was with me -- he c -- he was from Belgium, from Antwerp.</span> <span id="s1546">And he came from the first transport, came actually from Belgium, Holland.</span> <span id="s1547">And he came in ’42, maybe spring ’42, or this I don’t know either, exactly, but he was from the earliest Jewish transport, he came with the Jewish transport.</span> <span id="s1548">And we used to be in the same barrack.</span> <span id="s1549">And I remember, and I said -- I said, “Julius?”</span> <span id="s1550">And he says, “Yeah, Kornberg.”</span> <span id="s1551">Well, we recognize each other, and so we talked about it.</span> <span id="s1552">He was in Buchenwald, too, but during the march, when they took us away from over there, he had a chance, one from the guard told a reichsdeutsch, a German, you know, that he should go, organize, take away a couple horses, and -- and over there, you know, they needed horses.</span> <span id="s1553">So he took him along, so they just took off, they disappeared.</span> <span id="s1554">So he saved himself a lot of things in his life probably, because 80, no more, 90 percent, or even 95 percent didn’t made it, you know, after those marches and this -- everything.</span> <span id="s1555">[indecipherable] ask me where you going.</span> <span id="s1556">I told him [indecipherable] I says, “I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1557">“What you going to do?”</span> <span id="s1558">“I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1559">And he ask me, “Did you go back home?”</span> <span id="s1560">I told him I tried it, and they tell me I shouldn’t go in this town.</span> <span id="s1561">Well, he looked -- and he was a very nice guy -- and he’s still, you know, because we meet together, the Red Cross gets us together.</span> <span id="s1562">Julius Bear is his name.</span> <span id="s1563">He’s originally from Hamburg, but when the Germans kicked out those [indecipherable] in Germany, they send him to a border, you know, and so he ended up, his parents and him, they went to Antwerp in -- in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1564">And so he said that they go back to Belgium, to Antwerp, and he had a whole group was Jewish boys, too.</span> <span id="s1565">He said, “Come along.”</span> <span id="s1566">I said, “Why not?</span> <span id="s1567">I don’t know where else to go.”</span> <span id="s1568">I went in, but you had to go in to the council first, to pass, you know.</span> <span id="s1569">Well, he told me, you know, where Antwerp lays, near Antwerp, where this town -- I don’t recall even the town, but he told me.</span> <span id="s1570">He said the council probably will ask you a few questions.</span> <span id="s1571">And if he ask you, you know what is next to Antwerp, and that city.</span> <span id="s1572">Okay.</span> <span id="s1573">So I waited over there until I was called in, I called in to the council.</span> <span id="s1574">He ask completely things, you know, that I didn’t know, weren’t familiar so he right away -- he was very polite, he smiled at me, and he kindly touched my back, he says, “You’re not from Belgium.”</span> <span id="s1575">And he says, “I’m sorry I cannot let you go.</span> <span id="s1576">You’re not from Belgium.”</span> <span id="s1577">I came back out, and I told him, “The council don’t let me go through, he recognize that I am not from Belgium.”</span> <span id="s1578">Well, he told me that they stayed, they came a night before, and they stayed where in Prague, in a sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1579">Mostly in the sanitorium, he said there’s people from concentration camps over there.</span> <span id="s1580">And he said it’s a very good place, they take good care of you, and I should go over there to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1581">You know, he gave me the address, how to go, whatever, I didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s1582">Well, he went to Antwerp, an-and I went over there to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1583">Yeah, he warned me not to tell that I am from Poland, they have skirmishes, the Czechs and Poles.</span> <span id="s1584">He said, “If you say you’re from Poland, they will not take you in.”</span> <span id="s1585">Well, said all right, we didn’t had no ID’s anyway, nobody knows, you could tell anything.</span> <span id="s1586">Well, I came over there, and they ask me where I am, I told them I’m from Germany.</span> <span id="s1587">Which city?</span> <span id="s1588">I told them Hanover.</span> <span id="s1589">I didn’t know even where Hanover is, I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s1590">Okay, so they document me over -- over there, I had no other identification that I am from in Hanover.</span> <span id="s1591">And the first thing is this was the first time I saw a doctor.</span> <span id="s1592">It was a beautiful, clean place, good food and everything.</span> <span id="s1593">They gave me a number on the second floor, a room to stay over, everything unusually clean.</span> <span id="s1594">But even for somebody from a concentration camp, but in general, you know, was a nice place.</span> <span id="s1595">A nice section, too, it was almost outside Prague.</span> <span id="s1596">In the morning, around 10 o’clock, a doctor came, and examined me.</span> <span id="s1597">I was not used -- I never was examined before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: Except to see if you were capable of labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yeah, oh.</span> <span id="s1600">And examined me, and I -- I think I mentioned already, and then he told me I have a enlarged heart, and he called the nurse, and he told her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: -- that I should not go up on the second floor, they should give me a room downstairs, that I -- End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span> <span id="s1604">This is tape number five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: I was over there, and they actually saved my life, because I was still in very bad shape when I came to the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1606">But they fed us so good, and the friendship from the Czechs was so great.</span> <span id="s1607">Used to come for entertainment in the evenings, didn’t do nothing except ate, and sit around.</span> <span id="s1608">They used to send them young girls in school, kids, beautiful kids, beautiful girls, and they came in, they talked to us, and I -- I know how I looked, you know, shaved and everything, and terrible, shaved and everything.</span> <span id="s1609">They used to tell how beautiful I am, I mean I know the truth, and I knowed why they do it, make me feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Human again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Yeah, they made -- tried to do, they tried to do anything, you know, to make you comfortable, and they did.</span> <span id="s1612">And til today I ca -- will never forget that they actually -- the Czechs in the sanitorium saved my life.</span> <span id="s1613">So I stayed over there about four weeks.</span> <span id="s1614">But later, you see, go out in the streets, and you saw those Russian soldiers, and -- you know, I -- like I mentioned, I was raised and I had none -- much sympathy for Russians.</span> <span id="s1615">And I saw how they’re dressed, you know, on one foot he had a shoe, on one foot a boot.</span> <span id="s1616">You know, terrible.</span> <span id="s1617">And I start to dislike, you know, being over there in Prague.</span> <span id="s1618">And one time I met a couple boys, they came from Germany, actually.</span> <span id="s1619">They did business, you know, they bought up clothing in Germany, they were -- sold it in Czech -- or vice-a versa, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1620">They made money, that’s all.</span> <span id="s1621">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: So there was an awful lot of that going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: [indecipherable] keeping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1627">And probably fulfilling a useful role.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: They have been smart enough to realize that they don’t had nobody any more who will look at them.</span> <span id="s1629">They did the right thing.</span> <span id="s1630">A la -- they know what they have to do on their own to make money, and they did made it.</span> <span id="s1631">They ask me -- we met each other, and they ask me from where I am, which camp I was.</span> <span id="s1632">And I told them everything about it, and that I couldn’t go back home to my hometown.</span> <span id="s1633">And they said -- I told them, I don’t like -- that everything is good, clean, food, everything, but I feel of -- fairly all right, but the only thing is I don’t like to see Russians next to me [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1634">Told me why don’t you go to the American zone, the English zone.</span> <span id="s1635">They take care of you, they do this, it’s much better, you ge -- if you want, we can try to do business, you know.</span> <span id="s1636">Th -- you have more freedom.</span> <span id="s1637">I listened to him, and in Prague were used to be office where the -- they did the deportation to where you came, you know.</span> <span id="s1638">They organized, and they had buses, you know.</span> <span id="s1639">And certain days, even they went this direction, this direction.</span> <span id="s1640">And I came over there to this office, and I say I want to go home.</span> <span id="s1641">They ask me where, and sh -- I told them Hanover.</span> <span id="s1642">“Oh,” she said, “Hanover is bad.</span> <span id="s1643">We very rare have a bus go to Hanover.</span> <span id="s1644">A lot of times you could have to wait for it two, three weeks.”</span> <span id="s1645">Then was a German in the office, I don’t know what he did, and he says, “Oh, you know what?</span> <span id="s1646">I drive tomorrow to Stuttgart.”</span> <span id="s1647">And he says, “If you wanted, I can take you to Stuttgart, and Stuttgart you going to be closer to Hanover than in Prague.”</span> <span id="s1648">He says he just meet me here and here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: What was that journey like?</span> <span id="s1650">What was that journey like with the German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Didn’t bothered me, you know, I felt that he’s a very polite, decent person.</span> <span id="s1652">He offered me a -- you know, a ride, he takes me along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: He know that I don’t have money, and I cannot pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: I just wondered if there was close -- if you talked, and -- and whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Oh yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: -- whether he found out you weren’t really from Hanover, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Oh no, no, just my -- no, he didn’t, and he just want to do a favor for me, and I figured -- you know, I appreciated the favor.</span> <span id="s1659">No, we didn’t think about nothing else, except -- and true enough, he told me in the morning, meet me here and there, and he took me with his car.</span> <span id="s1660">Took a long time, you know, and I think in the evening even, they still had curfew at this time, you was not allowed to travel for private, excepts, you know, military.</span> <span id="s1661">Finally, in the morning, when -- whatever, he arrived in Stuttgart, and -- and he said this is as far as he go.</span> <span id="s1662">I -- he let me off.</span> <span id="s1663">First thing the -- I don’t know who told me, this I don’t remember even, that I should go over -- where he let me off was not far away was a school.</span> <span id="s1664">The name of the school is Yakob Shula.</span> <span id="s1665">Yakob School.</span> <span id="s1666">And he said, “Go over there, over there most people come home from concentration camps, they stay over there until they know where to go, or what.”</span> <span id="s1667">So I went in, this was -- must be a Friday I arrived in Stuttgart, yeah.</span> <span id="s1668">And I went over there, was a big room, a school, real huge.</span> <span id="s1669">It was maybe 20 beds, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1670">They gave you a bed, you know, to sleep in, and they gave you always a slip, across the street was a restaurant where they gave you a slip for breakfast, or dinner, supper, whatever.</span> <span id="s1671">Oh, this is all right, I mean, I didn’t feel nothing wrong in -- you know, about this.</span> <span id="s1672">I mean, it was great.</span> <span id="s1673">I went over there overnight, and in the morning, I didn’t know Stuttgart, but I went down in the center of the Stuttgart, and looked around.</span> <span id="s1674">And then I notice a couple boys, and they looked at me, and I looked at them.</span> <span id="s1675">You know, this was not hard to recognize.</span> <span id="s1676">Finally we get closer a little bit, I went their way, and they came my way, and finally they ask me in Hebrew, Amahoud?</span> <span id="s1677">Means if you are Jewish, you know.</span> <span id="s1678">I told them yeah, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1679">And they said they’re Jewish, too.</span> <span id="s1680">They ask me the story where I was, I told them, you know, in Auschwitz I worked in a coal mine, and I just come from Prague where I was in a sanitorium, and I -- somebody brought me to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1681">Well, they told me, oh -- he says -- yeah, this what they told me first, they ask me where I stay.</span> <span id="s1682">I told them the Yakob Shula.</span> <span id="s1683">They say, “Oh, Jewish people don’t stay in the Yakob Shula.”</span> <span id="s1684">This is maybe for Germans, other nationality, not Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: This is where you should go, they told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And I said, “Very well, where do I go?</span> <span id="s1687">I mean, I don’t have nobody.”</span> <span id="s1688">Oh see, they told me go to Dagaloff.</span> <span id="s1689">Dagaloff is the outskirt of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s1690">This is 90 -- 90 percent villas, and the most beautiful area ever see, you know, landscaping, beautiful.</span> <span id="s1691">It’s on higher ground, Stuttgart is in.</span> <span id="s1692">They call it castle in the lower part.</span> <span id="s1693">And they said, “You go over there, it’s a sanitorium.”</span> <span id="s1694">And over there where Jewish people go, you know, come from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1695">And I come over there, actually, a beautiful villa, sanitorium, re -- the grounds, everything, gardens and all kinds.</span> <span id="s1696">Was a sanitorium before the owner -- it was his name, Katt sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1697">He was a Nazi apparently.</span> <span id="s1698">Eisenhower, all the -- the biza -- the troops who were occupied to kick him out from the sanitorium, and let all [indecipherable] camps -- in concentration camp live in the sanitorium.</span> <span id="s1699">I -- I didn’t had -- the eyes kept on looking, and looking, wherever, how beautiful and everything.</span> <span id="s1700">And same way, they had to -- the German government was forced to supply the best foods.</span> <span id="s1701">The occupation -- the soldiers used to tell them they don’t care from where they get it, but they want for -- for those who camp in camps, the best, nothing less than the best.</span> <span id="s1702">And this what they had to do.</span> <span id="s1703">Anyway, I came over there, and then I met Fedderman, he was with me in -- in Buchenwald, in Traylitz.</span> <span id="s1704">And we have been together where I met him, and so we -- we shared the room together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: You mentioned when you were talking earlier, about your family member who went back to Stadbush.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Chadbush.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: Chadbush, your hometown.</span> <span id="s1708">This is much more recently, but I wonder if you’d briefly tell me, on tape, about that visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: Oh, this was my niece.</span> <span id="s1710">She’s a professor, a doctor professor, she teaches in Rowland University in -- in Florida, Orlando, near Orlando.</span> <span id="s1711">They live in -- in Winter Park, Florida.</span> <span id="s1712">And she just made up -- then this was the plan.</span> <span id="s1713">She’s -- normally she goes all over the world from the university, always with conferences, nofa.</span> <span id="s1714">So she decided, and her husband, she wants to go into the hometown where I was born, this is a -- a daughter of my brother from Israel, she’s a Israeli, too.</span> <span id="s1715">And she ask me if I want to go along, I -- I told her I don’t think I f-feeled for it, to do it.</span> <span id="s1716">She said she still wants to see it.</span> <span id="s1717">They went along in July.</span> <span id="s1718">They visited the hometown, and she was very nice greeted.</span> <span id="s1719">She had a letter to the mayor of Chadbush from the mayor from Winter Park.</span> <span id="s1720">Sh-She had it translated, actually.</span> <span id="s1721">And he really was a -- he looks a very pleasant person, a nice person, the mayor from the town, from Chadbush.</span> <span id="s1722">He is more or less a younger generation, too.</span> <span id="s1723">He’s -- he’s maybe in the 40’s, something like this, and he was very, very nice to her, and everything.</span> <span id="s1724">And she -- she’s very excited about it, and they made a video.</span> <span id="s1725">She send me a copy, the last night we watched it, actually.</span> <span id="s1726">I was not excited about it, you know.</span> <span id="s1727">She ask me before if I want to go along, and I told her, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1728">When I saw the video, or even before I saw the video, and she told me over the phone, I realized it would tear me apart to step in, you know, where I lost everything, to step in those stones.</span> <span id="s1729">I don’t know, you know, a lot of times, I’m not human, I’m like a piece steel, or a stone, you know, I don’t have no feelings for nothing.</span> <span id="s1730">On the other hand, you know, if -- I’m very easy to get emotional, too.</span> <span id="s1731">I think it’s a sickness, or it came in the suffer -- I don’t know, it’s not normal, you know.</span> <span id="s1732">I can get emotionally depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: I try my best, I know that I have to help myself.</span> <span id="s1735">I don’t believe in any doctor, or any consultation will help something like this.</span> <span id="s1736">The only way how I know, is to help myself, and just don’t give in, just be strong enough to fight it, to make you forget, even if you don’t -- cannot forget, and you will not forget, but talk yourself in that you did forgot, you have to keep on going on living.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1738">You know, I read -- I -- I think it was just yesterday I was reading different Holocaust materials, and I read that some people, survivors, have asked, strange though it may seem, to be buried at Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1739">And I wonder if you’ve heard of that, and whether -- i -- i-it’s really -- you spoke earlier of your -- one of the hardest things was coming to terms with having survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: But what is the -- what i -- what i -- have you thought about your own plans for where you’d want to be buried, and -- my guess would be it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: I -- I don’t know, everybody can has it’s opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: And what -- I will not agree or disagree.</span> <span id="s1745">I think this is private matter, you know, to do how you feel.</span> <span id="s1746">But personally, I don’t think, you know, it’s a great idea, something like this.</span> <span id="s1747">It’s too much Jewish blood in Birkenau, what it will never get over it, actually.</span> <span id="s1748">Still boiling, you know, because so many people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: -- innocent people, kids, men, women, who have been so brutally killed, murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: You know -- is there -- thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: I just -- if there’s anything else that, in this hours of taping that I’ve left out that’s important --</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: I don’t know what, I -- I -- this I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1755">This I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Morris Kornberg.</span></p> <p><span
