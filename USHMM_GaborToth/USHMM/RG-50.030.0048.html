id="s20">And when I was born, sometimes hard to say because I never saw my certificate birth.</span> <span id="s21">So what mother told me at that time I was 16.</span> <span id="s22">So I have to believe that.</span> <span id="s23">And during the war I went to, to city hall, and I made papers because I need it.</span> <span id="s24">So I told what mother told me, so I am going with these papers until now.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Um-hm.</span> <span id="s26">Ok, fair enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: But really when I don't know.</span> <span id="s28">I don't need it know.</span> <span id="s29">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: No.</span> <span id="s31">No, you don’t.</span> <span id="s32">Tell me about your parents.</span> <span id="s33">What, what did your father do?</span> <span id="s34">How -- what was your life like as a child with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Well, life was very good.</span> <span id="s36">My father and mother, you see, they didn't talk about too much with, with children about what happened, how.</span> <span id="s37">But what I heard, that my grandfather received from some king a big possession, big land and home for some heroic things, but I don't know what.</span> <span id="s38">And because the parents did tell.</span> <span id="s39">So we had, we had a lot of land and big home, building, big.</span> <span id="s40">And what I remember...the people worked on the land, and the parents paid them, and, and I was little girl.</span> <span id="s41">So I remember also we had a lot of horses -- I think six horses was, and a lot of animals, cows and chickens, what I hated.</span> <span id="s42">And we played around, running around; and, and that's all what was.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">01:03:30 Then maybe a year before war, father died.</span> <span id="s44">Yes.</span> <span id="s45">So mother was with us, and mostly sisters, two sisters older.</span> <span id="s46">They went to the city.</span> <span id="s47">They found the work there, and they worked.</span> <span id="s48">And then I was maybe 12 years of age, I visit my sister with my mother, and I love it.</span> <span id="s49">They, they work in Przemysl, where I was later; and when I came there first time, I don't know.</span> <span id="s50">I love city.</span> <span id="s51">And I told to mother, "Maybe I will stay."</span> <span id="s52">Mother said, "No.</span> <span id="s53">You're too young."</span> <span id="s54">And I wanted to stay, but they didn't let me.</span> <span id="s55">But a few months later, I was visit again, with mother, my sisters.</span> <span id="s56">So I said -- start to cry, and then I said to mother, "I have to stay.</span> <span id="s57">I will not go back."</span> <span id="s58">You know, I don't know, maybe that was my destiny.</span> <span id="s59">I really don't know, but I hated on the village this noise of the chickens and cows.</span> <span id="s60">I tell you, really, exactly at 12 o'clock at night, roosters start to crow.</span> <span id="s61">Oy, that’s makes me nervous.</span> <span id="s62">And in the morning, early in the morning, chickens say “Cock-cock-cock-cock-cock” That makes me nervous.</span> <span id="s63">So when I visit the second time my sisters, was for me city was very quiet and was beautiful, and I start to cry, and I said to mother, "I have to stay.</span> <span id="s64">I will not go back there."</span> <span id="s65">So was no rooster at night that did crow.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: How old were you at this time?</span> <span id="s67">01:06:00</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I think I was maybe 12 or 13.</span> <span id="s69">So my sister said, "Ok, if--" she said to mother, " --if she wanted to stay, she can stay.</span> <span id="s70">We have apartment.</span> <span id="s71">Not too big, but she can stay.</span> <span id="s72">We will find for her some light, not too difficult work, and she will work.</span> <span id="s73">She can be not lazy here."</span> <span id="s74">So mother said, "Ok, but how will it be with school?"</span> <span id="s75">So I said to mother, "Well, I will see later.</span> <span id="s76">Now is vacation."</span> <span id="s77">So I stayed with her, my sister.</span> <span id="s78">Mother returned.</span> <span id="s79">And older sister Mary, she found work for me in some bakery.</span> <span id="s80">So I was putting the rolls and bread on the shelves, but sometimes was too heavy for me.</span> <span id="s81">So one day sister came, and she saw and she said, "Well, I will look something else for you.</span> <span id="s82">And that was special some woman who looks for a work for a girl or some sister.</span> <span id="s83">And I went to her; and she said, "Oh, for this little girl, I will think I will have the work."</span> <span id="s84">And she went with me to some shop; and that was older woman, a little corpulent, and a small shop with everything.</span> <span id="s85">And she saw me, and they talked together with this woman, and she said, “Well, I, I really don't know the price,” what she wanted to pay me.</span> <span id="s86">Because she talked to this woman, and this woman later talked to my sister.</span> <span id="s87">So then she said I can stay with her, ok.</span> <span id="s88">And that was mother of present my husband, yes.</span> <span id="s89">And after few days, really she start to laughing, because, you see, I was young and I was jumping, running, singing, dancing.</span> <span id="s90">And she was lonely.</span> <span id="s91">She had four sons, and they -- some works.</span> <span id="s92">The other went to school, and husband was at home.</span> <span id="s93">He was old.</span> <span id="s94">So she was in this little shop alone, and lonely.</span> <span id="s95">But she said one day that I brought life to her life, to this little shop.</span> <span id="s96">So sometimes I was jumping through the -- these tables and, and she was -- sometimes she tried to do also a little exercise, because she was sitting all day behind this, this, this desk.</span> <span id="s97">And, and what I saw this part was too big.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">01:08:56 And sometimes, sometimes she had it difficult to go out; because it was really -- I don't know how many years she was sitting there and that gathered all this fat.</span> <span id="s99">And also, when I start to sell things went, came sometimes young people, and especially boys.</span> <span id="s100">I sell them chocolates.</span> <span id="s101">And some day, I gave them one.</span> <span id="s102">They said, "Two."</span> <span id="s103">Ok.</span> <span id="s104">I gave them two, and they paid for two.</span> <span id="s105">And some, they gave me, one for them.</span> <span id="s106">So how many chocolate I can eat?</span> <span id="s107">So I put back.</span> <span id="s108">And she said, "That is a double!"</span> <span id="s109">I make money double for her, because I -- I am selling twice the same chocolate.</span> <span id="s110">So, you see.</span> <span id="s111">And I worked there maybe a year.</span> <span id="s112">And then one day, I had enough.</span> <span id="s113">So, was too boring.</span> <span id="s114">And I found another work.</span> <span id="s115">And in a few days I walked through this street and close to her shop, and she saw me.</span> <span id="s116">She called, and she start to cry.</span> <span id="s117">She embraced me.</span> <span id="s118">And she said, “It is so sad in this little shop,” and she's lonely, and she will double my pension and if I will return back.</span> <span id="s119">I said, "I will see."</span> <span id="s120">And she said, "I -- I cannot live without you."</span> <span id="s121">You see, sometimes her friends...she had a daughter, but something happened.</span> <span id="s122">Her daughter was sick, and she was in hospital; and some her friend, they thought I am her daughter.</span> <span id="s123">Sometimes she said, “Yes, I am her daughter.”</span> <span id="s124">So -- and she, she really -- she was lonely.</span> <span id="s125">And so, why I said to you, I, I was jumping, dancing.</span> <span id="s126">And she sometimes she would smile all day.</span> <span id="s127">And then I returned back to her.</span> <span id="s128">And so I work with her.</span> <span id="s129">Sometimes in the morning, when was not clients, so I run to her home back to bring her some lunch.</span> <span id="s130">Something.</span> <span id="s131">Sometimes I ran to, to the market.</span> <span id="s132">I make some shopping, because the husband was not capable to, to do that.</span> <span id="s133">For me that was fun.</span> <span id="s134">Run out.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: What happened as the war began to draw near?</span> <span id="s136">01:11:59</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: When the war began, and so I still was there, there.</span> <span id="s138">And my sisters were, were -- mother came one day, and they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s140">How many sisters did, did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Six.</span> <span id="s142">That was six.</span> <span id="s143">Mother had six girls and two boys -- really, she had three boys.</span> <span id="s144">One died.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">That was later.</span> <span id="s146">Stayed two boys and six girls.</span> <span id="s147">That's a lot!</span> <span id="s148">So when war start, so I work, work still there.</span> <span id="s149">And then my sisters lost the apartment, and I didn't have apartment.</span> <span id="s150">So this lady, she said, "You can sleep in my house."</span> <span id="s151">But was no place, but it was little hole.</span> <span id="s152">And I said, "Well, I can sleep here in this hole."</span> <span id="s153">So her husband, he make like a courtesan to cover my bed, and that was rolling bed on the dirt at night.</span> <span id="s154">I make this bed, and daytime I put back together and to the corner.</span> <span id="s155">That was all.</span> <span id="s156">And that was few months.</span> <span id="s157">Then war start; and , the - - her sons and came German first.</span> <span id="s158">Her sons ran away to another city, to Lvov called, because closer to Russia.</span> <span id="s159">Because all youngsters they wanted to run away from Germany to the Russia.</span> <span id="s160">And they went there, to Lvov, and they couldn't go farther.</span> <span id="s161">So after, I think, few weeks they returned back, and Russia came.</span> <span id="s162">And Russia conquered this part.</span> <span id="s163">But the other part, after the river San, that was still German.</span> <span id="s164">So this lady was very afraid what will be if Germany will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What was it like under the Russian occupation?</span> <span id="s166">01:14:58</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, that was normal.</span> <span id="s168">That was normal.</span> <span id="s169">Only difficult was with language.</span> <span id="s170">So that was few weeks was German.</span> <span id="s171">So on the street, mostly I was running on the street to buy some bread, to buy milk, everything.</span> <span id="s172">Was no shop or market, "Star Market" or "Stop and Shop" like here.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Just on the street from the village women.</span> <span id="s174">So we were buying milk or butter, or something like that.</span> <span id="s175">So mostly in the morning, I was on the street running to, to, to buy everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Soon I heard on the street Germans speaking and so, German soldiers.</span> <span id="s177">Came Russia, just Russian soldiers and the Russian language.</span> <span id="s178">For me, was not really different because some friends, they said, "Well, now we have Russia.</span> <span id="s179">We don't know, maybe later we will have somebody else.</span> <span id="s180">We have to use, be use to that."</span> <span id="s181">And our life start to be again normal.</span> <span id="s182">And shops were opened, and I was still living with my old lady in this shop.</span> <span id="s183">And then start again war, again fighting, fighting; and again Germans were coming.</span> <span id="s184">And again these sons were running to the Russia border and to on the way to the Russia.</span> <span id="s185">Again to the Lvov.</span> <span id="s186">And so came German and start to segregate people.</span> <span id="s187">And also after the few weeks, the sons returned back because the German were there also.</span> <span id="s188">So was no sense.</span> <span id="s189">They couldn't run away with the Ger-- with the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s190">Something happened.</span> <span id="s191">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s192">They didn't run away there.</span> <span id="s193">So they coming back.</span> <span id="s194">And they, the German start to segregate people.</span> <span id="s195">They start to talk about all Jewish people start to wear this arm bands with stars.</span> <span id="s196">So for me that was something strange because I, I didn't know why the Germans start to segregate people, and why they mark these people with, with stars and white armbands.</span> <span id="s197">For me, this -- and for all our friends, we sometimes talked and we said what happened.</span> <span id="s198">After war -- before war -- was everything all right, really together; and we were all friends, more or less.</span> <span id="s199">But we were friends.</span> <span id="s200">And now when Germans came to the country, they start to segregate people.</span> <span id="s201">So sometimes we were very disagreed with that, but we couldn't do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">01:17:53 So then -- and you see, maybe why I later also helped, because when Germans were -- I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s203">I'm jumping so with....</span> <span id="s204">So, on the street one day I walked, and I was surprised everything, some people start to talk something wrong about that.</span> <span id="s205">About Germans, war and, and when walked, some boy -- Jewish boy -- maybe 10 years of age, and the other boy was not a Jew, and the other boy start to a little yell at this Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s206">And what -- so ordinary worker man, maybe 30 -- and he asked this boy, "Why you yell at him?"</span> <span id="s207">And this boy said, "Well, be--because he is a Jew."</span> <span id="s208">And this man said, "What he is a Jew?</span> <span id="s209">Look at him.</span> <span id="s210">He is the same like you.</span> <span id="s211">You see he is not difference.</span> <span id="s212">Just German makes difference.</span> <span id="s213">Before was no difference.</span> <span id="s214">Look at him.</span> <span id="s215">He is a Jew, ok?</span> <span id="s216">Because that is his people gave this name -- a Jew -- like you has the name of Pole.</span> <span id="s217">Every -- some groups, they give themselves some name.</span> <span id="s218">But look at him --the same skin like yours, like mine, like all of these people.</span> <span id="s219">The same color of hair -- some are, some are darker, some are blonde.</span> <span id="s220">That depend."</span> <span id="s221">And said, "And what that he's a Jew?</span> <span id="s222">You have to be friendly."</span> <span id="s223">That now is a war; and war will finish, and we will be all again friendly.</span> <span id="s224">And these boys, and, and this man said, "Shake the together hands.</span> <span id="s225">Be friends."</span> <span id="s226">And for me that was something also new.</span> <span id="s227">You see, I looked and I said, "Of course, we are the same."</span> <span id="s228">And you will laugh, but when I came home I looked at my skin.</span> <span id="s229">Because I, I have no, no chance to educate myself about people.</span> <span id="s230">Was, was no, no television -- like today, you can hear television, you can listen and people are talking.</span> <span id="s231">But wasn't that time.</span> <span id="s232">Radio some only people had.</span> <span id="s233">So, I, I just learned what I heard on the street.</span> <span id="s234">That's all was.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">01:20:39 So later I was surprised also that Germans segregate people.</span> <span id="s236">They start to talk about ghetto, and, and they made the ghetto.</span> <span id="s237">I helped to moved this -- my old lady with sons, with husband, to move to ghetto.</span> <span id="s238">We, we are carrying a little something -- a chair not too heavy, some luggages, some valises -- and they advised me also to, to find for myself some room.</span> <span id="s239">For me, especially, with my name.</span> <span id="s240">I really didn't know where to look, but they told me, they show me.</span> <span id="s241">And the same apartment, that was one room separate.</span> <span id="s242">And her husband told me where to go, and I went there.</span> <span id="s243">I brought paper.</span> <span id="s244">And he filled up everything, so I went there back to the city hall, and of building apartment.</span> <span id="s245">And they gave me permission for this one room.</span> <span id="s246">And I was so proud that I have my own room.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I think, at, at that time, I was maybe 17, maybe 16, 17 -- something like that, yes.</span> <span id="s249">So I had my own room; and I was proud, very proud.</span> <span id="s250">So they went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s251">And all apartment, all these building was empty, because there lived only Jews.</span> <span id="s252">And on the first floor, that was some Catholic girl there.</span> <span id="s253">She lived there a long time ago.</span> <span id="s254">And sometimes we are laughing.</span> <span id="s255">We came together, and she said -- she was older, she was maybe 21 -- and she said, "Well, now we are here host.</span> <span id="s256">We are owner of this building."</span> <span id="s257">And sometimes I was afraid, because I was alone on the third floor.</span> <span id="s258">Was nobody there.</span> <span id="s259">But you see, then one night, I heard that people were taken from the ghetto to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s260">And one night I heard the screaming, my old lady and her apartment at that was across, and that was her voice.</span> <span id="s261">And in the morning, I ran to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s262">And I, I had my special hole there, under the screen, and I knew there a, a few policemen and few German policemen.</span> <span id="s263">I often were a guest around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s264">They, they knew me.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: I didn't understand.</span> <span id="s266">You had a hole where?</span> <span id="s267">101:23:57</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: When I sneaked to the ghetto sometimes, that was -- the ghetto was around with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s269">Q: Oh, your apartment was outside of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You were not inside the ghetto?</span> <span id="s272">A: No, absolutely no.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I never was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s275">I just visit, yes.</span> <span id="s276">So when I ran to the ghetto, and I, I run to ghetto and I met there policeman who knew that me that I was very often there.</span> <span id="s277">And I told him I wanted to go inside.</span> <span id="s278">He said, "You cannot go there.</span> <span id="s279">It is very dangerous."</span> <span id="s280">I said, "I have to go there!</span> <span id="s281">I have to visit my friend and tell him something."</span> <span id="s282">He said that was the -- they took the people to the concentration camp, and some place.</span> <span id="s283">Anyway, it's very danger.</span> <span id="s284">You cannot go there.</span> <span id="s285">And then came German policeman.</span> <span id="s286">I said, also, I didn't speak German, just few words; but I told to this policeman, he Polish policeman -- he spoke very well German -- I said, told him that I've -- he have to disappear, and you, too, because I have to go to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s287">And this German policeman said to me, "Nein, nein, nein!</span> <span id="s288">"He will not let me go there.</span> <span id="s289">I said, "I have to go there!"</span> <span id="s290">And I said to this Po-- Polish policeman, "Take him out some place to the building, and you and go and disappear.</span> <span id="s291">Because I have to go there."</span> <span id="s292">And they talked together and they went to some building.</span> <span id="s293">And I pulled out a little this screen, this wire, and I sneaked there and I went to, to their house, there to their apartment.</span> <span id="s294">So the parents that night were taken to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s295">And because I heard screaming -- this lady, I heard voice -- because she cried that she left the children, and she didn't know what will be with her, with her husband.</span> <span id="s296">And they never returned back.</span> <span id="s297">And then again was "Aktion;""Aktion" -- that called when they took the people to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s298">That was the Aktion in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: Describe it, please.</span> <span id="s300">When you were outside, did you get to see any of it?</span> <span id="s301">01:26:30</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s303">I saw when they took it very often to the wagon, people.</span> <span id="s304">So that was bridge, connected from this place where I lived to the other side, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s305">Before that was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s306">That was normal streets there.</span> <span id="s307">People lived.</span> <span id="s308">But that was the bridge through by the train were passing under, the bridge that was train, that was tracks.</span> <span id="s309">So very often I was standing on this bridge with some my friends.</span> <span id="s310">So I saw them, how they took the people to the trains, and the wagon left.</span> <span id="s311">And very often I went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s312">I smuggled the food there, and sometimes they gave me there.</span> <span id="s313">So they, these four brothers, they didn't have any more parents.</span> <span id="s314">So they were alone.</span> <span id="s315">Then they took their other brother -- one brother also to the concentration camp, to Lvov -- that was a camp.</span> <span id="s316">And I visited there several times.</span> <span id="s317">I was there.</span> <span id="s318">That was camp not only for Jews.</span> <span id="s319">That was for Poles, for Ukraines -- Gypsy -- that was mix-it camp.</span> <span id="s320">So that also was one a policeman took care there, and he guarded there.</span> <span id="s321">So I made friends with him.</span> <span id="s322">So he sometimes he went there, and he called this brother Isaac (ph) -- my husband will show picture, I think, is here.</span> <span id="s323">And I brought food sometimes to him, and message.</span> <span id="s324">And so, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s325">I don't know why really, but I made it friends with people.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Can you describe the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I wasn't inside.</span> <span id="s328">I just this, this policeman, he took me one day to inside.</span> <span id="s329">But there came other guard, and he said, "It's forbidden to people from outside to bring inside to the camp."</span> <span id="s330">He 1 “No, no, no!”</span> <span id="s331">(German).</span></p> <p><span id="s332">2 Murderous campaigns undertaken for political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s333">said, "I am here working.</span> <span id="s334">I will not let my wife come here, or somebody else."</span> <span id="s335">So I saw just a little.</span> <span id="s336">So then this, this policeman said, "Ok, come on out."</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: But you brought food with you?</span> <span id="s338">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Were you able to get it in to the -- 01:29:35</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s341">They called, they called this Isaac (ph).</span> <span id="s342">They call, and he came to this special room -- visit room.</span> <span id="s343">So I gave sometimes shirt clean or underwear, or something like that.</span> <span id="s344">And food I gave.</span> <span id="s345">But I came one day, and I -- we make arrangement.</span> <span id="s346">And this Isaac (ph), he asked me -- he wanted to run away.</span> <span id="s347">And he asked me to bring some old glasses and pair of shoes, that he will dress differently, like on the street.</span> <span id="s348">And he will run away when I will come next time.</span> <span id="s349">Ok.</span> <span id="s350">So I came next time.</span> <span id="s351">I brought everything.</span> <span id="s352">But I was late, and maybe three hours, because on the, on that -- well, you don't know but during the war was nothing in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">When I went by trolley, so soldiers stopped the trolley; because that the Germans, they called Nachschub.Germans army was passing.</span> <span id="s354">And for them, that was first way supposed to be, not for civilian.</span> <span id="s355">Just for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s356">So the train was waiting maybe two hours.</span> <span id="s357">Then one hour took me to get there.</span> <span id="s358">And this Isaac (ph), he waited for me.</span> <span id="s359">And, was another, some woman that was maybe similar to me.</span> <span id="s360">And he thought that that's me, that I am waiting there, and he ran from the camp.</span> <span id="s361">And some guard saw him and ran after him, and took him back.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">And I don't know what happened there; but anyway, he was dead.</span> <span id="s363">That everything told me, few hours later.</span> <span id="s364">His friend, whom I knew, also, from the same city -- they were neighbors.</span> <span id="s365">And he said “Isaac (ph) is dead.”</span> <span id="s366">And he said how that happened.</span> <span id="s367">And so I gave him this bread?</span> <span id="s368">What I brought -- this food.</span> <span id="s369">And I gave him, and then I, I returned back.</span> <span id="s370">And that what, what happened.</span> <span id="s371">And you see, I returned back.</span> <span id="s372">And then again was Aktion in the ghetto, and ghetto was smaller and smaller.</span> <span id="s373">And one day, one brother with his fiancée, he works in some on the field, field with some with some farmers.</span> <span id="s374">They worked.</span> <span id="s375">They cultivated some vegetables.</span> <span id="s376">And they knew if German will have, will finish this war, so they will not needed them anymore.</span> <span id="s377">And next day, I heard that the -- again there's no more ghettos -- so ghetto still was, but again they took a lot of people to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s378">And then that time, they took present my husband and his brothers, and others people they took.</span> <span id="s379">And like he said that on the way, he knew that they will not survive.</span> <span id="s380">They will go -- they, they were going to -- for a death.</span> <span id="s381">Nothing more.</span> <span id="s382">So he wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s383">He -- he wanted to jump from running train, and he will be killed anyway.</span> <span id="s384">He wanted to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s385">And he bro-- broked the barbed wire from the window, make a hole and he jumped.</span> <span id="s386">And he told his brother also to jump after him.</span> <span id="s387">That they will be killed, and they will not have to go anymore to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s388">But he jumped, and he wasn't killed.</span> <span id="s389">And brother didn't jump.</span> <span id="s390">What he said later, Joe, when he jumped he had a bread.</span> <span id="s391">And this bread, he 3 Supplies, either personal or material (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s392">covered it here on the chest.</span> <span id="s393">When he jumped, and he was slide because the, the, the force of the air pushed him and he was slide.</span> <span id="s394">And he stopped on the post, some post, and the post hit him here on the chest in exactly what was the bread.</span> <span id="s395">And he had big hole on the bread, but this bread saved his chest.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: It was a bag?</span> <span id="s397">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s398">I don't understand.</span> <span id="s399">A: Bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Loaf of bread, he had here.</span> <span id="s402">And this bread, loaf of bread, saved his chest.</span> <span id="s403">Q: A loaf of bread?</span> <span id="s404">Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">01:35:54</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s407">And when he woke up, the train was far away; and he looked and he didn't find his brother.</span> <span id="s408">He didn't jump; but jumps other two people, some strange people.</span> <span id="s409">And he found them.</span> <span id="s410">One was broken here, this clavicle area, however, so he helped him.</span> <span id="s411">The other man jumped, young man.</span> <span id="s412">He had -- was broken something, hand here.</span> <span id="s413">So he helped them, and they walked a little.</span> <span id="s414">And they went to some man that Joe knew him before war.</span> <span id="s415">They went sometimes to skiing.</span> <span id="s416">And he, this man, had like some little cafeteria, and they came to him, and Joe said, "You remember me."</span> <span id="s417">So this man said, "Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s418">I remember."</span> <span id="s419">But he said, "You know, I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s420">And I jumped from the run-- running train that goes to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s421">So can you accept me?</span> <span id="s422">Can I stay here only one night?"</span> <span id="s423">Because was cold.</span> <span id="s424">And he said, "Ok, ok.</span> <span id="s425">You can stay."</span> <span id="s426">And he asked about friends.</span> <span id="s427">He said, "Ok, stay with your friends."</span> <span id="s428">And they let him stay and give what he could, some warm coffee and some little -- he washed them, helped them, and in the morning they left.</span> <span id="s429">Early in the morning.</span> <span id="s430">So the next, in the evening, he went to another friend that he -- in Przemysl, the other friend, that he -- same city in Przemysl.</span> <span id="s431">And this man -- so he let him stay during -- all day he let him stay.</span> <span id="s432">But at night, in the evening, he said, "My wife is scared.”</span> <span id="s433">Because of the Gestapo law, who was, “Who will help the Jews will be punished by death."</span> <span id="s434">Of course, everybody was afraid.</span> <span id="s435">So this man said, "My wife is afraid.</span> <span id="s436">I have children.</span> <span id="s437">So if somehow Gestapo will discover, so we will be all killed.</span> <span id="s438">So maybe you will find some -- another place, some-- somehow maybe somebody will take you."</span></p> <p><span id="s439">01:38:46 So Joe, he didn't know if I am still living in the same place or no.</span> <span id="s440">And he -- but this man brought him to the city; because he, this man, lived a little behind the city.</span> <span id="s441">He brought him, and he let him go.</span> <span id="s442">And Joe said, "Ok, I will go out."</span> <span id="s443">And this man said, "Maybe God will help you.</span> <span id="s444">Maybe after the war we will meet again.</span> <span id="s445">And good luck."</span> <span id="s446">And he left.</span> <span id="s447">And Joe went to the same building where I lived and his parents before lived, and he went to the basement because he didn't know what will, if he can come to me or no.</span> <span id="s448">For he, he thought that few days he will be in the, in the basement.</span> <span id="s449">When he came there.</span> <span id="s450">Well, basement the basement.</span> <span id="s451">Was some rats, mice, cats, sometimes were fighting, and that was maybe 11 o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s452">He was afraid also.</span> <span id="s453">And he was thirsty, hungry.</span> <span id="s454">And he was wounded also from the running train.</span> <span id="s455">When he jumped, he was wounded -- hands and face and knees; and he was afraid sometimes maybe some neighbors will come to the basement and will see -- find him.</span> <span id="s456">So he took the risk to come out.</span> <span id="s457">Maybe I will let him go if I am still in the same place and the same room.</span> <span id="s458">So he knocked.</span> <span id="s459">I was surprised for this knocking to my door so late in the evening.</span> <span id="s460">So I asked, "Who is there?"</span> <span id="s461">He said, "Joe."</span> <span id="s462">"Joe who?"</span> <span id="s463">And he said, "Well, you remember Joe.</span> <span id="s464">You worked with my mother.</span> <span id="s465">Is Joe from this little shop."</span> <span id="s466">"Ok."</span> <span id="s467">I opened.</span> <span id="s468">Well, I saw Joe.</span> <span id="s469">But that was no Joe.</span> <span id="s470">That was like three disasters together.</span> <span id="s471">Dirty, wounded, the blood on the face, blood on the hands, hands were very swollen.</span> <span id="s472">And so, "Ok," I said.</span> <span id="s473">And he asked -- and he said, "If you let me stay through the night, only one night.</span> <span id="s474">And tomorrow in the morning I will go out some place.</span> <span id="s475">But one night.</span> <span id="s476">I said, "Ok, come on."</span> <span id="s477">And my sister, she didn't know who was the Joe, and she didn't know who are the Jews, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">She didn't know the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: How old was she?</span> <span id="s480">01:41:52</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: She was six and a half at that time.</span> <span id="s482">So I explain.</span> <span id="s483">I said, "That is my friend, the Joe."</span> <span id="s484">And she asked, "Why he is so dirty?</span> <span id="s485">Why he has some blood on the hands?"</span> <span id="s486">I said, "He fell, fell down some place."</span> <span id="s487">And so she helped me to washed him, and little so....</span> <span id="s488">And I didn't have pajama for him, and I gave him my nightgown.</span> <span id="s489">And my sister, she laughed and she said, "Oh, now we have two Fusia, not one."</span> <span id="s490">She called me from Stefania, the Fusia.</span> <span id="s491">I'm Fusia.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">And she laughed, and she -- "Well, that is Fusia, and that is another Fusia."</span> <span id="s493">And he, I put him to the bed and he couldn't sleep because he was so excited and that he lost everything, and all night -- and he had a fever also.</span> <span id="s494">All night he was calling, "Mother!</span> <span id="s495">," "Father!</span> <span id="s496">," and "Brother!"</span> <span id="s497">Why he didn’t, didn't jump.</span> <span id="s498">All night: "I am jumping, I am -- jump after me."</span> <span id="s499">He called still that this, this brother, that he should jump.</span> <span id="s500">All night I was sitting behind -- beside his bed, and quiet because I was afraid maybe somebody will heard this girl have a man in her room.</span> <span id="s501">In the morning, he felt a little better.</span> <span id="s502">So I made some tea, and then I bought some little milk and he felt a little better.</span> <span id="s503">And still he had a high fever.</span> <span id="s504">So he was a few days.</span> <span id="s505">And during the day came friend of mine.</span> <span id="s506">So I didn't -- her -- didn't want to see her, a man, so I said to, to Joe, "Jump under the bed."</span> <span id="s507">So he jump under the bed, and all his clothes I put, put with, with him.</span> <span id="s508">And I said, "Keep you feet, feet cannot sticking out.</span> <span id="s509">And don't, don't breathe too loud.</span> <span id="s510">Don't sneeze."</span> <span id="s511">And I covered the bed longer with a blanket, that nobody will see him.</span> <span id="s512">And he was stayed, I think, week or, or week and a half he was in, in my home.</span> <span id="s513">And this man, my bed.</span> <span id="s514">And I slept in the other bed with my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">01:44:53 And I have to enlighten my sister a little: who is the, the Joe, who are the Jews.</span> <span id="s516">And so sometimes I took her around the ghetto, and I show her that is the Jews.</span> <span id="s517">And she asked a question, "Who are they, these Jews?</span> <span id="s518">What kind of people?"</span> <span id="s519">She didn't know.</span> <span id="s520">So I explain her, and I told her that Joe is a Jew; and she said, "But he is the same like you, like me.</span> <span id="s521">Like other men.</span> <span id="s522">He's the same!"</span> <span id="s523">I said, "Yes, he is the same."</span> <span id="s524">So I have to explain her the same what I heard this worker told to this little boy, who are the Jews: the same skin, the same everything, only the name is a the difference.</span> <span id="s525">And I told her, "You remember the mother, one time she said that God is one for all people.</span> <span id="s526">Only people choose some leaders, like she said Jews took the, the Moses.</span> <span id="s527">That is just a counsel.</span> <span id="s528">But God is one.</span> <span id="s529">The other people choose their counsel.</span> <span id="s530">But they, all these leaders counsels go to one God."</span> <span id="s531">And so I explained the same to my sister, because I had no -- I had no other way.</span> <span id="s532">So that she can understand a little more who are the Jews and why Gestapo are killing Jews.</span> <span id="s533">I, I said, "I don't know really why.</span> <span id="s534">I cannot tell you why, but they killed them.</span> <span id="s535">So we will try to help."</span> <span id="s536">And so she, she was enlightened a little who are the Jews.</span> <span id="s537">And, and then I --</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: You have a picture -- excuse me.</span> <span id="s539">You have a picture here of you and your sister during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s541">This is the pictures during the war and this picture is a little later.</span> <span id="s542">Q: Hold it up a little just a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s544">This is earlier.</span> <span id="s545">This is a little later.</span> <span id="s546">That is almost before, when war was ended.</span> <span id="s547">Almost, this picture.</span> <span id="s548">But that, that is a little earlier.</span> <span id="s549">You see this skirt, that is not mine.</span> <span id="s550">That is one of the women whom I hid in the bunker.</span> <span id="s551">She was -- why?</span> <span id="s552">Because was time where when they had no more money, so I have to exchanged dresses for our food.</span> <span id="s553">So I exchange all my better dresses for a food, and then I had only one dress.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">01:48:00 And then I started to -- they started to, to look among themselves what they have to exchange.</span> <span id="s555">So I had only one dress, and the Sunday -- sometimes if I wanted to go out and have something, I didn't have dress.</span> <span id="s556">Only to work.</span> <span id="s557">So this woman, she was with two children.</span> <span id="s558">And she said, "Well, maybe this skirt...you will take mine."</span> <span id="s559">She said, "It's in good condition, so try."</span> <span id="s560">And I tried, ok.</span> <span id="s561">And that is her, her skirt, because I didn't have.</span> <span id="s562">I exchanged for a food.</span> <span id="s563">Listen, 13 people that I needed a lot of food for them.</span> <span id="s564">13 them, two of us.</span> <span id="s565">That was together 15 people.</span> <span id="s566">I needed a lot of food.</span> <span id="s567">So that is my sister, and that's me.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">And that is later, almost when war was ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Let us go back now.</span> <span id="s570">Sorry to interrupt you.</span> <span id="s571">A: That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: So you have been hiding Joe under your bed for a week and a half, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s574">And then I, I went where work his brother.</span> <span id="s575">When he works there on the field with his fiancée.</span> <span id="s576">I went there to tell him that Joe is all right; and he jumped from the train and he came to me.</span> <span id="s577">I went there and I told him.</span> <span id="s578">And he said, "Ok, but anyway he will be dead now or later.</span> <span id="s579">He -- they will kill us."</span> <span id="s580">And his fiancée, Danuta (ph) her name was, and she asked me maybe they will come to me also because when they will not needed them anymore, so they will kill them.</span> <span id="s581">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s582">I have only one room."</span> <span id="s583">And the evening when they went back to the ghetto, she run away.</span> <span id="s584">She asked Henick (ph) -- her fiancé, Joe's brother -- that maybe he will run away from the way.</span> <span id="s585">And he was afraid, and she said, "You are going, or no?"</span> <span id="s586">He said, "No, I am not going."</span> <span id="s587">And she ran away by herself, and she came to me.</span> <span id="s588">So now I, I have two Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">01:50:53 But she two days later greeted me also unexpectedly friend of mine, and Joe were jumping under the bed, and I wanted her to jump, but at that moment friend of mine opened the door.</span> <span id="s590">And I just pretended that I am making the bed, to cover Joe under the bed with the blanket.</span> <span id="s591">And she saw this Danuta (ph), and she asked me, "Oh, who is that?"</span> <span id="s592">I said, "Well, that is a friend of mine."</span> <span id="s593">And, "What's she doing here?</span> <span id="s594">When she came?"</span> <span id="s595">Because she knows everything.</span> <span id="s596">Only was two of us in whole building.</span> <span id="s597">So you know, I don't know how these lies came to me.</span> <span id="s598">I told her that this friend, she's pregnant and she didn't want her parents know that she is pregnant.</span> <span id="s599">And she wanted to make abortion, and she ran away from parents and she came to me, yes.</span> <span id="s600">I don't know how I make up these stories.</span> <span id="s601">And this friend had -- she told, "Well, that's very easy."</span> <span id="s602">And she asked how months she's pregnant.</span> <span id="s603">I said, well, that is two months.</span> <span id="s604">And I really didn't know how, how, how long she was to say she was pregnant, because I didn't know the difference.</span> <span id="s605">The shorter, the longer -- I said, "Two months."</span> <span id="s606">And she said -- she gave advice, and she said to her, "Well, first of all, you have to make a hot bath.</span> <span id="s607">And you will, will sit there in the hot water maybe half an hour.</span> <span id="s608">Then you make exercise -- very, very strong exercise.</span> <span id="s609">Then again hot water, and then a run on the steps."</span> <span id="s610">I lived on the third floor.</span> <span id="s611">She said, "Run on the steps several times: up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s612">And make strong exercise, and that will go out."</span> <span id="s613">I said, "Well, you have experience!"</span> <span id="s614">She said, "Well, a little."</span> <span id="s615">And I told to Danuta (ph), I said, "Listen carefully.</span> <span id="s616">You have to do that."</span> <span id="s617">And I asked her, this neighbor, I said, "Well, how I will make bath, hot bath for her?</span> <span id="s618">I have no bath here.</span> <span id="s619">There is nothing."</span> <span id="s620">She said, "Well, all right."</span> <span id="s621">And she said, "I will borrow you…" She had like a big, big, some rounded -- some pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">01:54:05 She said, "You will warm water in the pot, and then put here warm water.</span> <span id="s623">And she will sit, and you will add every so 10 minutes or 15 minutes hot water.</span> <span id="s624">And that will be all right.</span> <span id="s625">And then exercises."</span> <span id="s626">And I said to Danuta (ph), "Listen, you have to do that if you want to get rid of these things when you have that."</span> <span id="s627">And then my friend, she left.</span> <span id="s628">And then she brought me this big pot.</span> <span id="s629">And I thanked her very much for her advice, and I said to Danuta (ph), "You thanks her, because that was for you."</span> <span id="s630">And she said, "Thank you very much."</span> <span id="s631">And she asked, "That will help?"</span> <span id="s632">She said, "Ok, that will help.</span> <span id="s633">You will see that will help."</span> <span id="s634">"Ok."</span> <span id="s635">So the neighbor left, and we laugh a little.</span> <span id="s636">I said, "Will you jump?"</span> <span id="s637">And next day I went to the ghetto, and this brother, he was waiting around.</span> <span id="s638">He knew the place that mostly I were coming there.</span> <span id="s639">And I met him there; and he said, "Well, here in the ghetto everything is quiet.</span> <span id="s640">It's all right.</span> <span id="s641">They can return back."</span> <span id="s642">I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s643">So he said, "I already found a room."</span> <span id="s644">"Ok."</span> <span id="s645">So I went back, and I told Danuta (ph) and Joe how it is.</span> <span id="s646">She said, "I will not go back."</span> <span id="s647">And Joe also told, "I will not go back for a death there.</span> <span id="s648">There, there is only death, nothing more.</span> <span id="s649">But what is doing this Henick (ph)?"</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Let's hold it a minute please.</span> <span id="s651">We need to change the tape.</span> <span id="s652">Let them do that and -- A: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s655">02:00:34</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Ok, we are now back there.</span> <span id="s657">You started talking about Henick (ph), is that his name?</span> <span id="s658">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s659">Oh, I did not finish about the ghetto, yes.</span> <span id="s660">So that night came back, and I told that Henick (ph) is back in the ghetto and everything is all right there.</span> <span id="s661">And they said they will not go back.</span> <span id="s662">But after noon, came some men knocking to the door.</span> <span id="s663">And I asked who.</span> <span id="s664">He said, "Friend."</span> <span id="s665">“What a friend?”</span> <span id="s666">I didn't know this voice.</span> <span id="s667">So I opened the door; and this man pushed the door and he came into the room.</span> <span id="s668">And that's good that Joe, in time, jumped under the bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">02:03:08 But Danuta (ph) was -- wasn't.</span> <span id="s670">And he came this man, and he pointed out on Danuta (ph).</span> <span id="s671">And he said, "Oh, this is the girl.</span> <span id="s672">This is the Jewish girl from the ghetto."</span> <span id="s673">And I was surprised and I thought, "Oh, that is...." Because I heard that the Germans had a lot of spies.</span> <span id="s674">There are spies.</span> <span id="s675">They were around.</span> <span id="s676">And spies.</span> <span id="s677">So I thought that is probably German spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">And he knew her and he came; and now probably he will kill me and Danuta (ph), and Helena, too.</span> <span id="s679">And he -- this man said, "Yes, that is the ghetto, Jewish ghetto.</span> <span id="s680">She run away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s681">And you fiancé, Henick (ph), he told me that you have to come back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s682">He begged me that I will come here and I will bring you back to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s683">And you see, when I heard that I was really angry.</span> <span id="s684">I said, "What a miserable thing!"</span> <span id="s685">How could he send someone that I don't know?</span> <span id="s686">Who is he to send and tell her -- him my name, my address?</span> <span id="s687">And he told who was the girl, that she is the Jewish girl and she is in my home.</span> <span id="s688">I was angry.</span> <span id="s689">But Danuta (ph) said, "I will not go back to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s690">He said, "Oh, girl, you have to go.</span> <span id="s691">You are a Jew, and your fiancé said that I have to bring you back."</span> <span id="s692">So I said later, and he doesn't, he, he said that Henick (ph) will not pay him until he will bring her back.</span> <span id="s693">So I said, "I will bring her back to the ghetto if she will not go with you.</span> <span id="s694">So you will be sure he will pay you."</span> <span id="s695">He said, "Ok, I will leave you here during the day."</span> <span id="s696">And he said to me, "But you have to bring her back."</span> <span id="s697">And she signed her signature and word that Henick (ph), Josef's -- her fiancé, Josef's brothers, he have to pay this man and she will return back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s698">And the man left.</span> <span id="s699">And I was really angry, and Joe was angry, too.</span> <span id="s700">And Danuta (ph).</span> <span id="s701">How could he do that?</span> <span id="s702">But anyway, sometimes that is --.</span> <span id="s703">So in the evening, they said they will go back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s704">They will not longer risk my life for them.</span> <span id="s705">If the ghetto still there, they will go back, ok.</span> <span id="s706">I will give them the food what I had, and I dressed them like on the street in the evening.</span> <span id="s707">So Danuta (ph), I gave some my dress, some jacket that she will look like a girl, and we took Joe between us.</span> <span id="s708">And we walked and we laugh and we joking sometimes when., when Germans....</span> <span id="s709">I said to her, "Hey, you laugh a little and be joking that this looks like a girl's walk with a man."</span> <span id="s710">And they are smile and joking, and something like that.</span> <span id="s711">And we came around the ghetto.</span> <span id="s712">Henick (ph) was waiting there.</span> <span id="s713">And I said, "How could you do that?</span> <span id="s714">You are skunk.</span> <span id="s715">You couldn't go or come by yourself!"</span> <span id="s716">Because he was too afraid.</span> <span id="s717">"You sent some man that I didn't know him.</span> <span id="s718">Nobody knows him.</span> <span id="s719">And you told him my address, my name!"</span> <span id="s720">He said, "Ah, that is good man."</span> <span id="s721">I said, "You know him?"</span> <span id="s722">"No, but I heard he is a good man."</span></p> <p><span id="s723">02:06:01 And Joe was also angry.</span> <span id="s724">And Danuta (ph) said to him, "Listen, Henick (ph), I will scratch you eye or you, you face.</span> <span id="s725">Everything."</span> <span id="s726">She was so angry at him, ok.</span> <span id="s727">We say -- said goodbye, and they went there.</span> <span id="s728">I went home.</span> <span id="s729">And every second day, Joe were coming to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Sometimes twice a week from the ghetto, because they needed food.</span> <span id="s731">Was difficult to get food there.</span> <span id="s732">And I -- and he brought sometimes skirt, sometimes glove, sometimes dress.</span> <span id="s733">I ran to the, to the market, and I exchanged for the food and I gave them.</span> <span id="s734">Later one day, he came, and came friends -- one boy from work -- and Joe jumped under the bed and then he came from under the bed.</span> <span id="s735">He got ide maybe I will find a bigger apartment, that I will take them from the ghetto to hide them.</span> <span id="s736">I said, "Where did you get this idea?</span> <span id="s737">Under the bed?"</span> <span id="s738">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s739">I said, "Go back under the bed."</span> <span id="s740">"And to think about something else if you are thinking under the bed.</span> <span id="s741">So go back and think."</span> <span id="s742">He laughed.</span> <span id="s743">I said, "Reverse your thinking."</span> <span id="s744">He said, "Ok, I am going back."</span> <span id="s745">And you see, exactly this time, a girl was knocked on -- to the door; and again came the same neighbors.</span> <span id="s746">And we talk a little, and she ask, "That this friend, this friend, she had abortion?</span> <span id="s747">She, she made miscarriage?"</span> <span id="s748">I said, "Yes, you, you advice was wonderful.</span> <span id="s749">Wonderful."</span> <span id="s750">She said, "If you need it, do the same."</span> <span id="s751">So all the time, twice a week, Joe was coming to me and still drilling a little to find apartment, to find apartment.</span> <span id="s752">And one day, he came and he said in the ghetto his brother was ill.</span> <span id="s753">He got the typhus.</span> <span id="s754">And his friend and they needed more food and better food -- like a milk, like a butter, a little cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">02:09:00 And again I have to run on the street or sometimes go on the village.</span> <span id="s756">Sometimes I walked thirty miles on the village, because I knew there someone to exchange some dresses and bring the food to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s757">So one day he said maybe I will ask this -- my neighbor, this Mary who lived on the first floor -- she was a good friend -- maybe we together we will find some apartment, and we will take him, his brother, and his friend from the ghetto because they, they heard the ghetto will be finished.</span> <span id="s758">They will take all Jews to the concentration camp, or to kill.</span> <span id="s759">I don't know what -- will be no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s760">So they wanted to run away from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s761">Maybe together with friend, we will take some apartment and we will take few Jews from him and other.</span> <span id="s762">So I invite friend of mine, this Mary, and I told her.</span> <span id="s763">And I said, "Listen, Mary.</span> <span id="s764">You see the Jews are killing and taken to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s765">Maybe we will help few of them.</span> <span id="s766">Maybe we will find bigger apartment, and we will take few Jews - - these friends, some.</span> <span id="s767">You have also friends, some friends, Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s768">So we will maybe help them."</span> <span id="s769">"You know," she said to me, “Stefusia,” she said, “I am 21.</span> <span id="s770">You are 17, probably.</span> <span id="s771">You know Gestapo law.</span> <span id="s772">We saw on the on the street there was the posters that was that sign by Gestapo: ‘who will help the Jews will be punished by death.’"</span> <span id="s773">And was posters also on the same, on our building also, the same poster sign by Gestapo.</span> <span id="s774">She said, "You read that.</span> <span id="s775">If you forget, go read again.</span> <span id="s776">That is maybe one percentage on the million that we can help and be alive.</span> <span id="s777">But this million, one million, that we can be dead."</span> <span id="s778">And she said to me, "I am too young to go to the grave for a Jew.</span> <span id="s779">If you want it, that is your life.</span> <span id="s780">If you wanted to be killed, to go to the grave in your young age, you can go.</span> <span id="s781">That is your choice."</span></p> <p><span id="s782">02:11:57 But she said, "I don't like to be dead.</span> <span id="s783">And I am too young to be buried."</span> <span id="s784">And she said, "No, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s785">I will not help you.</span> <span id="s786">I will not take Jews and help, because that is death."</span> <span id="s787">And I said, "Ok, Mary.</span> <span id="s788">If you don't like, maybe I will not take also."</span> <span id="s789">And I told her, "Mary, please don't tell -- don't mention to nobody."</span> <span id="s790">She said, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s791">I already got amnesia.</span> <span id="s792">I already forget everything.</span> <span id="s793">Don't worry.</span> <span id="s794">Everything gone from my head and my mind."</span> <span id="s795">And ok.</span> <span id="s796">So Joe came in the evening.</span> <span id="s797">I told him how Mary refused.</span> <span id="s798">He said, "Well, ok."</span> <span id="s799">I said, "Well, maybe I will take by myself.</span> <span id="s800">I will look for apartment."</span> <span id="s801">And I looked.</span> <span id="s802">I didn't know really where to go.</span> <span id="s803">But I look.</span> <span id="s804">And Joe advised me to go there, where was mostly Jewish street.</span> <span id="s805">And now was empty.</span> <span id="s806">That.</span> <span id="s807">Go there.</span> <span id="s808">Maybe there you will find apartment, ok.</span> <span id="s809">I went there.</span> <span id="s810">Was really empty, whole street.</span> <span id="s811">But was every apartment, I running up and down.</span> <span id="s812">Was no floor, was no doors, was no windows.</span> <span id="s813">No nothing.</span> <span id="s814">So I thought, "Well, floors is not necessary.</span> <span id="s815">But doors and windows, that is necessary!"</span> <span id="s816">Then I looked -- oh, sorry, then I looked around.</span> <span id="s817">If I will find some apartment there, I will take in these people where I will hide him, them.</span> <span id="s818">But was not apartment, was nothing.</span> <span id="s819">I thought, "Maybe from another building I will take some windows, some doors."</span> <span id="s820">But was no-- nothing.</span> <span id="s821">You see, I went out and I stood on the street and I thought, "Where to go now?"</span> <span id="s822">I didn't know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Empty.</span> <span id="s824">And I was frightening a little, so ghostly.</span> <span id="s825">You were laughing, really, but I heard a voice.</span> <span id="s826">I heard a voice.</span> <span id="s827">When I stood and thinking, and I asked, "Dear God, where I supposed to go now to look for apartment?</span> <span id="s828">Where?"</span> <span id="s829">I looked around, and was a little scared because was nobody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">02:14:52 And then I heard the voice.</span> <span id="s831">Some voice told me, "Don't be afraid, and go a little farther there.</span> <span id="s832">After this corner, there is standing two women, women who clean the street, and they are supporting on the brooms.</span> <span id="s833">And ask them for apartment.</span> <span id="s834">They will tell you."</span> <span id="s835">So I was listening; and then I said, "Well, what is with ordinary women who clean the street?</span> <span id="s836">What they will know about apartment?"</span> <span id="s837">And this voice said to me, "Go and ask.</span> <span id="s838">They will know.</span> <span id="s839">They will tell you."</span> <span id="s840">So I still thought, "Well, what they will know?"</span> <span id="s841">And this voice again told me, "Go.</span> <span id="s842">Please go."</span> <span id="s843">And I felt like a little pushed, and said, "Go and ask, and ask for a janitor there."</span> <span id="s844">And I said, "All right, all right.</span> <span id="s845">What I can lose?"</span> <span id="s846">And I am going exactly this way, like this voice told me.</span> <span id="s847">And aft-- after the corner, and I saw two women, and they are, they were talking together and supporting on the brooms, ok.</span> <span id="s848">I approached them.</span> <span id="s849">And I asked, "Ladies, maybe you know some apartment?</span> <span id="s850">I am looking for apartment.</span> <span id="s851">And there's nothing here.</span> <span id="s852">I looked here, but there's nothing.</span> <span id="s853">Maybe you familiar with this area or something?"</span> <span id="s854">They said, "All right.</span> <span id="s855">We know apartment."</span> <span id="s856">And one of them, she said, "Oh, is apartment empty.</span> <span id="s857">Tatarska (ph) 3.</span> <span id="s858">You go this way, Tatarska (ph) 3 -- that is little small</span></p> <p><span id="s859">cottage, one family.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">02:17:03 And over there is woman janitor, and you ask for this woman janitor, and she will show you this apartment.</span> <span id="s861">Is nice, nice apartment."</span> <span id="s862">And go, and they show me the way.</span> <span id="s863">And they said, "Tatarska (ph) 3, go that way and ask for this apartment.</span> <span id="s864">And janitor is there, woman.</span> <span id="s865">She will tell you."</span> <span id="s866">I thanked them, and I went there.</span> <span id="s867">And I went to this janitor; and I told her, asked her for apartment.</span> <span id="s868">She said, "Ok."</span> <span id="s869">There across is apartment.</span> <span id="s870">And she said, "Ok, I will take the keys.</span> <span id="s871">I will show you."</span> <span id="s872">And she opened the door and I went inside.</span> <span id="s873">It's really -- it's two rooms, something wrong.</span> <span id="s874">It's two rooms and a kitchen, separate attic.</span> <span id="s875">It's very nice.</span> <span id="s876">I looked around.</span> <span id="s877">She said, "Well, only bad thing is here is no running water inside.</span> <span id="s878">There's no electricity.</span> <span id="s879">Toilet is outside.</span> <span id="s880">It's primitive.</span> <span id="s881">But is nice."</span> <span id="s882">And she asked me, "How many people is?"</span> <span id="s883">"I have," I said, "By myself and my sister."</span> <span id="s884">She said, "Oh, that is big apartment for you.</span> <span id="s885">You not have to have electricity.</span> <span id="s886">You can have a candle, or...or kerosene la...lamp.</span> <span id="s887">And to go to the toilet, you not have to use at night.</span> <span id="s888">It's enough daytime."</span> <span id="s889">"Ok," I said.</span> <span id="s890">And she told me where to go to...to reach man that he will give me application and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">And he is, he takes care of everything around these apartments, all apartments.</span> <span id="s892">All right.</span> <span id="s893">So I came home.</span> <span id="s894">In the evening, Joe came; and I told him that I saw apartment and I told him, "Primitive, very primitive."</span> <span id="s895">He said, "Ok, that may be better."</span> <span id="s896">And in the evening he dressed like....</span> <span id="s897">He said, "I have to see that apartment."</span> <span id="s898">And he told me, "You will tell that I am your brother.</span> <span id="s899">I have to see this apartment."</span> <span id="s900">"Ok."</span> <span id="s901">He make artificial mustache and make up a little and everything; and evening, we run there.</span> <span id="s902">And I went to the janitor, and I said, "That is my brother.</span> <span id="s903">He wanted to see apartment."</span> <span id="s904">And she gave me the keys.</span> <span id="s905">And I went, opened, and he looks around and he said, "That is perfect."</span> <span id="s906">And he looked at attic, and he said, "That will be very nice."</span></p> <p><span id="s907">02:20:03 And I said, "That is like a dream for this deadly business."</span> <span id="s908">So I told the janitor that I will take this apartment.</span> <span id="s909">And...but that was evening.</span> <span id="s910">She said, "Ok, tomorrow morning you can go to this and this man, and he will give you application and everything."</span> <span id="s911">Ok.</span> <span id="s912">In the morning, in this same evening, Joe went back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s913">In the morning, I didn't went to work so I ran to, to this man.</span> <span id="s914">He sent me to the building apartment.</span> <span id="s915">He gave me, "Here's recommendation."</span> <span id="s916">And I went to the building apartment; and they gave me application and I went back, I came home.</span> <span id="s917">I filled up everything, and I went back there.</span> <span id="s918">And the secretary were there, there was a lot of people for apartment, but secretary is woman, very fine.</span> <span id="s919">She saw me and she heard: "You are back!"</span> <span id="s920">I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s921">I have everything all ready."</span> <span id="s922">And she took it from me; and she said, "In four days, come back.</span> <span id="s923">I think we be ready."</span> <span id="s924">I said, "Really, you will take care of it?"</span> <span id="s925">She said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s926">And ok.</span> <span id="s927">In four day, after four days, I came, and she saw me and she yelled to me, "I have for you.</span> <span id="s928">I have, I have."</span> <span id="s929">So I came, and she gave me and I kissed her.</span> <span id="s930">She said, "Yes, now you have a bigger apartment.</span> <span id="s931">Not just a studio."</span> <span id="s932">And I kissed her and man who stood on the line for apartment, too.</span> <span id="s933">And he -- she -- he told, "Maybe...." To the secretary, "Maybe...maybe I will kiss you.</span> <span id="s934">Maybe you will give me apartment, also."</span> <span id="s935">She said, "No, this girl was before you a few days."</span> <span id="s936">So -- and then I had this license my.</span> <span id="s937">And in the evening -- and I ran directly to the ghetto, and I told Joe that I have already apartment.</span> <span id="s938">And he start to organize there people and everything, a little money.</span> <span id="s939">And little by little, I -- first of all, I moved with my sister there.</span> <span id="s940">And my sister, when she saw two rooms and a kitchen separate.</span> <span id="s941">Oh, she, she lied on the floor and she, she rolled.</span> <span id="s942">And she said, "So big place!"</span> <span id="s943">And we moved right away to this bigger apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">02:23:01 And she was happy.</span> <span id="s945">And then start to -- first Joe and another man also with father, first when was everything ready.</span> <span id="s946">So from the ghetto they came.</span> <span id="s947">I went six o'clock, before six o'clock, under the ghetto.</span> <span id="s948">They were ready there.</span> <span id="s949">And then we met in some place -- not under the ghetto, a little farther -- and they were dressed like a workers, and they kept the hands like some can with coffee or something like that.</span> <span id="s950">And they are going to the work.</span> <span id="s951">And I brought them home.</span> <span id="s952">And two by two, with time, they came.</span> <span id="s953">And I had already seven people.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Who were the seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Third came Joe with this man other, his friend -- Zenek his name.</span> <span id="s956">Then came girl from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s957">She is in Brussels now.</span> <span id="s958">Then came another man with his friend.</span> <span id="s959">Then came this two father -- men from -- father from this man who came with Joe first time and father this girl who was already in my home.</span> <span id="s960">You see what happen?</span> <span id="s961">Also little tragic, but a comedy.</span> <span id="s962">When these two father were prepared to come, I came to the ghetto and they arrange with the Jewish postman that they will take them from the ghetto as a post office man.</span> <span id="s963">That nobody will control them.</span> <span id="s964">Because postman from the ghetto every day comes out of the ghetto to the city to take mail, and comes and brings to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">02:26:02 So they make arrangement with the postman to take them as his helpers, to take them out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s966">But they paid him to take them out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s967">But somehow -- I don't know if this man or other some, they denounce them to the German police.</span> <span id="s968">And what happened, I said, “What happened?”</span> <span id="s969">These men, they took them from the -- by mail, wagon mail, from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s970">And he knew the city of Przemysl very well, this man.</span> <span id="s971">Every day he was going from the ghetto to the, to the mail box, and that time that day he forgot the way.</span> <span id="s972">And he was surrounding three times around the city.</span> <span id="s973">He couldn't go straight to the mail box.</span> <span id="s974">He forgot!</span> <span id="s975">But what happened, I saw, we were waiting for them, for these two father.</span> <span id="s976">The policemen are waiting on the -- our street.</span> <span id="s977">Was two, two Polish policemen, and two German policemen.</span> <span id="s978">And they were walking up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s979">Exactly at Tatarska (ph) 3.</span> <span id="s980">Up and down.</span> <span id="s981">I was a little angry.</span> <span id="s982">So we wait.</span> <span id="s983">Past one hour, two hour.</span> <span id="s984">They didn't come.</span> <span id="s985">So I talk.</span> <span id="s986">I said to Joe, "I will go out."</span> <span id="s987">He said, "No, don't go out.</span> <span id="s988">If you will go out, exactly this father can come here.</span> <span id="s989">So who will open the door?"</span> <span id="s990">I said, "No, I have to go out.</span> <span id="s991">I have to something, some -- take some walks."</span> <span id="s992">And I am passing this policeman.</span> <span id="s993">And I said, "Good day!"</span> <span id="s994">And I said, "Oh, I surprised that you are here.</span> <span id="s995">What happened here?</span> <span id="s996">Somebody was killed, or something like that?"</span> <span id="s997">They said, "No, something, something maybe will be."</span> <span id="s998">I said, "Well, maybe you protecting us.</span> <span id="s999">Maybe we'll be -- we're landing here Hitler and Stalin, and we'll fight here.</span> <span id="s1000">That you are here, maybe you will protect us."</span> <span id="s1001">They said, "Well, if they will come here and fight, we will maybe help you to kill them both and will be war over."</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">02:29:05 And we laughed together, really.</span> <span id="s1003">And I wanted to pass them, and they wanted also to talk.</span> <span id="s1004">And they said, "Well, miss.</span> <span id="s1005">Talk a little!"</span> <span id="s1006">I said, "No, I have to go some place.</span> <span id="s1007">At least if you will tell me why you are standing here..." And passing exactly German policeman, and he asked something then and they told them something.</span> <span id="s1008">I don't know what.</span> <span id="s1009">I was not interesting.</span> <span id="s1010">And they pass, and they walk up and down.</span> <span id="s1011">And I said, "If you will tell me why you are standing here, I will talk to you.</span> <span id="s1012">If no, bye."</span> <span id="s1013">So came another policeman, and he said, "Well, of course, we can tell you.</span> <span id="s1014">Why not?"</span> <span id="s1015">And they said, "German policeman -- police received yesterday a note, a telephone, that today will leave ghetto some two rich Jews.</span> <span id="s1016">And they order us to, to catch them.</span> <span id="s1017">And you see, these two German policemen, they watch -- are watching us, too.</span> <span id="s1018">They don't believe us.</span> <span id="s1019">They watching us.</span> <span id="s1020">We watching them.</span> <span id="s1021">And we all watching for these two Jews.</span> <span id="s1022">Two rich Jews.</span> <span id="s1023">Probably German wanted to have also their money, or something like that."</span> <span id="s1024">You see, when I heard that, and I was inspected -- expected - - these two fathers, my heart fell down to the heels.</span> <span id="s1025">And I said, "Oh, God, what will be today?</span> <span id="s1026">Will, will I, will I be killed today or no?</span> <span id="s1027">What will happen today?"</span> <span id="s1028">You see, and I went -- I said, "Well, thank you."</span> <span id="s1029">And I said, "I don't think if some Jews will risk their life to go out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1030">They know they will be killed if they will leave ghetto.</span> <span id="s1031">I don't know if they will risk their life."</span> <span id="s1032">Policeman said, "Well, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1033">I think also this same way, but we received the note that we have to watch.</span> <span id="s1034">So..."</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">02:31:43 And I asked, "But why you standing exactly here, Tatarska (ph) 3?"</span> <span id="s1036">"Because," he said, "they don't know which number they will come.</span> <span id="s1037">But some -- someplace between 5 in 1 -- and 1.</span> <span id="s1038">So we stand here, 3.</span> <span id="s1039">We observe for 1, 2 and 4, 5.</span> <span id="s1040">And we have good view, so we observe.</span> <span id="s1041">And that is in the middle, 3."</span> <span id="s1042">I said, "Oh."</span> <span id="s1043">I thought, "Dear God, they had the right number."</span> <span id="s1044">And I said, "Ok, thank you."</span> <span id="s1045">And I said, "I don't think that they will come, that they will risk their lives to come."</span> <span id="s1046">And I went a little farther.</span> <span id="s1047">That was a church, and I went to this church, and I prayed and I asked God to take somehow this Germans and this other policeman from here, that these two fathers will be not caught here.</span> <span id="s1048">I prayed and I really asked God to help, to take out somehow these policemen.</span> <span id="s1049">And I -- ok, and then I came home.</span> <span id="s1050">Still was nobody.</span> <span id="s1051">And sadly, this one, the Zenek one, the fathers -- the son of one of these fathers, he stand at the window a little farther and nobody can see him.</span> <span id="s1052">And he observed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">And exactly that time the policemen went up.</span> <span id="s1054">All of them.</span> <span id="s1055">And they talked, and came one father.</span> <span id="s1056">This girl's father.</span> <span id="s1057">And he came on the back yard, and he didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1058">And he met the janitor, the woman, and he asked but -- before we talked together with this man if he will met someone that he will tell that he is from work, because that time I will not go to work, that he will a little angry at me why I didn't come to work.</span> <span id="s1059">That he is from work.</span> <span id="s1060">And he came, and he asked the janitor and why I didn't come to work.</span> <span id="s1061">And he was angry a little, and janitor said, "Well, she is a good girl.</span> <span id="s1062">She lives here, but she is a good girl.</span> <span id="s1063">She's work very hard, and she has a, a little sister.</span> <span id="s1064">So she have to take care of little sister.</span> <span id="s1065">Don't be bad to her.</span> <span id="s1066">She is a good girl."</span> <span id="s1067">And she show him where I am living.</span> <span id="s1068">And I opened the door, and I said, "Oh," what his name was, this mister who was in the in the factory.</span> <span id="s1069">I said, "I am sorry I didn't come to work today, but I had a pain in my knee.</span> <span id="s1070">I am so sorry.</span> <span id="s1071">But I will be afternoon, for sure, tomorrow."</span> <span id="s1072">And he said, "You miserable girl!</span> <span id="s1073">You didn't come to work today."</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">02:35:04 And I closed the door, and -- ok.</span> <span id="s1075">And I asked him, “Where is the other father?”</span> <span id="s1076">The, the Hirsch (ph) is the -- name of Hirsch (ph).</span> <span id="s1077">He said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1078">This man, he, he was lost, the mail man.</span> <span id="s1079">And he -- three times around and around the city, and he lost his way."</span> <span id="s1080">And he said, "He put us out of his carriage.</span> <span id="s1081">And I lost the, the, the Hirsch (ph), the Schilinger."</span> <span id="s1082">And I thought they, all my people were a little nervous.</span> <span id="s1083">And after few minutes the son, who was watching, and he said, "Oh, it's my father!</span> <span id="s1084">It's my father!"</span> <span id="s1085">And here came the other father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">He came.</span> <span id="s1087">And he did -- the Zenek came, "Oh, Miss Fusia!</span> <span id="s1088">Miss Fusia, my father!"</span> <span id="s1089">And he tooked me and he lifted me up.</span> <span id="s1090">And he said, "Go out.</span> <span id="s1091">Bring my father.</span> <span id="s1092">Go out.</span> <span id="s1093">Meet my father."</span> <span id="s1094">And I opened the door, and I asked, "Oh, you again?</span> <span id="s1095">Also from the work?"</span> <span id="s1096">And I took him home.</span> <span id="s1097">And my feeling...he came home, and he said, "Oh, God, we are discovered!</span> <span id="s1098">We are discovered.</span> <span id="s1099">Look, Gestapo will be here.</span> <span id="s1100">We are discovered."</span> <span id="s1101">And he start to running from one corner to the other.</span> <span id="s1102">"We are discovered!"</span> <span id="s1103">"What happened?"</span> <span id="s1104">I said, "Mr. Hirsch (ph), what happened?"</span> <span id="s1105">"Be quiet."</span> <span id="s1106">"What happened?"</span> <span id="s1107">"Gestapo will be here.</span> <span id="s1108">We are all killed.</span> <span id="s1109">We are all killed."</span> <span id="s1110">And I said, "Quiet!</span> <span id="s1111">What happened?"</span> <span id="s1112">And he said, “Story -- what, what happened?”</span> <span id="s1113">And that he said, "I lost Schilinger, this foreman.</span> <span id="s1114">I lost him."</span> <span id="s1115">And then he said, "I went here to this Tatarska (ph) 3.</span> <span id="s1116">And exactly a few doors before, one man caught me and put me to the inside to the building.</span> <span id="s1117">And he said to me, 'I know you are a Jew and I know you are going to hide here 'til some Polish people.'</span> <span id="s1118">Said, 'But I needed money.</span> <span id="s1119">Give me some money.</span> <span id="s1120">I know you are rich.</span> <span id="s1121">Your people know that you will come here.'"</span> <span id="s1122">And this father, he was prepared for that.</span> <span id="s1123">And he had ten thousand zlotysin the pocket, and he -- [TECHNICAL PROBLEM]</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">02:38:10 Oh, yes, and he said he gave him this, this 10,000 zlotys.</span> <span id="s1125">And he asked, "May I go now?"</span> <span id="s1126">This man said, looked out and he said exactly the German policemen was crossing, walking.</span> <span id="s1127">He took him back and he said, "No, you cannot go now."</span> <span id="s1128">He said to him, "I am a thief, but I am not killer."</span> <span id="s1129">He said, "I got what I wanted.</span> <span id="s1130">I don't like -- I don't want you life.</span> <span id="s1131">So go to this family.</span> <span id="s1132">I know you are going to be hide some Catholic family, whoever they are.</span> <span id="s1133">And good luck.</span> <span id="s1134">Maybe after war we will meet."</span> <span id="s1135">And he again went out.</span> <span id="s1136">He looked that policemen were out, higher a little.</span> <span id="s1137">He said, "Now it is all right.</span> <span id="s1138">Go."</span> <span id="s1139">And he let him go, then.</span> <span id="s1140">Because he 4 Polish monetary unit (Polish).</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">was angry when he came.</span> <span id="s1142">He had -- he said, "We are discovered.</span> <span id="s1143">We

not Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1148">Quiet!"</span> <span id="s1149">But anyway, I was afraid because that is some, some man; we didn't know who.</span> <span id="s1150">Maybe he observed where, where he were going.</span> <span id="s1151">But everything was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: How did you get the other four people?</span> <span id="s1153">You have a total of 13?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: The other, yes.</span> <span id="s1155">You see, one day came to me two, really, some street boys.</span> <span id="s1156">And they brought me a letter.</span> <span id="s1157">They gave me a letter, and they said some woman gave them from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">And she paid them to, to deliver this letter to me.</span> <span id="s1159">I start to read, and I see some woman named Zimmerman (ph)n (ph).</span> <span id="s1160">I don't know who is she.</span> <span id="s1161">I said, "I don't know who is she."</span> <span id="s1162">And they said they required my signature to, to, to give her back, that she will pay them.</span> <span id="s1163">And she will have proof that they delivered me this letter.</span> <span id="s1164">I said, "I don't know.</span> <span id="s1165">I don't know her."</span> <span id="s1166">But anyway, I went to my people and I asked them.</span> <span id="s1167">And they said, "Ok, give them your signature."</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">02:40:51 And this woman asked me to come there to the ghetto, and she said in this letter that she knows that I will take Jews, and she knows that I have a few.</span> <span id="s1169">And she mentioned the names the people and, and she said that I had to take her and her two children.</span> <span id="s1170">If no, she will denounce me to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1171">I a little was upset.</span> <span id="s1172">But I gave my signature, and I said, "Go back.</span> <span id="s1173">I don't know who is the woman."</span> <span id="s1174">And we discussed among this people, my people, and they said they don't know who is she.</span> <span id="s1175">Next day these same boys came.</span> <span id="s1176">And Joe's brother was still in the ghetto, still was there, and his fiancée.</span> <span id="s1177">And these boys came, and I read this letter again.</span> <span id="s1178">And again this same question, blackmail, to take her and her, her children.</span> <span id="s1179">If no, she will go to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1180">She knows whom I have already.</span> <span id="s1181">So I said, "I gave my signature."</span> <span id="s1182">They, the boys, left.</span> <span id="s1183">And I told to my people, I said, "I will go.</span> <span id="s1184">I will say -- see what she wanted and who is she."</span> <span id="s1185">I came there.</span> <span id="s1186">I went to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1187">And I met Joe's brother, his fiancée, and they introduced me to, to, to this woman.</span> <span id="s1188">And I said to her, "You know, you are miserable.</span> <span id="s1189">You know, you are a killer."</span> <span id="s1190">I said, "You -- ok, you sent a letter.</span> <span id="s1191">You can tell in the letters that you wanted to meet me.</span> <span id="s1192">You...you could say that the Henick (ph) is sick, or Danuta (ph) is sick.</span> <span id="s1193">That they wanted to see me, and here we can talk.</span> <span id="s1194">But in the letter, you, you sent some streets boy.</span> <span id="s1195">I didn't know who are they.</span> <span id="s1196">And you mentioned the people, that I have the Jews, a few Jews.</span> <span id="s1197">And you blackmail me, and you said that you will go to Gestapo if, if I will not take you."</span> <span id="s1198">I said, "Did you have do that?</span> <span id="s1199">You are killer!"</span> <span id="s1200">I said, "You go, you go to tell, 'Come on to visit because Henick (ph) is very, very sick, or Danuta (ph).'</span> <span id="s1201">And here we, we could talk.</span> <span id="s1202">But not to mention in the letter everything."</span> <span id="s1203">She start to cry, and she start to kiss my knee.</span> <span id="s1204">And she said, "I don't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s1205">I tho-- I thought that is the best way.</span> <span id="s1206">But I wanted to be alive.</span> <span id="s1207">I wanted to save my children.</span> <span id="s1208">I wanted to be alive to hear that this is dead, not, not nothing more."</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">02:44:00 And she started to, to embrace -- kiss me, and my hand.</span> <span id="s1210">And she said, "Please, I beg you.</span> <span id="s1211">I beg you.</span> <span id="s1212">I wanted to save my children.</span> <span id="s1213">I don't want to die, and my children."</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">02:47:04 I said, “That was a very bad way, very low quality way.”</span> <span id="s1215">She said, “But I didn’t know another way.”</span> <span id="s1216">So I said, “Ok, if I have so many people, three more people makes no difference for me.</span> <span id="s1217">If they will kill me, they will kill once.</span> <span id="s1218">Not many times.</span> <span id="s1219">Not for every Jew kill.</span> <span id="s1220">Just one death.”</span> <span id="s1221">So we make arrangement; and first, two days later, I took her children, girl and boy.</span> <span id="s1222">Boy was maybe eight, eight years maybe, maybe seven.</span> <span id="s1223">I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1224">Daughter was 15.</span> <span id="s1225">So I brought them.</span> <span id="s1226">Then she came.</span> <span id="s1227">Then came Joe’s brother and his fiancée.</span> <span id="s1228">Also was trouble with him.</span> <span id="s1229">He didn’t want to leave the ghetto, because was very quiet there at that time.</span> <span id="s1230">And he said, “Why I supposed to sit in, in the bunker and be closed?</span> <span id="s1231">Here I have apartment.</span> <span id="s1232">I have fresh air and I have food.”</span> <span id="s1233">Because he had the money to -- and he bought the food.</span> <span id="s1234">Sometimes I brought the food, and was everything all right.</span> <span id="s1235">So I said, “That will be not too long.”</span> <span id="s1236">And one day I heard on the street that ghetto will be finished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Will be end of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1238">And they, you know, during the war my ears were very long.</span> <span id="s1239">My eyes were very wide.</span> <span id="s1240">So I heard what people were telling, and I came home, and I said to the Joe what I heard on the street.</span> <span id="s1241">And he was frightened and he said, “Oh, please, Fusia.</span> <span id="s1242">Go to the ghetto and tell Henick (ph) that he is supposed to come right away.</span> <span id="s1243">He is only one of my brothers, only one left brother.</span> <span id="s1244">And you have to bring him here.”</span> <span id="s1245">I said, “How I can bring him?</span> <span id="s1246">I cannot take him under my arms or hands and bring him here if he doesn’t like to come.”</span> <span id="s1247">And he said, “Go!”</span> <span id="s1248">And he start to cry, “Go, and bring him here.”</span> <span id="s1249">I went, and I told Henick (ph) what I heard.</span> <span id="s1250">He said, “Oh, if something will be bad, we will hear first.</span> <span id="s1251">Not on the street, but here.</span> <span id="s1252">And the Jews, they have a good spies.</span> <span id="s1253">They first know what will be.”</span> <span id="s1254">I said, “Listen, Henick (ph).</span> <span id="s1255">Ghetto will be not long.</span> <span id="s1256">If you will not come today or tomorrow, you will not come to me anymore.</span> <span id="s1257">Because you will be not in this world.</span> <span id="s1258">You will be someplace else in another world.</span> <span id="s1259">You will be killed.</span> <span id="s1260">And I will not come here anymore.</span> <span id="s1261">If you don’t like to come, stay.</span> <span id="s1262">I will not come.</span> <span id="s1263">But you will not, you will not come to me anymore, because you will be already dead.”</span> <span id="s1264">And I left.</span> <span id="s1265">Next day, in the morning, early in the morning, he was dressed a little like a young Wehrsoldat,like a little, some youngsters, German youngsters dressed.</span> <span id="s1266">Jackets, like that.</span> <span id="s1267">And he was dressed also and early in the morning with his fiancée, Danuta (ph), he came.</span> <span id="s1268">He frightened me.</span></p>

brought the bread, one or two.</span> <span id="s1288">So to bring home, sometimes neighbors ask.</span> <span id="s1289">My sister was prepared for that, because Joe taught her how to say to, to neighbors, to friends.</span> <span id="s1290">And she said -- neighbors ask, she said, "Oh, today I didn't sell nothing.</span> <span id="s1291">Maybe later I will go, I will sell something.</span> <span id="s1292">And I will make money for one bread for us."</span> <span id="s1293">Yes.</span> <span id="s1294">And you see, that was the story.</span> <span id="s1295">And maybe a week, or maybe two weeks later, I came -- I work at night at that time.</span> <span id="s1296">In the morning I came home, so my people start to -- Joe and the Zenek -- they start to ask me what I will say if two people more will come to me.</span> <span id="s1297">I said, "What you mean, what I will say?</span> <span id="s1298">There is no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s1299">No more Jews.</span> <span id="s1300">How they will come?</span> <span id="s1301">From where?</span> <span id="s1302">From the other side of the war?"</span> <span id="s1303">They said, "Well, what -- how you will behave?</span> <span id="s1304">What you will say?"</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">03:03:04 I said nothing.</span> <span id="s1306">What I can say?</span> <span id="s1307">I know they cannot come.</span> <span id="s1308">"But if…" I said, "…all right, if they will come they will stay with you.</span> <span id="s1309">That's all."</span> <span id="s1310">And they said, "You know, yesterday in the evening, when you left, came two people more.</span> <span id="s1311">One couple.</span> <span id="s1312">They were married not long ago, and they came."</span> <span id="s1313">I said, "Ok."</span> <span id="s1314">And they ca-- and they introduced me.</span> <span id="s1315">And they came and they said, "Oh, please.</span> <span id="s1316">Don't throw out us, please."</span> <span id="s1317">And still kiss my hand.</span> <span id="s1318">I said, "All right, all right.</span> <span id="s1319">I tell you, they will kill me, if they will kill us all, only once."</span> <span id="s1320">So that was 12 people already.</span> <span id="s1321">So I said, " 12 people, 12 troubles.</span> <span id="s1322">Ok.</span> <span id="s1323">Will be no more people."</span> <span id="s1324">And a few days later, the same story.</span> <span id="s1325">I came home from work, the same story.</span> <span id="s1326">"What you will say if one man will come more?"</span> <span id="s1327">I said, "What you are talking about?</span> <span id="s1328">There's no more ghetto.</span> <span id="s1329">There's no more Jews in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1330">No more Jews in this, in this city."</span> <span id="s1331">"But what you will say?"</span> <span id="s1332">I said, "The same I will say like before.</span> <span id="s1333">If will come, will stay.</span> <span id="s1334">Ok!</span> <span id="s1335">Come on in!"</span> <span id="s1336">In came, and came this man that time, this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">6 Actually “Judenfrei,” meaning “free of Jews” (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">7 Jew (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Hold it close to you and up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: And this man came at night -- not at night, before curfew he came.</span> <span id="s1341">And they introduced me.</span> <span id="s1342">And he said, "Oh, I am sorry really.</span> <span id="s1343">But I, I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s1344">I don't wanted to die.</span> <span id="s1345">So I am so young, and I don't wanted to die."</span> <span id="s1346">And I said, "Where you been all this time?"</span> <span id="s1347">And this couple and he, they had friends, Catholic friends; and they ran from the ghetto through the sewer sometime.</span> <span id="s1348">Something like that.</span> <span id="s1349">And they went to them, to this Catholic family, and they kept them three days.</span> <span id="s1350">And they said, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1351">We cannot keep you any longer, because my family will be dead and we all will be killed."</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">03:05:51 But they knew my address, these, these Jews.</span> <span id="s1353">They knew my address, so they said, "Ok, maybe we will go to this girl."</span> <span id="s1354">But what happened, this man, special, he sent this woman to me, to ask me if I will take him.</span> <span id="s1355">I tho-- I thought that again some blackmail me somehow.</span> <span id="s1356">Maybe this woman knows that I have already this twelve Jews.</span> <span id="s1357">She wanted to blackmail me, that they give her a money.</span> <span id="s1358">When she told me that one Jew sent her, and he asked me to take him.</span> <span id="s1359">So I said, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1360">I don't know who is here he.</span> <span id="s1361">I don't know any Jew, so..." And I -- and she said that I have Jews.</span> <span id="s1362">I said, "I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1363">I have no Jews.</span> <span id="s1364">And I don't like specially Jews.</span> <span id="s1365">If you wanted me to blackmail me, you will not get from me money.</span> <span id="s1366">Just if you want it you can go to Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1367">Maybe they will kill me, but money I will not give you because I have no money.</span> <span id="s1368">And I have no Jews.</span> <span id="s1369">And I will not take a Jew, because I don't know who is here he.</span> <span id="s1370">And I will not take him.</span> <span id="s1371">If you want it, you keep him.</span> <span id="s1372">If he is really Jew.</span> <span id="s1373">But if you came to blackmail me, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1374">You have to..." And I opened the letter in the bun-- bunker that time.</span> <span id="s1375">And I opened all the rooms, and the rooms were, were -- went to the, to the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">This small room I opened, I show her.</span> <span id="s1377">I said, "Look at.</span> <span id="s1378">Everything is empty.</span> <span id="s1379">I am here only with my sister.</span> <span id="s1380">You see, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1381">And nothing will happen.</span> <span id="s1382">And I will not take Jew.</span> <span id="s1383">And I don't like Jews, and I will not take this Jew what you said.</span> <span id="s1384">And I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1385">Please leave my home.</span> <span id="s1386">If you wanted to blackmail me, I will not give you money, because I have no money."</span> <span id="s1387">And she left.</span> <span id="s1388">She left.</span> <span id="s1389">But in the evening what she told this man; and he said, "Well, I will go by myself."</span> <span id="s1390">And he came in the evening.</span> <span id="s1391">When he came, I said, "Hey, you miserable!</span> <span id="s1392">You shouldn't come by yourself.</span> <span id="s1393">You so comfortable like maharajah!</span> <span id="s1394">You sent somebody else, you couldn't come -- could come by yourself."</span> <span id="s1395">I said, "You miserable!</span> <span id="s1396">I didn't -- I didn't know who is this woman.</span> <span id="s1397">You sent her to me."</span> <span id="s1398">And I was really angry.</span> <span id="s1399">And, like otherwise, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1400">I'm this, I'm that."</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">03:09:09 So -- and so I had 13 people.</span> <span id="s1402">But, you see, what, what is started when was no money anymore for the food.</span> <span id="s1403">This couple, they wanted me to sell jewelries what they had.</span> <span id="s1404">I couldn't go to sell, because I didn't know where.</span> <span id="s1405">And how I can go to sell to some, some jewelry, some, some shop to sell some earrings or, or rings, or something like that?</span> <span id="s1406">So I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1407">So they talked together, and this woman who was married who came, she said, "We will go together.</span> <span id="s1408">And I will go to her because I know her, and I will tell her everything.</span> <span id="s1409">But I will not tell her that I am here.</span> <span id="s1410">Only someplace else.</span> <span id="s1411">And she will help."</span> <span id="s1412">Really, we were went in the evening there.</span> <span id="s1413">I was waiting outside; and she went there.</span> <span id="s1414">And this woman: "Oh, good that you are alive!</span> <span id="s1415">Good that somebody helped you."</span> <span id="s1416">And she took -- I don't know what she gave her, but she took it, and she prepared the next day food.</span> <span id="s1417">And we came in the evening.</span> <span id="s1418">She brought out, and we carry home.</span> <span id="s1419">And then when German moved to my apartment, I had four German -- another story.</span> <span id="s1420">Because in my story I title, they gave me two hour to move out of my apartment to a free apartment.</span> <span id="s1421">How could I move and leave 13 people for a certain death?</span> <span id="s1422">Whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Let's back up.</span> <span id="s1424">You are now -- you have come home with this woman.</span> <span id="s1425">She has sold the jewelry.</span> <span id="s1426">You have food.</span> <span id="s1427">You are putting it in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1428">Describe the bunker.</span> <span id="s1429">Was this in the attic?</span> <span id="s1430">Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: In the attic, yes.</span> <span id="s1432">First of all, was in the attic.</span> <span id="s1433">Everything.</span> <span id="s1434">But later, they saw that it is too dangerous to be in the open attic.</span> <span id="s1435">So they, Joe, and this Zenek, who came first with him, they looked and they said that they can divide the attic.</span> <span id="s1436">And they can build false wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">03:11:48 So now was trouble.</span> <span id="s1438">They said to me, and they called me because they have to tell me everything.</span> <span id="s1439">They call me, they told -- they showed me, and they said, "That will be better, because if sometime someone can come accidentally on the attic they will find us.</span> <span id="s1440">So on it will be bunker.</span> <span id="s1441">We will sit there.</span> <span id="s1442">All day we can sit here in the open air, and if some it will be dangerous, we will go there."</span> <span id="s1443">Now how I can find the same old wall boards?</span> <span id="s1444">How I can find?</span> <span id="s1445">They asked me the old to find, because they -- the old was old.</span> <span id="s1446">And I was everyday, when I went out in the morning from the work, I was running around the streets and look.</span> <span id="s1447">Because sometimes after the bombs was falling and destroy the buildings, the people were and taking the woods for burnings.</span> <span id="s1448">Was difficult to buy some, some coal, something like that.</span> <span id="s1449">Just wood.</span> <span id="s1450">And I was running and looking for some boards.</span> <span id="s1451">But who were selling was sometimes new, was not old.</span> <span id="s1452">But Joe, every day when I came from the work, I found the big card, paper with the letters, big letters, boards -- "Buy a Boards."</span> <span id="s1453">"Buy a Boards."</span> <span id="s1454">-- old boards.</span> <span id="s1455">Sometimes we laugh, really.</span> <span id="s1456">I said, "Where I get?"</span> <span id="s1457">He said, "I don't know where.</span> <span id="s1458">But buy.</span> <span id="s1459">Look."</span> <span id="s1460">And everyday, few days I went running every morning from the work around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">And sometimes I went to the market, because over there was gathering everything.</span> <span id="s1462">And they -- and one day, had man some, some things.</span> <span id="s1463">So I asked him how much that cost, and that was some instrument to, to dig the soil, soil there.</span> <span id="s1464">And he asked me, "Well, miss, for what kind?</span> <span id="s1465">For what you needed that?"</span> <span id="s1466">"To bury Germans."</span> <span id="s1467">"If you want it to bury Germans, I will help you."</span> <span id="s1468">I said, "No, I want it to correct something."</span> <span id="s1469">And when I returned from there home, I met on the street friend of mine from work -- two men -- and they had -- they selled also from the buildings the, the boards.</span> <span id="s1470">And they took it and they sell it additional, so they make money.</span> <span id="s1471">And I, I saw, and really old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">03:15:02 And I asked, "Well," They said, "High.</span> <span id="s1473">High.</span> <span id="s1474">It’s morning."</span> <span id="s1475">And I asked, "Well, that is good board, and good wood, too, for burning."</span> <span id="s1476">I said, "How much do you want?"</span> <span id="s1477">They said, "Well, we set some price."</span> <span id="s1478">They said, "But for you, will, will be lower."</span> <span id="s1479">And they told me a price, and was not too high.</span> <span id="s1480">Was really low.</span> <span id="s1481">And I said, "Ok, I will take."</span> <span id="s1482">And was really perfect.</span> <span id="s1483">Was old, dirty, and a little black like other.</span> <span id="s1484">So -- and they brought me home.</span> <span id="s1485">This -- this things, this board old.</span> <span id="s1486">And then they wanted to bring me inside.</span> <span id="s1487">I said, "No, thank you.</span> <span id="s1488">I have to exercise my muscles, and my sister, too."</span> <span id="s1489">And I paid them, and they put in front, and I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s1490">And I took really with my sister inside, and inside they helped me.</span> <span id="s1491">And they took and they start to build a new wall to cut -- to, to divide this, this attic.</span> <span id="s1492">And they built a new false wall, and they make a bunker up there.</span> <span id="s1493">And that was -- and something was really.</span> <span id="s1494">Some friend came, or something like that, so they went to the bunker.</span> <span id="s1495">And all day, they were free.</span> <span id="s1496">It was nobody.</span> <span id="s1497">They were, they were in the room.</span> <span id="s1498">They sit all day in the room, and downstairs.</span> <span id="s1499">But if somebody came, so they run up.</span> <span id="s1500">And I said, "Remember, take everything after you.</span> <span id="s1501">Especially men things."</span> <span id="s1502">So and I called them a ghost, my ghosts.</span> <span id="s1503">I had thirteen ghosts.</span> <span id="s1504">So when I wrote my story, I didn't know to, to, to write, to title -- Thirteen Ghosts, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1505">So friend of mine, she said, "Well, I had one day thirteen ghosts.</span> <span id="s1506">But that was really ghosts.</span> <span id="s1507">But that is not the real ghosts.”</span> <span id="s1508">So I said, "Well, maybe Fight for Thirteen."</span> <span id="s1509">She said, "That will be ok, all right."</span> <span id="s1510">So title is Fight for Thirteen -- not Thirteen Ghosts.</span> <span id="s1511">But otherwise I called them ghosts.</span> <span id="s1512">They, they worked without shoes, barefoot, because not make the noise.</span> <span id="s1513">And one day, one day, I had a boyfriend and he loved me very much, and he wanted to marry me.</span> <span id="s1514">And I couldn't afford to have a boyfriend, because I didn't know if I will be alive today.</span> <span id="s1515">Or maybe tomorrow I will be dead, or something.</span> <span id="s1516">How I can have a boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">03:18:00 So to all my boys who wanted to date with me, I said, "After war.</span> <span id="s1518">After war."</span> <span id="s1519">And this boy also, he came to me too often, maybe.</span> <span id="s1520">Maybe too often; and when he came, always I had some excuses to get rid of him.</span> <span id="s1521">And I walked with him out, but not all the, all the, time my excuses worked.</span> <span id="s1522">And he start to talk about marriage, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1523">I said, "Listen, after war.</span> <span id="s1524">During the war is no, no sense."</span> <span id="s1525">But he start to bother me, really.</span> <span id="s1526">If I wouldn't have this, this 13 -- my deadly business -- I really wouldn’t hesitate, because that was a good boy and handsome boy.</span> <span id="s1527">So one day, I thought and I said -- I didn't sleep all night, and I thought what to do.</span> <span id="s1528">How to scare him?</span> <span id="s1529">Then came to me idea that friend of mine, she had a photo studio.</span> <span id="s1530">And boy's, this boy's girlfriend, before he had some girl and she had some, some German boyfriends she met later.</span> <span id="s1531">And I, and he left her because she date with Germans, this boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">And there came to me ide "Well, if I will have also German some photo, studio some photo-- photograph of Germans, maybe I will scare him, too."</span> <span id="s1533">And I ran to -- in the morning, to friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1534">And I told her, "Listen, Emilka (ph), maybe you have some photograph, some picture -- could be SS man or Gestapo, but very handsome.</span> <span id="s1535">Very handsome."</span> <span id="s1536">She looked at me, and she said, "Well, for what purpose you needed that?</span> <span id="s1537">If I know you, you not specially in love with them."</span> <span id="s1538">I said, "But with this one, I will be."</span> <span id="s1539">And I told her story.</span> <span id="s1540">She said, "Well, for this purpose I make yesterday SS picture, and he is handsome."</span> <span id="s1541">And she said, "I will make him more handsome.</span> <span id="s1542">I will take out all the ruddish (ph)...." -- like she call, all this some, some spots or something -- "And I will make you -- him handsome."</span> <span id="s1543">And I came home, and Joe had the same idea.</span> <span id="s1544">Real-- really, like, like my mind went to him, and the same idea.</span> <span id="s1545">I said, "I already was, and I order."</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">03:21:01 And you see, two days later I came to this friend of mine, and she had already framed this SS man.</span> <span id="s1547">And he was really handsome.</span> <span id="s1548">And you see we are standing together.</span> <span id="s1549">And I keep this picture, and I said to her, "You know, he is handsome."</span> <span id="s1550">She said, "Yes, he is handsome.</span> <span id="s1551">If will be no war, or before war, really that this boy is nice."</span> <span id="s1552">And we laugh a little.</span> <span id="s1553">And I said to her, "Well, if I will hang on the wall and my boy will come, I don't know his reaction."</span> <span id="s1554">And I keep this picture, and then watch, and she told -- and this, the same SS man is coming.</span> <span id="s1555">Is coming, because he came maybe picture is all ready.</span> <span id="s1556">And she said to me, "Oh, trouble came."</span> <span id="s1557">And this SS man came, and he show -- saw his picture.</span> <span id="s1558">And he looked, and he looked at me, and he said, "Oh, Fräulein, Fräulein.</span> <span id="s1559">"I have his picture.</span> <span id="s1560">And the friend of mine, she spoke very well German.</span> <span id="s1561">And she asked him that I asked her that he is very handsome, if I can have his picture.</span> <span id="s1562">And he said, "Oh, Fräulein, Namsie (ph)!</span> <span id="s1563">Namsie (ph)!"</span> <span id="s1564">And he raised me, and he lifted me up.</span> <span id="s1565">And he said, "Namsie (ph)!"</span> <span id="s1566">And he kissed me.</span> <span id="s1567">And he, and he lifted me up, and he said, "Ah, all right!</span> <span id="s1568">Namsie (ph)!"</span> <span id="s1569">And this friend of mine, she said to me, "Stefie, run away.</span> <span id="s1570">Run away!"</span> <span id="s1571">So through the teeth, she told me, “Run away.</span> <span id="s1572">And fast.”</span> <span id="s1573">And I said to him, "Danke sehr schön, sehr schön.</span> <span id="s1574">"And he said, "Ah, Fräulein, Fräulein."</span> <span id="s1575">And my friend looked at me: "Run away!</span> <span id="s1576">Run away!"</span> <span id="s1577">And I went out.</span> <span id="s1578">And I brought home this picture, and I hanged on the wall over my bed.</span> <span id="s1579">Next day, this boy of mine came.</span> <span id="s1580">And he looked, and he said, "Well, what is that?"</span> <span id="s1581">I said, "What?</span> <span id="s1582">Who is that, not what!"</span> <span id="s1583">And he said, "What he is doing here?"</span> <span id="s1584">I said, "Well, that is my new boyfriend."</span> <span id="s1585">He said, "What!</span> <span id="s1586">He and you!"</span> <span id="s1587">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1588">And he said, "I don't believe."</span> <span id="s1589">I said, "Don't.</span> <span id="s1590">But that is true.</span> <span id="s1591">I am dating with him, and I will stay with him."</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">03:24:21 And I was so little aggressive, and you know.</span> <span id="s1593">And this boy looked at that picture, then at me, and I saw that he was like a paralyze.</span> <span id="s1594">And he looked at that picture, and then at me, and he became like older man.</span> <span id="s1595">And he couldn't moved.</span> <span id="s1596">A few minutes he stood and he looked, and he wanted to open mouth.</span> <span id="s1597">He couldn't.</span> <span id="s1598">Now, you know, my heart was broken.</span> <span id="s1599">I wanted to cry, really.</span> <span id="s1600">Because I, I loved him.</span> <span id="s1601">But I repelled this thing, this my mind from him, that I cannot love.</span> <span id="s1602">But I wanted to cry.</span> <span id="s1603">I -- and was a moment that I wanted to tell him everything.</span> <span id="s1604">I wanted to tell him, "Listen, I have 13 Jews.</span> <span id="s1605">I have to save them.</span> <span id="s1606">I have to help them."</span> <span id="s1607">I wanted to tell him.</span> <span id="s1608">But, you know, but some things, some mind told me, "No, don't tell him."</span> <span id="s1609">And second was that I wanted to tell him, and the, the other second told me no, not to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">But inside, my heart, heart was broken and I wanted to cry, but I kept my tears.</span> <span id="s1611">And I, I wanted to embrace him and tell him everything, but I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1612">I couldn't.</span> <span id="s1613">I thought, "God, I 8 “Oh, young lady, young lady.”</span> <span id="s1614">(German) 9 "Thank you very much, very much."</span> <span id="s1615">(German) have to help these people.</span> <span id="s1616">If I will tell him, I don't know what his reaction will be."</span> <span id="s1617">And I didn't tell nothing.</span> <span id="s1618">And he -- then he moved, and he looked at me and he said, "You?</span> <span id="s1619">You and SS?</span> <span id="s1620">You?"</span> <span id="s1621">I said, "Yes, me and SS.</span> <span id="s1622">Me and SS man."</span> <span id="s1623">And I said, "Look how handsome he is!"</span> <span id="s1624">And he turned, and he still look at me and he went out.</span> <span id="s1625">And I watched at the window, and he walked really like old man.</span> <span id="s1626">I tell you how much I wanted to cry.</span> <span id="s1627">I wanted to run and after him and cry.</span> <span id="s1628">But I said, "No, no."</span> <span id="s1629">And he left.</span> <span id="s1630">But otherwise, he was after me, behind me.</span> <span id="s1631">He was at work.</span> <span id="s1632">I saw him far away, but he was with his friend or someone, or sometimes alone.</span> <span id="s1633">Sometimes on the street, I saw him.</span> <span id="s1634">Otherwise I saw him.</span> <span id="s1635">But he didn't talk to me.</span> <span id="s1636">I didn't talk to him.</span> <span id="s1637">Then another boy I met on the party, my friend party.</span> <span id="s1638">And the first time he met me and I met him, we danced all evening like some....</span> <span id="s1639">If you study physics, you know some things just go together; and this, this like some things just come together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">And like we came together, really; and we dance all night together and then he asked me...so came a curfew.</span> <span id="s1641">So I said, "Before curfew, I have to go back home."</span> <span id="s1642">And he wanted to bring me home.</span> <span id="s1643">I said, "No, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1644">You know I have a little sister.</span> <span id="s1645">It's not nice for me to bring men to home, something like that.</span> <span id="s1646">No time, no nice for a little girl to see."</span> <span id="s1647">OK.</span> <span id="s1648">And we make date on the Sunday.</span> <span id="s1649">We will meet on the Sunday.</span> <span id="s1650">But in the Sunday, I arranged with one man around work... factory that will bring food from village, bring him food to the store.</span> <span id="s1651">He had a little store.</span> <span id="s1652">They will bring food--things like cabbage, potatoes, kasha, all these things.</span> <span id="s1653">So in the Sunday in the afternoon, they will bring him.</span> <span id="s1654">So I told him, "Leave for me some few pounds these.</span> <span id="s1655">Few kilos this."</span> <span id="s1656">He said, "Ok.</span> <span id="s1657">Come Sunday.</span> <span id="s1658">I will leave for you."</span> <span id="s1659">So I ...Sunday, I was running to this shop and I saw this boy was waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1660">But I couldn't go to him, because I had to first to buy food.</span> <span id="s1661">And he was so handsome, really.</span> <span id="s1662">But I ran there to the shop; and exactly came this religious people and this was, this man was alone in his shop.</span> <span id="s1663">So I help him to, to weigh these...these potatoes and the cabbage, and to bring inside and everything.</span> <span id="s1664">And for that, he gave me gave me a few kilos something for nothing.</span> <span id="s1665">So...so I had maybe 50 kilo--I had a little potatoes, maybe ten kilo potatoes, and three kilos kasha and some cabbage, some other things, some piece of cheese he give me without nothing.</span> <span id="s1666">Piece of butter, he gave me without nothing.</span> <span id="s1667">He said, "Oh, you so pretty, you have to have this little nourishment."</span> <span id="s1668">Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">03:30:18</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: Tell me about the Germans.</span> <span id="s1671">You brought, you brought the food home.</span> <span id="s1672">Where did you store it first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Well, mostly they kept in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1674">Q: Ok.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: They kept.</span> <span id="s1676">A little I kept in, in my -- in the kitchen, but mostly they kept.</span> <span id="s1677">All bread and butter.</span> <span id="s1678">Only a little I had in my kitchen, and rest they kept there in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1679">Also potatoes.</span> <span id="s1680">I couldn't have too much.</span> <span id="s1681">Just a little, for two girls, just a little.</span> <span id="s1682">So they kept there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Tell me how Germans came to live in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Well, across my apartment that was -- before that was a school.</span> <span id="s1685">Like a college, big building.</span> <span id="s1686">But that time, we don't -- we didn't know that Russia came closer and they repelled German from this moving and they fight with Germany.</span> <span id="s1687">And German were a little repelled.</span> <span id="s1688">And they have to have a hospital for a military people, for soldiers -- wounded soldiers.</span> <span id="s1689">So they looked for a some big building.</span> <span id="s1690">And they found exactly this building -- college across, big building.</span> <span id="s1691">And they took it for a hospital, and they make their hospital exactly from my, from across my building.</span> <span id="s1692">So they make up a hospital over there, and they went -- walked around neighbors and around street, they looked for apartment for their personnel, hospital personnel.</span> <span id="s1693">Like nurses, doctors.</span> <span id="s1694">Some they lived there, inside; but was not so much place so they look around.</span> <span id="s1695">And they took here one room, there one room.</span> <span id="s1696">And they came to me, two SS men and they looked around and they saw two girls, two rooms -- big two rooms and the kitchen.</span> <span id="s1697">They said, "You not need it so much.</span> <span id="s1698">Two girls, they not need it so big apartment."</span> <span id="s1699">And these two SS men told to me, they gave me order just two hours to move out of my apartment and to leave for them empty apartment.</span> <span id="s1700">They will come in two hours.</span> <span id="s1701">If I will be still here, they will kill me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">03:33:00 They have to have this apartment.</span> <span id="s1703">That is big apartment.</span> <span id="s1704">They have to have it, this apartment.</span> <span id="s1705">Two hours.</span> <span id="s1706">So you see, I went out and I looked for apartment, and I still went to this street where was before lived Jews.</span> <span id="s1707">I was still running up and down, up and down.</span> <span id="s1708">Was no available apartment that I can take it.</span> <span id="s1709">Was nothing.</span> <span id="s1710">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1711">Doors, windows, kitchen -- nothing.</span> <span id="s1712">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1713">Just ruined, nothing more.</span> <span id="s1714">Past two, one and a half hours.</span> <span id="s1715">So I came home.</span> <span id="s1716">I start to cry.</span> <span id="s1717">I said, "How I can leave 13 people for a certain death?</span> <span id="s1718">I can run out, but these people will be dead.</span> <span id="s1719">And I have no apartment."</span> <span id="s1720">So they advised me to go for another -- some street.</span> <span id="s1721">There look for apartment.</span> <span id="s1722">For sure I will find something.</span> <span id="s1723">I ran there.</span> <span id="s1724">Was nothing available, nothing.</span> <span id="s1725">Was 20 only minutes.</span> <span id="s1726">I came home.</span> <span id="s1727">I said, "Nothing."</span> <span id="s1728">You see, all my 13 came down; and these three children, they pressed all to me.</span> <span id="s1729">And they that was so tight to me, and all 13, they looked at me.</span> <span id="s1730">My decision.</span> <span id="s1731">Will I leave?</span> <span id="s1732">My decision.</span> <span id="s1733">Will I leave them or no?</span> <span id="s1734">And -- [Technical problem] I have to keep my hand, but I am a little too nervous.</span> <span id="s1735">I am not here.</span> <span id="s1736">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Ok, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: And you see, all 13, they said to me, and Joe and these older people, and they all said to me, and this Zenek, "Run away!</span> <span id="s1739">You not have to die with us.</span> <span id="s1740">We have to.</span> <span id="s1741">But you don't have to die with us.</span> <span id="s1742">You cannot help us anymore.</span> <span id="s1743">Save your life and your little sister.</span> <span id="s1744">And run away, because still you have time, 10 minutes."</span> <span id="s1745">And they said -- and Zenek and Joe, they pushed me.</span> <span id="s1746">They said, "Run away!</span> <span id="s1747">Don't die with us.</span> <span id="s1748">You cannot help us anymore.</span> <span id="s1749">What you could, you helped us.</span> <span id="s1750">But not now.</span> <span id="s1751">Save your life and Helena.</span> <span id="s1752">Go.</span> <span id="s1753">Run away."</span> <span id="s1754">And these all people watched me, and the children were so pressed to me that I heard their breathing.</span> <span id="s1755">And my sister watched me.</span> <span id="s1756">And so I really, you see, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1757">I said to them, "Well, first of all, come on.</span> <span id="s1758">We will pray.</span> <span id="s1759">We will ask God."</span> <span id="s1760">03:36:55 And you see, I had a picture when I bought when I was a little girl -- Jesus and his mother picture.</span> <span id="s1761">And I bought it.</span> <span id="s1762">And always hanged on my wall.</span> <span id="s1763">And I said, "Come on.</span> <span id="s1764">We will pray.</span> <span id="s1765">We will ask God."</span> <span id="s1766">And first I knelt, my sister and all the 13 after me, behind me.</span> <span id="s1767">And I prayed, and I turned.</span> <span id="s1768">All 13 were in deep, deep prayer.</span> <span id="s1769">And I asked God not to let us killed.</span> <span id="s1770">Help somehow.</span> <span id="s1771">I cannot leave this apartment.</span> <span id="s1772">I cannot leave 13 people for a certain death.</span> <span id="s1773">I will be alive if I will go out, but 13 people, 13 lives will be bad, will be killed.</span> <span id="s1774">That is the children also.</span> <span id="s1775">And young people.</span> <span id="s1776">I asked God, "Help, somehow."</span> <span id="s1777">Again I heard a voice, woman voice.</span> <span id="s1778">Was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s1779">Was so nice.</span> <span id="s1780">Was so quiet.</span> <span id="s1781">She said to me, "Don't worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Will be everything all right.</span> <span id="s1783">You will not leave your apartment.</span> <span id="s1784">You will stay here, and they will take only one room.</span> <span id="s1785">And will be everything all right.</span> <span id="s1786">I am with you."</span> <span id="s1787">And she talked to me.</span> <span id="s1788">"Be quiet."</span> <span id="s1789">And she advised me what to do.</span> <span id="s1790">She said, "Send your people to the bunker.</span> <span id="s1791">Open the door.</span> <span id="s1792">Open the windows.</span> <span id="s1793">Clean your apartment, and sing."</span> <span id="s1794">You see, I had my hands like that in prayer.</span> <span id="s1795">When I heard this voice.</span> <span id="s1796">I was like hypnotized.</span> <span id="s1797">My hands was bent down, and I was listening, listening.</span> <span id="s1798">And then voice said, "Will be all right."</span> <span id="s1799">And disappeared.</span> <span id="s1800">And after few minutes, I listened.</span> <span id="s1801">Was nothing more.</span> <span id="s1802">And I got up.</span> <span id="s1803">And I said to my people, "Go to the bunker."</span> <span id="s1804">Exactly like the lady told me.</span> <span id="s1805">And I said, "I will not move from my apartment.</span> <span id="s1806">I will stay here.</span> <span id="s1807">And go to the bunker, and be quiet very quiet."</span> <span id="s1808">And you see, and I was completely like different people.</span> <span id="s1809">And they looked at me.</span> <span id="s1810">They thought -- all my 13 -- they thought that my mind, there's something wrong with my mind.</span> <span id="s1811">And I said, "Ok, go out -- go in the bunker.</span> <span id="s1812">Will be everything all right.</span> <span id="s1813">And stay quiet over there."</span> <span id="s1814">And I opened the window and the doors, and I clean.</span> <span id="s1815">I start to sing.</span> <span id="s1816">I don't know how I became so happy.</span> <span id="s1817">And the all neighbors came.</span> <span id="s1818">And they said, "Miss Podgórska, what happened?</span> <span id="s1819">Why you not moved?</span> <span id="s1820">Gestapo, SS will come.</span> <span id="s1821">They will kill you.</span> <span id="s1822">That is the war.</span> <span id="s1823">That is the, the military.</span> <span id="s1824">That is the, the -- they said they have no mercy for an for an enemy.</span> <span id="s1825">They are our enemy.</span> <span id="s1826">Go out.</span> <span id="s1827">We don't like to see you to killed.</span> <span id="s1828">You're too nice, too young to be dead."</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">03:40:32 I said, "I have no place to go.</span> <span id="s1830">If SS man wanted to kill me, they can kill me.</span> <span id="s1831">I will not leave my apartment.</span> <span id="s1832">I have no place to go."</span> <span id="s1833">They said, "You can go to your friend's.</span> <span id="s1834">You know, your friend.</span> <span id="s1835">She has two rooms.</span> <span id="s1836">You can stay there."</span> <span id="s1837">I said, "No, I will not go from my apartment."</span> <span id="s1838">And they thought also something wrong, and came janitor's husband.</span> <span id="s1839">And he said, "Miss Podgórska, I will throw you out.</span> <span id="s1840">Go out.</span> <span id="s1841">I don't like to see you to be killed.</span> <span id="s1842">I have no place to bury you."</span> <span id="s1843">And serious -- he was serious.</span> <span id="s1844">He said, "That is, that is enemy.</span> <span id="s1845">That is, you know, that is Gestapo and SS, that is the same.</span> <span id="s1846">And that is wartime.</span> <span id="s1847">Nobody has for nobody mercy."</span> <span id="s1848">I said, "No, I am sorry.</span> <span id="s1849">I will not move from my apartment."</span> <span id="s1850">And he said, "Something is wrong," you see, and he left.</span> <span id="s1851">He left, and I am singing and cleaning my apartment.</span> <span id="s1852">And past exactly two hours, this 10 minutes, is coming only one SS man.</span> <span id="s1853">And he was so friendly.</span> <span id="s1854">He was laughing to me from a few yards.</span> <span id="s1855">And he came closer to the window.</span> <span id="s1856">And he said, he spoke a little Polish.</span> <span id="s1857">Very broken, but he spoke.</span> <span id="s1858">And he said good that I didn't moved from my apartment, because they will take only one room.</span> <span id="s1859">This last room they will take.</span> <span id="s1860">And he said, "Very well, you can stay.</span> <span id="s1861">It is good that you were not moving."</span> <span id="s1862">So ok.</span> <span id="s1863">And he looked, and he laughed.</span> <span id="s1864">And you know, he saw letter was on the table from my mother, and my mother was in Germany in the Salzburg, and he saw this letter.</span> <span id="s1865">This letter and the address and the Salzburg, and he said, "Oh, who, who you are in the Salzburg?"</span> <span id="s1866">I said, "Whom?</span> <span id="s1867">My mother.</span> <span id="s1868">You took my mother to the Germany, and my brother."</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">03:43:00 He said, "Oh, your mother is in the Salzburg!"</span> <span id="s1870">And he looked, and he said, "Oh, I know this address.</span> <span id="s1871">And that is my friend's, and I will go there next month.</span> <span id="s1872">Can I give the best regards to, to your mother?"</span> <span id="s1873">I said, "Ok."</span> <span id="s1874">What I can say?</span> <span id="s1875">And he said, "Ok.</span> <span id="s1876">I will go next month.</span> <span id="s1877">I will be on my vacation.</span> <span id="s1878">I will be back two or three weeks after that."</span> <span id="s1879">He said, "And I will come back, and I will tell what your mother are you're doing there.</span> <span id="s1880">And I will bring regards from your mother.</span> <span id="s1881">And I will see your mother."</span> <span id="s1882">And he talked.</span> <span id="s1883">He was so friendly.</span> <span id="s1884">And he said that he has also two sisters about my age and younger, and he said sometimes he would like to go.</span> <span id="s1885">He missed family and sisters.</span> <span id="s1886">They sometimes fight, but what is family?</span> <span id="s1887">And he left.</span> <span id="s1888">And maybe ten minutes later, came two sisters from this hospital with luggage.</span> <span id="s1889">And this -- and he came with them.</span> <span id="s1890">And I opened the door, of course, and he took this one last room.</span> <span id="s1891">And bunker was exactly over they’s room.</span> <span id="s1892">And every night, they had two boyfriends there.</span> <span id="s1893">Soldiers, German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1894">And they slept with them.</span> <span id="s1895">And every night, these two boyfriends -- these, these soldiers -- came to them every evening with their rifles, you know, when I saw old rifles and soldiers.</span> <span id="s1896">I thought, "Oh, maybe they will kill me today."</span> <span id="s1897">And they slept with them.</span> <span id="s1898">In the morning, they left.</span> <span id="s1899">And sometimes I think they suspect, because they probably heard the noise over their head.</span> <span id="s1900">And they maybe suspect that maybe something is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Because one day came, I came from work, and came these two German and also one SS man.</span> <span id="s1902">And the -- these two sisters came also from the hospital.</span> <span id="s1903">And one sister caught me, and she started to talk, ask something.</span> <span id="s1904">And the soldiers, too.</span> <span id="s1905">And one sister went -- one woman went to the, to this, this room where it was exit to the attic.</span> <span id="s1906">But Joe, and these people -- when they saw that Germans came to my home again and the sisters came from the hospital and they all came -- he said, in the last moment, "Go to the bunker."</span> <span id="s1907">And he closed the door, and he said, "Be quiet, because we never know.</span> <span id="s1908">Maybe they suspect sometime -- something."</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">03:46:08 And when this sister and these soldiers kept me busy and I wanted -- because I saw she is running there, and to the -- to the other room, to the, to the exit to the attic.</span> <span id="s1910">I wanted to run after her, and they caught me.</span> <span id="s1911">They, they hold me.</span> <span id="s1912">They didn't let me go after her.</span> <span id="s1913">And she went there, and lift the ladder up and she went on the attic and she looked around.</span> <span id="s1914">But you see, before, when they built this, this wall, I put there old things, old, some junks.</span> <span id="s1915">Old, that if somebody will come, will see that I have storage there.</span> <span id="s1916">Old some dresses, some, some, some junk, all old.</span> <span id="s1917">And she looked around carefully, this side and this side.</span> <span id="s1918">And she saw nothing.</span> <span id="s1919">Just storage things -- dirty, and old.</span> <span id="s1920">And she came out and probably she gave them a sign, and they let me go and they left.</span> <span id="s1921">But I tell you, this moment I knew that -- I thought that she will see them.</span> <span id="s1922">Because I didn't told them, "Go."</span> <span id="s1923">And over, I think over eight months, every day, every night, I had at home four Germans and 13 Jews over their head upstairs.</span> <span id="s1924">Do you know, can you imagine my feeling?</span> <span id="s1925">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1926">If you will not through, be not through by this things, this horrible time, you will not imagine my feeling.</span> <span id="s1927">When I went, came from factory sometimes, I walked in the morning -- after seven o'clock, after work.</span> <span id="s1928">Otherwise I ask God, "Dear God, what I will see at home?</span> <span id="s1929">Maybe all, they already killed.</span> <span id="s1930">Maybe they are waiting for me to be, to kill me.</span> <span id="s1931">Maybe something."</span> <span id="s1932">Oh, I tell you.</span> <span id="s1933">… But one day, when I returned from work afternoon, this same SS man who gave -- I took the picture, with his friend he waited close to the factory, and he called me.</span> <span id="s1934">And he call -- he knew that my name is Stefie, but in the German they don't pronounce it clearly.</span> <span id="s1935">Shtefie (ph) -- they add "s," and they and they pronounce "Shtefie (ph)."</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">03:49:02 And they call me, "Shtefie!</span> <span

farther."</span> <span id="s1945">And you know, I am going in his direction, and I still ask God.</span> <span id="s1946">Oh, probably he ran away from my wall.</span> <span id="s1947">And some, you know, my imagination were -- was running.</span> <span id="s1948">I imagine everything.</span> <span id="s1949">I thought, "Well, maybe from the picture he saw my 13 Jews, and maybe he already killed them.</span> <span id="s1950">And he came here and now he is calling me.</span> <span id="s1951">He will kill me.</span> <span id="s1952">Oh, probably Helena is killed and all 13 are killed.</span> <span id="s1953">Now he will kill me."</span> <span id="s1954">And I said, "Oh, dear God, don't, don't let kill me."</span> <span id="s1955">Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1956">You see, but all my mind was working.</span> <span id="s1957">And I came closer, and this -- he said, that is his friend and he embraced me, and they talked together.</span> <span id="s1958">And then this, this SS man whom I had his picture, he said in Polish -- they argued between themselves something, I don't know what, but he -- the SS man -- he said to me so much broken Polish that I should run away quickly, fast.</span> <span id="s1959">Run away, run away.</span> <span id="s1960">And I in a minute, I said, "All right, all right.</span> <span id="s1961">Gute Nacht.</span> <span id="s1962">Gute Nacht, auf Wiedersehen.</span> <span id="s1963">"And when I came to friend of mine, and she heard what they are were talking.</span> <span id="s1964">This other SS man, he told him to take me to their room for a night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">And he said, this other, he said "No, she is too young.</span> <span id="s1966">And she is nice girl, and young.</span> <span id="s1967">Why we have to kill her in the morning to throw her out?"</span> <span id="s1968">He said, "The war.</span> <span id="s1969">She is our, our enemy."</span> <span id="s1970">And he said, "We are her enemy."</span> <span id="s1971">And they argued together between themselves.</span> <span id="s1972">And this, this other, his friend, he wanted to take me for the night.</span> <span id="s1973">And this said, "No."</span> <span id="s1974">And because he told me run away.</span> <span id="s1975">And I ran -- and this, and you see, he, he somehow he saved my life.</span> <span id="s1976">I said, "God help-- helped me, protect me to save my life that I will save, save other lives.</span> <span id="s1977">And you see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: That's almost an ending for the tape.</span> <span

<span id="s1990">And in the morning we didn't know who won.</span> <span id="s1991">German or Russia?</span> <span id="s1992">So they stood all at the window, and I stood with them.</span> <span id="s1993">Who win we’ll, we’ll see to first, German or Russia?</span> <span id="s1994">Well, first of all we saw German.</span> <span id="s1995">I said, "Back to the, to the bunker!</span> <span
