We’re here today in Coral Springs, Florida with Mr. Saul Rosenheck.</span> <span id="s12">He’s going to be telling us his story.</span> <span id="s13">Mr. Rosenheck, would you mind spelling out your name for us, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: Okay, my name [indecipherable] Yeah.</span> <span id="s15">My name is Sholom Rosenheck.</span> <span id="s16">I’m going to spell it for you.</span> <span id="s17">Rosenheck is r-o-s-e-n-h-e-c-k.</span> <span id="s18">Sholom, s-h-o-l-o-m.</span> <span id="s19">I was born in Czechoslovakia in a small Jewish town called Mukachevo.</span> <span id="s20">Life was pretty decent in – for the Jewish people under the Czechoslovakian – under Czechoslovakian government, but this didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s21">Great Britain betrayed Czechoslovakia and sold them down the drain to appease Hitler.</span> <span id="s22">Czechoslovakia was then occupied three-quarters by Germany and the rest by the Ukraines.</span> <span id="s23">The Ukraine government that time planned to annihilate all the Jewish people because they – th-the – thanks God they didn’t – they didn’t last too long because Hungary came in and occupied them.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: But –</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: But they found documents that they were ready to kill all the Jewish people from – from A til Z, to annihilate them, all of them.</span> <span id="s26">So that was another miracle that time that the Hungarians came in and what they wanted to do to the Jewish people, it happened to them, because they shot them wherever they found them, the Hungarians, they killed them merciless, you know, wherev – but they deserved it too, because they wanted to do something else.</span> <span id="s27">You know how the saying, you dig a hole for somebody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: You could fall in th – yourself, so that’s what ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So did – did Ukraine come in before Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Yes, bu –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Okay, when did Ukraine come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: What year was that?</span> <span id="s34">Around 19 – I think 30 – ‘39, something like ‘39, ‘38.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Were they still under Soviet control at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: The uk – Ukraine?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Ukraine was – was – this was a separate Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: There was the real Ukraine occupied by the Soviets –</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: – from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s43">This, this was the carpa – in the Carpathians, they occupied that time the Carpathians.</span> <span id="s44">So, when they had the power they thought they gonna get away, they gonna stay forever there, so they wanted to make it, like the Germans said, Judenrein, free of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: In order to make free of Jews they had to kill all the – all the people, but then it happened to them, because Hungary claimed that this – this territory belonged to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Now, over there you had every day at – e-every day, I wouldn’t say every day, but very often new governments.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: First was Czechoslovakian, then was Ukraine, then was Hungarian, Germany, all of them, you know.</span> <span id="s51">So when I went to school, I had to learn all those languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: You learned one language, and this – a couple of months later you had to start another language, but that’s was the name of the game in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Do you still remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Oh, I sure do remember them.</span> <span id="s56">I – sure, you can’t forget, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Good.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: – I was a kid there, you know.</span> <span id="s59">I remember what happened to me by – when I was three years old, I could remember all the w-way back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Oh, what happened?</span> <span id="s61">A: No, nothing happened –</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Oh, was that when you started learning?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: – just as a child –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yeah, yeah, I knew that, you know, what was going on the – and I could remember the days, you know, when I went – started to school, and how I was treated in school, and all kind of things, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: What language did you speak at home, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: At home?</span> <span id="s68">Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Hebrew, or Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, no, Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Yiddish, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Because yi – Jewish and Hebrew is two different languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Jewish is [indecipherable] from German.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: It comes from Germany, the – the language of that time.</span> <span id="s79">But, this with the Hungarian, in the beginning they – they were very nice to the j – especially to the Jewish people and everything, but it didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s80">Finally Hungarian made a pact with Germany, and Germany wanted all the Jews out.</span> <span id="s81">So the honeymoon ended that time when Germany and ho – Horthy – Horthy Miklós was the – like the president here, he was that time th-the – he was the – li-like the – the president –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: – of Hungarian.</span> <span id="s84">His name was Horthy Miklós.</span> <span id="s85">He was very friendly to the Jewish people, but he didn’t have no choice because there was a lot of Hungarians, they – they were also sympathizers with the – with the Nazis, with the – with the Germans.</span> <span id="s86">So he didn’t have no choice and he had to do what they – they told him to do, but the reality, he didn’t have no power, had no – nothing to say there.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: In that time when – when they made a pact with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Could we maybe go back a little bit and just talk about your childhood and your parents?</span> <span id="s90">Any anti-Semitism you experienced, maybe going to school, what that was like for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, in the school – I was born in Munkacs and I went in the first and second – second grade, I went in Munkacs.</span> <span id="s92">Then we moved to Kwassie(ph).</span> <span id="s93">Kwassie(ph) is in the Carpathian mountains.</span> <span id="s94">And the – it all depends what kind of teacher you had.</span> <span id="s95">If you had a nice teacher, they were very nice, and some of them were special.</span> <span id="s96">I had the Ukraine teacher by the name of Kohut(ph).</span> <span id="s97">He was unbelievable, he hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s98">Every time – he was a substitute teacher [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s99">So my teacher, she was a Hungarian teacher.</span> <span id="s100">And she was very nice, absolutely, she handled the people, not only Jewish people, she handled the people because there was Ukraine kids, Ru-Russian kids, you know, Hungarian speaking kids, she handled everybody one way tha – with love, I could say.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: And this was in public school?</span> <span id="s102">A: This is public school, right.</span> <span id="s103">Now, this teacher, when he came in, he – w-we had to stand in two lines and we had to go over to him and he – we had to show – put my hand on his hands, and he checked if you have dir – cut nails or dirty nails.</span> <span id="s104">So when I came he looked at my ne – of my nails, and my nail were a hundred percent clean.</span> <span id="s105">But his – his – his hands were this – this thick black, he was a drunk.</span> <span id="s106">So he says, okay next.</span> <span id="s107">Ge – next dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s108">He called us dirty Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: And you weren’t even dirty.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: In front of everybody.</span> <span id="s111">I cou – you couldn’t say anything because in those days you couldn’t start up with teachers, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: So it was a very mixed classroom, though, between Jews and maybe Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: No, they were – we went to one class.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: This wasn’t only – it was a couple of Jews there, we were the minority there, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s117">Was is mostly Christians, or – okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yeah, mostly Christians, right.</span> <span id="s119">And – and-and couple of – and Jewish kids mixed in.</span> <span id="s120">We never had any problem with the – in the school, but all depends on with these teachers.</span> <span id="s121">Or sometimes – I’ll tell you another story.</span> <span id="s122">When I was already in a higher grade, that was already when I was in – in the fifth grade, I think.</span> <span id="s123">So I had a – a – a teacher by the name of Skoba(ph) Laslo(ph), a very nice man.</span> <span id="s124">So, wh-when you were old, I think by t – 11 – 11 or 10 years old you had to, like here – like the – the Germans had the Hitlerjugend, the – the kids when they had – they – they trained them for – for army and things, and singing and marching.</span> <span id="s125">The Jewish people – the Jewish kids, they took us and we had to clean the toilets, we had to do all those low class things.</span> <span id="s126">And instead of they – they had the make believe gun, they give us shovel, so – but wh-who cared, you know, as long – we did what we had to do and you cou – we didn’t have no choice.</span> <span id="s127">So one day my teacher told me I should do something for him, I had to go to the post office or something.</span> <span id="s128">He says, okay, this – for this, because you took care what I told you, you don’t have to go four times to the – they call it the leventher(ph).</span> <span id="s129">So I said thank you very much, and I was off, because every week, once a week you had to go there, to the thing.</span> <span id="s130">So when they see that I was missing, they came, two guys, grown up, they were maybe 18 years old already, but with guns, you know, how come you didn’t go to the – how come you didn’t come to the leven – I says, I have off for four weeks.</span> <span id="s131">He was the main guy, this Skoba(ph), teacher, he was the main guy from the leventher(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: So I said, Skoba(ph) gave me off four weeks.</span> <span id="s134">We don’t care, he says, we have an order, you have to come.</span> <span id="s135">And my mother wasn’t home, so I – they have to come, I went with them.</span> <span id="s136">And was snowing that if I – he was sitting as far from me, you couldn’t see my face, that’s how strong it was snowing, it was wintertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Just a few feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s139">So he s – and I came over there.</span> <span id="s140">The other one was a – the – a ver – also a big Jew hater, was named Cossack, like the Cossacks, you know?</span> <span id="s141">Was also Ukraine guy.</span> <span id="s142">He was the number two man, but Skoba(ph) was the higher – higher man.</span> <span id="s143">So he says – first of all he gave me a shovel, and I have to hold on with the shovel like this, and standing like this, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Up in the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">So, I was standing there.</span> <span id="s147">From far away I see somebody’s coming with a bicycle, because you couldn’t see, because it was so heavy the snow.</span> <span id="s148">When you come closer ca – I says, this must be Skoba(ph).</span> <span id="s149">He came close to – closer and closer, he says, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s150">Didn’t I gave you off four weeks?</span> <span id="s151">So I told him.</span> <span id="s152">He says, throw down the shovel, you go home.</span> <span id="s153">I’ll take care on the rest, right.</span> <span id="s154">And he had the big fight with them, and he says, when I tell – when I gave him off, that means he is off.</span> <span id="s155">You have no right.</span> <span id="s156">Next time he behaved.</span> <span id="s157">He put him in his place, cause he was the head guy.</span> <span id="s158">So as I said, there was some of them very nice, and some of them, you know, Nazi sympathizers.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: They were the worst.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: So you had a very mixed bag of experiences like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: That – that – that’s – that is correct.</span> <span id="s163">And that – even the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s164">The worst, they were e – th-those – they called themselves the [indecipherable] that they wanted to – to become for Germany one, you know, they were the worst.</span> <span id="s165">Like, Ukraines, Lithuanians – Ukraines, Lithuanians and Romanians, they were the worst.</span> <span id="s166">They did killings like – like you step on a cockroach, that’s what they used to do.</span> <span id="s167">But you gonna hear the stories later on, when I was in the concentration camp, what had happened and what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yes, I had two – two more bro – we were three kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Two more brothers, young – each year – I was born 1929 - 1930 and ‘31.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Each year.</span> <span id="s174">There was one – one ahead – before me, but didn’t make it, so – you know, in those days it wasn’t advanced, the medicines like today, you know, especially in America.</span> <span id="s175">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: We’re going to pause for just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s178">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: [indecipherable] Okay, we’re back with Mr. Rosenheck.</span> <span id="s180">Mr. Rosenheck, could you maybe tell me a little bit about your parents, like what they did, what life was like for them, and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s182">My mother and father – my mother was born in 1901, and my father was born in 1901, in same – in same thing.</span> <span id="s183">My father lived in – in Kwassie(ph), the – and my mother comes from Munkacs.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: It’s about a hund – hundred kilomet – kilometers in distance.</span> <span id="s186">So my mother always want to become a doctor, and in those days she went in university and she wanted to become a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: That’s impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: But something happened.</span> <span id="s189">They had a big business, and it was selling materials for ladies, for mans [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Your mother’s family had the business?</span> <span id="s191">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: My mother’s family.</span> <span id="s194">So, my grandfather in those days, cut his toenails, and cut maybe a little bit too deep, and got an infection.</span> <span id="s195">Now today you give a shot of penicillin, or anything, and it’s taken care.</span> <span id="s196">In those days, didn't have no penicillin nor antibiotics.</span> <span id="s197">And my grandmother used to s-scream at him, why don’t you go to the – see the doctor?</span> <span id="s198">Oh, this – you know, he was a big guy, strong guy.</span> <span id="s199">Oh, I don’t need it, don’t worry about it, nothing’s going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s200">Well, it did happen.</span> <span id="s201">Finally gangrene went in and they had to amputate his leg, and not l – after that, a couple of – a very short time he died, he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: So now, my mother made already three – in those days you had to go four years to university to become a doctor, she had already thre – three years finished, so – and my grandma didn’t know how to read, how to write, and she took over the business, and they ha – they had 14 children, but most of them were already married, and a couple of them were still home.</span> <span id="s204">So, my – my grandma, she didn’t know how to order, she didn’t know how to do things.</span> <span id="s205">She knew how to sell, but she didn’t help out in the business either because she – she did the cooking.</span> <span id="s206">And my grandfather had somebody who helped him out, and that’s all, they managed very good.</span> <span id="s207">So wh-when it came to a point that sh – th-they – she couldn’t pay the bills, because didn’t have – they wouldn’t give her no more st – materials to sell, because she couldn’t pay.</span> <span id="s208">So it came to a point that she turned to my mother and says, listen – my mother’s name was René – listen, René, you have to stop schooling.</span> <span id="s209">You have to take over the business, because you know me, I didn’t go to school, I don’t know how to handle a business.</span> <span id="s210">And because if you’re not going to take over we all gonna die.</span> <span id="s211">Because in those days there was no welfare.</span> <span id="s212">If you had the money you ate, if you didn’t have the money to eat, you didn’t eat, unless somebody maybe helped you out once in awhile, but they couldn’t do it every day because a lot of them didn’t have money also, to help you out.</span> <span id="s213">So in that time my mother – my – [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Let me pause once more.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s216">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: All right, we’re back.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: So anyway, my mother took it over, and as soon as the salesman heard that my mother took over the store, they all c-came to run, you know, Mrs. René, just, if you need something, we are all here to help you and don’t worry about it, and they knew that my mother is – knows how to do things that – they knew it.</span> <span id="s221">So my mother took over, and my aunt, the youngest sister, she was in Israel and I went to see her, so she told me the story.</span> <span id="s222">She said that my mother built up in a – in a couple of months, she made so much money that they couldn’t close the drawer, because in tho – in those days they didn’t have registers, you know.</span> <span id="s223">Everything was in a big drawer and you just laid down nicely the – each denomination, you know, separately.</span> <span id="s224">And th-the first thing she did, she paid off all the – whatever my grandma lost, paid everything, paid them back and she made a lot of money, in those days.</span> <span id="s225">So that was my mother.</span> <span id="s226">My father, my father was in Kwassie(ph).</span> <span id="s227">My – my father’s mother, they owned the mineral bathe – bathe, you know, there was a lot of minerals there, and all over from Europe used to come to bathe there, especially in the summertime, y-you couldn’t find a room, e-even the stables were rented.</span> <span id="s228">That’s how many people used to come in in the summertime.</span> <span id="s229">In the wintertime was a – a ski resort.</span> <span id="s230">So, that’s more or less my – about my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s232">How did they meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: That, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: I wasn’t around at that time, but anyway, I really don’t know because you see, in those – in those days used to be matchmakers.</span> <span id="s236">So let’s say they knew your parents, they went over there, say oh, I have a very nice little daughter or something, ye – you have a nice boy, and you know, they used to go around and – and match up people, and they used to get paid for that.</span> <span id="s237">That was their business, they called themself matchmakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: You heard about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yeah [indecipherable] the same thing here.</span> <span id="s242">So exactly how and what I cannot tell you because I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: So your father moved to Mukachevo?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: No, no, my mother moved t-to –</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: – because when she got – in those days you also had – you got – a – a girl used to get dowries.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: So, sh – they got a big dowry and they settled down there in the – in – in Kwassie(ph), in the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: So my father, his main business used to be – they used to buy, let’s say in the mountain, there’s – were a lot of wood there, so used to buy, let’s say, a whole – and a couple of acres of land, and whatever th – woods were on that land, they used to cut them off in th – in the wint – in the summertime.</span> <span id="s251">In the wintertime they used to bring them down with sleds, all the way to the station, and he used to deliver all over t – all over Europe he used to sell those things.</span> <span id="s252">So he was in the – in the wood business, in wholesale wood business.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So is that still when you were alive?</span> <span id="s254">Like, did you see –</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Yes, I was – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Was he gone a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Y-Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s258">But then, what happened – now I’m gonna comment and – and go on what had happened.</span> <span id="s259">See, in those days they took all – one day my father delivered already all the wood to the station and they were ready to deliver, put in the wagons.</span> <span id="s260">Suddenly it came that they called him in as a – what do you call that?</span> <span id="s261">Enforced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: In other words, he wasn’t as a soldier, they – let’s say, they were a Jewish battalion.</span> <span id="s264">They used to send them to th – to the front to pick mines or things like that.</span> <span id="s265">They didn’t train them how to do – pick mines, and if you did the wrong thing, i-it – it blew up and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s266">So a lot of Jewish people got killed that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What year do you think they first called them into forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Do you know about what year they called them into forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: What year?</span> <span id="s271">It was 1942 - ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: So – a-and that’s what happened – what – what happened, the big thing that when they called them in, all the wood was there, and nobody e – e – my mother didn’t know exactly wha – where to – you know, it came so suddenly –</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: – because over there they didn’t ask no questions.</span> <span id="s276">When you got that – that ticket to go – to go into the army or whatever, the labe – forced labor, you just to right away, give a no – couple of hours and you had to go.</span> <span id="s277">But anyway, in that time it was also Poland.</span> <span id="s278">Germany tried to occupy Poland, but there was a big fight between – in Germany and Poland.</span> <span id="s279">So all the military went through our – our town.</span> <span id="s280">And whatever they seen, they seen wood, you know, wood was a big commodity, you know, because everybody need wood to cook, and t – so they seen ready made wood, ready made, cut, everything, just to put it in the oven, they took – cleaned out the whole – the – all the wood was – even the Germans went through the town, Polacks went through the town.</span> <span id="s281">The Hungarian army went there.</span> <span id="s282">Everybody grabbed whatever they could.</span> <span id="s283">If they seen, they didn’t ask no question.</span> <span id="s284">If you had a cow someplace in the pasture, they just grabbed the cow, they slaughtered them, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Was it just your father in the wood business in your town, or was there anyone else?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: There was ano – another – another family was also in that business, but my father was a – on the – on the big – in the – he – he was in the bigger business.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Cause he used to export it all over Europe.</span> <span id="s289">So now it became a thing, because all the money was invested in that wood, and since everything was stolen, and my mother was in bad situation.</span> <span id="s290">So – and, you know, as I said, in those days, th – over there was no welfare either, and th-the – the government didn’t pay you anything because you – your father is in the service there, whatever he did – he was like a soldier, but he wasn’t – he wasn’t doing a soldier’s work, but they called him like a soldier.</span> <span id="s291">He had to wear a uniform, a Hungarian uniform.</span> <span id="s292">So my mother send s – had some jewelry, so she sold out the jewelry, you know, how much – so eventually there’s plenty of times that we were in ba-bad shape, he – went to the bed hungry, you know, because my mother said, I haven’t got what to give you, go to bed to sleep.</span> <span id="s293">And sometimes she had a piece of bread, she cu – she – you know, we were three boys and her is four, so she – she cut it in three pieces.</span> <span id="s294">And I – so I said – I was the oldest one, I says, how come you – you not cutting for yourself?</span> <span id="s295">You just – and I said no – nobody – because my brothers, they listened to me, you see, I was the oldest one, so they – whatever I said was going.</span> <span id="s296">So I said, you – nobody eats unless she cuts it in four pieces.</span> <span id="s297">Cause I didn't want my mother should –</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: – sh-sh-should need.</span> <span id="s300">I – I had a wonderful mother, this – that – one thing, nobody could take this away from me, because she was just one of the ni – I mean, everybody likes th – their – his or hers mother, but she was the best mother for us.</span> <span id="s301">She would have give her life away.</span> <span id="s302">As a matter of fact, you could see, she didn't want to eat, and I says no, you have to eat too.</span> <span id="s303">And she didn’t have no choice, she had to eat it.</span> <span id="s304">The kids wouldn’t eat it, would take it from her.</span> <span id="s305">But then luckily, luckily you see, when God keeps his hand over you, and everything turns out to be good.</span> <span id="s306">We, where we lived, our house was the post office, also.</span> <span id="s307">We had the big house, and we used to rent for the post office.</span> <span id="s308">They used to post –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Okay, so you shared a building with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes, with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s312">Were there – were there any other families in the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Just you.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Only the post office and us.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s317">Did you have any other relatives nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Oh yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: We had plenty of relatives.</span> <span id="s321">There was a lot of relatives in this – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Were they – were you able to help them, or were they able to help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Well, wait for th – we are coming to –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s326">So one guy – and we had also a forced labor from Hungarian, Jewish people came to us, cut woods and things like that.</span> <span id="s327">One day a guy comes in into our house and let’s say this was the front of – of the – of the aw – of the house, and that was the post office.</span> <span id="s328">And to us, we went – here is another gate, we went from here, there’s – the other half was ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Okay, so you were in back.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: So back – right.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: So, because he didn’t know exactly where to go in, by accident he came into our house and knocked on the door and my mother went out.</span> <span id="s333">He says, is thi – where – where is the post office?</span> <span id="s334">So my mother says, just go around there, right next – in the front of the house is the post office.</span> <span id="s335">Then he says to my mother, what smells so good?</span> <span id="s336">So my mother made soup or s – chicken soup or whatever, I don’t know exactly what kind of thing.</span> <span id="s337">So he says, oh my God, so – smells so nice.</span> <span id="s338">So my mother says, well, if you like, come inside, sit down and I’ll serve you a plate of [indecipherable] soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: This is one of the forced laborers.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes –</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: – one of the forced laborers, he lived in Hungaria.</span> <span id="s343">He was a big farmer, this guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Do you know if he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Yeah, he was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: He – forced labor had to be all Jewish.</span> <span id="s348">The forced labor was hundred percent Jewish.</span> <span id="s349">So he – he says to my mother, oh my God, he says, you know, I never ate such a good – such a good food, because my mother’s so – it was Friday, for Friday for sab – for Sabbath, you know, she prepared for the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s350">So he says, do you mind if I’ll ask you a question?</span> <span id="s351">She says, yeah, you could ask me a question, she says.</span> <span id="s352">So he introduced himself and he says, you know, I’m a – I’m a big farmer, I have a lot of cattle, and anything food, you name it, I have it, he says.</span> <span id="s353">Maybe you could cook for me too, because I don’t like the food what I – what – what they cook there for us in the thing.</span> <span id="s354">My mother says, well, if you would like to, gladly, we will help you out.</span> <span id="s355">Come in any time you want.</span> <span id="s356">And he says, this ca – has to be every day.</span> <span id="s357">And suddenly, after a week time, you should see them, we got maybe 10 packages in the post office, big boxes, food he – he wrote home, and they send him meat and sugar a-an – and flour, you name it.</span> <span id="s358">Everything was in boxes.</span> <span id="s359">He says, whatev – just tell – tell me what you need, he says.</span> <span id="s360">And suddenly – my mother didn’t have no money, no nothing and suddenly, have whatever you want to have.</span> <span id="s361">Then, next door was my father’s brother’s family.</span> <span id="s362">So eventually we had about 10 people, also very rich Jewish people, you know, th-that could afford, they – they were rich, and my mothe – but she couldn’t cook for – b-by herself, so sh – th – next door my – we had cousins, also that she was – one was 18, one was 20, she both came in and helped us out and there was plenty food and they took home for themself whatever they wanted, you know?</span> <span id="s363">And suddenly wa – there was no more dividing a – a piece of bread in four pieces, we had all kind of food, whatever you wanted.</span> <span id="s364">So you see, there’s a time when you get a lift.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s366">Was anyone paying her to cook at that point, or is it all just charity?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, no, they all – th – wa – one was a manufacturer.</span> <span id="s368">One was a manufacturer from clothing, so they brought all kind – for – for the kids everybody got pants and jackets and coats, winter coats and shoes.</span> <span id="s369">Whatever we needed, he provided.</span> <span id="s370">And si – they left also money, they paid, you know, wha-whatever.</span> <span id="s371">They were very happy with my mother’s cooking.</span> <span id="s372">So – so thanks God for that because – but, it didn’t last too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: One more – just one more question about that, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: – so all of the food and coats that you were being sent out, those are being sent from the family of the forced laborer?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Of the t – forced laborers, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Th-They were Hungarian Jews, all the way deep from Hungaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: Now suddenly, this forced labor start – you know, they didn’t stay, they stayed for a couple of months, whatever it is, and then they send them someplace else.</span> <span id="s381">But that wasn’t the – the problem, because we had, for at least for another year or two to eat, we had so much food in the house, whatever they – they send us, you know, plenty food, no – no problem with that.</span> <span id="s382">There was one night, beginning in 1944, the Hungarians – Hungarians came with the – with the – with the hung – Hungarians and the German from the Gestapo came in, just like that.</span> <span id="s383">You have an hour time to get out from your house.</span> <span id="s384">Leave all the jewelry, all the money you have, leave it on the table, and leave the keys in the door.</span> <span id="s385">And you have to go end of the town, there was – you know, there was a lot of – like a hotel type, you know, they had a lot of rooms.</span> <span id="s386">All the Jewish people have to be – leave everything from the house, take a couple of pieces what you need, and the rest – le – leave everything home.</span> <span id="s387">And if you have money, leave it on the table.</span> <span id="s388">And if we gonna find out that you packed some money away, you’ll be shot – put to the wall and shot.</span> <span id="s389">That was the German talking.</span> <span id="s390">And they me – they meant business, because they were unbelievable, those people.</span> <span id="s391">You gonna hear stories, later down in the line.</span> <span id="s392">So we – we – it – yes.</span> <span id="s393">And my father was sent on a furlough for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s394">So he just was called an-and this – with us together, so we were all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: So he was back home at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Back home –</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: – for a couple of days, but once they took him away, that’s it, they couldn’t return th – no more, to where he was.</span> <span id="s399">But this – they didn’t care about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: So it’s just your mom and you and your brothers going in to –</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: And my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: And your father, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: And my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Because he didn’t return to his – his unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: That was finished, the unit was gone already.</span> <span id="s408">And that was the first night of Passover, I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s409">Suddenly – th-the kid – the young kids, they lay down to sleep and the bigger kids wer – you know, Passover, there’s a Passover meal, you know, and they – I don’t know, are you Jewish, or no?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: I’m not, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, no, that’s okay, tha – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: I know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: – but you know about – you know about those things –</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: – is – there’s – they call it a Seder and they – they pray, and they eat matzos, they do-don’t eat bread, things like that.</span> <span id="s416">Suddenly, I would say it was dark outside, suddenly Germans came in with – with about two, three cars, with motorcycles.</span> <span id="s417">And they – and we were sitting, by the – they didn’t open the door, they broke the door in coming in.</span> <span id="s418">They always ma – like to make a – what do you call that [indecipherable] something, something –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Breaking in, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: When – when you’re – when they were breaking in?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: They breaking in, and they started to shoot in th – in the – on the ceiling, you know, and the kids started to – they got – they scared the – first they tried to scare the people, and make a – a -- behollah(ph) means, you know, with noises and with dogs, you know, this was their motive always, to scare the – first the people, and to, you know, to make them afraid of them.</span> <span id="s423">So that’s how they – they rushed in.</span> <span id="s424">And th – all you hear, people are cry – the kids were crying and screaming, you know, because they got scared.</span> <span id="s425">They don’t know who – that was German or it was Hungarian, or something.</span> <span id="s426">And then they put machine guns on this – on the street, and there was a field going down to the water.</span> <span id="s427">There was a – a river.</span> <span id="s428">The river was that – the Tisa.</span> <span id="s429">That was the big river there.</span> <span id="s430">So my uncle – people were running like – like crazy, were u – one on this way, one that way, one the other way around, cause they got so scared, frightened, you know, from those – from those Germans, the – when you come in – somebody comes in in a house and starts shooting and breaking and ca – and hitting you, thing, you get scared and you run every – a-all over.</span> <span id="s431">So, my uncle was running to the water, in the snow, you could see right away, when a person runs on the snow, you could see.</span> <span id="s432">Snow is white and if he wears the dark clothes, you can spot him right away.</span> <span id="s433">They shoo – killed him right there on the spot, so he fell that – right there.</span> <span id="s434">I was running with a friend of mine, he had the little baby.</span> <span id="s435">The – the mother just gave birth like maybe a week or two years old, I don’t remember exactly that, but very small baby.</span> <span id="s436">So we ran in – into a shack there, and they were running through, and suddenly the baby gave a cry, you know, he woke up, and the – right away.</span> <span id="s437">So they came in, and, get out, you know, and the Germans, get out from there.</span> <span id="s438">And one guy hit me with a gun – with a – with a gun from the end of the gun, hit me over the head.</span> <span id="s439">Luckily, he didn’t hi – he didn’t hi – if he would have hit that baby, that baby would be dead right there.</span> <span id="s440">Didn’t – didn’t matter anyway, because the baby didn’t – didn’t survive anyway, but that’s besi – another point.</span> <span id="s441">So that was – we were there in this house for about a couple of days, and from there they took us and we went to Máltészalka, that was a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: This was in winter of ‘43 or ‘44?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Winter of ‘44.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Beginning an – beginning of –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Like in January or February?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: – or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: All right.</span> <span id="s450">So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: [indecipherable] Máltészalka?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Yeah, we went to – they took us and put us in-into wagons, and they – they packed us in like sardines there.</span> <span id="s453">We came to Mátészalka and after a – I don’t know, we rode the whole night and – and half a day, I think, something like that, a day and a half.</span> <span id="s454">And then ther – they put us on an open field, no nothing, no – and it was raining, you know, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s455">And we did – we’d – we had the ha – no raincoats, we didn’t have raincoats, things like that, or the coat.</span> <span id="s456">And a lot of people died there on this – on the thing, because the older people, they just couldn’t take it, it was very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: How long were you on the field for?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: On the field, we were, for a nice couple of days.</span> <span id="s459">I cannot tell you – maybe four days, five days –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: So the people tried to sleep on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: The – there wer – there was also houses there, but in the beginning they wouldn’t let us into the houses, because it wasn’t ready somehow, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s462">But after then, we came into the houses.</span> <span id="s463">And we were there in Máltészalka also for – just for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s464">And it –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Did people like, try to sleep on the field, though, or did they just have to use the bathroom out there?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well, you use the bathroom, you went there on the side a little bit.</span> <span id="s467">Who cares?</span> <span id="s468">In those days you didn’t care.</span> <span id="s469">Could be a good looking girl, or something.</span> <span id="s470">I was a kid, I didn’t e – wasn’t interested in those days for – for the women, or something.</span> <span id="s471">But that’s – that’s was life.</span> <span id="s472">And they had there a guy, also a German, the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s473">If he walked by and he seen you, he didn’t like your looks or whatever, he took out his pistol and killed you on the spot, without any questions ask.</span> <span id="s474">And he gets away with everything because he do whatever he wants to do.</span> <span id="s475">Killed people.</span> <span id="s476">And we were so scared, when we seen him, everybody was hiding, because we knew what this guy is doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s478">How many people do you think were in Mátészalka at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh, I don’t know, there was a lot of people this – not only from our town, from all over around.</span> <span id="s480">For – they always – took most – most they took them there to Mátészalka.</span> <span id="s481">Maybe they took him someplace else too, which I don’t know.</span> <span id="s482">I was still a kid that time, and a – but anyway, after a couple of weeks, we were in Mátészalka and one day they came and they says, you – you people are gonna go to work, and you going to Poland to work.</span> <span id="s483">We didn’t have nothing to say.</span> <span id="s484">And then they said, we’re gonna examine you, and if you still have any jewelry or something – they undressed everybody naked, stark naked and they checked you out from top to bottom, and if you had something hidden or something, they beat you up like unbelievable.</span> <span id="s485">So finally they put us in wagons.</span> <span id="s486">And we didn’t know where we are going, but we wi – wind up in Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Who was with you at this point in – in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: In the – i-i – that wa – in this point, my mother, my father and the three brother – three kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: That’s – includes me, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Three kids, we are three brothers.</span> <span id="s493">Finally – and this was – this was unbelievable, because you see, in that time, a lot of military was going.</span> <span id="s494">So if a military train came, they took us and pushed us in the back to make for them the – the right of way to go, to go ahe – oh, this must be my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: We’ll pause for a second again.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s497">[tape break] Bay –</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Hold on a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s501">Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s502">We might hear Mr. Rosenheck’s wife in the background a little bit, but – she’s here, but we’re still with Mr. Rosenheck.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Right.</span> <span id="s504">Well anyway, now we arriving to – to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span> <span id="s505">We still didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s506">As soon as they opened the doors, you could see the Germans – Gestapo.</span> <span id="s507">This is the SS, you know, this – they are the worst, with dogs, with German Shepherds.</span> <span id="s508">And they were instigating those dogs, you know, and ri – the dogs came, you know, with [growls].</span> <span id="s509">You know, they – they are trained, killer dogs, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: So this was after you had gotten off the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: This is already in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: We just arrived to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s514">And screaming, raus – and there was a lady, I – I remember, I – and I used to know her because her – her father was a shoemaker in town.</span> <span id="s515">And she had poli – she had polio.</span> <span id="s516">She was about 25 years old, I think, and she had the little girl.</span> <span id="s517">But she – when she had the little girl she didn’t have the – later on she di – somehow she developed polio.</span> <span id="s518">And she – they brought her with – with her bed, because she couldn’t walk, she couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s519">Don’t ask.</span> <span id="s520">So the German grabbed – pushed her out, with the bed, and the bed flew this way and she went the other way around.</span> <span id="s521">And she was crying, you know, but he – they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s522">Now, I was a kid.</span> <span id="s523">For me to jump down from that wa – wagon was nothing, because a kid, you know, is about this tall – high.</span> <span id="s524">But an elderly person, he couldn’t jump down from there, because he is old, too old, or an elderly woman, or somebody.</span> <span id="s525">A young guy is nothing, to jump down from here to the ground is nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Just a few feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Right.</span> <span id="s528">And they started to hit us with the – with the canes and with the dogs, and everybody was running in different directions.</span> <span id="s529">I run this way, my mother, father, somehow wind up the other way around, and some of my brother went this way, you know.</span> <span id="s530">Depends, depends.</span> <span id="s531">You – you always try to run away from the thing.</span> <span id="s532">So finally everybody was out from the wagons because they had to ma – clear the – the rails, that’s the reason they wanted us one, two, three out, but it takes time to – to jump out from there even, and especially for the sick people or elderly people, they just couldn’t jump like ano – another person.</span> <span id="s533">So finally, a guy comes over to me, an inmate already, a – a Jewish guy from Poland.</span> <span id="s534">He says listen, don’t tell them how old you are.</span> <span id="s535">Tell them that you are older, and tell them that you are an electrician.</span> <span id="s536">Guy came over and talked to me in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: How old were you really, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: In – in that time I was about –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: – twel – 13, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Thirteen.</span> <span id="s543">So he says – he says to me, now you see there in the corner?</span> <span id="s544">That’s Mengele standing there.</span> <span id="s545">You heard about Mengele?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: You just have heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: The death of the a – a-angel of death.</span> <span id="s550">Cause if he send you this way or he send you this way, this way is to life, and this way is to die.</span> <span id="s551">Now, he is gonna interview, he interviews everybody.</span> <span id="s552">And he just makes with the finger, this way, that way, this way, that way, but sometimes he stops and asks you some questions.</span> <span id="s553">So when I came, he asked me, how old are you?</span> <span id="s554">I says, I’m 15.</span> <span id="s555">He looks, looks.</span> <span id="s556">Well, you working?</span> <span id="s557">He said what – what did you do?</span> <span id="s558">I said, I worked electrician helper.</span> <span id="s559">Yeah, okay, he send me this way.</span> <span id="s560">People – if you were pregnant, he – I don’t care how old you are, if 18 or 20 or 15, when he see that you’re pregnant, that’s to die.</span> <span id="s561">There’s no question, as any pregnant woman was going to the – to the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Were you undressed at this point?</span> <span id="s563">A: Undressed, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: This is still just from the wagons out –</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: – and then when – when he sends you this way, you had to go through a bath, and they change you, took away all your clothing, and they give you the concentration camp clothing, you know, those striped clothings?</span> <span id="s568">You must have seen it in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: All right, okay.</span> <span id="s571">So – and now suddenly, I became all by myself.</span> <span id="s572">I didn’t see – I didn’t know where my father was, I didn't know where my mother was, I didn’t know my two brothers.</span> <span id="s573">Own – only by myself, completely by myself.</span> <span id="s574">Okay.</span> <span id="s575">So finally we came in, and they sh – take all – sheared up all – all your hair, all over, and they – they call it ant-lousing.</span> <span id="s576">You know, they disinfect you, you know, because a lot of people maybe came, had lice or whatever, this, you know, so – and they took away everything what you had and they gave you the concentration camp clothes.</span> <span id="s577">So I wind up in – in the – in – in F lager.</span> <span id="s578">You see, Auschwitz was divided, A, B, C, D and E – and F. Now, between – between each, A and B, there was high voltage wires.</span> <span id="s579">You touch that wire, and that’s it, you cannot – could not – you could not pull back your hand.</span> <span id="s580">It’s like – it pulled you like a magnet, it killed you instantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you see anyone touch it?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yeah, I’ll –</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: – we’ll come – we’ll come – coming – coming to that.</span> <span id="s585">So anyway, I just want to tell you the way – ho-how I arrived there.</span> <span id="s586">So finally I came into the barrack, I was so tired, so knocked out, because in-inside in the wagons, you couldn’t – I couldn’t stretch my feet.</span> <span id="s587">If you sit down you couldn’t get up, if you get up you couldn’t sit down because like – like sardines they put you in – in those – in those things.</span> <span id="s588">Now imagine if you had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s589">And what do you think you did?</span> <span id="s590">You did where you were standing.</span> <span id="s591">And the smell, you know, from I don’t know how many people it was in the wagon, at least 50 - 60 – I don’t – I can’t tell you because I really, honestly don’t know myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So this was still in the wagon when –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Still – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Okay, and ye –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: But this is already now I’m out from the wagons.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: So, I was very thirsty and was a hot day that time, and I was so thirsty.</span> <span id="s598">They didn’t give you nothing, nothing to eat, but I went to the faucet and drink a little bit water.</span> <span id="s599">That’s – that’s what – that calmed me down, I says, now I don’t care, I’m – there was no bunk beds, and no nothing there.</span> <span id="s600">On the cement lay down, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s601">I lay down, I took off my – my pants and my jacket and I put it under my head, you know, and my shoes.</span> <span id="s602">In the morning around four o’clock, was pouring outside – we had Gypsy overseers, sigo – Gypsy, Zigeuners, you know.</span> <span id="s603">You heard about Zigeuner?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: There’s some German – Gypsies is the German Zigeuner.</span> <span id="s606">They also beat us, you know, raus, out, out, for the appell, you know, outside those – lined up.</span> <span id="s607">I take a look.</span> <span id="s608">I haven’t got no clothes, I haven’t got no shoes.</span> <span id="s609">Look [indecipherable] I see.</span> <span id="s610">I haven’t got nothing to put on.</span> <span id="s611">Somebody took it away from me.</span> <span id="s612">So I says to myself, listen Mr. Saul, you better change your – your habits here, you see what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s613">You gonna do what you did right now, you not gonna survive here for a long time.</span> <span id="s614">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Was everyone in F lager from your transport, or were some people there already?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: No, no, was me – this different – all mixed in, all different transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: So there were people there already and you were just coming in?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yeah, sure, they were –</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Yeah, coming in.</span> <span id="s621">You see, in Auschwitz, the-they annihilated i-in a day they could annihilate 10,000 people, that mass production what they had, the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s622">But I’ll be come – coming – coming to that, too.</span> <span id="s623">So finally we went outside, everybody was outside.</span> <span id="s624">And then I said to myself – we were sitting there til it got light, because when I – we were – they chased us out, was still dark outside.</span> <span id="s625">So finally, must have been maybe seven, eight o’clock, I don’t know because I didn’t have a watch and I didn’t know the time.</span> <span id="s626">Because over there the time – the – the time didn’t mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: So we’re sitting, sitting, then I said to myself – you see, the barracks were going one barrack here, one barrack here, one bar – and here was a place that we used to sit between the barracks.</span> <span id="s629">I said, you know, let me take a look, maybe I’ll go to the next, maybe I’ll see somebody from my hometown that I – I could recogni – maybe I’ll see my father.</span> <span id="s630">Just for a guessing, you know?</span> <span id="s631">So I see nobody looking, I pfft, and outside, and I pass by there, I look, I look.</span> <span id="s632">Nobody.</span> <span id="s633">I went one – another barrack further, nobody.</span> <span id="s634">I said, let me try one more.</span> <span id="s635">I try one more, nothing, didn't find anyone.</span> <span id="s636">As I’m turning around, there was a window.</span> <span id="s637">I looked inside – peek inside from the back of the barrack, I see a barrel is there, coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: So I pulled the window – windows open, pull one, I’m looking.</span> <span id="s640">I jump in, and at first – first I go and drink like that.</span> <span id="s641">I’m – I’m still drinking –</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Stick your head in.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I was so thirsty, you haven’t got no idea.</span> <span id="s644">I’m still drinking the coffee, if I close my eyes, the way I was drinking the coffee.</span> <span id="s645">So I drank, I drank and – and now I was full.</span> <span id="s646">Now I was satisfied wi-with drinking, because you know you – when you are very thirsty, your mouth is dry.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s648">There was no one else around that saw you doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: No – nobody, nobody else because they were no more sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: There was – this part was empty, that’s the reason na – then I see a canteens, German canteens, you know, laying on the floor.</span> <span id="s652">I don’t know how that coffee went in there or what or who put it in there.</span> <span id="s653">Don’t ask me, because I don’t know.</span> <span id="s654">All I seen it there, I ran inside, I took one canteen, put it in the – filled it up and put it in my shirt, now this time, you know, because they shouldn’t s –</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: So they were pretty small canteens?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: No, there’s about thi-this tall, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: And thi-this wide.</span> <span id="s659">It’s a canteen of coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: I put it in my shirt because if they gonna see me with a ca – things, you know, could get into trouble.</span> <span id="s662">I went back to my place, and finally lunch time they give you – they took like in a pot for five people, and they count one, two, three, four, five and they give you a pot with some soup in it.</span> <span id="s663">Now, if they’re nice people you’ve – you met – find nice people, they share that with you, one spoon for you, one spoon for me.</span> <span id="s664">But sometimes they [indecipherable] stronger guys and they said the kid, who – who cares, you know?</span> <span id="s665">Sometimes you get – didn’t get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So those were the other inmates that would share with you, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: With other inmates.</span> <span id="s670">I got a couple of spoons myself and all right, what I got, I got, that’s it.</span> <span id="s671">You know, I – I was used to already so – sometimes not to eat, because you didn’t have ron – there was a time where you didn’t have what to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Was there any trading at that point, like if someone had some bread, they’d give you some bread for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yeah, but thi-this is later on –</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: – later on, when it – it settled down.</span> <span id="s676">It’s one thing, I never believed in trading.</span> <span id="s677">Those people give away the piece of bread for cigarettes, you know.</span> <span id="s678">Fo – and besides, I didn’t smoke, so – and I didn't want to take.</span> <span id="s679">Whatever they gave me, I said that’s what I’m gonna eat, and no – no trading.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Later on you’ll see why – why – why I was doing that.</span> <span id="s682">So anyway, I came at night, and I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s683">In between, when I went out this mor – the – the morning, before [indecipherable] I didn’t have no – no – no pants, no nothing.</span> <span id="s684">I seen in the garbage can, I found a pair of pants, old pants but this big.</span> <span id="s685">Maybe two sows could fit in there, not one.</span> <span id="s686">Big pants.</span> <span id="s687">I just took it, made a knot, and I was holding like this, at least I had a pair of pants.</span> <span id="s688">At night, I met there a guy, so he says, here there’s another pair – a – a jacket, and there’s a pair of shoes, maybe they fit you.</span> <span id="s689">Eh, it fit me, so I was sort of back in bus – but didn't – was-wasn’t new, but I was covered.</span> <span id="s690">At night suddenly, and I still had my canteen, but this time I – I didn’t put my – my stuff just like put it down, you know, make believe, an-and then they should steal it from me.</span> <span id="s691">I learned my lesson very fast.</span> <span id="s692">You had to learn, otherwise you couldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s693">So, at night I hear somebody cries, mommy, mommy, mommy.</span> <span id="s694">He had scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s695">How did I know, I’m gonna tell you how I knew it, too.</span> <span id="s696">And he says – he was burning up.</span> <span id="s697">You know, scarlet fever goes with a very high temperature.</span> <span id="s698">So then another guy who was sleeping next to me says, who has water, who has – who has to drink, something?</span> <span id="s699">So I go over – I get up, you know, I was still new, you know, when I heard somebody crying, it – it bothered me.</span> <span id="s700">And I went over there, and I opened his mouth and I put a little drop – a couple of drops of coffee.</span> <span id="s701">Oh, he said, oh.</span> <span id="s702">And now he felt good because it’s – it’s cool, it’s water, it cooled him off a little bit.</span> <span id="s703">And then I went back to my place to sleep, and I slept.</span> <span id="s704">In the morning – again, they chased us out early in the morning, but this time they made two line – two lines.</span> <span id="s705">One group was this way, and one group was this way going.</span> <span id="s706">And I came out.</span> <span id="s707">Wherever I went, I s – I stopped right there in this – in this place.</span> <span id="s708">Suddenly, we were – got a little bit li – if you sit down, we were sitting there and waiting for what’s going to be next.</span> <span id="s709">Suddenly the kid from last night, happened the same thing.</span> <span id="s710">He fell down and fainted again, because the high – the fever, the big fever was burning him up.</span> <span id="s711">And again, who has drink, who?</span> <span id="s712">He needs some water, who has something for him to drink?</span> <span id="s713">So I got up, I still had th – my ca – my – my canteen, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: And I give him again, but this time I couldn’t go back to my old place, so I stood right there.</span> <span id="s716">And then the – the Germans came right away, at – maybe in half an hour after, and they said this line this way, and this line remains here.</span> <span id="s717">So those people where I was going was supposed to remain there, but then we went into the D lager.</span> <span id="s718">First of all, we came in, we had bunk beds, no more sleeping on the floor.</span> <span id="s719">Wa – the middle, one on the bottom, in the middle and on the top.</span> <span id="s720">And there was about six – six kids in one back – on the top six, on the ba – middle, and in – on the bottom six.</span> <span id="s721">So about 18 kids in a bunk bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: It came lunch, you got a – you got a plate, a separate plate, with a spoon, and you got a liter of soup.</span> <span id="s724">This time they couldn’t cheat you, because you got your own, and – and besides, they had th – if you wanted [indecipherable] you – you could repeat and you could go again and they give it – give you another soup, so it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: I said, my God, what a difference from one place to the next.</span> <span id="s727">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Did you always have to hold on to your plate and your spoon?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: No, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: You got –</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Plates you gave back, they – they wer –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: – there were some kids that used to – that was divided.</span> <span id="s734">You had to wash those plates, and they washed it for you, and some people went to the kitchen, picked up the soup, or th – they give you the bread, or whatever, whatever the food was divided.</span> <span id="s735">In the morning you had already coffee.</span> <span id="s736">There wasn’t coffee, it was – they took some, like a corn, and they burned it and they thin – that was the coffee, you know, it wasn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Some kind of fake coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: – coffee like you get.</span> <span id="s739">Yeah, fake coffee is right.</span> <span id="s740">They used to call it ersatz, in German, it’s fay – ersatz coffee, but it wasn’t real coffee, just fake coffee.</span> <span id="s741">That’s the right word there, but i-in German used to be ersatz.</span> <span id="s742">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Appreciate that.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Well, anyway, let me see.</span> <span id="s747">Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: The ersatz coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s750">We – we came – so now, it – situation improved.</span> <span id="s751">But it didn’t last too long.</span> <span id="s752">What happened?</span> <span id="s753">We had the German Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s754">He was in charge of the – of the kids.</span> <span id="s755">The – this was only kids, kids tha – between 11 - 12 til – til 15 or something like that.</span> <span id="s756">There was – the barrack was lo – all only kids.</span> <span id="s757">So he found that one of the kids that I gave him the coffee, had scarlet fever, so he had to report it to the Germans, that.</span> <span id="s758">Now today a scarlet fever, you give one injection, and – and it’s finished, it’s over.</span> <span id="s759">Over there they didn’t treat you, instead – and I’m gonna tell you what happened with those kids, and what happened with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: How easily do you think it spread between kids though, at that point?</span> <span id="s761">Did a lot of people have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yeah, well, I’m coming –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: – thi-this now, I’m coming right now to it.</span> <span id="s765">So as soon as he reported it – so Mengele was in charge of the health, the – you know, killing and making all kind of injections and – or taking the person and cutting open without the – without the anesthesia, you know.</span> <span id="s766">All those – those good things what he was famous for.</span> <span id="s767">So once he found out that there is scarlet fever in barrack 27, I was in the 27th barrack, he came in wa – and the next day, must have been nine o’clock, I think, and he had always a sergeant walking with him.</span> <span id="s768">He didn’t have no gun, but the sergeant had the small pistol on – on the side, I still remember them.</span> <span id="s769">So he used to come, and we had to stand naked, and he looked at you.</span> <span id="s770">If you had like measles or pimples or something, that means that you had the scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s771">And he took one look at you, he said wshht, this way.</span> <span id="s772">This way meant – because in the back of – this is the barrack in the front, this is the front, this is the back.</span> <span id="s773">In the back where the ambulance was standing there and waiting.</span> <span id="s774">God forbid if you had anything like pimples or measles or something, they sent you straight in the ambulance.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: What is – oh, the ambulance.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Ambulance, ambulance, yeah.</span> <span id="s777">In German they say ambulance, I still – I still speak German.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: A-Ambulance.</span> <span id="s780">Now, nobody knew what was happening to you, this was the first time.</span> <span id="s781">So he had a co – picked out maybe four or five kids, ambulance.</span> <span id="s782">Ambulance went straight around, out, and the crematoriums were right here, put them in the crematorium, gassed them, goodbye.</span> <span id="s783">He used to come every day.</span> <span id="s784">Every day he used to come for inspection.</span> <span id="s785">And this – this time we were in quarantine.</span> <span id="s786">You couldn’t come in, you couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s787">And they used to bring the food, put it down in front of the – of the door, by the door, and we had to take it in.</span> <span id="s788">When the ba – the barrels were empty, we had to put them outside.</span> <span id="s789">That – that was our job, that you didn’t do no work, no nothing because you couldn’t – we were not allowed to go outside, only in the barracks.</span> <span id="s790">Was a quarantine.</span> <span id="s791">One day – Mengele used to come every – every morning like, you know Germans, they – they punctual.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Very precise.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s794">One day we take a look this, he’s supposed to be here, he still didn’t come here.</span> <span id="s795">And somehow you know, you didn’t do anything, and I just felt tired, and I fell asleep.</span> <span id="s796">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: That’s fine.</span> <span id="s798">[tape break] All right, you ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Okay, we’re back.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: So, I fall asleep.</span> <span id="s802">And you know, we had a blanket this time, with a straw like – a mattress from straw, you know, inside.</span> <span id="s803">But there was a blanket over it, and the blanket had like dimples, you know, up and down, th-the – it wasn’t straight, smooth.</span> <span id="s804">And it left me an imprint on my face.</span> <span id="s805">And I was in the middle of – I always liked to be in the middle of the bunk beds, not on the top and not on the bottom, in the middle.</span> <span id="s806">And Mengele goes through, and I was right here on the end, on the first thing, and he stops right next to me.</span> <span id="s807">And he looks, looks, looks, and then he says, come a – raus, come outside.</span> <span id="s808">Well, he calls me wa – my friends on the top thing, they were crying already, because they – we knew already where you are going.</span> <span id="s809">Now imagine, it’s like a death penalty, you know.</span> <span id="s810">When he calls you, 99 – 99 percent that you are finished.</span> <span id="s811">And the barrack, this was the barrack and the length – there used to be horses in those barracks before.</span> <span id="s812">So there was like a trough, the horses used to drink from that tro – torf – trough, they call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Trough, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Trough, right.</span> <span id="s815">So they went, they filled in, where the water was, they filled it in with cement, and then we use it like a table or a bench, we used to sit on that – on the ho – on the whole length, from the barrack.</span> <span id="s816">So we used to sit there.</span> <span id="s817">So Mengele told me to sit down there, he took out a thermometer and put it in under my arms, and he went to inspect for – now it comes to me and says – says, don’t – don’t pull it too hard, because I was afraid – I didn’t know if I had a fever or not, but if he called me out there must be something, because he – so I – I pulled away from it, and I didn’t – didn’t hold it tight, it should [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s818">When he came back, he takes out a temperature, it didn’t even pull the normal temperature.</span> <span id="s819">So he knew right away what I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: He’s not – he wasn’t stupid, that guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: So this was Mengele that –</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: – did that, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Tha-That’s the – the – the – the angel of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: And you think that he just pulled you aside originally cause you had the imprints on your face?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yeah, on – on that face, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Now what – you know what he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: He sat down on this thing, took me, sat me on his lap, and he was holding me this time like this.</span> <span id="s832">I couldn’t do no more anything, couldn’t do a thing.</span> <span id="s833">My heart wa – I e – every beat from my heart, I heard it in my ears, because I knew this is the end.</span> <span id="s834">I still didn’t know, when he took out the temperature, I didn’t know if it was normal or not normal, he didn't tell me anything, he – he didn't – wouldn't tell me anything.</span> <span id="s835">Now, he took out a temperature, my temperature was normal.</span> <span id="s836">He comes with the funny smile, he says in German, mach das du verschwins.</span> <span id="s837">Make that you disappear from here before I change my mind.</span> <span id="s838">Did I disappear from there.</span> <span id="s839">You know what means jet propulsion?</span> <span id="s840">Like a jet.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Did he do that to anyone else?</span> <span id="s842">A: I am the first – the only kid that survived from Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s844">In that camp, or just – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: In – in that – in that – in that – in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Because when he took you out already, you were finished.</span> <span id="s848">But he – I seen he was standing and waiting, but he wasn’t [indecipherable] himself, but I said, ah, maybe he-he still – he still has maybe the scarlet fever, but I didn’t have anything, I just fall asleep and the imprint left me from that blanket.</span> <span id="s849">So that was I went through with Mengele.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Were there any other doctors or soldiers around when he was doing the inspection?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No, only – only – only him and – and a sergeant.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: The two people ca – always used to come in for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: – for the inspection.</span> <span id="s856">So now, finally, there came a day, and everybo – yeah, okay, now comes an interesting thing.</span> <span id="s857">One night I – we went to sleep.</span> <span id="s858">And I had a friend, he was sleeping always on the bottom.</span> <span id="s859">I take a look.</span> <span id="s860">His name was – Hungarian kid, Jewish kid, his name was Gustie(ph).</span> <span id="s861">I say – take a look downstair, I said, he’s not here yet, I says, what happened to him, he’s supposed to be – you know.</span> <span id="s862">Waiting, waiting, waiting.</span> <span id="s863">Maybe about two, three hours later, I take a look, he comes in with a shopping bag.</span> <span id="s864">And I says, Gustie(ph), where have you been?</span> <span id="s865">I spoke to him Hungarian, because you see, Hungarian Jews don’t – don’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s866">They don’t speak je – only Hungarian, most of them.</span> <span id="s867">He says, shh, don’t say anything, I’ll talk to you in the morning.</span> <span id="s868">First he gives me a piece of – a piece of bread, and then an apple, and he give me some cake.</span> <span id="s869">Said sh, don’t [inaudible] talk.</span> <span id="s870">So, he says don’t talk, I’ll tell you tomorrow morning, everything.</span> <span id="s871">He put it under his bed.</span> <span id="s872">People were sleeping, so nobody knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Was it just the two of you at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Just the two of me, because I was waiting for him, he is my friend –</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: – you know, so I wanted to know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s877">Okay, so in the morning he told me the whole story.</span> <span id="s878">You know, there is, in barrack 13, there used to be the Sonderkommando, they used to called themselves Sonderkommando.</span> <span id="s879">Those people used to work in the crematoriums, they’re Jewish people.</span> <span id="s880">Each six months they used to exchange them and kill those – those people themself; they always take new people.</span> <span id="s881">Cause the Germans said that they knew too much, and they were afraid it shouldn’t leak out.</span> <span id="s882">But the whole world knew already, especially the Roosevelt and Churchill, they knew what was going on in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: So anyway, so he told me that – I says, where did you get all those things?</span> <span id="s885">So he says, I – I went to the barrack 13.</span> <span id="s886">That’s the Sonderkommando, that’s what – you see those chimneys, the crematoriums?</span> <span id="s887">Because I was there, I still didn’t know, I thought they were factories.</span> <span id="s888">See, y-you couldn’t get out, but there was the wires, you couldn’t go on the other side.</span> <span id="s889">And – but you seen the chimneys.</span> <span id="s890">I didn't know they were crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: You still didn't know at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No, at that time I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s893">So then he explained it to me that this – this is crematorium.</span> <span id="s894">He told me already, because he went there, but he couldn’t communicate with those people cause they were Polish Jewish kid – people working there, and he didn't speak Polish, and he didn’t speak Yiddish, and they couldn’t communicate.</span> <span id="s895">And they spe – didn’t speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s896">So I says, you know what, I’m gonna go myself, too.</span> <span id="s897">I’ll go next – he says, it’s very dangerous.</span> <span id="s898">Because you know, there’s floodlights, and they go like – like this.</span> <span id="s899">Like this around, back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s900">So if you are caught in those floodlights, you are finished, because th-there’s the towers where the Germans – Gestapo stands, and they see something moving, no questions asked, they – they shoot you [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s901">Could you hold this for a few minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Yeah, all right.</span> <span id="s903">[tape break] Okay, we’re ready to continue now.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: So – yes, okay, I – I listened to his advice what he gave me, and I took it very seriously, because I know that if something goes wrong, I never will be able to come back.</span> <span id="s905">So you had to be very, very, very careful.</span> <span id="s906">[interference] Anyway, next – the next day or two days later, I don’t remember exactly when it was, I said to him, okay, I’m leaving right now.</span> <span id="s907">And he said, go to the end of the barracks.</span> <span id="s908">There is a board, just pull it away, sneak out, go to the left, and you will see barrack 13 in the back, it says 13.</span> <span id="s909">That’s where you have to go in, just bang in the door couple of times and they – they are out, they’re gonna let you in.</span> <span id="s910">I said okay, I got the message.</span> <span id="s911">And then, when you come to barrack 13, the same way where you put the – and there was – the end of the barrack was the bathroom, so – and then the – on the 13 is the same way.</span> <span id="s912">Pull the board, first knock on the door, and if they don’t open the door, you could do the same thing.</span> <span id="s913">But first wait, and if not, you could go in through that board, too.</span> <span id="s914">But we – the main important thing was, be very careful when those floodlights go back and forth.</span> <span id="s915">When the floodlights go this way, you have to go – move.</span> <span id="s916">When the floodlights come back, you have to lay down flat on your stomach, so they shouldn’t see no movements.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: So you were trying to go back and forth between different barracks at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: [indecipherable] yeah, b-between, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: I was in 27.</span> <span id="s921">From 27 there was all the uneven numbers; 27, tw – 25 - 23, all uneven numbers til you come to 13.</span> <span id="s922">So anyway, I arrived there, everything went fine, everything is smooth.</span> <span id="s923">I followed very – he – he – he warned me, be very careful with those floodlight, that’s the main important thing.</span> <span id="s924">Thanks God I made it, I came in.</span> <span id="s925">The first thing I opened the door they said, you speak Yiddish?</span> <span id="s926">The first thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: This is when you got to the cre –</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: In – when I – in 13, in barrack 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: And right away they – I says yes, I’m a Jewish guy, and I speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s931">Because the other kid didn’t speak, they couldn’t communicate with him, so they were like – they make him with the hands, you know, but with me they didn't have no problem, and I could talk with them and everything.</span> <span id="s932">So I came in, and everybody – everybody hugged me, you know.</span> <span id="s933">I was the youngest kid, they were already big guys, you know, like 25 - 26 - 30 - 40 years old.</span> <span id="s934">Okay, first they ask me, are you hungry, you want to eat something?</span> <span id="s935">I says yeah, thank you very much, and they gave me the [inaudible] see, they were ba – from the tra – when the transport came in, so the people broke through the – you know, because they thought they going – in the working camps, so they gonna need food, so whatever, they had food.</span> <span id="s936">And when they gassed them in the tanks, all the food remained, so they could take it home with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So their job was to sort through all of the things that were left by –</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: So then I sat down an-and I was talking with them.</span> <span id="s941">So the first thing I asked them, I says, you know, my parents, my mother, my father, my two brothers, I don’t know where they are.</span> <span id="s942">And, you know – but when he explained it, the crematoriums, I didn't know too much, because he didn’t – he didn’t understand either what they were telling to him.</span> <span id="s943">Then I said – I said, I’m not going to mention anything, I was just going to say, what are those chimneys there, you know?</span> <span id="s944">So then one guy come over and sit down, he says, might as well, you are here anyway.</span> <span id="s945">Might as well you should know what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s946">Those are not workings.</span> <span id="s947">Because I thought they were factories, you know?</span> <span id="s948">Said, this is not a factory, a factory they – they burn the Jewish people there, and gas them with Zyklon gas.</span> <span id="s949">And he said, we do the – we do the sh – the pulling out the dead bodies, and all – they used to pull out the teeth, the gold teeth, and they – then they used to sell it to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s950">I don’t know if you hear about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s953">So he says, and your parents, he says, they must have gone up there to the sky, up higher, in the crematorium.</span> <span id="s954">Because I said, what is a crematorium?</span> <span id="s955">I didn’t know what a crematorium means, in those days.</span> <span id="s956">So they explained me, give me a good – a good lesson, and they explained me whatever was going on, and he says, and don’t think that we have it so good.</span> <span id="s957">We have all the food to eat, but you know, in six months we are next to – to be cremated, and th – and they – they knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: So this was the first time that you think you might have gotten the gist about where your parents were, that they might have died?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes, yes, that – that – that’s what I – that’s what I – hundred per – well, he told me, and I didn’t find them here no more, so that means – and if they would have gone where I went, I would have met them inside there eventually.</span> <span id="s960">Not in one day, but two days, in maybe the next week or two weeks, or three or four.</span> <span id="s961">And they weren’t, so I said, that’s what it is, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Do you think your brothers –</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Did – did you think that your brothers had also died at that point, cause you hadn’t seen them?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Well, okay, I’m gonna come and I’ll tell you what happened with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Somebody told me that story from my mother, but from my father and two brothers, I never heard again.</span> <span id="s968">Never, ever again.</span> <span id="s969">And then after that they gave me – said take whatever you want fruit, and they give me also in the bag, you know, ba – two bags, he said, be very careful how you go.</span> <span id="s970">They warned me too, you know.</span> <span id="s971">I says yes, I know already, because my friend was here yesterday – he said – oh, not yesterday, a couple of days ago.</span> <span id="s972">He said, but he didn’t speak no Yiddish.</span> <span id="s973">He says, yeah, we – we remember him.</span> <span id="s974">We couldn’t talk with him, we just say – we talk with the hand and the things.</span> <span id="s975">So a little [indecipherable] got out, but the main thing for him, he didn’t know what – he didn't tell them that they were wor-working in the Sonderkommand, because he couldn’t understand what they – what they were talking to him.</span> <span id="s976">So now I knew already exactly that over there is the crematoriums, and that’s where the people, they going – th-they – they used to call it, to the bathe – to the bathing, and it was showers inside like you go and take a shower, but instead of the shower was the Zyklon gas came out.</span> <span id="s977">And that’s how a lot of people were dying there.</span> <span id="s978">Now, when the scarlet fever was over, and we were allowed already, because scarlet fever died down, people were no more sick, we could go outside.</span> <span id="s979">And we used to work in the bar – barracks, you know, there was – okay, here – here how what – Auschwitz was.</span> <span id="s980">When you came in the big tow – big – not doors, but gates, and it says, Arbeit macht das Leben süss.</span> <span id="s981">Work makes life sweet.</span> <span id="s982">That’s what is – a big sign said that.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Did you ever see the one that said Arbeit macht frei?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Arbeit macht frei, yeah, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: It was on there.</span> <span id="s986">So there were two different ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: – yeah, you – yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s990">You see them when you go out from the barrack, you could see in th – in the front.</span> <span id="s991">It was right in the front when you came into the – to the barracks.</span> <span id="s992">Now, this was – this was our barracks, right?</span> <span id="s993">The barracks were going one – like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: In rows.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: And then there was a road here, and on the other side was the same barracks, but with the – with the even number or uneven numbers.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: And then here, y-you – you went straight, you came out to the gate.</span> <span id="s998">And on this side was a lot of times a cappella, you know, music playing, and g – the German Jews from Vienna, they had an orchestra and they played.</span> <span id="s999">And on the other side the – on the other side was the crematorium, and the crematorium burned the people.</span> <span id="s1000">A lot of times the Swiss cross, the Red Cross came to a – to inspect – for inspection, so-called inspection.</span> <span id="s1001">So, you know how funny it was, here they burn people, and here – here they – they played the music of bo – Goethe and Bach and Mozart, whatever they used to play that for the – for the muse – musicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Were those very close to each other, the little orchestra and the crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: No, no, crematorium was on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: They just – completely different sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: This was – here was the orchestra, and here, on other side was a – here was the barracks, on the uneven numbered, then the even numbered, and that was a – an electric fence.</span> <span id="s1008">And that’s – on the other side was the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Okay, so very far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: So here was playing the music, and the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: How often did the music play?</span> <span id="s1012">A: When – specially when they came there from the si – from Switzerland, the Red Cross for ins – for inspection.</span> <span id="s1013">And now they came over to you and asked you some question, you couldn’t say anything bad, because the German is standing right there.</span> <span id="s1014">You say something bad, yo-you were so much afraid that you were shivering when you see those Gestapo.</span> <span id="s1015">That’s how bad –</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: – bad they were.</span> <span id="s1018">But another thing, the ra – the – the Red Cross, right, used to give packages for the inmates, was Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, Romanian inmates, you know.</span> <span id="s1019">Except, only Jews did not get Red Cross packages.</span> <span id="s1020">Would you believe that?</span> <span id="s1021">This is from Switzerland, the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1022">They knew about it.</span> <span id="s1023">Now we had – is – what was a Red Cross package?</span> <span id="s1024">Was a piece of chocolate, maybe a couple of cigarettes, a – some fruit or sa – some cake or cookies, whatever it was, it was a package.</span> <span id="s1025">But that was a – if you would give me a million dollars, and you would ask me, what do you want, the Red Cross package, or you want the million dollars?</span> <span id="s1026">I wouldn’t take the million dollars, because you – you couldn’t do anything with a million dollars there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did the be –</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: The piece of bread was the million dollars, because you knew that you’re gonna survive another day, because you have enough to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Did the Red Cross people give them to the Lithuanians, etcetera, directly, or did the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Everybody except Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: But did the Red Cross people give them to you, or did the Red Cross people give them to the Germans to give to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Okay, the Red Cross gave them to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: And they came with the trucks, and they came in, because in some of the places there were Jews mixed in with the Lithuanians also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: So the Jews had to go this way, and they – only Ukraines could come, and rush – there were Russians also in the concentration camp; they got a package, but not the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: So the Red Cross may not have known that the Jews didn’t get a package?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: I don’t think so, they – they knew quite well what was going on.</span> <span id="s1039">They – believe me, if they would have wanted to give Jews the – the Red Cross packages, they would have gotten it too, but they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1040">They were the Red Cross only for the world to, you know – as I said, here is the crematoriums, and here was playing the music.</span> <span id="s1041">You mean to tell me they didn’t know?</span> <span id="s1042">They knew what was going on in th – over there in the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Were they ever taken over there to see that, or was the camp ever cleaned up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: I-I – that, I cannot tell you that, because it – we couldn’t even communicate with them, or something, tell them, because we were afraid.</span> <span id="s1045">If you were – say that – how the Germans treat you, that’s it, you wouldn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1046">A-As soon as they – they leave, they – they take care of you for good.</span> <span id="s1047">Very famous for that.</span> <span id="s1048">As a matter of fact, when I was working outside, we had to, you know, we plant a little flowers there, and fa – to make – make believe, to show the world that – how nice the concentration camp looks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: But they told me what to do, I had to do it.</span> <span id="s1051">I seen some Arab – Arabs, you know, with the – with the [indecipherable] like the Arabs dress with the togas and everything, with those long dresses.</span> <span id="s1052">There was maybe half a dozen of them, you know.</span> <span id="s1053">I didn’t know who those Arabs were, but I – I knew that it must be Arabs, because I see wit the – the dress, I knew the ho – the Arab dress with the ki-ki – peyah(ph), or whatever they call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Were they prisoners in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: This was the mufti from Jerusalem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: He was a friend of Hitler.</span> <span id="s1060">He went to Berlin, and asked Hitler to build crematoriums in Israel.</span> <span id="s1061">That time it wasn’t Israel, it was pales – Palestine, because he also wanted to annihilate the Jews, because they wanted to take over a-al-all – all Israel that ti – all the – the ho – how did I find – that – ho-how did I find out?</span> <span id="s1062">When I was liberated after the war – you know, I lived in Germany – ow – I came to this country in 1950, and I was liberated in 1945, so around five years I lived in Germany.</span> <span id="s1063">So I used to, you know, I used to in the morning, used to get up, used to get the newspapers.</span> <span id="s1064">I take a look, there was a picture from – from those guys, in SS in Auschwitz, inspecting.</span> <span id="s1065">And then a-all the whole story, that the mufti ran to Berlin from there and asked Hitler to build crematoriums to – to kill Jews and – an-and things in – in – in Israel.</span> <span id="s1066">Or Palestine in those days.</span> <span id="s1067">So that – that’s – that’s – I still remember that.</span> <span id="s1068">Okay, from there, now a – it came to a point that everybody wanted to get out from Auschwitz, from Birkenau, because to see that crematorium, every time you looked at it, it reminded you of death.</span> <span id="s1069">So we said, oh, as soon as you can, just get out from there, get out from there.</span> <span id="s1070">Now, I made friends, we were three kids, we were holding like in a group, because sometimes you had to be protected from other people.</span> <span id="s1071">Because sometimes you had a piece of bread, they – they could rip it out from your hands even, sometime.</span> <span id="s1072">No, you can’t blame people, they didn’t have no control.</span> <span id="s1073">Some people had a lot of control.</span> <span id="s1074">Let’s take, for instance myself.</span> <span id="s1075">I wouldn’t pick up something from the garbage that’s – was ra – half rotten, something, I wouldn’t pick it up, I would leave it.</span> <span id="s1076">Some people didn’t care, they – they took it and – or – or not only that, a lot of times people – the dead bodies, they used to throw them out by the door, and there was people that used to pick them up and bring them to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1077">But this is already not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1078">From there, from Auschwitz, we went to Birkenau – to Chebene(ph) Trzebinia –</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Trzebinia.</span> <span id="s1081">There was an oil refinery, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: How did you – did you go there every day, or were – were you moved there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, we moved –</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: You see, Auschwitz was like in the center, and around Auschwitz was different concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1086">Kat – Auschwitz, Katowice, Monowice, Buna, Trzebinia.</span> <span id="s1087">And let’s say ich – they needed workers, they called up Auschwitz, and Auschwitz supplied them the workers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: And Trzebinia is just a little north of it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Tribi – yeah, Trzebinia was a concentration camp, we worked in a oil refinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: See, the – the Germans used to bring in from rome – from Romanian oil, and they used to refine it for the airplanes to fly, because you know, the airplane needs – you cannot use for airplanes the same oil what’s used for a car – the same gasoline, it had to be very fine oil refined.</span> <span id="s1092">So we used to work in the refinery.</span> <span id="s1093">But I’ll tell you, the – we worked there, but every morning, every morning when the skies were clean, you knew that – that the planes will come and bomb th-the refinery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: British planes, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: British and American planes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">A: Now, a lot of times I was standing outside, when I looked up I could tell you the serial number, that’s how low they were flying.</span> <span id="s1098">And they were flying straight across the crematoriums.</span> <span id="s1099">You know why I’m saying that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: They were flying straight across the crematoriums?</span> <span id="s1102">Because they – they asked the British, because when they used to go on missions, let’s say to bomb in Romania and things like this, and they flew through Auschwitz, they always used to come back with – with – with bombs.</span> <span id="s1103">They said, why don’t you bomb the crematorium?</span> <span id="s1104">They begged the British.</span> <span id="s1105">They said, we cannot interfere with the war efforts, because this takes too much time.</span> <span id="s1106">Baloney!</span> <span id="s1107">They were flying – this was the crematoriums, they were flying straight through the cremator – only had to open the cockpit and drop a couple of bombs a-and annihilate the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Do you think they would have killed a lot of other people though, a lot of the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: They told them, don’t worry, even if you kill inmates or not, they – most of them i – a lot of people were got killed either way, one way or another.</span> <span id="s1110">The transports used to come in every day.</span> <span id="s1111">So i-if they wouldn’t have the crematoriums, they couldn – they couldn’t annihilate so many people in a – in a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: It wa – would be a harder task for them to do.</span> <span id="s1114">But like this it was a killing machine, it was a – everything was going automatically like – like today the computers with push button, everything was going there.</span> <span id="s1115">So they – but the British wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1116">So that’s – that’s another story.</span> <span id="s1117">They – they – they could tell the world that it was too much to fly – to go over there, to fl – to go t – and bomb the crematoriums, but they didn’t have to go there, they were flying through anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: But they would bomb the oil refinery in Trzebinia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: No, they used to go out further –</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: They would fly over, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: – further out and bi – I don’t know, military places –</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: – I don’t know exactly what they did, what their mission were.</span> <span id="s1124">But they used to fly through Auschwitz every day, if it was a nice day.</span> <span id="s1125">So that’s – they were lying to the world because they flew – because they said, it takes too much to go to Auschwitz with – to fly – but they were going through anyway.</span> <span id="s1126">All they had to do – and they would beg them.</span> <span id="s1127">Then they had, oh, we would have killed a lot of innocent people.</span> <span id="s1128">They said, don’t worry about tha – killing innocent people.</span> <span id="s1129">If – if you were gonna bomb those crematoriums, less people will die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1131">Do you think there were any ge – did you see any German efforts to shoot down the planes, or did they just let them go –</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: It was already – that was already in ‘44, so the Germans knew already that they getting –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: – not gonna – bec-became a world power, because they were used to saying [sings in German] Well, today belongs germ – German to us, and tomorrow the whole world is gonna belong – that’s what they used to sing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: What part of 1944, like middle, end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Well, when I was already – that – when we left Auschwitz I was – that – that time, that must have been July, aug – July, August, something like that.</span> <span id="s1139">Now we were there July, August, September, October, November, December, January the 17th we left, because the Russians came already, very, very, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Of ‘45?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: So – but, I’ll tell you one more thing that – what happened in between.</span> <span id="s1144">One day, it was – I remember it was very, very, very cold, it could be like November, December, you know, in Poland it’s very cold and very harsh [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1145">One kid got lost, because where we – when we went to work they counted us, and when we came in they counted us, in order to know if somebody did – ran away or something.</span> <span id="s1146">They always watch from – from the guards, you know, we always surrounded by guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: And this was still Trzebinia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: This is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: In Trzebinia –</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: – yeah, in Trzebinia.</span> <span id="s1153">So, it was – usually, we used to go home like six, sometimes 5:30, it was already nice and dark.</span> <span id="s1154">But one is missing.</span> <span id="s1155">So, we were standing there and then come – they called up the headquarters for – and from – in the camp, and the – the main guy, he was a obersturmfuehrer, in German that’s – was his rank.</span> <span id="s1156">I don’t know whether it was like a major, hul – I don’t remember exactly –</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Someone high up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Right, higher up.</span> <span id="s1159">He was the top guys, and he came running with the motorcycle.</span> <span id="s1160">And it was also snowing, you know, it was cold.</span> <span id="s1161">Now you walked in the [crunching noise] the snow was breaking under your feet.</span> <span id="s1162">And the wind was blowing, and we were standing there and we jumping up and down, because you had to do something, otherwise – so what happened, we were standing at least two, three hours outside, and it – he said, if you can – not gonna find this guy, you’re gonna stay til in the morning, and we have to find the guy.</span> <span id="s1163">So what happened, the guy went in the bathroom, fall asleep in the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1164">He was so weak, he fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1165">They did – luckily they didn’t touch him even, because when they took him out, he wa – he hardly – he couldn’t even walk.</span> <span id="s1166">They had to shu – drag him to – to walk so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: So the Germans found him in the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: No, no we were there – we were all –</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: – we went to look all over, because there was those big tanks, you know.</span> <span id="s1171">And somebody went into the bathroom, he had to make a pee or whatever, so he fou – he was sleeping on – on the thing.</span> <span id="s1172">He fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1173">He was so weak, you know, he fall asleep.</span> <span id="s1174">So that was a night t-to remember.</span> <span id="s1175">And then 1945, as I said, January 17, we left Trzebinia.</span> <span id="s1176">That was the death mar – they call it the death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: Can we go back just a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: What kind of work did you do in the oil refinery, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: In oil refinery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1183">That’s a good question, which I missed.</span> <span id="s1184">Number one, the water level in Trzebinia was very high, like Florida.</span> <span id="s1185">You dig a little bit, you hit water, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: No basements.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Right, no basement, that’s correct.</span> <span id="s1188">Over there it was also, the water level was high, so they had pipes that runs, you know, t-to – the control there was heated pipes for the oil, they needed so – I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s1189">Because when I came already, the oil refinery didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1190">They put up a wi – a-a-after that they came almost every day, as I said, when the skies were nice and clear, planes would come, or Americans, or – or British, they used to come to bomb everything.</span> <span id="s1191">When they left, we had to clean up again.</span> <span id="s1192">That’s what we did always, clean up, build up a wall, they came and smashed it again.</span> <span id="s1193">So there was not – no production.</span> <span id="s1194">But they still did – the Germans still the last moment, didn’t give up.</span> <span id="s1195">So what we had to take – yeah, in the wintertime was very cold, so they had to take the pipes and go down another couple of feet, about six feet.</span> <span id="s1196">The pipes had to be lowered down into the ground.</span> <span id="s1197">So when we used to dig up, the water used to come right away.</span> <span id="s1198">So there was a pump – a pump, and one side was a guy, a kid and me, and we were going up and down like this, and pump the water, that’s what we did the whole day, up and down, up and down, til they changed us and some other kids came that also do work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Did you get any breaks for bathroom or food, like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Well, ba – the food over there, they used to give you a lunch, soup, and in the morning was coffee and they give you a piece of bread with a piece of cheese or meat, whatever.</span> <span id="s1201">And at night they give you a soup again.</span> <span id="s1202">So, is manageable.</span> <span id="s1203">But that’s what I said, I never liked to change.</span> <span id="s1204">Because some people used to change for a cigarette, you know?</span> <span id="s1205">I said no, I’m not changing, I’m not doing anything, and that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s1206">But, there was an advantage to work with those pumps.</span> <span id="s1207">You know why?</span> <span id="s1208">Because pa – people went to work in something, they see a little kid, 12 years old, wo – you know, skinny, bones, so you could count the bones, so they used to throw him a sandwich, or they used to throw him a piece of bread or an apple.</span> <span id="s1209">One day, I-I was – I was working and a guy, a farmer, he wa – he was – had the little wagon with two wheels and one horse.</span> <span id="s1210">And he seen me, he had cabbage on the – on the wagon, he threw me a cabbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Is this like a Polish farmer that was going –</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: – it must be a Polish farmer, but you know, he’s – he watch, you know, what he should see, he throw a cabbage.</span> <span id="s1215">Okay.</span> <span id="s1216">I took that cabbage, I almost died from that cabbage, cause you know, your stomach is very weak.</span> <span id="s1217">And I – but I had – we were three kids, and we had a deal between us.</span> <span id="s1218">If you go to work and you get a piece of bread, we divide it in three pieces.</span> <span id="s1219">I got my third, I gave to other kid and the other kid.</span> <span id="s1220">And he got something, we were all together all the time, til liberation we were together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Hm, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: Some other kids seen that we get along so good, they also tried – tried the same thing, but it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1223">Because if you are not honest – like one kid is – we came home, there were the three, he says, oh I didn’t – I didn't – today I didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s1224">The other kids says oh, he is lying, I seen him, he got a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1225">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1226">That was finished.</span> <span id="s1227">So they couldn’t trust [indecipherable] us, til the last moment we were together, because we were honest to one another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Did – did you meet these two other boys in the camp, or did you know them before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: No, I met them in the camp, in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Okay, you didn’t know them before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Okay, one was from England, one was – and two were from Poland.</span> <span id="s1234">Now, from England, how did he get into – to this business, in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s1235">He went for a wedding, he had an aunt, or somebody got married.</span> <span id="s1236">So he went to the wedding, but the Germans wouldn’t – they caught him, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1237">It just happened the Germans took over.</span> <span id="s1238">He came in, but he couldn’t get out no more.</span> <span id="s1239">So they put him in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1240">So when we were liberated, he spoke fluently English, because he was born in England.</span> <span id="s1241">But right away, soon after – after liberation, he went to the British embassy and they took him right away, took him back home.</span> <span id="s1242">So that was after liberation already.</span> <span id="s1243">That – well, I’ll come to the liberation, I’m gonna tell you more in details.</span> <span id="s1244">Now, okay, so now we were on the death march, they used to call it.</span> <span id="s1245">As we were marching – was also, January 17 in Poland is very, very, very cold.</span> <span id="s1246">Very cold.</span> <span id="s1247">And there was twin brothers, two twins.</span> <span id="s1248">I mean, two kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: A set of twins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Twin – yeah, twins.</span> <span id="s1251">And one had an infection o-on his foot, and he couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s1252">So they dragged him, he dragged him, but then finally he says, it’s no way, no way, I can’t even pick my foot up, never mind walking.</span> <span id="s1253">So he sit down, and the guy was a Romanian guard.</span> <span id="s1254">This guy must have been six feet tall a ver – tall – very tall guy.</span> <span id="s1255">In other words, he wasn’t walking straight, he was walking like this, bent, and he more than six feet.</span> <span id="s1256">He says, why don’t you walk?</span> <span id="s1257">So the boy says, I can’t walk.</span> <span id="s1258">He took the gun, shoot him right there.</span> <span id="s1259">You, the brother.</span> <span id="s1260">He says, I’m not gonna leave my brother.</span> <span id="s1261">Shoot him too.</span> <span id="s1262">So that’s the reason they call it death march, it was not only one incident, was a lot of incidents, because they call it death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: As we were walking – we were walking towards Gliwice, there was a – a big station, you know, where the trains were going all over – all over Europe from the – from that place we had to walk towards Gliwice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: How long did you walk for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Okay, w-w-we – we left at night Trzebinia, we walked the whole night, and we walked maybe a half a day, but i-in between you were resting, you know.</span> <span id="s1267">Let’s say it came to – at one point they says, okay, and we – we had to go in the field, because the German, the army had always the right of way.</span> <span id="s1268">Whatever they – if they came, we had to move to the thing.</span> <span id="s1269">So mostly w-we were standing in the fields, and walking til they – they cleared for us the road.</span> <span id="s1270">When they are finished, then we started to walk, so we have to wait.</span> <span id="s1271">So i-it – I think it was a night and a day, something like that, til we a – we arrived already to Gliwice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Did you and your friends survive the march?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: We were – yeah, li-listen to this, what happened.</span> <span id="s1274">So then it was – maybe it was 12 o’clock or one o’clock at night, and the Germans said okay, we go to this field here, you could lay down and you could take a nap, and we gonna walk in the morning, continue walking in the morning.</span> <span id="s1275">But we were there maybe a half an hour, or maybe an hour tops, they said you cannot stay, we have to go – because we heard already the shots from the – from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1276">The cannons and machine gun, you could hear already they were shooting from far away.</span> <span id="s1277">But in between, I had – he wasn’t my friend, but I knew him fo-for – because we were together in Auschwitz and then we came to Trzebinia, so I knew – I knew the kid.</span> <span id="s1278">He was an – he was a little bit older than me, he must have been 15 - 16 - 17, I don’t know exactly, but something in that age.</span> <span id="s1279">And he says he’s gonna lay down.</span> <span id="s1280">I says, don’t lay down, because you gonna lay down, you never gonna get up, you gonna freeze to death.</span> <span id="s1281">You see all the kids, they jumping up and down and do this, and all kind of exercise, because to feel a little bit warm.</span> <span id="s1282">I don’t care, he says, no more.</span> <span id="s1283">I says – he lay down.</span> <span id="s1284">I ran to my kids and I told them, and then we to-took some other kids, we grabbed him and we says, you not gonna lay – you not gonna lay down here, because you gonna be liberated, and believe me, the guy was liberated and he wa – just lay down, and we – we wouldn’t – he says, if you gonna lay down on, we gonna – we gonna hit you.</span> <span id="s1285">Don’t lay down, because you gonna lay down you know what, you never gonna get up.</span> <span id="s1286">As soon as we had that fight, suddenly the Germans said, we have to leave right away.</span> <span id="s1287">So we marched further.</span> <span id="s1288">He couldn’t lay down no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: And – but we did something else.</span> <span id="s1291">We, let’s say three or four – four guys, or five guys, in the middle, we exchanged.</span> <span id="s1292">The middle guy was able to walk and sleep, and we were holding like together, you know, and then we exchanged.</span> <span id="s1293">And then, let’s say you were next, you went in the middle, and the other guy, that’s how, you know, we exchanged to sleep a little bit.</span> <span id="s1294">You could close your eyes and relax a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1296">How long do you think you did that for?</span> <span id="s1297">Like an hour or two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Well, til – til in – til in the morning, til you know, til we could – by then we stopped already, in the morning we stopped, and yeah, in between, that’s very important.</span> <span id="s1299">There was, in the gutter, you know there was on s – this gutter on this side, and the middle was the road.</span> <span id="s1300">I see from far away, I see a big coat laying on the floor, a heavy coat, a winter coat.</span> <span id="s1301">I says to myself, I’m gonna pick up that coat.</span> <span id="s1302">Must be a big guy who had that coat, you know, a big, heavy coat.</span> <span id="s1303">My friend said, are you crazy, you’re gonna schlep this coat?</span> <span id="s1304">But you – you hardly could walk already and everybody could run, you gonna schlep that big coat?</span> <span id="s1305">I said, that coat is gonna be a lifesaver, remember.</span> <span id="s1306">And I wouldn't give it up.</span> <span id="s1307">I said, I’m gonna take.</span> <span id="s1308">You don’t have to ca – if you want to carry it, fine.</span> <span id="s1309">You don’t want to carry it, I’m gonna carry it all the – but th-they helped me out, they – because we three were together.</span> <span id="s1310">What wer – one did – had, the other wouldn’t let us down, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: So, it was just sitting on the side of the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Was laying on the lo – somebody throw it away, I don’t know, was a good, heavy coat, really, was this thick of a coat.</span> <span id="s1313">And it was warm, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Hm, about an inch or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: But listen – listen, this coat saved our lives.</span> <span id="s1316">So when we arrived to Gliwice, the Germans put us on – on open wagons, railroad, you know, cars.</span> <span id="s1317">No – no roof on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Just slats, kind of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Nothing, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1322">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1323">Like a – your car hasn’t got no roof?</span> <span id="s1324">Same thing, the railroad has no – no roof.</span> <span id="s1325">And the snow was this high up inside.</span> <span id="s1326">So how could we lay down?</span> <span id="s1327">So the German says, take with the hand, shovel out the snow.</span> <span id="s1328">With the hand.</span> <span id="s1329">We didn't have no shovels.</span> <span id="s1330">We had to do, because you know, otherwise, lay down in the snow.</span> <span id="s1331">Well, I want to tell you something, that the – the death march wasn’t as bad as the [indecipherable] march, because we – when they put us on those o-open wagons – when the train was standing was not so bad yet, you know, but when that train started to roll, and s – I don’t know how fast that train was going, at least I – I’m sure, 40 - 50 miles, and that wind was so strong, you know, that you c – you couldn’t breathe sometimes.</span> <span id="s1332">And in the morning when we got up, more than half of the – of those people were dead.</span> <span id="s1333">They – they – they died, what do you call that, from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Frostbite?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: No – that was worse, worse than frostbite.</span> <span id="s1336">There – there’s a special name, I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Oh, hypothermia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: Hypothermia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: They died from hypo – they went to sleep, never got up.</span> <span id="s1341">So now, with all those bodies, they said, just throw them out.</span> <span id="s1342">The train was moving, we just throw out, because they running.</span> <span id="s1343">From Poland they – we were going towards Germany at this time.</span> <span id="s1344">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: How many people do you think were on the march with you?</span> <span id="s1346">Is it like a couple of barracks worth, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Oh, the – the – the – the – there was march from – from different camps also, they – we got together, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: I really don’t know, but it was in the thousands, I think.</span> <span id="s1350">I don’t – I cannot give you a number, because I didn’t know th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: So, masses of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: – a lot of people were ta – were walking.</span> <span id="s1353">But as I said, the train ride was worse than the march.</span> <span id="s1354">More people died on the trains than on the march from hypothermia.</span> <span id="s1355">Now here comes that coat that I br – brought.</span> <span id="s1356">We’re three small kids – comparing to other people, you know.</span> <span id="s1357">I – we put down the thing, we covered ourself up with that coat.</span> <span id="s1358">We’re sitting on the snow, still we’re frozen sitting, but at least the wind – the wind killed those people.</span> <span id="s1359">The wind was so cold that they died of hypothermia.</span> <span id="s1360">And then we just had to throw out the bodies, and – so finally, from there, from – after r-riding on – yeah, and there was – see, the Germans, they – they had a canteen, you know, they get some food, whatever they got, I don’t know, but we didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s1361">And when the train stopped to let us o – beca – there’s certain points the train stopped, so we had to go to the bathroom or something.</span> <span id="s1362">But if not, you s – you could do it on the train, we were ki – it didn’t bother – nobody bot – would bother you if you did it.</span> <span id="s1363">And sometimes you hadn’t got no choice.</span> <span id="s1364">You had to do what you have to do.</span> <span id="s1365">Nature doesn’t ask questions.</span> <span id="s1366">You have to run, you have to run.</span> <span id="s1367">So, after that, we came to – we went to Oranienburg.</span> <span id="s1368">Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg [indecipherable] Berlin.</span> <span id="s1369">So, we stood there for – for about a week or two, but then they had to ship us further, so we wind up in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Where did you stay in Sachsenhausen, did you have barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: Tha – those – the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: And a – it was a la – a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Did – did you have barracks, though, or were you just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Yeah, we had barracks –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: – barrack – at least it was nice and warm there.</span> <span id="s1378">We – we recuperated a little bit from all that cold, you know?</span> <span id="s1379">And they give us some food there, so it – it was – it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s1380">You could – we could survive there already.</span> <span id="s1381">So this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So you didn’t really do anything else there, it was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: No, no, that was really the wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: – recuperating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: – the – the Germans knew that they lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: You know, it was towards the end of the – close to the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1388">Because I was liberated in April 28th.</span> <span id="s1389">So, we left from there the 17th January.</span> <span id="s1390">So January – January, February, March, April.</span> <span id="s1391">So, we were already close to – January, fe – end of February, be – like beginning of March.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Then they send us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1394">If I see never – you know, sometimes you ask people, how long were you in the camp?</span> <span id="s1395">Some guys, oh, I’m fa – I was five years in the camp.</span> <span id="s1396">Then I ask somebody, how long were you?</span> <span id="s1397">Oh, I was a year or two years, whatever it is, but I’ll tell you one thing, when we arrived to Bergen-Belsen – here is the story: I a – we arrived there, it was already like, I don’t know exactly, but around four, five o’clock.</span> <span id="s1398">First of all, we came into a barrack, no – no beds, no bunk beds, nothing.</span> <span id="s1399">Wherever you are, s-say tha – I – it just happened I was in the – in the corridor like here in – in – in th – in the front, I lay down there.</span> <span id="s1400">And there was not far, the bathroom was also a little further.</span> <span id="s1401">One pipe busted, and I got up in the morning, oh everybody was wake up all wet.</span> <span id="s1402">Now imagine, cold, wet – [phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: Now, pause for a second.</span> <span id="s1404">[tape break] Okay.</span> <span id="s1405">All right.</span> <span id="s1406">Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s1407">How did the – wh-when the pipe –</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: Oh, Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: In Bergen-Belsen, when the pipe exploded, was it just a pipe of excrement, or water?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: No, no, no, the pipe busted from the – from the – it was so cold, froze.</span> <span id="s1413">It froze, the pipe froze –</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: – and it – it start shooting out the thing, but I was sleeping, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1416">And when I woke up, I was so tired, knocked out, that nothing bothered me.</span> <span id="s1417">I lay down on the cement, believe me, I slept better than I sleep in in a nice bed here in my house, over there, that’s how tired you were.</span> <span id="s1418">On the cement.</span> <span id="s1419">Didn’t mean anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Did the pipe have water, or excrement, or what was in the pipe, everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: From a toilet.</span> <span id="s1422">I da – I – I cannot tell you.</span> <span id="s1423">I know it was wet, and it smelled also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1426">I was used to those things.</span> <span id="s1427">It didn’t – didn’t even bother me that – but alright, I felt the wet.</span> <span id="s1428">So, after a couple of hours it dried out and you wen – you were back in business.</span> <span id="s1429">In the morning, a kapo – kapo means like an overseer that was – usually the kapos mean that, from the group of people they choosed out, and they were cooperating most with the Germans too, you know.</span> <span id="s1430">So he came with – with two Germans, and they had guns, those big guns, you know.</span> <span id="s1431">And – a ri – I mean a rifle, they call it a rifle here.</span> <span id="s1432">And they said, we need s – we need about 15 - 20 people, and you gonna get good food, and we need volunteers.</span> <span id="s1433">So they said good food, I says, oh my God, I’m – I was really hungry, you know, hungry, wet and then thirsty, you name it, anything.</span> <span id="s1434">So I said okay, I’m going, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Did your friends volunteer with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Did your friends volunteer with you?</span> <span id="s1438">With –</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: M-My – one – from my friends, we got divided for awhile, beca – we got together on the next camps.</span> <span id="s1440">We met up in another camp.</span> <span id="s1441">Because sometimes you were standing, and they said, here is cut off, and that’s it, you couldn’t go back no more.</span> <span id="s1442">But i – when I came to aux – all right, I’m coming soon ri – to the next camp.</span> <span id="s1443">So, we were march – Bergen-Belsen was a long camp.</span> <span id="s1444">And over there there were women and children and men together.</span> <span id="s1445">See, in Auschwitz, the – each female was separately, men was separately, children were separate – children from 12 an-and up to 15 or something like that.</span> <span id="s1446">Here was everything mixed in together.</span> <span id="s1447">How did I know?</span> <span id="s1448">Because we walked – I don’t know, I – it was quite a walk.</span> <span id="s1449">I don’t know in mile how much it was, a quarter, or a half a mile or something like that.</span> <span id="s1450">And we came to a barrack, and there was a big grave dug outside.</span> <span id="s1451">Big, you know, with the bulldozer it was dug.</span> <span id="s1452">And then they went and opened up the door from the – from the barrack.</span> <span id="s1453">Bodies from the top to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s1454">Women, children, men, everything, dead bodies.</span> <span id="s1455">We had to drag out those bodies and throw them in that – in that – to the – in the – that grave.</span> <span id="s1456">And as soon as they opened up, the stink was so bad that, I didn’t have what to vomit, but I just – it came like vomiting.</span> <span id="s1457">It was – the stink was so bad, it’s just – I don’t know how – those bodies were rotten already there.</span> <span id="s1458">And they didn’t give you no gloves, no mask, nothing with you.</span> <span id="s1459">And a lot of times you pulled a hand, and the hand remained in your hand.</span> <span id="s1460">So, you know, it’s – it’s unbelievable [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1461">And what – what do you think they gave us to eat?</span> <span id="s1462">Big nothing.</span> <span id="s1463">We went back, when we came to the c – back to the original thing, to the barracks, we had s – they gave us a little soup, and that’s about it.</span> <span id="s1464">And then they had the nerve to come and say we need more volunteers.</span> <span id="s1465">You know what I did?</span> <span id="s1466">I ra – hide myself under – under the barracks.</span> <span id="s1467">You know, there’s a empty space, like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: I crawled in, myself with another guy.</span> <span id="s1470">We said, oh I’m not – I’m not going if they give me the best food on the world.</span> <span id="s1471">Because wa – that stink was bad, and those bodies – I mean, the bodies didn’t bother me already because you seen at the – you seen it all the time.</span> <span id="s1472">So, I says no, they not gonna get me no more there.</span> <span id="s1473">In Bergen-Belsen, we were a short time.</span> <span id="s1474">I don’t know, maybe a week?</span> <span id="s1475">Tops, two weeks, or 10 days, I really do – honestly don’t remember exactly how many days.</span> <span id="s1476">From there we went to Horgau, Augsburg.</span> <span id="s1477">Augsburg was Messerschmitt, we work for the air – by airplanes, you know, wa – in parts.</span> <span id="s1478">Let’s say they give you a part, and y – there was marked here and here a couple of marks, and you had to drill those holes.</span> <span id="s1479">Now here already was a different – h-here already you were a – in – in – in th – in Horgau, I don’t know, I think there was, for prisoners, used to be there before, prisoners, like soldiers, maybe British, who knows?</span> <span id="s1480">I don’t know what kind of briti – prisoners.</span> <span id="s1481">At least we got – we got already – there was bunk beds, you know, and they give you some food rela – but then everyday – and that’s where I met my two friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: They were already there, inside.</span> <span id="s1484">So right away I s – I came in and I was ready – they already knew whats was going on because instead of going to Bergen-Belsen they went straight, they didn’t make Bergen-Belsen, which, believe me, thanks God they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: But there’s – that was the worst camp.</span> <span id="s1487">There’s no way that a man could survive there, never mind a year, but even months he couldn’t survive that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: Did many people that you were with when you got into Bergen-Belsen go with you also to Augsburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Well, this barrack where I went, there, the whole barrack went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Okay, from Bergen-Belsen to Augsburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: From Bergen-Belsen to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: – to Horgau.</span> <span id="s1494">Now Horgau, we – we slept there and we were – train took us every day to – to Augsburg was the Messerschmitt.</span> <span id="s1495">But what we did, 12 o’clock til one o’clock, the guard that used to guard us inside there, they used to go for – for lunch.</span> <span id="s1496">So, he was a – was a wooden wall fr-from boards, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: So what we did, we – in – in the other s – on the other side, let’s say this was the – the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: On this side we used to work, in – in this side they used to keep the parts.</span> <span id="s1501">Raw parts or finish parts.</span> <span id="s1502">On the bottom, used to pull away a – a board and used to climb in, and they took out the finish parts and put back the raw parts.</span> <span id="s1503">Because we knew the Germans, they were – they come back, they come back one o’clock, so we knew that nobody was watching us, so we could do this.</span> <span id="s1504">So we made like a sabotage, you know?</span> <span id="s1505">Not to be – so instead, let’s say they give you 50 parts to make those holes, so you put back 30 or 40 parts, and we took already made 40 - 50 parts.</span> <span id="s1506">Because if you didn’t make your quota, you didn’t get to eat.</span> <span id="s1507">That was their – their motive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: So, but we fool them, and it was going on – but we weren’t there in Augsburg either, too long.</span> <span id="s1510">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: They never noticed the sabotage, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: No, they – they couldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1513">There were so many parts there, so they didn't know if I took in, or took out, or whatever I did, we made believe, we put the same thing wer – they put there th-the raw – the unfinished parts, we put in the same place, and then we took off the – from – there was, in the thousands and thousands of parts that they di – they couldn’t know.</span> <span id="s1514">If they would have caught you in the middle, you would have had a big problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: And you only did it when they were on their lunch break?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: On-Only in the lunch [indecipherable] but we had to work very fast.</span> <span id="s1517">And then we – we came is – so he gave you a little paper that you finish your quota, for in the parts, and you got a – a – a meal.</span> <span id="s1518">The – the – the meal was – was pretty good, I mean, co-comparing to concentration camp meal, was – was not bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: What did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: We used to get horsemeat sometimes.</span> <span id="s1521">The horsemeat tastes very good, sweet, or they gave us soup.</span> <span id="s1522">In the soup a little horsemeat, or things like that, or sometimes they give you a cheese, or – they call it Blutwurst, you know, in German.</span> <span id="s1523">Blutwur – you know what wurst is?</span> <span id="s1524">Like salami with blood mixed into it, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: We are not allowed to have blood, you know, Jewish people, the – this is one of the biggest things, that you’re not supposed to have blood and – but over there, anything went, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: You had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: – if they were to give us dog meat, or – or rat meat, or who knows what, they – you had to eat it, because you didn’t have anything else.</span> <span id="s1529">You had to eat what they gave it to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: So you pretty much gave up on the kashrut laws at that point, yeah.</span> <span id="s1531">You had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: There’s no such a thing.</span> <span id="s1533">No such a thing.</span> <span id="s1534">You couldn’t do anything there.</span> <span id="s1535">Well anyway, one day they decided – now I’m coming already, this was already to – towards the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: It must be an end – like in middle April already, something like that.</span> <span id="s1538">We were s – they told us that we have to go to Dachau, because here in Augsburg we cannot stay no more, we have to go to Dachau.</span> <span id="s1539">Dachau had a concentration camp, Dachau had the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1540">And, what we find out is, they di – wanted to annihilate all the people, and the last time that – because we knew all what was – was going on, and they knew that the Americans were very – coming close, because we – I was liberated from Americans.</span> <span id="s1541">Some people were liberated from Russians, some people were liberated from British, but I was liberated from the Americans.</span> <span id="s1542">So, next day they give an extra portion, because they had some leftover, whatever it is, and we are going towards Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Did you have to walk, or did they put you on a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Walk, walk, walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: No more train riding.</span> <span id="s1547">Walking.</span> <span id="s1548">We were walking, I had my shoes, you know those wooden shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: They call it Holland derkus(ph), you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: Little clogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: And this rot my foot, it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1555">So I took it and I throw them away, I said, I bar – I cannot walk in it, because it rot my – my foot.</span> <span id="s1556">You know, if you have a soft shoe, it gives.</span> <span id="s1557">Wood doesn’t give.</span> <span id="s1558">And if it doesn’t give and you walk, you pull your foot and you scrape your foot and it get infected.</span> <span id="s1559">So I threw them away, I was walking barefoot.</span> <span id="s1560">They didn't – they didn’t care, they couldn’t care less what you did, already, it was, you know, they knew already this is the end, this is the end.</span> <span id="s1561">So we walked til about – we walked a whole day, and at night, maybe we – no, it couldn’t be that we walked half, because that’s – or maybe it was two days we walked, and then the last night.</span> <span id="s1562">Because we walked to the middle – to the middle, and we couldn’t go no more, because we seen the airplanes coming, and little American planes, those little planes.</span> <span id="s1563">And used to give the [indecipherable], because they were alrea – we were surrounded already with Americans, but we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1564">But I seen the American planes, and th-that – the white star, you know, and I still didn’t know if it’s American or not, but we knew it was a friendly plane.</span> <span id="s1565">And the Germans didn’t shoot at them, but they were hiding also.</span> <span id="s1566">When the American – the planes came, they were hiding under the ho – because they had a canteen, you know, like a kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: With two wheels, and there was soup for them, for the – for the germ – only for the army, not for us.</span> <span id="s1569">For us, forget it, we didn’t ha – we didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s1570">But we’ve passed by, sometimes, i-in a field or a – find some corn or things.</span> <span id="s1571">But hardly anything.</span> <span id="s1572">A matter of fact, there was wheat – people eat – a lot of people were hungry, they chewed what horses eat, what do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: A little grass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Not grass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Was it cud, something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Yeah, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: And i-it’s – it’s very sharp on two edges.</span> <span id="s1579">Is a point here o-o-on the front and the back.</span> <span id="s1580">And it punctured their stomach.</span> <span id="s1581">People died from – the last minute people died from it punctured their stomach.</span> <span id="s1582">And then they said, do not eat that stuff because it’s gonna kill you.</span> <span id="s1583">Between us, you know?</span> <span id="s1584">Was doctors there, or people that they knew what – what happens, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: What did you find to eat?</span> <span id="s1586">Or did you find anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: I – I – I – I-I – I tried one – oh, at night we slept in – it was a barn.</span> <span id="s1588">And we were all three together and suddenly, I take a look, I find an egg.</span> <span id="s1589">An egg.</span> <span id="s1590">You didn't see an egg for – for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: So you were in a barn, someone’s barn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: In the bar –</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: In the barn.</span> <span id="s1595">In the barn.</span> <span id="s1596">Not only me, it was a big barn, it was a farm and we slept on the straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Was it like a farmer’s barn, was the – the – the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Yeah, but nobody was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Okay, no one was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: I don’t know, nobody was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: No – no food, no nothing, just barn.</span> <span id="s1603">I don’t know what happened to the farmer, he ran away or something, but there was nothing, no food, no nothing, just the barn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: When I said to mys – I said, hey guys, we three, I says, I found an egg.</span> <span id="s1606">Oh.</span> <span id="s1607">So now, how would we break it?</span> <span id="s1608">So I said, let me bite on it, maybe, you know.</span> <span id="s1609">You know what kind an egg it was?</span> <span id="s1610">A false egg that you lay under the chicken, the chicken should lay the eggs.</span> <span id="s1611">We were so disappointed, I mean, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1612">But that’s – that’s wa – what happened to the egg, the false egg.</span> <span id="s1613">Anyway, the next night, we slept no more in a farm, but we slept – it was a field like this, and going up the mountain, up.</span> <span id="s1614">So we were up between the wood, and the Germans had their kitchen canteen on – on the – on the field.</span> <span id="s1615">So here was the f – the field, and here was going up to the mountain, and there was the woods, inside.</span> <span id="s1616">It was still snow.</span> <span id="s1617">In April, in Bavaria in the mountain, was still – still quite cold.</span> <span id="s1618">So, we lay down, I still had that coat.</span> <span id="s1619">The coat –</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: – we never got rid of that coat til liberation.</span> <span id="s1622">So we put down the coat, we lay down on that coat, we three, and in the morning I heard something, I says, you know, I hear some tanks.</span> <span id="s1623">You know, when a tank comes towards you, you hear that noise it makes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: And I says – and I take a look, I says, no more – I see no soldiers, they ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: German soldiers, not –</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Germans, no German soldiers.</span> <span id="s1628">And they left the horse with the kitchen, it was – it was like – I don’t know the distance, like two distance from here to those streets.</span> <span id="s1629">Th – and that – that was downstairs was the – the ke – that kitchen.</span> <span id="s1630">And then my friend says, so maybe we should run, go over there.</span> <span id="s1631">I says, hey, maybe that’s a trap.</span> <span id="s1632">Maybe the Germans are hiding there with the machine guns.</span> <span id="s1633">They used to do those things, and you start running, then they start sh – killing you, you know.</span> <span id="s1634">So let’s wait, let’s wait.</span> <span id="s1635">And we were waiting til it got a little bit light already.</span> <span id="s1636">And then we heard the – the tanks are coming.</span> <span id="s1637">But we didn’t know what c – if it’s German tanks or – or American tanks or British, we didn’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1638">Suddenly, you could see the tanks coming towards us [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1639">So one guy, it was – we were liberated from black soldiers.</span> <span id="s1640">See, in those days the blacks were separated, they were not together with the white.</span> <span id="s1641">Was a whole brigade of black soldiers.</span> <span id="s1642">And they surrounded us, and they said hold it, don’t come towards us.</span> <span id="s1643">He says, we gonna let you know when.</span> <span id="s1644">And they si – it wa – the guy spoke German.</span> <span id="s1645">And, stay there, he says, we’ll let you know when it’s gonna be safe for us, we gonna let you know that you come – could come forwards.</span> <span id="s1646">And don’t worry, don’t run, we have plenty food for you.</span> <span id="s1647">They knew that we didn’t have to eat for – for quite awhile.</span> <span id="s1648">I don’t know how, but they knew.</span> <span id="s1649">Americans are not stupid, they knew how we were treated, because they seen what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: So you knew they were American at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Not at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Th-The guy spoke German.</span> <span id="s1654">He spoke beautiful German, this guy.</span> <span id="s1655">And he says, we are here – we are – you are liberated, and if – just stay for awhile, we get the order – because the planes were circling around and told them that the Germans are here, or hiding there, or hiding there and they used to shoot and kill ger – Americans too yet, in – in the same time.</span> <span id="s1656">So they were very careful, you know.</span> <span id="s1657">So they said, stay there where you staying, do not come forwards, do not come for – he – he repeated a couple of times, do not come forwards.</span> <span id="s1658">So finally said, now it’s okay, you could come.</span> <span id="s1659">There was americ – the am-ambulances, were one or two military ambulances, because right away, some people, they couldn’t walk, they have infections, you know, from the walking.</span> <span id="s1660">As a matter of fact me too, I had a – an infection, I went over there.</span> <span id="s1661">And one guy, the doctor, spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1662">He was an American Jewish guy.</span> <span id="s1663">So he told me right away, he f – they took care of me, a-and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: What kind of infection was it?</span> <span id="s1665">Just something in the – like gangrene or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: You see – no, no, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: – no gangrene yet.</span> <span id="s1669">It was infected, but it was, you know, it didn’t look right, my foot, you see, and I was walking barefoot, dirty, you know, from the wa – I didn’t have no shoes.</span> <span id="s1670">I was walking barefoot.</span> <span id="s1671">Ah, he says, don’t worry about it, you have plenty food, we have plenty food for you prepared and don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s1672">And then – as a matter of fact, I went into a – there was a monastery, all nuns, and they used to take care on the German soldiers, you know, wounded soldiers there.</span> <span id="s1673">I came in, they send me over there and they washed my foot and they treated me – they were very, very nice lady, all ladies.</span> <span id="s1674">Th-There – they’re doctors, everything i – run from nuns.</span> <span id="s1675">And I was there about two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Did the Americans take you there, or was it nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">A: N-N-No, yeah – well, the doctor took me over there and they said they gonna take care on you.</span> <span id="s1678">Because they had to go further.</span> <span id="s1679">You see, they took care on us, they gave us whate – throwing chocolate and candies and cigarettes, you know.</span> <span id="s1680">But the real stuff, later on, because the Germans had to take care, they had to feed us, they had to give us rooms where to sleep.</span> <span id="s1681">So I went for – for – I was about two days there with the nuns, and they – they gave me to eat, whatever – whatever I wanted, and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1682">[coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1683">They were really very – treated me very nice.</span> <span id="s1684">Nuns are nice, you know, they – they ar – they were afraid of their own soldiers, of the – especially of the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Did they have a big hospital, or did you just rest in the monastery?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: No, they wer – they had a hospi – that was the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Th-They work there in – in that – in the – in that place, in that hospital.</span> <span id="s1689">So they took care on the German wounded soldiers.</span> <span id="s1690">Now, the German soldiers, they were – everybody was running away, they put on civilian [indecipherable] those German SS, they took off their uniforms and they put on civilians, because they knew that if they catch you they were – they were in trouble, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Did you recognize any of them from the ones that had taken you on the marches?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: No, they run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: And a-as a matter of fact, in the morning when I got up, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s1695">But we were afraid to walk, because maybe they’re hiding, and they used to do those things, even they used to shoot – kill American soldiers, too.</span> <span id="s1696">Like this, put on a machine gun, and zzzzz, you know, killing e – it wa – for us, definitely they were not afraid to do it.</span> <span id="s1697">With the American soldiers, they knew that they had a treaty with the thing, they not – were not supposed to have prisoners, you know.</span> <span id="s1698">But for us they did whatever they wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1699">So that’s where I got liberated, in mickhaus – Kleynach(ph) Mickhausen, it was the place where I got liberated.</span> <span id="s1700">From there, i – the Jewish doctor gave me a note, he says, go to Augsburg, there’s one Jewish synagogue left in all Augsburg, that – to show for the world that Hitler wasn’t so bad, he left one synagogue, he left in thik – in – in thing.</span> <span id="s1701">He says, I’ll be there too, and I’m gonna say hello to you when I’ll come there.</span> <span id="s1702">And that’s where I met him, and – but then I had already – I met a German family, because they told you have to go and they had to give you food, clothing and shelter.</span> <span id="s1703">And money.</span> <span id="s1704">That was after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: Was it just you, or was it anyone else that the German [indecipherable] had to take in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: Yeah, okay, now with my – my – we were three together.</span> <span id="s1707">One kid – one kid – this – the guy from England, he went right away to the British embassy.</span> <span id="s1708">I never met him again, because he took him – he told me that he’s going straight home to Britain.</span> <span id="s1709">I-I don’t remember, it was some – near by longam – Man-Manchester – I don’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Manchester?</span> <span id="s1711">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: – whate – whatever.</span> <span id="s1713">That’s was – was his home.</span> <span id="s1714">His – his parents there, everybody there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: So you’ve never talked to him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Now, my other – other friend, he wa – as soon as he got liberated, he developed a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s1717">He couldn’t take the liberty.</span> <span id="s1718">See, you were always under the gun, wherever you were walking, so he had a nervous breakdown and he – he was in very bad shape.</span> <span id="s1719">So the Americans took him, and they took him to a – to a place where, you know, to a – to a hospital to treat him, you know.</span> <span id="s1720">And also, from – from there, he went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1721">And I never met him again, too.</span> <span id="s1722">And le – like this we were.</span> <span id="s1723">That’s where we broke off and we got divided and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Have you even had the chance to talk to them?</span> <span id="s1725">Or you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: No, for the guy –</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: – just no contact whatsoever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: – the guy who – who had the nervous breakdown, you couldn’t even come close, he was very wild, you know, he was – he was – somehow, he lived in a different world, you know?</span> <span id="s1729">He thought that the – I’m – I want to kill him, or – or – e-even they had to – they had to bind his feet and thing when the – the American MPs, the military police came and took him to a hospital, even they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1730">But they – they, you know, took two or three, they bind him down and put his hands in the thing.</span> <span id="s1731">But he w – he was – he was okay after he was treated in – in these hospitals, and from there he went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: But since then, have you had any contact with him at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: No, I never had any contact –</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">A: – contact with him.</span> <span id="s1736">But I heard – somebody told me that, because his name was vudok – Moishe Vodowsky(ph), I think.</span> <span id="s1737">W-Was V-Vodowsky(ph), Vodowsky(ph).</span> <span id="s1738">And he told me that he went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Okay, so you heard through a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: So, right, right.</span> <span id="s1741">And the other one, I knew that he went home.</span> <span id="s1742">So he told me that he’s – he’s leaving us, he hugged me, we kissed and he went right away to the British embassy and they – they right away said to come and send him home.</span> <span id="s1743">That’s was end of the story to liberation, so this – this is it.</span> <span id="s1744">Now, if you want to ask me any questions, you go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: When did you meet William Fuchs?</span> <span id="s1746">Is that Andrew Sellin’s(ph) father?</span> <span id="s1747">Was he the one that liberated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">A: That is the one.</span> <span id="s1751">So now, wait a second, now you got – how – who got in touch with you, Andrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Yeah, Mr. Sellin(ph) got in touch with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Ah, right, right, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: And he’s the son of William, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1756">Now, he – he – Andrew swe – oh, he was unbelievable person.</span> <span id="s1757">Unbelievable, what a nice –</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: Andrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: An – no, his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: William.</span> <span id="s1762">Captain William Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1763">He was the captain.</span> <span id="s1764">He was also there by – were in – by that ambulance, you know, and he spoke Yiddish, too.</span> <span id="s1765">So right away he asked me, are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1766">And then he says, redts(ph) Yiddish?</span> <span id="s1767">Because he spoke Yiddish to me.</span> <span id="s1768">I didn’t speak a word of English in that time.</span> <span id="s1769">As a matter of fact, when I was liberated from those black guys, I says, my God, those guys must – must be very hot in America, they got all sunburned.</span> <span id="s1770">I didn’t know that there were – there – there was black – honest, that’s the honest truth.</span> <span id="s1771">I didn’t know there was black guy – black people.</span> <span id="s1772">Negroes, you know, I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: But oh, they were so nice to us, those people.</span> <span id="s1775">I remember I was stand, they were throwing us chocolate and bread and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1776">And then a German came over, he wanted to – he says – he took the bread and stepped on it, he says, instead of giving it to you, and you disappear from here before I’ll – he – he rather – stepped on the bread, not to give it to the German, the – because a lot of people died from – from – Americans, the Germans used to kill Americans too, you know.</span> <span id="s1777">Maybe it was friends that died, or something.</span> <span id="s1778">So they hated those Germans.</span> <span id="s1779">So – so now I know how I – how you got in touch with me, because he – he told me if I want to give a report from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1780">I says okay, I says, so – so that’s how you got in touch, from that.</span> <span id="s1781">You know Andrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: No, I haven’t met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: But he –</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: He’s a professor, he – he teaches in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: Yeah, he’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: In – in Brooklyn?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1790">And his mother – yeah, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1791">His mother lives here in – in – in Miami.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1793">Do you see her a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">A: Okay, I met Captain William Fuchs, I met him when I came to America, because he gave me, before he left he gave me his address, and I know he was 323 Brownsgroup(ph), that was his –</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: Where is that?</span> <span id="s1796">In Brooklyn s – in New York, or down here?</span> <span id="s1797">A: No, no, in the army – he – he was in air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Air force, 323, he used to fly those big bombardiers, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: And he was, I think it was the navigator or something like that.</span> <span id="s1802">Oh, he was nice.</span> <span id="s1803">And then when I was – after the liberation, he went in Pansing(ph) airfield, and in Pansing(ph) airfield, he says, if you want to come – I had a – I met another friend, he was in the partisans, also a Jewish guy from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1804">So I said, I have another friend with me.</span> <span id="s1805">He said, okay, don’t worry about it, anybody, just come, bring him.</span> <span id="s1806">And we came there on the – on the base, so he introduced us the hi-hierarch – high officers there, you know, I don’t know, in those days I didn’t recognize, I think he was like –</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Captain –</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: – maybe one star general.</span> <span id="s1809">He was the head from the whole – from the whole airfield there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: And they – oh, they treated us nice there.</span> <span id="s1812">It’s any time you want to come in, we have – because in those days the officers eat separately, and the men eat – used to eat separate.</span> <span id="s1813">The regular army used to be separate.</span> <span id="s1814">So we always were, we came, we went there, because he gave us the okay to come and eat with them.</span> <span id="s1815">So they – we were treated – y-you couldn’t get better treatment than that.</span> <span id="s1816">So we were very nice.</span> <span id="s1817">And then the – so Captain William – William Fuch – Wil-William said okay, go to the Bürgermeister.</span> <span id="s1818">Bürgermeister is the mayor.</span> <span id="s1819">In German, the mayor calls the Bürgermeister, you know, from a city, the mayor of the city?</span> <span id="s1820">So he says, go to them, and tell them that you need a room for – he should give you a room.</span> <span id="s1821">And in case he doesn’t want it, he ha – he knew already that we wouldn’t get it, just come back and let me know, because from – from the mayor to the airfield was 50 minutes walk, something like that.</span> <span id="s1822">So we came in, yeah, what can I do for you, he says in ger – we talking in German to him.</span> <span id="s1823">Says well, we need a room.</span> <span id="s1824">Ich habe keiner, I have no rooms for you.</span> <span id="s1825">Okay.</span> <span id="s1826">I says – dav – David, my friend says, it’s no use to argue with him.</span> <span id="s1827">Let’s go back to well – tell him – to William.</span> <span id="s1828">So we came back, he went and put two guns on his – an-and with two guns he came in.</span> <span id="s1829">As soon as he seen him, and the Germans, you know, right away he stands in the – in thing.</span> <span id="s1830">He says, I want you should give those guys a room.</span> <span id="s1831">Jawohl, jawohl, jawohl, right away – right away he had the rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: So you had a room to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: Beg –</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: You had a room to yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: No, no, with my friend, one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Q: Okay, you shared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: But we share – an-and where the officers used to sleep, and it was a big th – there used to be the – they ha – German Air Force used to stay there in those rooms.</span> <span id="s1840">Now there was an extra room there, so he said – the mayor said, there’s one room there in the officers’ thing.</span> <span id="s1841">Said okay, that’s good for them.</span> <span id="s1842">Give – give them that room.</span> <span id="s1843">So the well was – the captain was sleeping in one side, on the other side of the house, and we – we had the room for ourself i-in this side of the house.</span> <span id="s1844">So we were treated there wonderful, very nice.</span> <span id="s1845">Very nice, I – so, when I came to America, he came to see me, because I was working in New York in the garment center that time.</span> <span id="s1846">He took me out for lunch, he gave me 50 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Fifty dollars was a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1851">And then, he invited us to a hou – to his house in Brooklyn, but he – Andrew wasn’t – was – wasn’t born yet, because he has two b – two boys.</span> <span id="s1852">The older one – what was the older one’s name?</span> <span id="s1853">Okay, I have it so – when we came there he was a baby, a little baby yet.</span> <span id="s1854">So, he said –</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: What year was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: What year was this in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: This is in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: 1950 when I came to America.</span> <span id="s1861">So anyway, we came to visit and then – and we had – th-they invited us for – for supper or lun – whatever it is.</span> <span id="s1862">And then he says to us, we are going – we are going to – to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1863">Because in those days was the G.I. quote, you know.</span> <span id="s1864">The G.I., whoever wanted to star – to – to study for higher – because he was a high school teacher, he wanted to go higher.</span> <span id="s1865">In the – the americ – the – the government paid f – the G.I. Bill was that time, they called it G.I. Bill, and the government paid for everything.</span> <span id="s1866">For study, for – they gave him money, gave him everything, and they send him to Switzerland, to study in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1867">So he said, come next week, and then I’ll – I’ll tell you everything exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s1868">When we came next week, he was already gone, because they somehow – they told him – they – for – a couple of days later that they – he’s gonna have to come, you know, because they were prepared, already packed and everything, but somehow they called him up and he said, you have to leave before.</span> <span id="s1869">So we were there – we came there on a Saturday, and he left already on Thursday.</span> <span id="s1870">So I came there, I knock in the door, nobody answers the door, so I go next door.</span> <span id="s1871">It was an elderly lady living there in – in – in the – in the house.</span> <span id="s1872">So I says, do you know where the Fuchs are?</span> <span id="s1873">Dillon Fuch?</span> <span id="s1874">Oh, they left already.</span> <span id="s1875">They – sh-she knew already that they left, they left on Thursday.</span> <span id="s1876">So, since then we got lost, and I – and I went – you know ma – I had another friend who was in the army, that I met, he tried to locate him, because I knew where he – nobody knew, nobody, how to get in touch with him, and I couldn’t get in touch with him.</span> <span id="s1877">So, when I moved here down to – in Coral Spring, when I went in the synagogue, there was one guy – I somehow came out to talk, you know, about my – my friend, I said, I – I had a friend, Captain William Fuchs, you know, and I – we tried to – he says, I could find that out for you.</span> <span id="s1878">He says, give me a couple of days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Was this someone in the army, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: No, no, no, he – he was in the army, yeah, but beside, he had – he knew from the computers.</span> <span id="s1881">He says, I’ll find him, I’ll find him for you.</span> <span id="s1882">And he came back the next week, he brought me the com – the went ou – write-out from the computer, where he was in army, how long, where he lives.</span> <span id="s1883">But when I f-found – when I got in touch with the family, cause I had the number, everything was with number, I – first – the first thing I spoke to – to Andrew.</span> <span id="s1884">So he says, my mother is in – in – in Miami, the live in Miami, and my father died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: I was – I was really heartbroken, because – and I passed by his house a couple – when I moved – I moved down to Miami first.</span> <span id="s1887">I passed by his house, and I didn’t know that they were living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: He was still alive that time.</span> <span id="s1890">And he died on – on his – he had a stroke.</span> <span id="s1891">He was handsome, good looking guy, nice, very good, you know.</span> <span id="s1892">People like – like him, you – you seldom find.</span> <span id="s1893">Very nice guy, very nice guy.</span> <span id="s1894">So that’s was then, so I invite – invite his wife, came here, Andrew came to my house, we invited him, and the other kid lives in California, so I didn’t met the other t – the oldest son I didn’t – I never met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: When did you find out about where – how to get in touch with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: I find out about, I-I-I should say a year ago, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">Q: Oh, so very recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: Yeah, not – not – not long ago, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: So, had you just moved to Coral Springs then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: No, I was living –</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">A: – I was living already in Coral Springs, but when I lived in Miami, I used to pass by their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">A: And I didn't know that he – they are there.</span> <span id="s1905">I didn’t know because I didn’t – I couldn’t get in touch.</span> <span id="s1906">If this guy wouldn’t get me in touch with them – he got in touch, and my friend, he was in the army, he – he went to the air force base and give them the thing.</span> <span id="s1907">I had the number where, you know, 323 [indecipherable] where he was in – in the – in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1908">They couldn’t find him either.</span> <span id="s1909">And he found them in the computer.</span> <span id="s1910">I don’t know how he did it, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: It’s amazing what you can do with computers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: So that’s how – that’s how I got in touch.</span> <span id="s1913">So now I know how you come in and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1914">Yeah, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: So, can we go back a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: Yeah, would you like first to eat something, or drink [indecipherable] okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">Q: Sounds good, okay.</span> <span id="s1918">[tape break] Wha – let’s go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s1919">Did you – what was the situation for you after you were liberated?</span> <span id="s1920">Did you go through the DP camps?</span> <span id="s1921">And how did you – what was your story after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1923">As a matter of fact, when William came over and he told me that he is leaving now back to America, and if I want to go there is a DP camp in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s1924">Panzing is the airfield.</span> <span id="s1925">From Panzing to Landsberg was not far, about two kilometers or something.</span> <span id="s1926">I don’t know exact, two or three ki – it was very – you could walk it too, you know.</span> <span id="s1927">So he says, why don’t you go to the DP camp, and over there they give you room, board, clothing, anything you want.</span> <span id="s1928">And he says, go see my friend.</span> <span id="s1929">He had friends all over.</span> <span id="s1930">The chief of the camp was – he – he knew the chief of the camp there.</span> <span id="s1931">He says, they’re gonna treat you very nice.</span> <span id="s1932">As a matter of fact, I went with my friend and first of all I said I wanted to see the chief of police, you know.</span> <span id="s1933">Was o – e-everything was Jewish there, the police, everything was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1934">So I says, I would like to see the chief, and I told him that I want to see him.</span> <span id="s1935">No, you can’t see him.</span> <span id="s1936">I said, I must see him, I have to – I ha – I want to see the – the guy, you know.</span> <span id="s1937">And as I was arguing with the – with that policeman, the chief of police came and said, what’s going on here?</span> <span id="s1938">I says, yes, I want to see you, mist – you know well, Captain William Fuchs?</span> <span id="s1939">Oh, my friend?</span> <span id="s1940">So, right away I got the royal treatments because he – he send me, Captain William Fuchs.</span> <span id="s1941">Is there anything you need, just call on me, he says.</span> <span id="s1942">You want – need a room, you want a registration, everything is gonna be taken care of for you and for your friend.</span> <span id="s1943">So, through him, I got all the royal treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">Q: So how long were you in Landsberg for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: In Landsberg, I – I came, as I said, th-this was ninet – let’s see, 1945 I was liberated, ‘46 - ‘47 – I – I was in Landsberg til about ‘47, and then I found out that I have a cousin, I met a cousin from my – my – my first – from the – my old family, I found out that he was in Lunberg(ph) frumwald(ph).</span> <span id="s1946">That was a city there by Ravensburg, someplace around there.</span> <span id="s1947">So right away I – I got in touch with him, and he said listen, Saul, wh-why should you stay there?</span> <span id="s1948">Come with me.</span> <span id="s1949">I have a nice room in Lunberg(ph) frumwald(ph) and don’t worry about anything, just come.</span> <span id="s1950">So I moved over there.</span> <span id="s1951">And then he said that he is engaged to a girl already, and that she is going, his fiancée is going to America, and once she comes to America she is going to send papers for him, for my cousin.</span> <span id="s1952">And he says, when I’ll come to America, I’m going to send you the papers and you gonna come to America.</span> <span id="s1953">Because in those days it was already not so bad, you could come with the – it was the UNRRA, the – the Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: UN relief agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: – the – the – the HIAS –</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: – they used to call it.</span> <span id="s1958">And they helped you out, so – so as soon as they – he came to America, they got married, that was all televised, because in those days was a big deal, so Holocaust survivors, you know, got married, there was a lit – it was already on TV, and the gro – Grossingers(ph), you heard of Grossingers(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Was a big hotel in the mountains, and they – they invited them for the – for their honeymoon, and they were staying there for a week, and so – and af –</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: They got married before they went to America, or when they – when they –</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: No, they – they got married when my cousin ca – arrived to America –</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: – right away, a day or two, or a week maybe, right away they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: And the HIAS arranged it, and everything, the wedding, th-the – was made, everything from them, it was a big headlines in all the newspapers, you know.</span> <span id="s1967">And after then, after a couple of months, he made me the papers, and I c – that’s how I came to America in 1950.</span> <span id="s1968">So that’s the end of the story.</span> <span id="s1969">And I – and I –</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: So you just took a ship over, and were you with your friend still at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: When I came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: My friend, he – my friend, the – he – the part – he was in the partisan, he went to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: And he worked for the UNRRA.</span> <span id="s1976">He was – he’s dra – drove a big truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: But he had a bad end, poor guy.</span> <span id="s1979">He was jumping – he was a very athletic guy, and he was jumping on a board, you know, where you si – into the pool?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: And the board hit his – his back and break his – the spine, and he lived for a couple of hours, and that was the end of – young – young guy, went through so much in his lifetime, he told me stories, you wouldn’t believe it, it was scary.</span> <span id="s1982">He was – he was about five, six years older than me.</span> <span id="s1983">So that was the end of the story with him.</span> <span id="s1984">And I told him, I beg him, I said, co-come with me, come, because my cousin has all connections there, it – no, no, no, I want to go, I have a job there and I’m gonna drive the truck, and – but that was a ba – very bad end of him.</span> <span id="s1985">If you have any more questions, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: What did you do between ‘47 and ‘50?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: A big nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: A big nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: A big nothing is right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Were you just in the Landsberg camp, or where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah, the Landsberg camp, and then I went to Neuenberg, and I was there.</span> <span id="s1992">Th-There was no camp, there was – yo-you lived privately.</span> <span id="s1993">And f –</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1995">What did you do in Nuremberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">A: In Neuenberg?</span> <span id="s1997">In Neuenberg, a-as a matter of fact, I – I try – I worked there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1998">I – I met friends there, Jewish people, and they – they were furriers, you know, make fur coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">A: And they taught me how to – I used to know how to cut – you know, you had to stretch those furs, and to sew them?</span> <span id="s2001">I used – a-all the – the whole fur coat, I used to know how to put – assemble them together.</span> <span id="s2002">And they paid me for each coat, I think it was 50 German marks.</span> <span id="s2003">It was good money, so in a – if I could do it in a day, I could make a whole fur coat.</span> <span id="s2004">Stretch it out, and – but I didn't have every day a fur coat, but I made two, three fur coats, so it’s another 150 doll – d-mark(ph), that was already the d-mark(ph), was not the Reichsmark.</span> <span id="s2005">In the beginning the Reichsmark didn’t have very little value, but the d-mark(ph) was already – had a good certain value.</span> <span id="s2006">So I learned how to do.</span> <span id="s2007">As a matter of fact, when I came here to United States, I go – I got a job in the garment center.</span> <span id="s2008">Ah –</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s2010">In – in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: In New York –</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: – New York, in the garment center.</span> <span id="s2014">Were – were you – oh, excuse me, were you ever in N-New York, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">Q: I’ve been.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: Oh, so you know where Times Square is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: [indecipherable] Seventh Avenue, that was the garment center.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">A: So, I’ll – when I came to a – to America, I stood with my cousin.</span> <span id="s2023">He was already married, and my cousin was – she was already pregnant.</span> <span id="s2024">Then eventually she had the little baby boy.</span> <span id="s2025">And so some friends used to come over, and – because they heard that I came, so they come to see me, hello, the – so my cousin says, maybe you have a job for – for – for Saul.</span> <span id="s2026">So he said, yeah, I could give him a job in – in – in – where I work.</span> <span id="s2027">Because he was a sa – a something like foreman.</span> <span id="s2028">Not the higher foreman, the lower foreman.</span> <span id="s2029">Oh, I could give him a job in the – in the – in the garment center.</span> <span id="s2030">I said, okay.</span> <span id="s2031">So I said, what – what do I have to do?</span> <span id="s2032">Don’t worry, tell them that you are a tailor from home.</span> <span id="s2033">I said, I don’t know you – how to – how to hold a needle in the hand.</span> <span id="s2034">I know how to do some fur – furriers, I worked in – i-in – i-in – in Germany, but to sew, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2035">Don’t worry about it, tell them that you are a tailor from home.</span> <span id="s2036">All right, I says, you want me to tell that, I – I will tell.</span> <span id="s2037">So I came next week, on Monday.</span> <span id="s2038">Cause I was here about a week or two, I already started to work.</span> <span id="s2039">Because the HIAS supported me, gave me certain amount of money, and they paid me for a room.</span> <span id="s2040">And so I was already, you know.</span> <span id="s2041">But I didn’t want they should support me, I wanted to make my own money, you know, I wanted to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: You were living on your own at that point, you didn’t share a room with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: No, no, I’m still – no, no, no, I was living with my cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: With your cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: So anyway, I came up the next week, I came to work and I see the bi – he introduce me to the big foreman, and he says, oh I hear you’re a tailor from home.</span> <span id="s2048">I says yes.</span> <span id="s2049">And they had fun in the back, they were laughing, you know?</span> <span id="s2050">I le – ha – I heard them something, but I didn’t know what was going on there.</span> <span id="s2051">So the guy says, okay, let me see how you do – do some sewing.</span> <span id="s2052">So he gives me a thimble, I didn't know where or on what finger to put on even the thimble, never mind to sew.</span> <span id="s2053">And they were laughing.</span> <span id="s2054">He said, all right, we had the little fun with you, don’t – don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s2055">You gonna learn – you gonna learn, don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s2056">Be – I know all about it, what kind of tailor d – you a-a-are.</span> <span id="s2057">So I says, yeah, Teddy – his name was Teddy, the guy who – who told me I should be – just tell them that I am a tailor.</span> <span id="s2058">But, I worked there for a couple of weeks, and believe me, I produced just like anybody else, I learned very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Can you still sew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2061">I – I wa – I went and I had the dry cleaning business in – in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Yeah, so – with my cousin, together.</span> <span id="s2064">Box –</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: So that’s what you eventually went up and – and did there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Yeah, and that’s how I learned – I learned a lot of things to sew in the – in the factory when I used to work, but I worked there for about – I worked in two factories.</span> <span id="s2067">One in the beginning factory, and then I left because I got into an argument with the – with this Teddy, because he thought that because he gave me a job that he could – I could lie for him, and I could do all kind of things, which – there was an old lady, also a Holocaust survivor, and he wanted to get rid of her.</span> <span id="s2068">So he took me as a witness to the big boss there.</span> <span id="s2069">So, I see he was talking and he pointing towards me, because they were there – over there and I see that he points towards me.</span> <span id="s2070">Finally he comes over with the boss, and the boss was, you know, big cigars, you know, all sunburned because he went to Florida for the – it was in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s2071">So he says to me, if – if I speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2072">I says, I – I don’t speak no English, but I speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2073">So he started to talk to me and then Teddy says, and ask Saul, he’ll tell you that she doesn’t want to work.</span> <span id="s2074">I said, hold it, hold it, hold it.</span> <span id="s2075">I – in front of the boss, I said, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s2076">I says, she’s – she’s an elderly lady.</span> <span id="s2077">She was about 45, something like that, but she looked like a hundred.</span> <span id="s2078">Skinny [indecipherable] broken, sick.</span> <span id="s2079">I says, she tries her best, I says, and she wants to work and she does work.</span> <span id="s2080">And the boss just looked at him like, you know, when he – when the boss left, he comes over to me and says, I’ll tell you one thing Saul, as long as you gonna work here, you never gonna get a raise, an increase.</span> <span id="s2081">I says, look, I don’t care about your increase and I don’t care about your raise.</span> <span id="s2082">You think I’m gonna squeal on a woman like this?</span> <span id="s2083">I mean, because you gave me a job, you think you own me?</span> <span id="s2084">I says, I don’t care, no matter what – you want me to leave, you could throw me out.</span> <span id="s2085">I – I’ll leave.</span> <span id="s2086">I don’t even want to – I don’t like to say – and I don’t like you at all when you do the – you should be ashamed of yourself, I says, you went through a concentration camp, and yo – that’s how you behave to an old lady like that?</span> <span id="s2087">She looks old, but she’s 45 something, she’s still a young woman, and look what you want to do to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: So the boss was a survivor also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: The – the bo – no, the boss went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: The boss was – this was when the boss left already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: He came over to me, and talked to me like this.</span> <span id="s2094">But anyway, so I worked – I – I remember I made 75 cents an hour in those days.</span> <span id="s2095">I made 75 cents, but one day I go over th-the boss’s son-in-law, his name was Howard.</span> <span id="s2096">I says, I’m gonna go and ask a raise.</span> <span id="s2097">I wanted a raise of five dollars.</span> <span id="s2098">So I go over to the boss – yeah, and I used to make already better garments, you know, and duplicates, you know, samples.</span> <span id="s2099">And they had to rush them out, sometimes I had to go for lunch, and he says, Saul, can’t – you can’t go because we have to rush out this things because otherwise we wouldn’t get the order.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: So, a lot of times, instead of going 12 o’clock for lunch, I had to go three o’clock or 3:30, and I used to get headaches, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2102">So I go over to him and I says, listen Howard, I would like to ask you for a raise, for five dollars.</span> <span id="s2103">I’m sorry Saul, I can’t give it to you.</span> <span id="s2104">That’s was Teddy’s work, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: So I says to him, okay, I’ll tell you what, you don’t want to give you a raise, that’s fine.</span> <span id="s2107">Instead of, put me on – put me on work – on piecework like the other guys work.</span> <span id="s2108">If I’ll make hundred dollars or I’ll make 10 dollars, whatever I’ll make, whatever I produce.</span> <span id="s2109">I knew that I could make much more than 75 cents an hour.</span> <span id="s2110">No, I – I’m sorry, I can’t do that because I need you here by this table.</span> <span id="s2111">You are – you be – you – you taught all the – the garments, the – I – I – you know how to make the samples and prepare them, everything, you know, and I ca – and I-I need you here by this table, I can’t – all right.</span> <span id="s2112">So I says, okay, you don’t want to give me a raise, you don’t want to give me piecework and you don’t want to do anything, okay, fine, fine.</span> <span id="s2113">And I had a headache unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2114">So I’m going down, suddenly, who do you think I meet?</span> <span id="s2115">I meet a guy from Germany that – way back from Germany I used to know from the ca – from the camp, from the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2116">Saul!</span> <span id="s2117">I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2118">I went to eat, and he came into the building.</span> <span id="s2119">He didn't work there, but he just happened to pass by.</span> <span id="s2120">H-He almost cried, and I was crying almost.</span> <span id="s2121">So he s – so Saul, so wha-what are you doing?</span> <span id="s2122">Wha – how – I says Joe, his name was Joe, in Jewish his name was Yittel(ph), I says, I have such a strong headache, I hardly could see out of my eyes.</span> <span id="s2123">So I told him the story, he says, Saul, I have good news for you.</span> <span id="s2124">I have a partner that I work in – they work for Hentlie(ph), and this was Kolmer Marcus, where I worked, it was a cheap line, a cheaper line.</span> <span id="s2125">Let’s say for a lady’s suit over there, 20 - 30 dollars was – that’s about it.</span> <span id="s2126">He worked for between two, three, 400 dollar suits, Hentlie(ph), everything was made by hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: So I tell him, listen Joe, but you know I ha – I work in a cheap line, I don’t know if I’ll be able to work in your place.</span> <span id="s2129">Saul, don’t worry, you work for me then, you’ll be my partner.</span> <span id="s2130">And I assure you, you’re gonna make more than – I made 55 dollars when I left this – this – my place, to come to him.</span> <span id="s2131">I says, I hope you’re – so anyway, I ran over to my boss, and – I called up my boss where I worked, because he owed me one week wages yet.</span> <span id="s2132">I said, oh, I have a very bad cold, and I cannot – I didn’t want – I was afraid maybe I’m not going to be qualified there, and I didn’t want to lose a job –</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">A: – because I had the job already, and I made 55 dollars, it’s better than nothing.</span> <span id="s2135">So, he says Saul, I have lo – I’m overloaded with work.</span> <span id="s2136">You better come in as – I says, as soon as I feel better, I says.</span> <span id="s2137">And I talk like, you know, I have – had a cold.</span> <span id="s2138">I worked the first week with my friend, I made 150 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: Hundred –</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: So, were you doing piecework there, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Piecework, piecework.</span> <span id="s2145">But I had to do on certain things on a garment, he told me, you’re gonna do this part, and I’m gonna do this part.</span> <span id="s2146">And that’s all you’re gonna do.</span> <span id="s2147">So I had plenty chance to work myself into it, you know?</span> <span id="s2148">I was very good, this was – I was – there was a hard job.</span> <span id="s2149">It wasn’t so hard, but it was a – how shall I say, it was a job, a boarding job.</span> <span id="s2150">He had crisscross because everything was handmade, so you couldn’t fold it under, you had to flat – the suit should – it was li – you s – wear a suit like a sweater.</span> <span id="s2151">It was giving from all the sides.</span> <span id="s2152">Had no paddings, no nothing.</span> <span id="s2153">That’s why it was so expensive.</span> <span id="s2154">So I did the – the little – little jobs here – all over the – that suit, it was all – so that was my job, and make the bottoms, that was my job.</span> <span id="s2155">And he put in the linings.</span> <span id="s2156">And we worked in a team unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2157">Same [indecipherable] like we had the team for the three kids, we had three kids.</span> <span id="s2158">And then they – they seen that I do so good with him, they also start together, but they didn’t – they – they worked for awhile, oh, you sit too much on the toilet, you didn't come yesterday.</span> <span id="s2159">I mean, you know, sometimes you cannot make [indecipherable] you don’t feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: Or la – my – my – my friend had to go someplace, he had the sister that was sick.</span> <span id="s2162">I never told him hey, you’re going too much to your sister.</span> <span id="s2163">He came an hour later, so what, so he came an hour later.</span> <span id="s2164">Still.</span> <span id="s2165">So they tried the same way, but it didn’t work with them, so it’s also fall apart.</span> <span id="s2166">With me, til the last moment I work there, I worked with my friend, we made good money.</span> <span id="s2167">I mean, there was times I went home with 200 dollars, in those days it was a fortune of money.</span> <span id="s2168">Like today a thousand dollars almost, for 200 dollars, you sh – yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: In just a week?</span> <span id="s2170">In just a week?</span> <span id="s2171">A: A week, in one week, every week.</span> <span id="s2172">So then, when I came up to – to collect my – he owed me a week wages, my boss that – my ol – first place.</span> <span id="s2173">Oh Saul, we are so happy to see you.</span> <span id="s2174">I take out my envelope and I show him, I says, see what I made this week?</span> <span id="s2175">I asked you for five dollars, you wouldn’t give it to me.</span> <span id="s2176">Look what I made.</span> <span id="s2177">He almost fell down.</span> <span id="s2178">But one thing he says to me, Saul, any time you need a job, if anything should go wrong in your place, or whatever it is, my door will be always open for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: That’s nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: And he said, I apologize, I should have give you that raise, but it was interference here, and I’m sorry what I did, that I didn’t give you the raise.</span> <span id="s2181">And if he would have give me the raise, I would maybe still sit there in – in that –</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2183">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: So that’s a good thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: So how about –</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Are we still on the tape recorder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Yeah, we’re still on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: Oh, oh, okay.</span> <span id="s2189">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: So how about after that?</span> <span id="s2191">Like, when did you meet your wife, what did you do, how long were you in New York for?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2193">When I was in the dry cleaning business, we used to make also deliveries.</span> <span id="s2194">And there was a bigger delivery, so one customer calls me up and says, yeah, we have all – we had also a route.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: So, my cousin – first I – I was in the store, I – because I-I was the – I knew already [indecipherable] clean, because I took some lessons.</span> <span id="s2197">I went, there was a – a school from dry cleaning business.</span> <span id="s2198">And I was already a licensed dry cleaning business, so my cousin didn't know, so I was doing the spotting, and all those things.</span> <span id="s2199">But my cousin was a presser, because he worked also in the garment center.</span> <span id="s2200">So – and I did alterations, we had a – a tailor also.</span> <span id="s2201">And my cousin sometimes – we – the pressers was very bad there, because they were not reliable, they used to come in drunk, or they didn't show up, and they’re supposed to be – let’s say I opened up seven o’clock, they’re supposed to be eight o’clock in the – in the store, they used to come in two o’clock, three o’clock in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2202">I says, why are you coming so late?</span> <span id="s2203">Oh, you don’t like me?</span> <span id="s2204">Pay me out.</span> <span id="s2205">I said, pay me out with what?</span> <span id="s2206">I don’t owe you anything, I paid you – Saturday I paid you everything to a penny.</span> <span id="s2207">The guy didn’t have 10 cents to go home with the subway.</span> <span id="s2208">And ca – a lot of times they came in drunk.</span> <span id="s2209">I says, no, you cannot work drunk.</span> <span id="s2210">And one day I was very busy by the counter, a-and my cousin went out to eat lunch – breakfast, I mean, in the morning, and I didn’t see the presser came in, and went straight – I was so busy in the front with the customers, I didn’t even see when he came in.</span> <span id="s2211">And he was quite overdosed with – he drank – early in the morning already, he was drunk.</span> <span id="s2212">Suddenly, I hear like an explosion.</span> <span id="s2213">He pulled the pressing machine out from the place, and he busted the pipe, and the ste – I thought that like – like a bomb exploded.</span> <span id="s2214">He pulled the pressing machine from the wall out.</span> <span id="s2215">He ma – he was a very – we used to call him Herman the bull, he was such a – he was a big guy, you know, very strong guy.</span> <span id="s2216">But he didn’t know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s2217">I said, didn’t I tell you not to come in drinking?</span> <span id="s2218">I – I says, you came in, I didn’t even see you coming in.</span> <span id="s2219">So I went, I s – I gave him a dollar, I says, go buy yourself black coffee, and sit dow – he was a very nice guy.</span> <span id="s2220">One thing he was nice, but when he was drunk, forget it.</span> <span id="s2221">He didn’t know what he was doing.</span> <span id="s2222">And so I said, drink some coffee first, lay down.</span> <span id="s2223">When you gonna feel you gonna be all right – I called in right away, because I had insurance.</span> <span id="s2224">They came right away, they fixed everything up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: It was wa – I paid for a whole year of – that’s – that insura – that insurance was a blessing from – from heaven.</span> <span id="s2227">The – I remember the first year was pipes busted.</span> <span id="s2228">The first year that it was in business, I didn't know that pipes were busting from the water line, and shoot up.</span> <span id="s2229">And suddenly, we put on the steam, and suddenly it starts shooting out the steam all over.</span> <span id="s2230">And you couldn’t get a plumber there like an emergenc – like a doctor was – in emergency you couldn’t get a plumber.</span> <span id="s2231">But I called them up.</span> <span id="s2232">About in a half an hour they were there and they fixed me up back in business.</span> <span id="s2233">A lot of cleaners, they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2234">They had to wait for a week til they – but this guy, because I told him, because you see he – I had before, when we opened up the business, we bought the business for 5,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s2235">And – but we were all cleared out, because we put down the money, 5,000 dollars for the whole – for the whole business, we gave them cash, 5,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s2236">So – what did I want to just – want to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: About owning your business?</span> <span id="s2238">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span

don’t know what the other guy did.</span> <span id="s2248">I assure you – and in between the way I’m arguing with him, the landlord comes in.</span> <span id="s2249">He says, Saul, what’s going on here?</span> <span id="s2250">I says, the guy don’t want to give me – he wants I should pay him right away cash.</span> <span id="s2251">He says to the guy, fill ‘em up, fill up his tank.</span> <span id="s2252">Come into my office, I’ll – I’ll give you the money.</span> <span id="s2253">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2254">So, he s – the guy saved me.</span> <span id="s2255">Give – paid me out the

<span id="s2260">You see, now it came out a new law, the high – high pressure boilers have to have a special instrument and a special thing, it – it shuts off the boiler, in case something goes wrong, you know?</span> <span id="s2261">And that alarm costs about 200 dollars, he said, I’ll give you this as a present.</span> <span id="s2262">And I says, okay, you got a deal.</span> <span id="s2263">Now, I says, next week, come and fill up my – my tank, he says fine.</span> <span id="s2264">He came, they filled it up, end of the month he sent – but in between, the other guy came

remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: With my landlord had to pay you the – to fill up for the tank, I says.</span> <span id="s2269">Oh no, he says, oh, I’m gonna give you cheaper.</span> <span id="s2270">He gave me 10 cents off, he gives me 20 cent.</span> <span id="s2271">I says, even if you give it to me for nothing, I says, I deal with this man, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s2272">I shook hands with him, and that’s – that’s the contract.</span> <span id="s2273">And that’s – til I – we don’t – til I [indecipherable] sell that business, I was still with this – with the same guy.</span> <span id="s2274">And that guy treated me – if we needed a problem – fixing anything, he had plumbing, everything, and he took it care [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: That was the – the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: And how long did you stay with that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: Oh, I stood there in that business, I think, almost when I came to Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: When did you come to Florida?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: Seventy – ‘76.</span> <span id="s2281">So, til then – til ‘76, I was in the dry cleaning business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">Q: So you met your wife up in New York then too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: So, okay, you asked me that question, and I – somehow I jumped to someplace else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">A: Okay, so I delivered – we had a route also, to deliver, but sometimes, you know, it was a big – big delivery, so they asked me if I could deliver it to them.</span> <span id="s2288">Says okay, no problem.</span> <span id="s2289">So I came up there and I was talking – she – she had the daughter, I – she was also my customer, and the – the mother was a little bit – the elderly people, they didn’t clean much.</span> <span id="s2290">But a-anyway, she gave me for – her husband was still alive that time, so one suit I had.</span> <span id="s2291">So I said, okay, I’ll bring it to the daughter her stuff, and I’ll bring you the suit for – for – for her, for her husband.</span> <span id="s2292">And I came up, she said, oh, I’m expecting – my little niece is coming from Argentina.</span> <span id="s2293">My wife comes from Argentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: I says, little niece?</span> <span id="s2296">I said, oh.</span> <span id="s2297">Maybe – I figured maybe, little niece, 10 years old, or something.</span> <span id="s2298">So then she said, oh, I have a couple of dresses, Saul, could you take it for me and – and bring it back to me whenever you – you will be in this neighborhood?</span> <span id="s2299">I says, no problem.</span> <span id="s2300">She gave me two dresses, or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s2301">And it was on a Friday, and I come in and she says, oh Saul, meet my little niece.</span> <span id="s2302">My wi – I said, oh, this is your little niece?</span> <span id="s2303">She was – well, she was 18 years old, that time, 18 or 19 years old, something like that.</span> <span id="s2304">She was very good looking girl.</span> <span id="s2305">I said, oh, this is your little niece?</span> <span id="s2306">So I says, is it all right if I’ll take her and show her around a little bit, and – you know, downtown, or take her to movie?</span> <span id="s2307">Oh yeah, you could take her anytime you want.</span> <span id="s2308">So – but my wife spoke a little Yiddish – Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2310">So that’s how you communicated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: Yeah, but sh-she spoke mostly Spanish.</span> <span id="s2312">English, she didn't speak a word.</span> <span id="s2313">No-Nothing, no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: Had you learned English by this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">Q: Had you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Oh, I ma – my English was already good, I was already a nice couple of years in the – in the country.</span> <span id="s2318">I have already my own business, so – so then, I s – si – so my wife s-se – I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s2319">Try talk – she spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s2320">Not too good, but I could communicate with her, because her mother and parents, they spoke Yiddish, too, you see.</span> <span id="s2321">They come from the same place where I come from, from the Carpathians.</span> <span id="s2322">So that’s how I – I – I got very friendly with them, too, because she – she came from Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2324">Had they moved there before the war?</span> <span id="s2325">To Argentina?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: No, from a – no, this was after – after war, sh-sh – I think she came in 19 fif – 60 – 60?</span> <span id="s2327">‘59.</span> <span id="s2328">We got – I got married in ‘59.</span> <span id="s2329">So, was – so anyway, I said Ceil(ph), okay, the main thing is you have to learn English.</span> <span id="s2330">I said, either schools here – and she picked it up very fast.</span> <span id="s2331">Picked it up also very fast.</span> <span id="s2332">So that’s how I met her and I went – we went out, but see, she had a little problem with i – with old people.</span> <span id="s2333">If she wrote too many letters, you’re spending too much money, you know, [indecipherable] look – if she brushed the teeth, you put too – too much toothpaste, you know?</span> <span id="s2334">So I said s – and she told me that.</span> <span id="s2335">I says, okay, you know what?</span> <span id="s2336">I’m gonna buy you it – I bought a – a fi – a si – 50 stamps, I says, and you could write 50 letters.</span> <span id="s2337">If you needed more money, just let me know.</span> <span id="s2338">And I says, here is some money, you could buy your own things [indecipherable] give me this, give me that, I says, don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s2339">Thanks God I make a good living, I’m all right.</span> <span id="s2340">And I think after – after a close couple of months, you pass by and there was, on the – oh, I forget this.</span> <span id="s2341">I’m gonna tell you in a minute, it’ll come back to me.</span> <span id="s2342">You pass by there and they were rehearsing a – a wedding was going on.</span> <span id="s2343">So he say, oh, you want to see how they get married, how they rehearse for, because they’re gonna get married the next day, they – you know, they showed how the ushers go and the – all the steps they have to make.</span> <span id="s2344">Burnside(ph) Avenue, it was on –</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: – Burnside(ph) Avenue, nice place.</span> <span id="s2347">So in between we went to watch the wedding, the owner comes over to me, he says, can I help you?</span> <span id="s2348">And s – and so I says, well, we are not ready yet to get married, but soo-soon.</span> <span id="s2349">Oh, I have a good deal for you.</span> <span id="s2350">Listen to this, I have a good deal for you.</span> <span id="s2351">There was a couple that they had to get – you know, you have to give a down payment.</span> <span id="s2352">So they – something went wrong with that thing, and he says, I got a deposit, but if you want, you gonna get, instead of the deposit, I will give you much – a very good deal.</span> <span id="s2353">So I said, all right, let me think about it, I’ll think about it.</span> <span id="s2354">We went home, and I spoke to Ceil(ph) and she said, oh su – get married so soon?</span> <span id="s2355">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2356">Oh, right, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2357">So I says, all right, talk to your aunt, because she came to her aunt, you know.</span> <span id="s2358">I says, talk to your aunt, and we’ll – we’ll see.</span> <span id="s2359">And then I’ll – I’ll go back and I’ll find out what he wants and I’ll make the deal with him.</span> <span id="s2360">But, I says, I couldn't say it there right away that I’m gonna take it, because I have to talk to you first, too.</span> <span id="s2361">Maybe – maybe you don’t want to get married, I don’t – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2362">So right away, oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2363">So right away I went back and made the deal with him, and give me a good deal, because comparing, in those days, I think was he charged me 20 dollars for a couple, or for a pers – I don’t remember, but such a long time.</span> <span id="s2364">It’s almost 50 years, don’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: You don’t remember after – all those details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: It’s your anniversary this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: Yeah, October</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: October, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: October the 10th we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">A: So, that’s how we got married, and then we went to – for a honeymoon, also very close, in the Catskill mountains.</span> <span id="s2373">And we have a nice hotel, and we were there for a week.</span> <span id="s2374">I couldn’t – I couldn’t stay too long because of the business, but my cousin says, Saul, stay as long as you like.</span> <span id="s2375">So we – we stood there one – one week, or two weeks?</span> <span id="s2376">I think it was – I can’t tell you that, I don’t remember, so better don’t say anything.</span> <span id="s2377">So that’s how we got married, slowly.</span> <span id="s2378">We lived in – in Washington Heights, and after then we bought a house [indecipherable] Parkway section.</span> <span id="s2379">And then finally, somehow the – I said we – I have enough from the cleaning business, because it was a good business, but I left in the morning, I didn't see my kids, I came home at night, I didn’t see my kids.</span> <span id="s2380">So I said, we had eno – he wanted also get out from this thing, so – and then we had a friend, he said, let’s go for a – for a vacation, because the school was closed, it was Christmastime, said, let’s go to Miami, to Florida, from New York.</span> <span id="s2381">So I said, okay, I have a big car, I had an Impala Custom, a che – a Chevy, a big – it looked like a Cadillac.</span> <span id="s2382">Eight cylinders, you know, in those days.</span> <span id="s2383">So sh – her husband was a doctor, because they went together in school.</span> <span id="s2384">Celia went with a – with a doctor i-i-in the – in – in the high school there, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2385">So that’s how we – we knew them, we became friends.</span> <span id="s2386">So, I was the driver, and we went to Florida, and when I came to Florida, I says, I love this – this weather, I says, that’s the weather for me.</span> <span id="s2387">Going home we wind up in a snowstorm, and I d – I don’t know, in those days I used to get headaches, and I got a headache, so she said, okay, let me drive.</span> <span id="s2388">But I says – what’s was her name?</span> <span id="s2389">Well, ca – it’ll come back soon [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2390">Hi – hi – the husband’s name was Leethor(ph), and her name I forgot.</span> <span id="s2391">All right, so she said, I’m gonna drive.</span> <span id="s2392">I says, listen, be very careful how you drive.</span> <span id="s2393">You know, you cannot use brakes, because on snow you don’t use brakes.</span> <span id="s2394">So, oh don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t worry.</span> <span id="s2395">I said, hole – slow down a little bit, you’re going too fast, you’re going too fast.</span> <span id="s2396">And as soon as I said too fast, a car comes, and she was on a curve, and we wind up in the gutter.</span> <span id="s2397">I says, okay.</span> <span id="s2398">Luckily, they too – had to take us out from that, you know, I couldn’t get – I had a shovel, I had everything with me, I had to shovel out first, good, you know, to get out from there.</span> <span id="s2399">And then we got some helpers, they stopped and they helped us out.</span> <span id="s2400">I said, don’t ever touch my car again, because I said, I warned you, go slowly, go slowly.</span> <span id="s2401">Edith, Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: Edith.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: I says, Edith, I told you, I says.</span> <span id="s2404">You cannot use brakes on snow.</span> <span id="s2405">I says, you drive in New York, too, you drove in New York, I says, it’s the same thing here.</span> <span id="s2406">But here is – it’s so bad, and the snow was coming down so strong.</span> <span id="s2407">We had to stop and to read the sign I had to go and clean out the sign, I didn’t know where to go.</span> <span id="s2408">So I had to clean it out by hand to see – to read this – the sign.</span> <span id="s2409">So that’s how we went.</span> <span id="s2410">And, big snowstorm.</span> <span id="s2411">But thanks God we made it back home, and everything was all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: And you moved to Miami a few years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: No, we

eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: Ask you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: – actually, two more questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A:

coming to America and being liberated again, did you ever have any inclination to go to Palestine, or Israel, once it became Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Yes, yes, I had – I wanted to go to Israel in those days, because – I didn’t want to bring this in because he told me that you are only interested in – in the – from the concentration camps, the stories from the concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: We like a bit of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2442">So, I was on the ship, on the Exodus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: I went illegal to Israel.</span> <span id="s2445">Since you want to know –</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">Q: No, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">A: – so I’m gonna tell you now.</span> <span id="s2448">And when I was in Landsberg, and – and so – because his father, vel-Velvil(ph) – I mean, I called him Velvil(ph), his Jewish name was

spoke a good Jewish, you know, very nice, very good Jewish.</span> <span id="s2459">So he liked to talk to me because I spoke Yiddish and he practiced his Jewish.</span> <span id="s2460">So when I – because he says, if you want to go to America, I could arrange it for you, or if you want to go to – to Switzerland, or to Sweden, a lot of people went to Sweden, he said, I could arrange it, and every – I says, no, thank you very much, but I want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2461">You want to go to Israel, I went to a concentration camp, I had enough, I says.</span> <span id="s2462">I don’t want – I’m not looking for anything, I wa – want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2463">He says okay, he says, if you want to go, go to Landsberg, see this chief of police, and they gonna inform you, because you had to belong to a kibbutz, you know what a kibbutz is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: Mm-hm, little working community.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: Working community,

id="s2485">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: So, it says there, that the time will come, and the Jewish people will return to their – to their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">A: And others say in Hebrew it says –</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">Q: Once the messiah comes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">Q: Once the messiah comes you’ll return –</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2493">Not – this – yeah, the messiah is, but even before the messiah will come [indecipherable] and the Jewish ki – children will return to their promised land.</span> <span id="s2494">So, when I was reading this Bible, you know, I – I believe in the Bible, beca – in the – in the five co – in the five books of Moses.</span> <span id="s2495">And you have the New Testament, we have the Old Testament.</span> <span id="s2496">So I said, that’s the reason I want to se – I said, I am going to Israel.</span> <span id="s2497">But, i-in those days, so the British were against the – because they wanted the Arabs, they favored the Arabs.</span> <span id="s2498">Now, the Jews, if they smuggled in weapons or something, they went – used to go in the kibbutzim, and confiscate the Jewish weapons and sell them to the Arabs or something like this.</span> <span id="s2499">But then it came a time that the Jews got a little bit stronger, and they started to fight back the British.</span> <span id="s2500">I don’t know if you remember it when they bombed the King David hotel, it was the – the British headquarters in Jerusalem, and a lot of British soldiers died.</span> <span id="s2501">And they started to suffer.</span> <span id="s2502">You know, first they – they killed Jews and things, but then the Jews hit back, and they – they got the beating, too.</span> <span id="s2503">So then they decided they had enough, they – too much losses and they said they giving up.</span> <span id="s2504">But before they giving up, they thought that the – they confiscated weapons from the Jews and gave them to the Arabs, and they took away the weapons from the Jews, but the Jews got weap – different – from different places they got weapons.</span> <span id="s2505">And they were hundred percent sure that the Jewish people, who in those days, I don’t know, a million and – tops a million and a half or something like that, and the Arabs were in the hundred millions.</span> <span id="s2506">There was Egypt, there was Lebanon, Syrian, Jordan.</span> <span id="s2507">Jordan had a well equipped army with tanks and things.</span> <span id="s2508">What the Jews, they had a couple of rifles, and things like that.</span> <span id="s2509">So anyway, the Jews didn’t have no choice, but they went in le – illegally, on boats, you know, they came in.</span> <span id="s2510">This ship, Exodus – come, I’ll show you something, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2512">Here we go.</span> <span id="s2513">Let me take the mic from this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">A: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s2515">I have to sit, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: – I’ll show you the picture afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: I forgot we got again the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: We can pause and get the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: Yeah, I’ll – I’ll show you – I’ll show everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2523">A: So anyway – so they – they thought now, as soon as the British are gonna leave, the Arabs will attack.</span> <span id="s2524">And that’s what they did, really.</span> <span id="s2525">They knew ahead of times, and they gonna wipe out the Jewish people one, two, three.</span> <span id="s2526">But, you know, when God promises something, and he watches over you, you could have a billion army, and you have hundred people, and who – who goes out the – the winner is what God wants, right?</span> <span id="s2527">And then, the British left, and the U.N. wa – said they should divide Israel half.</span> <span id="s2528">Half Jerusalem for the Arabs, and have half Israel for the Arabs.</span> <span id="s2529">Half Israel, half Arabs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: But the Arabs didn’t want half, they wanted everything, the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2532">And the Jews weren’t ready to give them.</span> <span id="s2533">Now here, Israel has nothing, comparing with the Arab side.</span> <span id="s2534">Jordan had a regular army trained by the British, with tanks, with airplanes, with all thing, what did the Jew have?</span> <span id="s2535">Nothing.</span> <span id="s2536">Couple of tanks or machine guns.</span> <span id="s2537">But the Czechoslovakian sent help out for the – for Israel [indecipherable] Russia in those days helped.</span> <span id="s2538">America was – stayed away.</span> <span id="s2539">Didn’t do anything for the – at that time, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2540">But, as soon as the British left and the u – unite [clears throat] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2541">The United Nations declared Israel as a state, the Arabs didn’t want to agree on anything, and as soon as Israel declared a state, that was – the first premier was dur – Beng-Ben-Gurion.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: You weren't in Israel at that point though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: No, no, I wasn’t in i – I came to Israel, but I was caught by the – let me – let me just continue –</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">A: – and then I’ll come back –</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: – with the thing.</span> <span id="s2548">So anyway, the bri – the – the United Nations, they voted in Israel as half – half – we’ll divide it half and half, but Arabs didn’t agree on that.</span> <span id="s2549">They wanted everything, and as soon as they gathered the army from Egypt, they gathered the army from – from Jordan, Syria helped out, Saudi Arabia, everybody against little Israel.</span> <span id="s2550">But what happened?</span> <span id="s2551">Israel, the – the b – st – yeah – Egypt, with Egypt, it started first with Egypt.</span> <span id="s2552">Egypt said that from now on the Jews cannot use the Red Sea, they block – put a blockade against Israeli shipping, because Israel had already a couple of ships that used to come, as you know, commercial ships.</span> <span id="s2553">So since isra – since Egypt came out with that tank that – in other words, they stopped the select – you have a job, and they take away from you a job, you cannot co – you cannot – they wouldn’t let you live.</span> <span id="s2554">So didn’t have only one thing.</span> <span id="s2555">They went and instead of Egypt attacking Israel, Israel attacked Egypt.</span> <span id="s2556">And they had already a couple of American Jewish pilots that they used to be in the second World War, went to help Israel.</span> <span id="s2557">And they got a – a couple of planes, and Egypt had the big air force already, but Israel attacked first and wiped out the whole Egyptian Air Force.</span> <span id="s2558">That was the main thing what they did, number one.</span> <span id="s2559">And once they divide – they – they got the air force finished, and Egypt got stuck in the middle, where everything was going in the Sinai, in the desert, because they were starting to march, but it was too late already for them.</span> <span id="s2560">And then the tan – tanks came, and Israel wiped out the whole tanks, and surrounded Egypt and Egypt had such a defeat that they just hardly made it alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: When Jordan seen what Israel did to Egypt, they started coming down from – from the it – what do you call that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">Q: The –</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">A: The Golan Heights –</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">A: – the Golan Heights.</span> <span id="s2567">See, the Golan Heights – have you ever been in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: I haven’t, but I know the geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: You know the geography.</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2572">See, the Golan Heights goes up like this in the mountain, and then when you come all the way on top is – is Syria.</span> <span id="s2573">From there you could just walk in straight to Syria.</span></p> <p><span id="s2574">Q: So they came in through there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2575">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2576">But see, Jordan – Syrian, they used to bomb because they used to live by the [indecipherable] it’s like a swamp, you know, where you step in the ground you could sink in til about here, you know, it’s – it’s soft land, they call it the sump(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2578">A: This – th – it’s more water than thing and it’s – you cannot walk there, you know.</span> <span id="s2579">So they used – an-and people, the Israelis used to already dry out the sumps(ph) and to – to grow wheat or corn, whatever it is.</span> <span id="s2580">And the Syrians from the top, when they used to – because they had the Heights.</span> <span id="s2581">So they used to shoot down with cannons and things and used to kill a lot of Israelis.</span> <span id="s2582">Now they said oh, Israel attacked Egypt, now we gonna attack Israel.</span> <span id="s2583">And they came down with the mountains with the tanks.</span> <span id="s2584">But, going up on the tanks, when th – Israel was ready also with tanks they had already, because they got shipment.</span> <span id="s2585">France helped Israel a lot, Russians, Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s2586">So they had already more weapons, and they caught a lot of Egyptian weapons.</span> <span id="s2587">That’s where they made.</span> <span id="s2588">And also, they called those rockets, the rockets, you know, where they – to shoot up, and wit – that was the Vietnam war, I think it was that.</span> <span id="s2589">But France somehow, I don’t know, something went wrong between France and Israel, and France stopped delivering – no more weapons, but Israel bought from them some boats, speedboats, and they – Israel paid for them, but she couldn’t deliver them yet, she said the – an – they had a date when to pick them up.</span> <span id="s2590">And France said – wouldn’t give back the money to Israel and wouldn’t give back the boats for Israel.</span> <span id="s2591">So Israel, at night, from i – from France to Israel is not very far.</span> <span id="s2592">So they had also boats, and they came at night and they kipnapped – kipnap – kidnapped all those boats out.</span> <span id="s2593">It was – belonged to them.</span> <span id="s2594">So says, we paid for it, but the – France didn't want to give them out.</span> <span id="s2595">For what re – I don’t remember the reason exactly why.</span> <span id="s2596">So anyway, they took out the boats and that’s how France stopped giving them no more – no – because they used to sa – sell them Mirage, the jets.</span> <span id="s2597">The French mira – like you have here the – the Americans have the-their jets, what do you call the American jets?</span> <span id="s2598">The Phantoms?</span> <span id="s2599">Phantom jets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2600">Q: Phantoms, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: So over there the – the brit – the – France they had the Mirages, and it was a good plane.</span> <span id="s2602">In those days if – a Mirage used to be a million dollars.</span> <span id="s2603">So, anyway, when Syria said now we gonna teach those Jews a lesson, and they planted mines all the way – in other words they knew that the – Israel has the tanks that they co-could come up, and they planted – there was a lot of sand there.</span> <span id="s2604">And then it was a mir – another miracle happened that that night – they didn’t know that – the knew that there was – but they didn’t know exactly where the – the mines are, and they went into one place, they were surrounded by the mine fields, and it was very dangerous for them to continue.</span> <span id="s2605">They didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s2606">Suddenly, a – a – a sandstorm came, and blow out all the sand, and you could see the mines, they could see where the mines are laying.</span> <span id="s2607">All they went, the soldiers, they knew how to handle those things.</span> <span id="s2608">They picked up the mines, and then they went up, and they – then come the big battle, it was a fierce battle, cause the Syrians, they have very well prepared and fortified, because they were on the top, and the Jews were on the – on the bottom.</span> <span id="s2609">So you know when you are on top what you could do when – go up –</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: It’s much easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: But finally, a b – very bad fight [indecipherable] fight, and the Jews gained that, and they went all the way up, they almost went into Syria, but they stopped just in front of Damascus.</span> <span id="s2612">They could have gone inside, but America told them to stop, not to go in and they stopped.</span> <span id="s2613">So then – so then they – they annihilated th-the whole brit – the whole Egyptian army, the whole Syrian army, and Lebanese armies.</span> <span id="s2614">So one little – couple of people against – against millions.</span> <span id="s2615">So here, used to say it was a miracle, because God told you that the Jewish people will return.</span> <span id="s2616">Now, you see, they still did not return completely, because this is not the turning place, you see, now they still want – they still want half of – of Israel now.</span> <span id="s2617">Even they lost everything and they start with the fight.</span> <span id="s2618">Israel wanted to give them everything half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: Like the U.N – nited Nations, but the United States was crooked too, so – so that’s – that’s the story is now – you – you seen Netanyahu was here.</span> <span id="s2621">And I don’t know what happened, what they – what they arranged something, I really don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s2622">So, in another couple of days, when they read the newspapers, you’ll find out, more or less –</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: – what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: What about your experiences on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Yeah, I wanted to show you the – the ship –</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: I have a picture, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s2629">Q: Shall we take a break?</span> <span id="s2630">A: Yeah, take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2632">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2633">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: All right, I have two more questions for you.</span> <span id="s2635">The first is that I noticed that you have the tattoo on your arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">Q: And could you tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2638">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: And then could you tell us your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2641">The tattoo is – you see, in – when you were in the concentration camps, they – they – that denigrated you so low, that they didn’t want to call you by your name, you were only a number.</span> <span id="s2642">There’s a reason they give you – see, this is B10140 is my tattoo number.</span> <span id="s2643">That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">Q: That’s all you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">A: And if you were in that time in Auschwitz – as a matter of fact, I had here – where I put it?</span> <span id="s2646">Oh, here it is.</span> <span id="s2647">Now, you’ll have a chance – you could read it after.</span> <span id="s2648">It’s not my name, but the similar people that after the war they got together also, but they had the higher – higher number – yeah, a later number than mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: Tattoos from Auschwitz horror reunite lost inmates.</span> <span id="s2650">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: Right, right –</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s2653">A: Somebody – somebody in the synagogue showed it to me, because he seen that I had a number, he says he got it from the computer, so I should read it.</span> <span id="s2654">So it just so happened that I got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: So were you able to meet anyone because of your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: No, there in Israel, you know, it’s – there’s a lot of people that I met –</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: – with the – with the same numbers.</span> <span id="s2661">I mean, in – in the sequence numbers.</span> <span id="s2662">My number is 10,000, their – their maybe is 15,000 or different.</span> <span id="s2663">Or sometimes you could get even the next number, next – but so far I never met – met those type of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">Q: Do you have a lot of people that ask you about your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: Yeah, sure, yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s2666">But there was also numbers – they – they made a K and an L on your forehead.</span> <span id="s2667">That was rude.</span> <span id="s2668">Concentration camp, you know, th – in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">Q: But did the k –</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">A: Koncentrations Lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">A: The KL, Koncentration Lager.</span> <span id="s2673">You see, I spoke flu – when I came here to – to America, I spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s2674">Fluently, good.</span> <span id="s2675">But if you don’t speak for so many years, you get s – I still understand, if I have to go in a German store, I could unders – as a matter of fact wh-when I had the dry cleaning business, was a German professor, a lady, very nice lady.</span> <span id="s2676">She was teaching German.</span> <span id="s2677">And she – there’s the only pe – person she used to come in and talk to me in German, you know, so I was able to talk with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A: But now, it’s – I’m so rusty and it – even my Jewish starts getting slowly rusty, because we speak only English in – in – in the house.</span> <span id="s2680">Very seldom – my wife sometimes speaks Yiddish or something.</span> <span id="s2681">But if you don’t use a language often, yo-you get – specially German, I didn’t use for a long, long, long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: She was my customer [indecipherable] and that.</span> <span id="s2684">She had a whole family, they used to all come to me, and she was – what was her name?</span> <span id="s2685">Come back soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: [indecipherable] think about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: It’s one thing, I forget the name, but in a few minutes it comes back.</span> <span id="s2688">Okay, so go ahead, ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: One last question –</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: – you were – you were telling me earlier, and I would just like you to say this again, why you like doing this, and why you think it’s such a good idea to tell your story when others can’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Oh, oh, I see, yeah.</span> <span id="s2693">Well, you see, the thing is this.</span> <span id="s2694">You have to tell the world what the German people did – did to the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2695">Now, a lot of people th – the – they were cremated o-or killed, in – i-in the war time, they cannot speak no more, because they are dead.</span> <span id="s2696">And those people who got liberated, they have the ability to s – to let know the – the rest of the world what was going on, and they should be always on – on the alert, because you never know what could happen.</span> <span id="s2697">You never know what could happen.</span> <span id="s2698">Right, take a look for instance Germany.</span> <span id="s2699">It was a culture nation of – who would believe that they would produce such a killer machine and kill 10,000 people overnight?</span> <span id="s2700">Oh, I forgot to tell you about the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: What about the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: So you want me to tell you?</span> <span id="s2703">Q: Yeah, what about the Gypsies?</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2705">I was in the D camp that time.</span> <span id="s2706">I was on this side, the Gypsies, they were living with families, women, children, man, they were living together, and I was living the other side of the barracks.</span> <span id="s2707">And one night, we were alread – everybody was asleep.</span> <span id="s2708">Suddenly they open up the big – see, the front of the barracks were very tall.</span> <span id="s2709">From here til here, you n – a truck could back up and load in people, it was specially made like this and vi – the doors were quite high up.</span> <span id="s2710">But see, this door is what – what is, eight feet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">Q: Yeah, about eight feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">A: That one was about 16 feet, so a truck –</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">A: – big truck would fit in there.</span> <span id="s2715">Suddenly I heard big commotion, the dra – the doors open up and the trucks start mov – and this is in our barrack, barrack – what is my barrack, twen – 27, yeah, 27.</span> <span id="s2716">And ji – the Gestapo with – with the dogs, you know, with those shepherds, and out and chasing us into the – into the – into the trucks, and we didn't know f – suddenly nothing, nobody, no warning ma – imagine you’re half asleep and suddenly someone comes in with dogs and screaming and hitting you with things.</span> <span id="s2717">And everybody, we were like panic-strick, you know?</span> <span id="s2718">And they chasing you with dogs in-into the truck and ra – you know, hurry up, and thi – and one dog, I cou – I have here, it’s still a mark that the –</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: I don’t remember if this or – let me see, I f – I forgot or – even on what foot it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: It’s okay, you don’t have to show me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: No, I’ll – I’ll show – I’ll show you –</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2724">A: – I’ll show you, I will show you.</span> <span id="s2725">I have to see it.</span> <span id="s2726">Okay, after then I’ll – I want to show you the thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">A: And so they – yeah, so thi – this is the barrack right?</span> <span id="s2729">I was here already, see, right here.</span> <span id="s2730">They had to go all the way, from all over to push in the – the kids in the thing.</span> <span id="s2731">There was not one truck, this [indecipherable] trucks, I – I just seen one, and then I see the other – the other – moved in, the other backed in.</span> <span id="s2732">But then it happened – it was already half of the barrack almost emp – in – in the truck inside, then they get an order, you got in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s2733">They had to go on the other side, on the Gypsy sides, doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s2734">So they ran in – now they chased you out from that truck, raus witar(ph), you know, get out, you know, in German, they – everything was in German there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: We still didn’t know

id="s2742">Now, they – they – the trucks backed out, everybody got out from the trucks, they go to the other side, and they went to the Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">A: They did the same thing with the Gypsy families.</span> <span id="s2745">I don’t know how many thousand of Gypsies there were there.</span> <span id="s2746">There was a couple

children and men.</span> <span id="s2757">Now, what had caused that?</span> <span id="s2758">I never find out.</span> <span id="s2759">But that’s what happened in Auschwitz, and that’s what happened in our barrack.</span> <span id="s2760">So, they made a mistake, first they came to us, and then they got an order they got in the wrong place.</span> <span id="s2761">They kicked us out again, and then they went on the other side, and in one night they annihilated all the Gypsy populations.</span> <span id="s2762">They were German Gypsies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">Q: That’s awful.</span>

know.</span> <span id="s2769">And maybe tomorrow I’m gonna go, oh, I forgot to tell you this, or – or like – same thing like, see, I didn’t even tell you about this, you see?</span> <span
