<p><span id="s12">Question: Good morning, Mr. Shipper.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Good morning to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Now, it’s a -- it’s my pleasure and it’s an honor to come to the United States, you know, to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s16">So, I’m only too pleased to be here.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Well, we’re glad to have you.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me if you would your -- the name you were born with and what town you were born in.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I -- my name is -- originally was Zygmund Shipper.</span> <span id="s20">Now it is Ziggy Shipper, you know, because in England Zygmund would have been a problem, you know, with pronunciation and -- but it was -- it’s Shipper now and it was Shipper originally, except the spelling was different, it was S-zed-y-p-e-r and now it’s S-h-i- double p -e-r.</span> <span id="s21">The reason, my wife decided when we got married, because when we had children they had problems at school, you know, is it Zyper, is it Zipper?</span> <span id="s22">So we thought the best thing is that we change the spelling, and we did.</span> <span id="s23">Now, I was born in a city, second biggest city in Poland, called Lódz, L-o-d-zed, and that’s where I lived til I was deported from Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: And you were born in 1930, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I was born, yes, 18th of January, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And tell me a little about your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well, unfortunately my parents, you know -- I come from a very Orthodox family, Jewish Orthodox family and my parents were divorced and my mother left me with my father and my grandparents.</span> <span id="s28">And with a Jewish family in the 1930’s Orthodox, divorce was as bad as death, or even worse, you know.</span> <span id="s29">It was such a terrible thing for a Jewish family, you know.</span> <span id="s30">So as far as I knew, you know, after awhile, you know, I -- I thought my mother was dead, and I didn’t see my mother and that was it.</span> <span id="s31">So I was just left with my grandparents, of course, and my father, which my father worked, so I didn’t see that much of him either.</span> <span id="s32">But my grandmother, as far as I can remember, she was a wonderful woman and I owe her so much that I wish I could have told her that when I grew up, but unfortunately there was no chance of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s34">Would you like to tell me your grandparents’ names and where they were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My grandfather was Itzhak Szypers, he was from Lódz.</span> <span id="s36">My grandmother came from a place called Zduńska Wola, and her name was Esther Berger, before she has a ma -- her maiden name, before she got married.</span> <span id="s37">I had -- she had six children.</span> <span id="s38">Unfortunately, two of my aunts died well before the war.</span> <span id="s39">One aunt was left and I also -- my father had two brothers, which were in the -- with me all the -- well, not with me, but they were -- they were in the -- in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Mm-hm, so you had an extended family --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: I had an extended family, yes, and my father and one of my uncles and my grandfather worked in the same business, they had their own business in -- import business of chemical materials.</span> <span id="s42">And the other uncle was an engineer, he had his own business, you know, he worked.</span> <span id="s43">So in a way, I think, from what I know now that we had a -- a reasonable comfortable life, you know, I -- I remember having enou -- my own bedroom, which is almost unheard.</span> <span id="s44">But I suppose because we lived in a big city, it was a second -- as I said, second biggest city in Poland, and you know, there was a million inhabitants before the war, and 25 percent, like 240,000 were Jewish people.</span> <span id="s45">I went to a Jewish school, you know, I -- it wasn’t a cheder or a Orthodox school, it was a Jewish school, but we learned Hebrew much more so than -- we didn't learn the Bible or things like that.</span> <span id="s46">Hebrew we learned and -- and all the other things that children of six, seven, eight learn, you know, it was -- it was almost a normal life I had.</span> <span id="s47">I don’t -- after awhile I don’t think I missed that I haven’t got my mother, you know, really.</span> <span id="s48">I was -- maybe I was too young too, because my grandmother was -- was a -- certainly a very good substitute for a mother, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Was your grandfather working when you were small, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s51">He was in the business with my -- where my father was there, and my uncle, the three of them worked in the business, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What was the name of the business, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Szyper and sin, you know.</span> <span id="s54">Father and son, the name of the father and just son, it’s like it would be here Berger and sons, limited, that company.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s56">They were importing chemicals for -- do you know what --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Yes, soda and those big bottles of -- of different acids and things like that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: All I remember, my father had to wear goggles and gloves, you know, to protect, because it was coming on trains, you know, the -- their place was on a railway sidings.</span> <span id="s60">So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: They had a warehouse?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Oh yes, a very big warehouse, you know, and that’s what I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s64">And your school was all Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: All Jewish children, the school I went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: And did you like school, were you happy in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: As far as I remember, yes, you know, I -- I -- I wa -- there was no choice anyway and at -- I think so.</span> <span id="s70">I -- you know, it’s going back 70 years.</span> <span id="s71">I should imagine that I did like school.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And -- and you were born in 1930, so you grew up throughout the 1930’s in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Any -- anything remarkable that you remember in those early years before 1939 about your life, or was it just --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: N-No, I mean -- I didn’t come across -- you see, that’s -- the thing was that the school was in the same building at -- where we lived, you see?</span> <span id="s76">It was a small school and so I didn’t come across anti-Semitism as much as other children that had to go in the street in school and non-Jew, you know, Polish kids, so -- and they used to throw stones at them, and so on and call them names and there were always fights.</span> <span id="s77">I guess I wasn’t out that much, only played in the yard with other children, even with Poles.</span> <span id="s78">Course, lots of times, you know, there were anti-Semitic remarks, but there -- it didn’t mean that much to me, I didn’t quite understand what it meant, you know, why are they calling me dirty Jew, or something like that.</span> <span id="s79">You see, which they did, you know, in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: But it -- it -- I had no problems about, you know, possibly, you know, when you’re six, seven, eight years old, I don’t think any child has problems, they just fight.</span> <span id="s82">If it wouldn’t be with them, most probably they would have fought amongst each other, you know, whether were they Jewish kids or non-Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s84">Did you ever travel anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Ah, no.</span> <span id="s86">I have -- the only place we went, we -- we traveled to a place called Columnow, which was sort of a s -- not a seaside because we weren’t on the sea.</span> <span id="s87">You know, there wa -- there was a lake and you know, and I remember going swimming, you know, we went away, sort of.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t know what month it was, whether it was July or August, because Poland gets very cold in the winter, but very hot in the summer, you know, and I remember going there as a child and having a good time, you know?</span> <span id="s89">I -- on the whole, I think I had a good life, you know, til 19 -- til September 1939, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you live in a part of town where there were mostly Jews then?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, I lived in a -- in one of the main st -- roads in -- in Lódz, you know, it’s funny enough, I went to visit it first time I went back to Poland.</span> <span id="s94">And even -- it was a nice apartment and i -- ik -- we even had a -- we lived on a second floor, we -- as I said, we -- I had my own bedroom, you know, and we had a balcony, you know, and -- you know, even when I showed it to my daughters when I went back to Poland, I couldn't believe it, you know, I mean, because, you know, everybody -- well, not everybody, most people I s -- in England, and I don’t know how it is in the U.S. think that everybody lived like “Fiddler on the Roof” in a little shtetl.</span> <span id="s95">It wasn't, you know.</span> <span id="s96">Warsaw, Kraków, Lódz, you know, they were big cities, and you know there were -- there were poor areas, naturally, and there were sort of not so much affluent areas.</span> <span id="s97">But there were the areas, you know, which all apartments.</span> <span id="s98">There was no small houses or something like that, that was all apartments.</span> <span id="s99">But I mean, you know, it -- it is just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s100">When I tell my friends, they don’t even want to believe that we had a telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: You see, I-I’m -- not that I spoke on the telephone, I’m sure I wouldn’t know how to dial it even, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: So it was -- it -- it -- as I said, I think it -- we had a good life, as I had a good life as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Had wonderful gr -- well, parents almost, they weren’t parents, but grandparents.</span> <span id="s107">As I said, my father I didn’t see that much, you know, because he worked all day and I suppose he had his own life to lead.</span> <span id="s108">But he knew that he left me with good -- and so I s-suppose my mother must have known that she is leaving me with -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Did your mother ever come back to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: My mother came back once, and I still remember that.</span> <span id="s111">I don’t know whether I was six years old, five years old, you know, don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s112">And I c -- I wouldn’t go to her and I screamed.</span> <span id="s113">I even hit her or scratched her or something like that.</span> <span id="s114">I -- I just -- I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s115">You know, today I think back, why did I do it, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Did you know who she was, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I didn’t know who she was, but she says I’m your mother and maybe that’s what -- you know, maybe I thought how could you be my mother if my mother is dead, you know, and so on.</span> <span id="s120">I -- you know, I tried to analyze it -- I did years ago to analyze it, which you can’t, you know, but no, I wasn't happy to see her and when she left I didn’t -- didn’t mean anything to me, I mean, she left and I think that’s it, I’ll never see her again, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you know -- was there -- do you know why she left?</span> <span id="s122">Did you ever hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: No.</span> <span id="s124">It’s -- it’s one of my regrets, you know, that I never knew why she left, you know?</span> <span id="s125">I -- look, when you sort of -- especially when you grow up and you’re 13 - 14 and you see other people with mothers and fathers, you know, and -- and you think to yourself, how could she leave me?</span> <span id="s126">But of course you get older and you realize things are not that simple, you know, that there must have been a good reason why she left.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Well tell me now about the late 30’s and -- and how did you notice things starting to change in your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Well, in -- in about 19 -- I would say 1938 there was a lot of talk about war.</span> <span id="s129">You know, eight year old boy, I mean, what did I know about war?</span> <span id="s130">I didn’t even mean -- didn’t realize what it means there’s a war.</span> <span id="s131">And they said, you know, Germany and the Germans will come in and they -- I [indecipherable] and this was carry on like that til 1939, you know, and then 1939, you know, in September ’39, one morning I was in bed, you know, my father came to me and he said he has to go away.</span> <span id="s132">And I said, why are you going away, you know?</span> <span id="s133">So I says -- I thought to myself, now here a mother I haven’t got, now I won’t even have a father.</span> <span id="s134">Oh no, he says, don’t worry at all, I’ll be back within six months because there’s going to be a war and the German armies are going to invade Poland and the first thing they will do is take all the young men away, you know, but you and your grandmother and grandfather and the children a -- they will -- won’t touch them, it’s only the young people.</span> <span id="s135">Of course, he couldn’t have been more wrong, but nevertheless he left and I never saw my father again.</span> <span id="s136">He run away to Russia and I suppose conditions in Russia were not that good either because at that time the Russians already were together with the Germans, they split up Poland in half, you know, some part went to Russia and so on.</span> <span id="s137">So he decided to come back, and he managed to get to Warsaw, because Warsaw was by then -- the whole of Poland was already occupied by the Germans or by the Russians.</span> <span id="s138">But Warsaw was a occupied part of Poland by the Germans.</span> <span id="s139">Lódz was part of Germany, they annexed it.</span> <span id="s140">That’s the Third Reich.</span> <span id="s141">So he couldn’t get back to us, you see?</span> <span id="s142">But that’s what I had found out, later.</span> <span id="s143">But ’39 when he left, you know, and within a few weeks, of course, the German armies came in and things completely changed straight away.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Do you remember that, when --</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s146">I remember certain things, not everything.</span> <span id="s147">I-I -- I hadn’t seen it, but everybody was talking about it, first of all, as soon as they came in they destroyed most of the synagogues in -- in -- in Poland, in Lódz especially, you know.</span> <span id="s148">And -- and you know, to -- to a -- to a child, even nine year old, you know, being brought up as -- in a very Orthodox family, you know, to destroy a synagogue is -- is the most terrible thing that could happen.</span> <span id="s149">But of course everything changed, you know.</span> <span id="s150">We -- we weren’t allowed to travel on normal transport like on trams.</span> <span id="s151">We had trams in Lódz, we couldn’t travel on trams.</span> <span id="s152">I found out because I never traveled on trains, you know, but you couldn’t travel on a train.</span> <span id="s153">Jewish doctors couldn’t practice medicine, Jewish teachers couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s154">And of course, there was no school, you know.</span> <span id="s155">I left school when I was -- in June.</span> <span id="s156">That’s where they had stopped it in -- in Poland at the time and I was about nine and a half years old, and I never went back to school.</span> <span id="s157">That was my education in life.</span> <span id="s158">And every day different things happened.</span> <span id="s159">I mean, ya -- you know, we couldn’t -- we weren’t allowed to walk -- not that people came out of [indecipherable] they were too frightened to come out, but you know you’ve got to eat, you’ve got to buy food.</span> <span id="s160">And food was scarce because Jewish shops weren’t opened, they closed them up.</span> <span id="s161">We weren’t even allowed to walk on pavements, you know.</span> <span id="s162">But of course children like my age, you know, we got away with it, we walked.</span> <span id="s163">But the thing was, you know, they called a je -- a -- a Jewish man, you know, with the long beard, which they knew he was a Jew, you could recognize the Jewish people that were Orthodox, especially in -- in Lódz.</span> <span id="s164">They used to -- first thing they did, you know, took out the beard off and I -- and I asked why are they doing, you know, I didn’t ask the Germans, I asked my grandmother, why do they do that?</span> <span id="s165">They said, purely to humiliate him, you know, because they know it’s the most terrible thing to have that beard cut off.</span> <span id="s166">And then they made him wash the pavement, for no reason at all, just to degrade him, to humiliate him, to -- and you know, you’re not even 10 years old, you cannot understand why and you keep asking question and there is like always, there’s -- there’s no answers why.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did anything like that happen specifically to your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No.</span> <span id="s169">My grandfather didn’t go out, you see, and he was at home and food was very, very scarce and he was getting weaker and weaker and -- and -- because he wouldn’t eat that food that wasn’t kosher and kosher food was almost impossible to get.</span> <span id="s170">So he lived on bread an-and potatoes and things like that, you could still get some.</span> <span id="s171">But it was getting more and more difficult and then they decided, you know, to recognize every Jew that is not recognizable, we have to wear a Star of David and in -- in some places, like in [indecipherable] they used to wear one in the front.</span> <span id="s172">We had to wear one in the front and the back so that the minute th-they saw you they -- they knew who you were, so you get beaten up, especially the older people, not -- you know, and the children started stealing food wherever they could, you know, to bring home.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Was your grandmother then going out to get food or try to find food --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Yes, when she --</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: -- had to, I -- there was no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: And would you with her when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I don’t remember me ever going with her, you know, but we were out, you know.</span> <span id="s181">When I say stealing food, there was a lot of trees with apples and pears and plums and things like that, you know, whatever there was at that time of the year.</span> <span id="s182">You know, we used to go and st-steal and we used to get beaten up, but you know, but when you s -- nine, 10 years old, it’s -- it’s a game more than anything else, so we didn't mind, you know, we got beaten up, so we went next day again an-and bring home something, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: So she didn’t try to keep you in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Not that I can tell.</span> <span id="s185">I’m sure she tried, but you know -- you know what that 10 year old child is, it’s -- you know, he goes anyway, you know.</span> <span id="s186">She turns around and he’s out, you know, it’s -- and that’s what I did, you know.</span> <span id="s187">A-And then it’s by November of 1939 we were told, you know, I -- I was told by my grandmother, you know, we’ve got to leave our apartment.</span> <span id="s188">We’ve got to move to a certain area of Lódz, which was the poorest area of Lódz, which was called Baluty, you know, it’s funny enough, a lot of Jewish people lived there before the war, you see.</span> <span id="s189">And of course, a lot of Polish people lived -- now the Poles had to move out of their apartments and we had to move into theirs.</span> <span id="s190">Now, the Poles were very happy about it, because they moved into a good area, a nice apartment, nice furniture, because we couldn’t take much with us, you know, and out of the three bedroom apartment we had with a bathroom, you know, a -- we managed my -- and I had an aunt also living with us, and the four of us moved into one single room on a second floor in a -- in a tenement building with stone steps.</span> <span id="s191">And it was already November, it was getting very cold.</span> <span id="s192">In November it’s full blown winter in Poland and no running water, no toilet or everything.</span> <span id="s193">And the four of us had one single room, no kitchen, no nothing, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Do you remember going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Do you remember how -- how was your grandmother and grandfather, how were they notified and -- and do you remember that moment when they were notified?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s198">All I remember is going on a horse and cart, you know, with a bit of things we had to take with us, you know, we’ve -- I don’t -- I don’t even know how we found it, that -- that apartment, but all I remember is living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: And did you go -- was it far from where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: And you had to go across town?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: The other side of town, right across town.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Did you go with other people, or do you remember seeing people on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: Oh yes, there was a whole lot of people going all the time, from morning til night, moving there.</span> <span id="s205">I don’t even know how we found, whether we were offered that place, or we were allocated that place.</span> <span id="s206">I don’t know, that I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s207">Maybe I was too young to -- to know.</span> <span id="s208">But I know where it was, I remember the name, the street, the number, the second floor, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What was the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Limanowskiego 26.</span> <span id="s211">And it was, the thing was, you see, by April the whole -- everybody in Lódz had to be -- if he was caught outside the ghetto, he was shot.</span> <span id="s212">So by that they surrounded with barbed wire.</span> <span id="s213">They had -- we had our own Jewish police and a Jewish sort of committee, government thing with a -- with a leader of that.</span> <span id="s214">His name, I’m sure you know, was Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s215">And -- but the street where I lived they had a problem because how would they go from -- the Germans or the Poles go from one side of town to the other?</span> <span id="s216">So two streets were blocked -- were -- the actual road was outside the ghetto with barbed wires.</span> <span id="s217">And for us to cross -- we had the bridge, or two bridges to cross from one side -- because I worked on the other side, we had to cross on a bridge.</span> <span id="s218">So they -- which was, in a way for -- for us it was lucky, because what was happening, when lorries with food and potatoes or carrots or something, they weren’t in sacks, they were loose -- or they [indecipherable], so, you know, you soon find ways, so we had long wires and we used to try to hook them onto the lorries when they were passing, or a horse and cart, and move that thing and they fell down and eventually we could get some potatoes or whatever was on the [indecipherable] we had -- we had to try to steal things.</span> <span id="s219">But the worst thing was, winter came and you know, we had to go downstairs to fetch water, you know, to pump actually water and to carry up [indecipherable] and that I still remember.</span> <span id="s220">I remember falling down because it was all frozen, you know, and it was slippery from the water, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And that was your job, to go get the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Well, it wasn’t my job, but somebody had to do it.</span> <span id="s223">My grandfather could -- certainly couldn’t do it because he was already too ill and, you know, within a very short time he died, in 1940.</span> <span id="s224">And purely from -- from -- I think he had a broken heart because he was so religious and he so had -- even -- even the rabbis came and they said, you know, you can eat anything, because you know, life is more important than anything else.</span> <span id="s225">But he wouldn’t and he -- he died from malnutrition and -- and everything else.</span> <span id="s226">So it was just left my aunt still there an-and she died soon afterwards as well, and it was just my grandmother and I, and then they said, you know, we each could get the ration card, but you had to work.</span> <span id="s227">If you didn’t work, you didn’t get the ration card.</span> <span id="s228">I was about 10 and a half when I started working in a metal factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Before we get to the metal factory, tell me something about when your grandfather died.</span> <span id="s230">Did -- did you take him -- there was a cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: There was a cemetery in -- which is even there today.</span> <span id="s236">You know, there was a cemetery just a -- just outside but it was still in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Right at the end of town, there was a Jewish cemetery there.</span> <span id="s239">Because as I said too, you know, before the war there was a lot of Jewish people living in that area, in the poor area, you know, and of course so they had a cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: And did someone come and get his body and take him there --</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Oh yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: -- or did you have to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: -- yeah, it was a proper, it was a proper -- at that time still, in 1940, yes, proper --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: So that --</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: -- everybody that died in the ghetto was buried there.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: And then there was a service of any kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I honestly don’t remember a servi -- I’m sure there must have been something, and as I said, I -- one of my uncles was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s250">You see, my father wasn’t, but one of my uncles was in the ghetto, so I’m sure he was there that could say kaddishim, you know, but I don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s251">I -- I certainly wasn’t at the funeral.</span> <span id="s252">Why?</span> <span id="s253">Because I would say the first time I went to a funeral was in -- in London, in England.</span> <span id="s254">So I am sure I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I would have remembered.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s258">But -- so it would have been your grandmother and your aunt, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Would you tell me your aunt’s name so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Genya Szyper.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Genya.</span> <span id="s263">And how was she related to your grandparents?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: She -- she was a daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Oh, your father’s sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Sim -- a sister, yes, as I said to you in the beginning, there were three sisters, two died before the war, and one remained, and that was the one that remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: And she was single?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Single, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s270">Younger than your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s272">She was the youngest in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s274">Do you know how old she would have been, ro-roughly?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: I honestly don’t know, but she must have been pretty young, be -- I know my father was born in 1900, and that means he would have been 40 in -- when I was in the ghetto with my aunt and my grandparents at the time.</span> <span id="s276">So she could have been -- she must have died when she was about, I don’t know, 38 or something like, I do -- 35, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: And -- and you think it was also malnutrition like your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Malnutrition also, and I remember she had a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s279">I remember then, as a young kid like that, I remember she had a boyfriend and then they split up, something, and she was also -- I don’t think she wanted to live, you know.</span> <span id="s280">The circumstances we lived in, you know, and she had nothing to live for, you know, and -- and -- and unfortunately she also died, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: That winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Winter, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: The first winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Oh yes, the first winter, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Your grandmother must have been a strong person.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: She was, you know, I mean you’ve got to remember women in -- in Poland and Russia and eastern Europe, you know, before the war, they were hard working.</span> <span id="s287">When I think back, you know, to bring up six children, you know, without -- without help.</span> <span id="s288">We had no maids or help.</span> <span id="s289">You know, to bring up six children, to -- to cook and wash and as you, I’m sure you know, in Poland, you know, a lot of food, you know, you made yourself.</span> <span id="s290">You didn’t go to shop to buy you know, you know.</span> <span id="s291">Like vermicelli, you know, [indecipherable] you know, you -- you made yourself.</span> <span id="s292">I remember that.</span> <span id="s293">And -- and even the challahs, you know, you baked yourself, and you know, I just -- and I -- all I know is I think my -- my grandmother already had the first child when she was 16 years old because in them days in Poland, when you were 20 and you weren’t married, you were already on the shelf, you know, it was a stigma.</span> <span id="s294">How come you don’t just -- not married, or something like that.</span> <span id="s295">So no, she -- she must have be -- you wouldn’t, if you looked at her, and I look at her picture now and I think she couldn’t have been that strong, but she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: We need to take a little break and change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And we’ll come back in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: That’s quite all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: W-We were talking about your grandmother before we took a break and I -- I just want to ask you one other question about her.</span> <span id="s304">W-Was she -- did she -- was she optimistic in any way?</span> <span id="s305">Was she giving you hope throughout this period, and was she the strong one in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: It was -- absolutely, she was -- she -- she never thought oh, we’ll get killed, or we will not survive.</span> <span id="s307">It was always, I don’t know, I’m sure she didn’t believe what she was telling me, but she always, oh, it won’t last long, it’ll get better, and so on.</span> <span id="s308">And I think this is also a Jewish trait, you know, of it’ll get better, don’t worry, you know, an-and the usual thing you know, with Jewish people, you know, next week, next -- you know, and -- and God will see to it and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s309">No, she was -- she wa -- I don’t know, like I said, whether she was optimistic or she was just talking to me as a child, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s311">When you were in the ghetto, you got a job in a metal factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Yeah, tell me about that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: It was -- we were producing all different things for the German war effort, you know, an-and there were different groups.</span> <span id="s315">I was assigned to a group that we were producing little metal things that were going onto shoes, you know, so that the soles, and you know, and -- and the heels, to last, there were some little s -- round things to put on the soles so that they should last, the shoes should last longer, you shouldn’t wear them out as quick as that.</span> <span id="s316">So it was two of us, one was putting things into a wooden things, six of them, and the other one was making holes into them, you know what --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: With a -- with a press?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: With a press, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s320">You were 10 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I was 10 and a half, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s323">Is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: You know ac -- you know, ya -- this you get sa -- no, it wasn’t a question that I a -- I had to work because if I didn’t work then there was no ration card, there was no food.</span> <span id="s325">Whatever little food we had, I had to obtain on my ration card.</span> <span id="s326">At work we worked like six days a week from what, I don’t know, seven to seven or something, and there was nightshifts as well, which I didn’t work and lunch time we used to get a soup and -- to keep us going and so on, and I had a very good man that I worked for, that he was the boss of the group of about, I don’t know, 20 or so.</span> <span id="s327">And he was very good, he tried to look after me for a certain -- to a certain extent, you know.</span> <span id="s328">When he thought that I -- I can’t do it, you know, because I’m so tired, he says go underneath the bench and sleep for an hour and so on.</span> <span id="s329">Because there was no -- we weren’t surrounded by Germans, you know, it was all done by Jews.</span> <span id="s330">Everything was Jewish, you know, whether it was doctors or hospital, or whatever, you know.</span> <span id="s331">But unfortunately, the food that we were -- were getting, even with the rations, every month, you know, it got worse and worse, or less and less, and people are dying of malnutrition and -- and of course, frost and -- it was that cold.</span> <span id="s332">You know, when the summer came, of course it was a bit better.</span> <span id="s333">But every morning we used to go to work, and -- you know and we were -- had to step over dead bodies, cause they didn’t have a chance yet -- they had a special group of people that were taking the bodies away and then taking it to the -- I suppose there were mass graves, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: You mean -- are bodies in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: In the street, yes, we had to just go walk over them almost, to go to work, and you know, you get so immune, you know, that you just don’t care any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And where -- where was the factory?</span> <span id="s337">Where did you go to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: The factory was about on the other side, as I said to you we ha -- I had to cross the bridge and it wasn’t that far, it was about 20 minutes, half an hour to walk to the factory.</span> <span id="s339">It was a very big factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Did your mother go, or I mean, your grandmother go as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: No.</span> <span id="s344">She --</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Did you go by yourself?</span> <span id="s346">You walked --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: -- I -- yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s348">I -- you were quite safe, you know, as far as walking in the ghetto, you know, you had no problems there, you know.</span> <span id="s349">But unfortunately, you know, it’s -- it’s the -- the main thing there was the food and -- and the conditions we lived in.</span> <span id="s350">And, you know, by the time we -- we went into the ghetto we were about 150,000, eventually finished with 70,000.</span> <span id="s351">But people were dying.</span> <span id="s352">Also people that were coming in and sending -- they said we need 5,000 people to go out to work, you know, in -- in labor camps.</span> <span id="s353">Which wasn’t true, we found out later because the people that were taken, you know, they were like -- but the problem was they took people out so that you thought there was more room.</span> <span id="s354">But then what the Germans did, the S -- the Nazis, the SS or whoever they were, they were liquidating all the small ghettos because they said it’s useless having more guards to guarding small ghettos, we’ll take those people and send them to the bigger camp -- ghettoes like Lódz or Warsaw or whatever there was.</span> <span id="s355">So every time they sent people in, you know, from other ghettoes, so it was -- it was never enough room for people to -- to -- to exist, to live, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Did you n -- did you know that at the time, did you know that people were coming from other ghettos?</span> <span id="s357">Were you talking to people, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: You know, they sat and you know, they told us how bad it is there.</span> <span id="s361">They didn’t realize how much worse it is in our ghetto, because Lódz was -- Lódz and Warsaw was one of the worst ghettos in Poland you know, because [indecipherable] was -- a small ghetto was not, but we were so overcrowded, you know, and -- and like I said, overcrowded.</span> <span id="s362">In the winter it was cold, in the summer -- I don’t know what was worse, because disease in the summer was worse, you know.</span> <span id="s363">Luckily that -- that at least we had enough water to wash.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: And how was your health?</span> <span id="s365">Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well, as far as I know, all the years I was in the ghetto, I wasn’t ill.</span> <span id="s367">I had no problem with illness.</span> <span id="s368">I was problem with lack of food.</span> <span id="s369">I was -- you know, i -- hunger is a funny thing.</span> <span id="s370">It doesn’t matter how much you eat, you’re still hungry, because it’s all in your mind most of the time.</span> <span id="s371">You know, even when I had -- when we used to go out sort of near the outskirts of the ghetto, you know, and there was some stuff we could steal, you know, and -- so we used to go, a few of the kids used to go out and you know, then we were either at the borders, you know, of it -- of -- where the barbed wire, you were hit by the Germans, or the Jewish police culture, you know, we were sort of -- have the -- our jackets or shirts inside the trousers, so that we could put the food away there and they caught us, they just opened it up and the food came out.</span> <span id="s372">We got a good hiding and we run back home and that was it.</span> <span id="s373">But then -- but they didn’t stop us going again, you know.</span> <span id="s374">But if -- there were times, of course, that we managed to get home with some food and we had so much food, and -- but we were still -- it doesn’t matter how much we had, we were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s376">In the Lódz ghetto they were rounding up children too, weren't they?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: Yes, but the worst thing was -- you see, was in -- I think it was 1942, the Germans decided they need 10,000 people, you know, a day or something like that, something -- an enormous amount of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: -- and they’ll do it in a week and they’ll take them away, so most of the people they would have taken away.</span> <span id="s382">But I asked the -- which I don’t think it could have been 10,000, but they said -- the Jewish police have to go and give them every day so many people to bring out.</span> <span id="s383">But of course they came to the -- to the Jewish homes and they got beaten up by the people.</span> <span id="s384">Nobody would have given away people, you know, nobody would go.</span> <span id="s385">And then the Jews -- so the Germans said there is no way they can do it, so they said they are going to do it themselves, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Did they ever come to your place?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s388">Not the Jewish police, I don’t remember them coming, but the Germans said right, we’re going to do it systematically, nobody’s going to work for a whole week.</span> <span id="s389">And from Monday onwards, you know, they went from street to street, house to house and everybody had to come down and they took people away and they said they’re taking them to work.</span> <span id="s390">But you know, as young as I was, you know, I -- I realized, you know, you don’t take people to work that are disabled people, old people, women and children.</span> <span id="s391">And my grandmother was hidden somewhere and I went down and they took me, they slung me on the lorry and it was a similar scene, funny enough, like in “Schindler’s List.”</span> <span id="s392">And I -- I don’t know why it was so bad and I was alone, I s -- I would have thought why did I want to escape?</span> <span id="s393">Maybe because I thought to myself I’ll be alone and I wanted to be back with my grandmother and I jumped off the lorry.</span> <span id="s394">And the Germans were inside the yard, you know, had they stepped out they would have seen me, they would have shot.</span> <span id="s395">I’m sure they would have hit me because I wouldn't have been that far away.</span> <span id="s396">Anyway, I -- I was lucky once again and I run and I hid myself in the house and I stayed there for hours.</span> <span id="s397">And I remember a distant cuz -- well, it -- a distant cousin came and he also escaped, also jumped off the lorry and he escape and I remember -- I remember like today and he says, come on, let’s go home, cause we lived in the same sort of block or yard or something.</span> <span id="s398">And I started screaming at him, I was in such a state, you know.</span> <span id="s399">Eventually, of course, I did.</span> <span id="s400">But the funny thing was, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: What did you scream?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I just screamed at him that why he said to me we should go back home, I was -- I don’t know, I was -- my mind was completely -- I was completely confused, you know, and -- but a funny thing happened that that boy, that cousin of mine was the only one of his family that survived, and not so ma -- and he was very religious.</span> <span id="s403">And -- and he became the chief rabbi of Poland.</span> <span id="s404">About 10 years ago he was a -- or 15 years ago, a chief rabbi of Poland.</span> <span id="s405">He lived in Jerusalem, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: Joskovich.</span> <span id="s408">And anyway, I went back and after awhile things went back to as it was, you know, my grandmother came back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Where had she gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: She went to hiding somewhere, I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: You don’t know where?</span> <span id="s412">Not in a building?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, it must have been from my uncle, you know, I don’t honestly know.</span> <span id="s414">May -- could have been in a basement somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: But when you -- when they took -- came to take people away, she was -- she was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: She wasn’t there, she was gone, you know, she sha --</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And you had come home and found that she was gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: And -- no, she wasn’t there, but I knew she was in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: And why didn’t you go to hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I -- there was no way I could go, for some -- I don’t know what the reason it was, but I wasn’t -- I didn’t go into hiding and --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: And the Germans came and physically dragged you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Oh yeah -- no, we had to go downstairs, they didn’t come.</span> <span id="s423">Everybody had to leave and they searched the rooms, you know, and downstairs they said they just picked up people and -- and -- and I saw women, children, disabled people, it’s not -- something is not right, and this was the reason it made me jump -- jumped off the lorry, and you know, and -- and we found out later, you know, we never had all those people again, so we knew that they were -- where they were taken I don’t know, but they were certainly -- at that time there was no Auschwitz yet -- you know, I mean there was Auschwitz because Auschwitz was built much earlier, but it wasn’t built for Jews, it was built for Polish prisoners of war, you know, and certainly Birkenau wasn’t in existence.</span> <span id="s424">And you know, in -- within two days we went back to work and we carried on and -- and things got worse and worse and worse, til it carried on like that til 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Two -- three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Mm -- well, I was -- from 1940 til 1944, you know, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: -- April 1940 the ghetto was shut, you know, and it’s liquidated in autumn of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: Were there other deportations that you escaped?</span> <span id="s430">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Not from Lódz, no.</span> <span id="s432">I never escaped another deportation, Lódz or otherwise, you know, it -- but when they liquidated the ghetto it was automatically -- but where I was -- you see, I -- I don’t know, in my life I always seem to have been lucky.</span> <span id="s433">And were -- the factory that I worked for, the metal factory, when we -- the Lódz ghetto was liquidated because they said the Russians are getting nearer, and we’ve got to -- they’re going to send us to working camps inside Germany, and so street by street, day by day, they were taking away peop -- people had to report to the railway station and they were allowed to take one suitcase.</span> <span id="s434">They said when we get there we get more clothes and all the rest of it.</span> <span id="s435">But me, they didn’t take -- they didn’t tell us to come from the house where I lived then, but from the factory, because I said they were going to take us to Germany and we’re going to work in a metal factory there.</span> <span id="s436">Which the funny thing was that it was true.</span> <span id="s437">We didn’t reach Germany to work in a factory, but that was the intention.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: This factory -- the fellow you mentioned who ran the factory, say his name, because he was very important to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, th-the man that -- that saved my life --</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: -- twice --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: -- you know, he saved my life, his name was Zilbershatz.</span> <span id="s444">And also a funny thing that a nephew of his is a friend of mine today, he lives in London, you know.</span> <span id="s445">And the man also survived the war, the one, Willie Zilbershatz, he lived in Israel.</span> <span id="s446">Unfortunately I never managed to see him because by the time I went the first time to Israel, he was -- he died.</span> <span id="s447">But I am very much in touch with his nephew and -- you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you know very much about him before he had this factory in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s449">Did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Well, he didn’t have a factory, he was just in charge of that group.</span> <span id="s451">It was a very big factory.</span> <span id="s452">It was -- somebody else was in charge of the whole factory, his name was Hemovich.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: I see, it wasn’t his factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: No, no, no, it wasn't his factory, it was -- it was nobody’s factory, it belonged to the ghetto, you know, it belonged to the Germans really.</span> <span id="s455">I don’t know what it was before the war, whether it was a factory before the war and who owned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So he was the manager.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: He was the manager and you know, they had groups, managers of each, you know, like 20 people worked in one group and -- and that man Zilbershatz was in charge of that group that I worked for.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Was he a young man?</span> <span id="s459">He --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, oh yes, he must have been about 30 at the most, you know.</span> <span id="s461">You know, to me he wasn’t a young man, you know, and I -- I was 10 years old, 11 years old, 12 years old, a -- he wasn’t a young man, you know, but he was a very young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: And there were times when he saw that you were tired and he let you rest --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Rest, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: -- were there other children?</span> <span id="s465">Were there other children working there?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: There were a few other children.</span> <span id="s467">I d -- I don’t remember whether the others, you know, I -- I ha -- I don’t know what it is, but I -- I think I’ve always had a -- in Yiddish they would say chutzpah, you know.</span> <span id="s468">And I still have.</span> <span id="s469">I’m 78 years old and I still have a chutzpah today, you know.</span> <span id="s470">And I think I get away with many things which others might not have got away with them.</span> <span id="s471">So he was very good to me as that was, you know, and there were some good people there.</span> <span id="s472">Not many, but there were some.</span> <span id="s473">It’s -- it wasn’t a question that a -- I mean, people become very selfish, you know, everybody wants to live, so why, if he’s got something more than you, why should he share with you, you know?</span> <span id="s474">You gotta be a real great person to do that, and you know, not many people are around like that, to share their last piece of bread or something, you know.</span> <span id="s475">But there were some, and I came across them.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: So tell about when the n -- when in ’44 they liquidated the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes, they told us that we’re going to Germany, and that we’re going to build the factory.</span> <span id="s478">And again we had to get just one suitcase, and I went with my grandmother to the station.</span> <span id="s479">She also came -- as I was in the metal factory, she came with my group, as a group.</span> <span id="s480">And we went to the station, reported to the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: She didn’t work in the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No, she didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: So that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: But nevertheless, she came with us, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: They allowed -- so this was the manager --</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yes, well, they allowed --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: -- her to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: -- yes -- well, yes.</span> <span id="s489">And as we arrived, you know, th-there were cattle trucks waiting for us, you know, which I couldn’t understand, you know, and they just said, take a suitcase, get onto the cattle trucks.</span> <span id="s490">We were helped by the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s491">And this is when it started.</span> <span id="s492">We thought, you know, that things are bad in -- in -- in the ghetto, but that’s when our trouble started, between 1944 and 1945, those were the worst -- the worst year, well it was less than a year that happened to me that stand out in my -- mostly in my -- first of all I was already older.</span> <span id="s493">I was already, you know, I was 14 years old, 14 and a half.</span> <span id="s494">I was already -- to my way of thinking, I was already a grown up person already.</span> <span id="s495">And when they put us in the -- those trucks, do you know, it was just impossible to survive.</span> <span id="s496">It was so packed, you couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s497">And do you know, today, I said that many times, you know, I feel ashamed, not only for other people, for myself, what can happen to a person, that when we stopped -- th-th-the train stopped somewhere after a day or so, and -- and there were a few people were dead, you know.</span> <span id="s498">First of all there -- there was no water to drink.</span> <span id="s499">You remember like I said to you, we’re -- it was July, August, in the summer in Poland, the heat.</span> <span id="s500">You know, you talk about your sort of 90 degrees or something like that, packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s501">And people, you know, elderly people, people that ha-had problems were dying and -- and I’m so ashamed today, you know, when I think of it, how could I have ever done that, say thank God they died, there’ll be more room for us, you know?</span> <span id="s502">And of course at that time it -- that’s how I felt, but -- and most people, and -- but today when I think back, like I wasn’t human any more, you know?</span> <span id="s503">How can a human being think like that?</span> <span id="s504">To be that selfish, you know?</span> <span id="s505">But unfortunately that’s how it is, you know.</span> <span id="s506">I -- I saw children stealing a piece of bread from their father.</span> <span id="s507">I saw a father s-stealing a piece of bread from -- from a child.</span> <span id="s508">And do you know I’m a father today and a grandfather and I think I would rather die than do that.</span> <span id="s509">But if I would have a father then, would he steal from me, or would I steal from him?</span> <span id="s510">Maybe.</span> <span id="s511">I don’t know, you know.</span> <span id="s512">You’ve got to be in that position to realize.</span> <span id="s513">It’s easy to say how could he do it, but today, you know what, I’ve got a family and I’ve got -- I’m not short of -- of anything, you know.</span> <span id="s514">When I say anything, food, or drink, or -- I can say that.</span> <span id="s515">Would -- how would it have been in those circumstances, you know, if I was starving and knowing that my child has got a piece of bread, could I have stolen it?</span> <span id="s516">May -- I definitely say today no, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s517">You have to be in those circumstances to realize whether you can do it or not.</span> <span id="s518">And we traveled for a few days and it was less and less people in -- in -- in -- in the coaches, you know.</span> <span id="s519">And eventually one morning at about, must have been five, six o’clock in the morning, the train stopped, and you know, we could see through the slats, you know, of the truck, something written up, Oswiecim, and then it said Auschwitz and I -- didn’t mean anything to me, an-and the grown up people say oh, it’s a concentration camp, and I didn’t know what a concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s520">And they opened it, the gates and straight away in German they started shouting, raus, raus, raus.</span> <span id="s521">And there were people sort of wearing striped things and striped caps and we did -- still didn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s522">And it was -- like I said, it was in the summer and it was hazy, the sun was hazy because it was very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s523">And there was like a haze, yellow haze, and then we saw chimneys and we saw that’s bakeries, or [indecipherable] whatever it is there, and -- and then, as I said, we had to jump down, you know, and it was pretty high, and some of those people that were there, they were Jewish inmates of Auschwitz that helped people to jump down.</span> <span id="s524">We weren't allowed to take our suitcase, they said, you leave everything behind.</span> <span id="s525">When you get to where we going, we get our luggage back, you know, and of course, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s526">And then we had to go through a selection committee.</span> <span id="s527">And here we go again, I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s528">Being in the factory, we were a main transport that went through the selection committee.</span> <span id="s529">Women, children, disabled people, everybody went through.</span> <span id="s530">We were 500 and odd people.</span> <span id="s531">But the train had many more people on it, and all the others had to go -- the selection, there were German officers with dogs and batons, you know, and everywhere -- and they were rushing them, and you know it was right and left, right and left.</span> <span id="s532">And then we realized what was happening, that the people going to the right were disabled people, women with babies, with children.</span> <span id="s533">And some of them -- and there were screams, you know, because they -- they -- they took the child away and the woman they said to go to the left.</span> <span id="s534">And of course, can you imagine a mother giving up a child.</span> <span id="s535">So the mother run towards it, she was beaten, but she was left with the child.</span> <span id="s536">And they said they’re going to take them to showers, but we found out soon afterwards, you know, beca -- from the guards, from the Jewish people that were [indecipherable] that an hour after a -- that train arrived in Auschwitz, in Birkenau, you know, those people were dead.</span> <span id="s537">They were gassed and put in -- and how can a human being do that?</span> <span id="s538">Taking a child, a p -- a person, a woman, a disabled person, whoever and put in a gas oven, and then burned?</span> <span id="s539">It just -- but unfortunately I learned.</span> <span id="s540">I’m now an old man so I’ve learned that it’s -- appear it’s happening today.</span> <span id="s541">I mean, maybe not to the -- that extent and maybe not to the Jewish people, but it’s happening.</span> <span id="s542">And us they took to -- the people that went to the left, we all went to showers.</span> <span id="s543">They were actually showers, they were not gas -- they were not gas cha -- crematoriums, gas chambers.</span> <span id="s544">And we had to take all our clothes off and we never saw it again.</span> <span id="s545">They shaved everybody, whoever had hair, wherever you had hair had to be shaved, women and men.</span> <span id="s546">And we came out and they gave us striped clothing.</span> <span id="s547">And of course the women went separate to a different one, we went separate.</span> <span id="s548">And had a -- one of those caps.</span> <span id="s549">They didn’t tattoo us at the time, it was -- I don’t know whether that was because we were with a group, or whether they didn’t tattoo any more people, but they -- but we had a number, so at that time that was -- I wasn’t Ziggy Shipper, I was 83303.</span> <span id="s550">Not that anybody called me by the number or so, but that’s what I had writ -- a stripe, think here.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: On your jacket?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: On my jacket, yes, an-and trousers.</span> <span id="s553">And I remember like today, and I don’t know why, you know, they just gave me a uniform, one of those striped thing.</span> <span id="s554">I mean, they didn’t say oh, you are small, we give you a small one, big one, and I got a very big one, and I don’t -- and you know that my trousers went almost to -- under my arms.</span> <span id="s555">And somebody came, oh I got the smaller one, can you give me the bigger one?</span> <span id="s556">I don’t know why, you know, I remember like today I said no.</span> <span id="s557">Maybe I thought because it’s bigger it’ll be warmer in the winter or something.</span> <span id="s558">I didn't know how long I’m going to wear those.</span> <span id="s559">Anyway, after the showers, disinfection, haircut, you know, shaving, we -- they went into barracks.</span> <span id="s560">Now that I -- we expected many things, but we didn’t expect that.</span> <span id="s561">I don’t know whether you know what it looked like.</span> <span id="s562">I went back after the war to see that and you know, it was bunks, three bunks, one out -- above the other.</span> <span id="s563">You know, three bunks, I don’t remember if I was in the bottom or middle.</span> <span id="s564">I think I was in the middle bunk.</span> <span id="s565">Three persons to a bunk, you know.</span> <span id="s566">Two one way, one that.</span> <span id="s567">And straw and every morning we used to get the -- it was hot, you were -- could suffocate.</span> <span id="s568">Every morning we had black coffee and a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s569">Every evening we had -- we didn’t work.</span> <span id="s570">We just had to stand outside all day long, you know, and then go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Let’s take a little break and I’ll change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: You were talking about your arrival at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: The summer of 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I’d like to know if we could back up just a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Do you have any sense of from the time those doors opened on the cattle car --</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: -- to the time you were in your barracks, how much time passed by?</span> <span id="s583">Was it a matter of --</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Matter of hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: It wasn’t a matter of days or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: It was very, very qui -- one thing what they did was everything was quick.</span> <span id="s589">Quick, quick, quick.</span> <span id="s590">From the minute the ghetto [indecipherable] opened, you know, all you heard was raus, raus, raus, quick, quick, quick.</span> <span id="s591">And even the selection, when you went through selection, if you weren’t fast they were beating you, you see?</span> <span id="s592">That’s why they had those batons, you know, those big things and they were knocking you, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Hitting you, and you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: It must have been so frightening, so chaotic and so like a nightmare when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Well, it’s -- it was a nightmare because you -- you just didn’t -- you couldn’t understand what was happening to you and to the people.</span> <span id="s597">What’s going on, you know?</span> <span id="s598">It wasn’t like -- it wasn’t like being in the ghetto, you know, that every week it got a bit worse and more people are dying and -- and people are dying of starvation and whatever else, of illness, and you know.</span> <span id="s599">But here it was something happened so fast, you know, an-and -- and the people kept asking, where are they?</span> <span id="s600">Where’s my wife, where’s my mother, where’s my child, where’s -- you know, the ma -- men would be saying, you know, and then -- and there was no answer, because there wasn’t other camps that you could see them.</span> <span id="s601">You know, where have they gone?</span> <span id="s602">But they soon found out, you see, because the -- the inmates, you know, th-the ones that were doing all the cleaning up and the disposing of the bodies, you know, and so on after they were gassed they had to put them in the ovens, you know, and -- to cremate them in.</span> <span id="s603">They asked them, and they were soon told, you know, what it is.</span> <span id="s604">But you know, even then, as a 14 year old boy, you doi -- i-it didn’t sort of -- possibly, personally, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s605">I came with my grandmother and I knew my grandmother is still there.</span> <span id="s606">I had no siblings, you know, so I didn't have to worry about where -- where’s my little sister, or my brother, or -- or -- nothing s -- sort of happened to me that I should feel in a terrible state, you know?</span> <span id="s607">And at 14 and a half, do you care what happens to other people, you know?</span> <span id="s608">And especially in the position where we are all in, like I said to you before, you become so selfish and so hard, that all you care is about yourself, don’t care about anybody else.</span> <span id="s609">Because you are not human any more.</span> <span id="s610">They dis-humanized you.</span> <span id="s611">You know, yo-you -- you become a terrible person.</span> <span id="s612">I found that out years later [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s613">But you see it today even, you know, in -- you know, people in -- in -- in the African nations or in the Middle East, you know, you know, people starving, you know and -- and you become -- you steal.</span> <span id="s614">You steal from each other, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: So you were in the barracks with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I was in barracks with -- th-there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: -- a men’s barracks, in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Yes, a men’s barrack, there must have been at least eight - 900 people in the barracks.</span> <span id="s619">There certainly -- there was room for them because we -- everybody s -- had where to sleep.</span> <span id="s620">The only thing the stench, the smell, th-the -- the heat, you know, i -- and people were dying there, they didn’t have to kill them, they didn’t have to take them to g -- the gas chambers to kill them, they were dying there.</span> <span id="s621">Wat -- anybody that was there was finished, you know.</span> <span id="s622">Either he -- first of all he couldn’t survive and secondly they took him away and took him to -- straight away to a gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: You would sleep three to a bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Three to a bunk, and there were three bunks right, and there was another one next to it again, so it was like 18 people in a square sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Could you sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: I would imagine so, you know, as a child, yes, you know, and a -- the problem was always, you know, if you gi -- when you got your piece of bread and you thought you’ll put it under the -- inside you -- in your jacket because you slept in your clothes, there was no undressing.</span> <span id="s627">And you couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s628">That’s the only time I couldn’t sleep, personally, you know, it -- when I knew I had a piece of bread there.</span> <span id="s629">I had to eat it up, you know and then I managed I’m sure after, to sleep.</span> <span id="s630">You know, and we got up very early to c’est l’appel, which was the counting of the people.</span> <span id="s631">Why they had to count people, what were they worried, they were going to kill them anyway, why were they worried whether was one missing or not, you know?</span> <span id="s632">But that’s the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: During those times when you were in the barracks, did people -- what did people talk about?</span> <span id="s634">What did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: I di -- di --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: -- what was it like?</span> <span id="s637">Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No.</span> <span id="s639">No.</span> <span id="s640">Well, the only thing we were talking about, when will it finish.</span> <span id="s641">When will we get out of here, will we survive, will they take -- because we already knew about the gas chambers then.</span> <span id="s642">Will they take us away to the gas chambers?</span> <span id="s643">But -- ami -- but me as a child of 14 or 14 and a half, it never entered my mind that I’ll be killed.</span> <span id="s644">I could never understand -- you know, I saw my friends dying, I saw other people dying.</span> <span id="s645">But I could never -- I couldn’t accept it, that I’ll die.</span> <span id="s646">That eventually it will be the end, you know?</span> <span id="s647">And you know, there were always rumors, you know, the Russians are near, the British are near, the Americans are coming in.</span> <span id="s648">Eventually we will be rescued.</span> <span id="s649">You know what, maybe that helped me to survive, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s650">But I survived that and after a few weeks, not very long, we weren't a long time in Auschwitz, they found us.</span> <span id="s651">The Germans actually found us and they took us -- they said, right, now we’re going towards Germany, which we didn’t, we went -- well, it -- in a way we did, I suppose, because they took us to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Oh s -- is this group of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: The group of 500, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: -- that worked in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes, they to --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And including your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: My grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: I’m sorry, your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s660">And we went to a concentration camp called -- it wasn’t a extermination camp, it was a concentration camp called Stutthof, which was very near Danzig.</span> <span id="s661">Now there was a bigger problem because as hot as it was in Auschwitz, we were going on to the Baltic.</span> <span id="s662">And after a few weeks in that camp -- the camp was west, the living accommodation -- and the food was even worse than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s663">We again didn’t work, but it was getting late, you know, after a few weeks, you know, it was getting September, October, November, most people that were with us, even from that group, were dying.</span> <span id="s664">You know, the elderly people were dying, you know, from sp -- pure starvation and disease.</span> <span id="s665">And what we were saying when I -- I was asked, was I small, or was I tall, or was I, for a child of 14 and a half or so, I was [indecipherable] at 15.</span> <span id="s666">No, I was small.</span> <span id="s667">And what we did, when it was cold in the camp they made human ovens.</span> <span id="s668">What it meant to people was sort of getting together and make group and get bigger, bigger, bigger, sort of a round thing.</span> <span id="s669">And what we were supposed to do, the people from inside were coming out and going outside.</span> <span id="s670">And so me, I came out, but I soon managed, as being very little, I managed to get in -- back inside t-to --</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Back inside.</span> <span id="s672">So just the [indecipherable] bodies --</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: They were huddled in a circle --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: -- and people were s --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: That’s right, a human oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: How long would they do this for?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Oh, we could stand for hours like that, you know.</span> <span id="s680">You know, we couldn’t fall because we were all s-squashed together.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: And si -- and you weren’t working, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: -- this would go on --</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: -- outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: The only work that we’re do -- the only work we had to do was carrying big stones from one of the camp to the other side.</span> <span id="s687">When it was there we -- they had to carry it back to the other.</span> <span id="s688">There was no work there.</span> <span id="s689">There was just -- they wanted to kill you, but there was no such a thing as -- as they took you to the -- only if you were ill.</span> <span id="s690">Of course there, there was no hospitals or anything.</span> <span id="s691">They straight away took you to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s692">They only had one gas chamber, one crematorium.</span> <span id="s693">And that -- the only problem was in the winter, if somebody did escape and there was w -- a person missing, we had to stand there all day long in the cold, in below freezing temperatures to stand there, you know.</span> <span id="s694">And then what happened -- of course, food was even scarcer than it was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s695">Then they said they wanted 20 young people to go to work in a cat -- in a working camp.</span> <span id="s696">And I said -- they said, who is 17, and I couldn’t volunteer 17, I was 14 and a half and my size was about 12 years old.</span> <span id="s697">And they said there wasn’t enough, so they said, who is 16?</span> <span id="s698">And I stood on my toes and I lifted my hand.</span> <span id="s699">And everybody said, all the others were saying don’t volunteer, don’t volunteer, they’re going to kill you.</span> <span id="s700">I said, listen, if I stay here I’ll be dead within a very short time.</span> <span id="s701">No food and cold and frost.</span> <span id="s702">I’m going.</span> <span id="s703">And so they took 20 boys, all Polish boys, Jewish boys, you know, and they took, by passenger train -- oh, they gave us -- by the way, they gave us new winter clothes, which was the same stripes, but warmer.</span> <span id="s704">So I said, well it’s getting better already.</span> <span id="s705">A -- and they -- you know, listen, everything is -- is a matter of -- it’s relative to it, you know, it -- and they took us on passenger trains, oddly enough, to a place called Stolp in Pomerania.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Before you tell me about that, did you have a conversation with your grandmother about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Ah y-y -- only through the wires I could shout, because I could see her.</span> <span id="s708">You know, and I said, I’m going away and I’ll see you after the war.</span> <span id="s709">You know, everything was I’ll see you after the war, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: What did she say?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Nothing, she -- I don’t remember exactly the words she said.</span> <span id="s712">I suppose she must have said something in Yiddish to bless me, or something.</span> <span id="s713">And maybe that helped, you know, and I -- they took us, like I said, on those passenger trains.</span> <span id="s714">We arrived at that Stolp.</span> <span id="s715">And the only thing that was better, it was in the winter, still Pomerania, which is very cold.</span> <span id="s716">But it was warmer for us because we worked on a railway yard, you see, to do with the trains and so on, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s717">And the food was even slightly better.</span> <span id="s718">We -- at least we got something, a piece of bread in the morning and in the evening and lunchtime we had the soup.</span> <span id="s719">And we had -- we worked for German people, and not the army, just German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: We were guarded by the -- but we worked for -- it was a factory there, that we worked at.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: I’m sorry, tell me where Pomerania is, my geography is not that good.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: It is that -- today it’s Poland, at that time it was Germany, it was east.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: So it’s eastern --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: East, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: -- western Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s728">It was -- it’s about -- I would say about 50 kilometers from Danzig, you know, so it was also near the Baltic, but it wasn’t on the Baltic.</span> <span id="s729">And also the advantage was, there were only Jewish people in that camp.</span> <span id="s730">This was a labor camp, there was no extermination, like I said.</span> <span id="s731">And working on the railways, there’s always a chance to steal some food.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Cause these were passenger trains?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: There were passenger trains, there were goods trains.</span> <span id="s734">Thank God there were goods trains so we could [indecipherable] goods train, we managed to eat whatever their goods they were carrying, we managed to get them, we managed to steal some carrots or potatoes or beets.</span> <span id="s735">The only thing was, whatever we stole we had to eat raw there.</span> <span id="s736">We couldn’t cook it, there was nowhere to cook.</span> <span id="s737">But it didn’t -- it tasted very good, you know.</span> <span id="s738">Doesn’t matter, when you’re hungry everything tastes good.</span> <span id="s739">You know, the unfortunate part was there, that one day five boys, older than I was, they stole some cigarettes or tobacco that was going to the German army, to the front, where they were fighting.</span> <span id="s740">And they were caught.</span> <span id="s741">So they put them -- there was a little room like a disinfection room, with no windows, nothing.</span> <span id="s742">They put them there and they kept them there for a week, then they said -- then they announced they’re going to let them out.</span> <span id="s743">But the problem was they -- we had to come and see those boys.</span> <span id="s744">I don’t know how those boys survived without water, without food, without anything in that thing.</span> <span id="s745">But when we came to the square where they were going to let out, we saw gallows, five gallows and little stools standing there.</span> <span id="s746">And they took those boys out, they put those ropes round their neck -- five boys, and I mean, I’ve seen people die next to me, you know, and -- but I’ve never seen somebody young, you know, putting a rope around their necks and going to hang.</span> <span id="s747">And they were start to read out why they’re being, you know, German, another thing, they had to -- why did they have to say why?</span> <span id="s748">They were going to hang them.</span> <span id="s749">But those five boys didn’t give them a chance, even.</span> <span id="s750">They jumped off the stools and they killed themselves, th-they didn’t wait for the Germans to kill them.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: All five of them.</span> <span id="s753">And that was, like I said, the first time I saw people being hanged, actually, you know, people not dying, but being people killed.</span> <span id="s754">I mean, when they took away the people to the gas chambers, we didn’t see it, we only saw the people taking away.</span> <span id="s755">But here I -- it’s -- it’s -- it -- do you know, I can see it today like it’s happening now, in front of me, of -- of -- of course, what happened then.</span> <span id="s756">Then we started working again and going back to the factory and work again.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Before we go on, I want to ask you another question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: These five boys who were hanged were not much older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Well, no, I -- today that certainly wasn’t, but they were like 18 or 19 --</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: -- which were much older at the time, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: But did it -- at that point, when you saw that happen, did you think then that you could die as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: It never -- it still --</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: It never -- right through the five years, it never occurred to me.</span> <span id="s767">I don’t know why, it just -- maybe that’s how I am, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: -- I never thought -- never thought -- I thought, one day I’ll be free, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Did you feel fear?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s772">Oh yes, every time, you know, you saw -- even in that camp that we were in, which we -- we -- it was considerable better than it was in Auschwitz or Stutthof, when we saw a German officer come in now, is he going to take us away, you know?</span> <span id="s773">Fear yes, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Fear -- and what was your worst fear?</span> <span id="s775">If you weren't afraid of dying, if that wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I don’t know, I don’t know, just seeing that German was fear enough, you see.</span> <span id="s777">But no, and -- and then of course, what was happening that the Russians are getting nearer again, so they took us to another camp.</span> <span id="s778">Don’t ask me where it was, but it wasn’t very far from where I was in Pomerania.</span> <span id="s779">A place called Buschgraben, which was a German name, most probably it wa -- it was still in Poland, so it was -- I don’t know what it was called in -- in -- in Polish.</span> <span id="s780">And there we stayed, there we did nothing.</span> <span id="s781">We had no food, no drink.</span> <span id="s782">And the Russians were so near us, the Russian soldiers, that at night we could hear the music.</span> <span id="s783">During the day we saw the planes flying over, you know, very low and the Russian would say we could -- you could see the pilots in the plane.</span> <span id="s784">And one sort of afternoon we looked around and we couldn’t find any Germans.</span> <span id="s785">We were free.</span> <span id="s786">And so we said th-the -- the boys sort of my age, you know, said right, let’s go over to the Russians, you know.</span> <span id="s787">At least we get some food and drink.</span> <span id="s788">But the grownups said you can’t do that because they might -- they won’t know who you are, they might kill you, they might shoot at you.</span> <span id="s789">So we said all right, we went to s -- we went to sleep that night, you know, woke up in the morning we were surrounded by the SS troops, by the Nazis again.</span> <span id="s790">And they were coaches waiting for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Coaches?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, ordinary car -- vehicles, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Cars.</span> <span id="s794">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Car -- well, you know, big.</span> <span id="s796">Like buses, you know?</span> <span id="s797">Luxury buses.</span> <span id="s798">And today I cannot understand it.</span> <span id="s799">They didn’t have enough petrol for their soldiers, but they had petrol to transport Jews.</span> <span id="s800">And they said now they’re going to st -- again, every time they’re going to send us to Germany.</span> <span id="s801">And they said we go back to Danzig.</span> <span id="s802">And we went back to Stutthof to wait, which was even -- there was no gas, there wa -- and there was no electricity, there was no water, people are dying.</span> <span id="s803">But we stayed there only a few days and then they said now they’re going to take us to a boat and they’re going to put us on boats and we’re going to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So the Germans were going to send you to Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: To den -- yes, well, Denmark was occupied by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: -- Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: But what happened -- do you know what happened to the Russians?</span> <span id="s809">You thought the Russians were so close.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yes, but they took us away, you know, so most probably next day the Russians were there, they -- they occupied that place.</span> <span id="s811">But us they took away.</span> <span id="s812">The whole camp that was there in Buschgraben, and they say -- as I said, they were going to take us to Denmark.</span> <span id="s813">There wi -- everything will be better.</span> <span id="s814">And it was already getting late, it was already March, April or so in -- in -- so we went to that port and they put us on -- into barges, like you carry coal, or wheat or corn.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Open on the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Open, and there was no watcher [indecipherable] you know, there was -- I mean, it could be closed, they could close the hatches, you know, but there was nothing on top.</span> <span id="s817">There was, well, just for you -- just for transporting goods.</span> <span id="s818">It wasn’t a ship, you know, it was -- and they put us in those barges.</span> <span id="s819">And they said we arrive in Denmark, everything [indecipherable] I’m sure Denmark was already liberated by then.</span> <span id="s820">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s821">And we were only for about 10 days, eight to 10 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Did they feed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: There was no f -- no food, no drink, nothing.</span> <span id="s824">It wasn’t a question like when we left the ghetto, we could take a little bit of food with us.</span> <span id="s825">Here we had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: And you were how many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: I don’t know exactly, but it was more than just one camp, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: It was more than just that 20 that were --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: It must have been about a thousand people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: You know what -- you know -- but there wasn’t one barge, there was many barges.</span> <span id="s832">You know, we also had luck [indecipherable] we had some Norwegian and Danish prisoners of war on those barges and they were treated much better than us, because they were prisoners of war, so they used to get better food.</span> <span id="s833">They were much more able-bodied people.</span> <span id="s834">And that was very lucky for us, but anyway, at that time I already had typhus.</span> <span id="s835">I didn’t know then I had typhus, but I found out later.</span> <span id="s836">Now, you can imagine having an illness like typhus, never mind medication, that was, of course, out.</span> <span id="s837">There was no medication.</span> <span id="s838">But there was no water.</span> <span id="s839">And I think what saved me again -- it’s funny -- that I was so ill that I didn’t drink the salt water, cause I didn’t have a chance to get it.</span> <span id="s840">A lot of people drank the salt water, within one day they were dead, because they swelled up and they just died.</span> <span id="s841">Cause you -- you can imagine how much salt there is in that water.</span> <span id="s842">Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: With typhus do you have a high fever?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: I should imagine so.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: A-As far as I know, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Did you -- were you conscious during this --</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: -- boat trip.</span> <span id="s850">You were awake?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: I was almost conscious, semi-conscious, I suppose.</span> <span id="s852">And after -- I said we were traveling for about 10 days and one -- one evening we were very near land and the German -- the troops, the SS, the whoever was guarding us got off those barges, then we were just alone.</span> <span id="s853">But we couldn’t have -- we weren’t on land, they went across on little boats.</span> <span id="s854">So the Norwegians, when I said why we were lucky that they [indecipherable] the Danish, they said, you know what, if you want to, whoever wants to, we will take over onto dry land.</span> <span id="s855">Because there were still little boats left.</span> <span id="s856">So slowly, right through the night, they took every person off, onto land.</span> <span id="s857">Some people escaped.</span> <span id="s858">Well, I wasn’t in a state to escape, I do -- I couldn’t walk, never mind run.</span> <span id="s859">The Germans came back in the morning and they saw what happened, they didn’t put us back on the boat.</span> <span id="s860">We are 15 kilometers away from a town, which is a naval town called Neustadt.</span> <span id="s861">We go there, our boat that we are -- got to go on it will be waiting for us to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: The German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: -- yeah, to go.</span> <span id="s864">So we had to go on a march.</span> <span id="s865">And ev --</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: We -- how many people -- the Norwegians brought people over during the night --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: -- and some of them just ran and escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Some of them ran away, I don’t know how many ran away.</span> <span id="s870">Not that it was important to us --</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: But then the Germans came back to get you --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yeah, well they didn’t count us --</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: -- and you were already on land.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s877">Whoever was there they took away.</span> <span id="s878">And that was one thing.</span> <span id="s879">You had to walk.</span> <span id="s880">If you fell you were shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s881">There was no transport and they weren't going to leave you there.</span> <span id="s882">And they were not going to carry you.</span> <span id="s883">So luckily I ha -- I was with friends that I was together during all the times even from Poland, from the ghetto, through the camps together and two of them managed to carry me -- sort of half carry, half walk and somehow, don’t ask me how, I don’t know, once again I survived and we arrived eventually.</span> <span id="s884">If we started a thousand people, we might have finished up about three, 400, the rest fell and were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: How long did this take?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: I don’t know exactly, but it took hours and hours.</span> <span id="s887">And it was only another 50 kilometers, like 10 miles.</span> <span id="s888">Shouldn’t have take -- well, to a able bodied person it wouldn’t have taken that long.</span> <span id="s889">Anyway they -- we arrived at the place and it was a port and it was a boat waiting for us.</span> <span id="s890">That’s th -- the only time they told us the truth.</span> <span id="s891">It was a proper ship, a liner, you know?</span> <span id="s892">Atlantic ocean liner, it wasn’t some little ship.</span> <span id="s893">And there was already a transport of people from other camps on that ship.</span> <span id="s894">We didn’t know then, but the re -- we found out, because there were planes going around and we knew it couldn’t be German planes.</span> <span id="s895">We didn’t know whether they were Russians, Americans or British.</span> <span id="s896">It turned out they were British planes, and all of a sudden they started bombing.</span> <span id="s897">And they hit that boat, but they didn’t hit it that it was completely damaged, you know, and they started -- people started shouting, screaming that we’re on the boat.</span> <span id="s898">That’s how we found out that there were other people on the --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: So you saw the boat you were on?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Oh yes, we were just in front, like in front waiting to go on it.</span> <span id="s901">But they couldn’t do it because of the -- the bombing.</span> <span id="s902">And the people started screaming and jumping into the water and of course some of them drowned, you know.</span> <span id="s903">And we were waiting and waiting, waiting and it took -- must have been at least a half an hour and then it stopped, so we didn’t know whether they -- everybody was already jumped off or they were dead, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s904">And then about av -- 10 minutes, 20 minutes later, we heard people shouting again, but it was different.</span> <span id="s905">They were waving things.</span> <span id="s906">We couldn’t understand what was happening.</span> <span id="s907">And then all of a sudden we looked around and we didn’t see any Germans.</span> <span id="s908">We were surrounded by the British army tanks.</span> <span id="s909">That was the third of May, 1945.</span> <span id="s910">And I went over to the -- to the tank and the first thing -- he was talking to me in English and I didn’t know what he was saying, you know.</span> <span id="s911">And the only thing I kept on saying is in -- in German, wasser, wasser.</span> <span id="s912">You know, wasser, he must have understood wasser, water, you know and he gave me some water.</span> <span id="s913">This is the first water I drunk after 10 days.</span> <span id="s914">And not only that I drunk after 10 days, as a free man, you know.</span> <span id="s915">I don’t think I appreciated the free, you know, because I didn't know, and of course then they threw me a little parcel as well, and I managed to hide it.</span> <span id="s916">A usual thing, I thought no, everybody’ll want it, and it was true, everybody wanted [indecipherable] they didn’t realize that we are free, that we can get food as much as we want.</span> <span id="s917">And they -- straight away some others came and some people could speak German, you know, some people -- British soldiers.</span> <span id="s918">And you know, they said you are free now, you can do whatever you want, you can go around.</span> <span id="s919">You can rope, you can steal, you can kill, do whatever you want.</span> <span id="s920">Well, of course, being Jewish and being a child, all we were interested was to get food.</span> <span id="s921">And this, to a certain extent, I wish they wouldn’t have done that, I wish they would have kept us and put us in -- somewhere in a camp and give us food.</span> <span id="s922">Not tell us that we can go and take whatever we want, because I would imagine that the first month of the liberation, more people died than in previous months purely from overeating.</span> <span id="s923">You couldn’t -- our stomachs couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s924">And here we were just eating for the sake of it, you know, we couldn't -- we were right up to our necks in food, you know.</span> <span id="s925">We were eating meat and jam and cheese, everything together.</span> <span id="s926">And the British were so good to us, you know.</span> <span id="s927">Every time they -- they used to come in, they -- first of all they said to us, go and live wherever you want.</span> <span id="s928">We, a few of us found a prison.</span> <span id="s929">So we thought we’ll stay there.</span> <span id="s930">But not where the prisoners -- there was no prisoners, but where the guards must have slept, you know, and that was first time in years of so white sheets, you know, and -- and of cour --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Let’s take a little break --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: -- I’m sorry, we have to change tapes.</span> <span id="s934">We’ll come back to the -- to the prison, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Do you un -- End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: So it’s m -- it’s May of 1945, and you’re in --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yes, third of May, 1945, and I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: -- Neustadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: In Neustadt which is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Which is not far from Lübeck on one side and Oldenburg on the other side, and even not that far, it’s about a hundred kilometers from -- roughly from Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: And the British have said to you that you can go and --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: And do whatever I want, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: -- do whatever you want to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: We were free.</span> <span id="s947">We could do -- and unfortu -- well, not -- I suppose unfortunately, there were also some Russians from the -- not prisoner of war, also inmates like us, on the boats, you know, and they did commit a lot of crimes, unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: What kind of crimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: Well, the natural thing was rape, you know, rape and murder and stealing and -- we were stealing, well, in a way we didn’t think we were stealing, the food was there in the open.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: And the people were there who owned the stores or the market --</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: No, no, no, it wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: -- or they were bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: -- it was -- it was a naval port.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: And -- and the -- the -- the marines, the German Marines weren’t there, you know, the German Navy wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s956">It was open, it was -- nobody was there, you know, you could take whatever you wanted, you know, and like I said, you know and I slept in that prison with white sheets for the first time in my life, you know.</span> <span id="s957">But the funny thing was I woke up in the morning, I -- I didn’t have a bath or a shower even then, I mean, this was the least of my problems, you know.</span> <span id="s958">Food was the only problem.</span> <span id="s959">And got up -- but when I got up in the morning I looked at my sheet and it looked so dirty, and I said, well, it must be from my body, you know, I -- I -- I haven’t washed for -- for -- for days and days, for weeks.</span> <span id="s960">And the same clothes, there was no other clothes.</span> <span id="s961">Only one shirt, one pair of boots, you know, which were wooden clogs.</span> <span id="s962">And I looked at it and then -- then I saw things were moving and then I realized that it was lice.</span> <span id="s963">And of course, I was covered completely with lice.</span> <span id="s964">You know, but this didn’t matter, you know, as long as I had food.</span> <span id="s965">And every morning, you know, they -- the British troops, soldiers were coming and with the Red Cross vans and they said anybody that wants to go hospital, and you know, and I ne -- I -- somehow my typhus didn’t sort of exist any more, you know.</span> <span id="s966">And -- but I’m sure I was still very, very ill, and -- but I laughed.</span> <span id="s967">I said, why do they want to take us to the hospital?</span> <span id="s968">Now we’ve got everything.</span> <span id="s969">Everything in life was food.</span> <span id="s970">That’s the only thing we are orientated.</span> <span id="s971">Three days later when they came I said I would like to go to hospital, but I won’t manage because whatever I had came down, came out of me.</span> <span id="s972">And they took me to a hospital in Neustadt.</span> <span id="s973">I was -- they took away my clothes, I was -- had nothing and -- and then th -- they put me to bed.</span> <span id="s974">And I, even now I was -- I was very, very ill.</span> <span id="s975">I was -- I don’t know what was wrong with me, I wa -- but I was semiconscious.</span> <span id="s976">And do you know -- and they asked me, do you want anything?</span> <span id="s977">And don’t ask me why, the only thing I wanted is salami.</span> <span id="s978">It’s just one of those stupid things when I think of it today.</span> <span id="s979">Well, of course I didn’t get that [indecipherable] they put me to bed and for three months I was in the hospital you know, when -- when I was already okay, I couldn’t get out of bed, I couldn’t walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: You were so weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I was t -- yeah, I couldn't -- they had to teach me to walk, you know.</span> <span id="s982">And you know tha -- I said, what is wrong with me, they said nothing.</span> <span id="s983">What was wrong with me?</span> <span id="s984">Also nothing, you had typhus when you came in but otherwise there’s absolutely nothing wrong, but you know -- and I remember such stupid thing, I couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s985">But when I was in bed, you know, and the -- the -- the -- there was the American people were coming in from Joint, the American jo -- Joint --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Joint Distribution Committee, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yeah, and they were bringing us chocolates and cigarettes you know, so -- and you know that -- that mind that work, that -- that -- to steal, you know.</span> <span id="s988">So of course you didn’t steal, you didn’t have to steal, but wo -- we were doing, you know, the -- I mean, I was only -- I didn't need it, you know, I had enough food in the hospital.</span> <span id="s989">But when they came, to -- to the children they gave chocolates.</span> <span id="s990">To the grownup that were there they gave cigarettes.</span> <span id="s991">So of course when they -- the people that -- with the chocolates ha -- came, so I was there, sitting up in bed and I took the chocolate.</span> <span id="s992">When I knew the people with the cigarettes are coming, I covered myself over the head.</span> <span id="s993">And they asked, who is there, I says, oh, there’s a man there, so they left me cigarettes, you know, that -- that mind that works, you know, it’s -- it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: You just needed to keep things, you just couldn’t give up.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Oh, keep thing is not, it didn’t matter, I had to put -- have things, you know.</span> <span id="s996">Well eventually they said yes, you’ll be able to go out.</span> <span id="s997">I said yes, that’s all very good.</span> <span id="s998">I’ve got no clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: How did you communicate with the British at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Oh, there were -- there were already -- first of all, after a few months, the German nurses were doing everything and I spoke German t -- you know, I spoke Yiddish and a bit of German, you know, mixed it up.</span> <span id="s1001">They understood.</span> <span id="s1002">And some of the soldiers even, you see, the ones that liberite -- that liberated us went -- carried on fighting, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">So the -- the ones that came in were different already and there were some soldiers that could speak Polish, there were soldiers that could speak Yiddish, there were Jewish soldiers, so there was no problem.</span> <span id="s1004">So -- and the thing was that it was already three months after the liberation, so the -- the -- the German nurses already were girlfriends of British soldiers, you see?</span> <span id="s1005">So she said to me, I try to get you something to wear, one of the nurses and she brought me a British uniform, you know.</span> <span id="s1006">I said, that’s very nice, but I mean, I’m a little boy, I mean, it’ll be too big.</span> <span id="s1007">Anyway, don’t worry and they shortened it for me.</span> <span id="s1008">And I came out of hospital and some friends of mine that I was with in the camps said oh, we going to a displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s1009">Which was a camp where we had where to live, where we used to get enough food.</span> <span id="s1010">They they said, you know, there is -- I think now the British government is allowing a thousand children to come to England.</span> <span id="s1011">The Swedish government is allowing a thousand children to go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1012">And we can also go to Palestine because Palestine -- we can’t go as such, just say right, we going, because there is a quota, because they said, according to the British government, because it was under the British protection, British mandate, that it wouldn’t be fair to the other population to send all the people that want to go to Israel in one go.</span> <span id="s1013">So every month groups will go.</span> <span id="s1014">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1015">But I definitely -- so, we sat down, we thought Sweden, England, it must be about 50,000 miles away.</span> <span id="s1016">I said, what will we go to England, we know nobody.</span> <span id="s1017">No, let’s stay and go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1018">I said, I’ve got nobody in England, I’ve got nobody anywhere else as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1019">And I said right, we’ll do that.</span> <span id="s1020">So we stayed in the displaced person camp, then we went to a -- ab -- about 10 miles away to a children’s home, and there were a few grown up people there, Jewish people and they kept on teaching us a little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Teaching, you mean English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: Eng -- no, no.</span> <span id="s1024">English was unimportant, we didn’t need to know English.</span> <span id="s1025">You know, we weren’t going to England, it was in ger -- I was in Germany so we learned Hebrew mainly, you know, because going to Palestine and then they said all the kids that go to Palestine will go to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1026">And in Hamburg we were at -- they sent us there, so I said, let’s go to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1027">It was a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s1028">It was donated by the Varberek family, which was a Jewish family, Jewish bankers that when the war broke out in Germany they went to live in Switzerland and some went to live in England, you know.</span> <span id="s1029">So we stayed there, then I got ill, I needed an operation.</span> <span id="s1030">So again they sent me to the hospital, I had the operation.</span> <span id="s1031">Of course there was no anesthetic at the time, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: What was it -- what was it for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: I ruptured myself --</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s1036">It la -- it was -- I can’t tell you how it happened, you know, cause I’m too embarrassed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">Anyway, I wanted to look somewhere where I shouldn’t have done, you know, being 15 years old, you’re very inquisitive.</span> <span id="s1040">And I -- but anyway, so I went to hospital and had the operation.</span> <span id="s1041">Then two friends came to me and -- with a letter.</span> <span id="s1042">And the letter was from London, England.</span> <span id="s1043">And I s -- who would write to me from England?</span> <span id="s1044">I don’t know anybody in England.</span> <span id="s1045">I look, and you know, the usual thing, I look at the back, there was a return address, London.</span> <span id="s1046">And it give a name, it means absolutely nothing to me, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Do you remember what the name was?</span> <span id="s1048">A: Oh yes, I remember it very well.</span> <span id="s1049">I’ll come to it in a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: And -- so my friend went up to [indecipherable] and says, why the hell don’t you open the letter and you’ll know who it’s from and who is writing to you.</span> <span id="s1052">And I open the letter and it says, written in Polish, you know, my name is so and so and I left Poland in the 30’s -- it’s a woman -- and I had a son in Poland, same age as you and I -- I found that name on the British Red Cross list in London.</span> <span id="s1053">She even says where, in Woburn House.</span> <span id="s1054">The only thing, the year of the -- of the -- the birth is different.</span> <span id="s1055">It says that Zygmund Shipper, born 18th of January, 1931, and I know that my son was born in 1930.</span> <span id="s1056">And she says, but if you have a look at your left wrist, as a child of about three or four you burnt yourself and there should still be a mark there.</span> <span id="s1057">And you know, I didn’t even think of the mark.</span> <span id="s1058">I knew I had a mark because it was very -- you could see it very easily.</span> <span id="s1059">But of course, today you can just about see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: Right there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: And you know, and I looked at that and I found my mother, that I knew that she was dead for over 10 years.</span> <span id="s1062">As a child of five I knew my mother was dead.</span> <span id="s1063">At least that’s what I thought.</span> <span id="s1064">And here a woman found me and she says she is my mother.</span> <span id="s1065">The funny thing is I -- I -- tears come down now.</span> <span id="s1066">When I actually knew about it, it didn’t mean that much to me.</span> <span id="s1067">And of course, in the letter she says, if I’m your mother I -- I want you to come to England to be with me, you know, and -- and I said to -- I turned around to my friends and -- you know, and I said, I don’t know the woman.</span> <span id="s1068">She doesn’t mean anything to me.</span> <span id="s1069">I mean, you are my family.</span> <span id="s1070">You are -- you two are my brothers.</span> <span id="s1071">She is a stranger to me.</span> <span id="s1072">And of course, you know, they said, how can you say that, you know.</span> <span id="s1073">And when I came out of hospital an-and went back and the teacher there, we had teachers from the Jewish brigade, that were teaching us Hebrew and we had lessons in -- in -- in math and whatever else, German, I’m not sure, history or so on.</span> <span id="s1074">And everybody said -- everybody was talking about the incident and they said you found your mother, how can you not -- you’re one of the luckiest people alive that you’ve got somebody, a mother, and we’ve got nothing.</span> <span id="s1075">You must go to your mother.</span> <span id="s1076">Anyway, they persuaded me and it took about -- at that time I couldn’t go, just go, she had to get a visa for me, and it took 10 months to get a visa, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Oh yes, it -- or even longer.</span> <span id="s1079">Than happened in January and I think -- and I came to England in December -- 22nd or 23rd of December 1946.</span> <span id="s1080">And I arrived -- I came on a boat, I arrived in Hull.</span> <span id="s1081">A man met me, and he said to me in Yiddish, because I couldn’t speak English, he says -- when I came off the boat he says, if you’ve got your things, get your luggage and we will go on the train, we’ll go to London.</span> <span id="s1082">I looked at him and I be -- start laughing.</span> <span id="s1083">He says, why are you laughing?</span> <span id="s1084">I said, what luggage?</span> <span id="s1085">You see what I’ve got.</span> <span id="s1086">I was -- I was -- when I was in Hamburg I was very friendly with a girl and the only reason -- reason I was so friendly with her is because I had one shirt and I had -- needed somebody to wash my shirt.</span> <span id="s1087">When she washed my shirt I had to stay inside because I had no other shirt to wear.</span> <span id="s1088">And he talks to me about luggage.</span> <span id="s1089">Anyway, he turned out to be my stepfather, my mother remarried.</span> <span id="s1090">And that’s what I said to you I’ll tell you the name, it was Killberg.</span> <span id="s1091">And eventually we came home and you know, we -- I arrived and my mother cried, and made me cry as well, but I still didn’t feel anything towards her at the time, you know?</span> <span id="s1092">And the first six months I didn’t go to work, I did nothing, but it was the worst -- one of the worst times in my life.</span> <span id="s1093">I thought my wer -- bad times have finished but they were bad, I had nobody.</span> <span id="s1094">My family was in Germany, waiting to go to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Let me ask you a question about the time, that year that you spent waiting to go to England.</span> <span id="s1096">What did you do, and what did you think about?</span> <span id="s1097">I mean, did you -- and did you write to your mother, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: -- get caught up and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I wrote.</span> <span id="s1101">Yeah, not as often maybe as I should have done, but I did write, and what did I do?</span> <span id="s1102">We had school.</span> <span id="s1103">And you know, we were outside Hamburg and we -- we had a time of our lives, you know.</span> <span id="s1104">We had money to burn.</span> <span id="s1105">We -- we -- we used to get Red Cross parcels that were sent during the war for the American prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1106">And there were mountains of those.</span> <span id="s1107">And -- and you know, we used to -- and in the parcel there was two pa -- a parcel for two people, so we used to share it.</span> <span id="s1108">There was Nescafe, I’ll never see Nescafe.</span> <span id="s1109">There was -- there was prunes, there was sugar, there was chocolate.</span> <span id="s1110">And of course the most important thing was the Nescafe and a pack of 200 cigarettes.</span> <span id="s1111">Not that we smoked, but we could buy things with them.</span> <span id="s1112">If we wanted to go to a theater, you know, to see an opera -- I mean, I never knew what an opera was -- we -- there was no tickets, you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s1113">But when you put a packet of cigarettes at the desk where they were selling -- where the -- the ticket thing was, then you straight away got tickets, and coffee as well.</span> <span id="s1114">We used to go to the farms, you know, German farms, and you know, exchange a tin of Nescafe, those small tins at the time, which cames in the parcel, for some eggs or some ham, or whatever we wanted, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: Was Nescafe ground coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: You know -- yes, you know, the tins.</span> <span id="s1117">You’ve got it here, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Yeah, I just didn’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: -- if it was the same thing, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">A: -- the ready made, you know, spoon cof --</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: -- instant coffee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: -- coffee -- instant coffee, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: But it was Nescafe, it’s the same as today in England.</span> <span id="s1126">I’m sure you’ve got it here.</span> <span id="s1127">Anyway, so we were -- excuse me [tape break] Yes, and it was carrying on like that.</span> <span id="s1128">I was with them.</span> <span id="s1129">They didn’t say you’ve got to leave because you’re not going to Palestine, so I stayed with them and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: [indecipherable] you stay, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: -- til -- til we went, you know.</span> <span id="s1132">I didn’t want to go, right up til the last minute I didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1133">But anyway I came, like I said, and for the first six months I didn’t do any work, all I did was go to cinemas.</span> <span id="s1134">I’ve never seen a film before in my life.</span> <span id="s1135">Now I certainly made up in those six months.</span> <span id="s1136">And then one day they -- somebody came to me and said, you know, there is a club that young Holocaust survivors, boys and girls meet in a certain area in London in Belsize Park, as it happens, and why don’t you go there one day?</span> <span id="s1137">On a Saturday night they’ve got a dance, so why don’t you go?</span> <span id="s1138">I said all right, so I decided I’ll go, you know, so I arrived at the door, you know, it -- they had a dance in a church hall.</span> <span id="s1139">I knocked on the door and they opened.</span> <span id="s1140">And I said some words then that I -- in the book what -- what Sir Martin Gilbert wrote about us, the boys that came here -- that came to England,.</span> <span id="s1141">and I said -- the first thing I said when th -- I opened the door, I found my family again.</span> <span id="s1142">That’s what they meant to me, more than my mother.</span> <span id="s1143">And from then on, my life completely changed, you know.</span> <span id="s1144">I joined the club straight away and I spent more time in the club than anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1145">I got a job, my mother said and my stepfather said every person should have a trade.</span> <span id="s1146">What would you like to do?</span> <span id="s1147">I said, I haven’t got a clue what I want to do.</span> <span id="s1148">My mother said, would you like to go to school and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1149">I say, I’m too old for school.</span> <span id="s1150">At 17 I was -- I can’t go back to school, you know, I sort of -- so they said, what about tailoring?</span> <span id="s1151">I said okay.</span> <span id="s1152">So I went to t-tailoring.</span> <span id="s1153">I worked in tailoring for about six or seven years and I must tell you I hated every minute of it.</span> <span id="s1154">By then I already found th -- in that club, a refugee girl as well, but they came in 1939, she came with her parents to England.</span> <span id="s1155">We started dating, you know, and I said to her, do you know what?</span> <span id="s1156">The day the man will say that I’m a qualified tailor, this will be the day I give up tailoring and I’ll never hold a needle in my hand.</span> <span id="s1157">And I kept to it.</span> <span id="s1158">He said, now you can -- he says, you’ll have more money.</span> <span id="s1159">I said, thank you very much, but now I’m leaving the job.</span> <span id="s1160">And going back to that girl, we started going out together.</span> <span id="s1161">Eventually we got married.</span> <span id="s1162">And I opened a delicatessen business, that didn’t go very well eventually.</span> <span id="s1163">So she said, you know, my father is in business, but if you go in, you can go much bigger in the business, we -- why don’t you go in?</span> <span id="s1164">And the father said, why don’t you come in with me, and I did.</span> <span id="s1165">It was a stationery and printing business.</span> <span id="s1166">And eventually, after a few years, I left him and he retired and I got bigger and I did wholesale, I had my own print place.</span> <span id="s1167">I had retail shops in London.</span> <span id="s1168">But you know my mother -- going back to my mother, you know, I realized then, you know, when I got married I realized, you know, there must -- she must have had a good reason why she left.</span> <span id="s1169">You know, things are not so ha -- black and white.</span> <span id="s1170">I realize people do get divorced, you know.</span> <span id="s1171">But I regret -- I’ve got a regret, that -- I’ve got very few regrets, but one regret is -- which you did ask me, and I never asked my mother til she died, and she died, unfortunately, very young, why?</span> <span id="s1172">What was the reason?</span> <span id="s1173">And up to today I don’t know the reason, you know, why she left, for what, whether there was another person involved, or whether she just couldn’t live with my father, or vice versa.</span> <span id="s1174">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: [coughs] Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1176">I want to a -- I’m glad you brought up your father because during this time, while you were in the -- in the ghetto, in the camps, you didn't know what had happened to your father.</span> <span id="s1177">You never heard from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Did you -- w-w-when you were finally liberated, was it on your mind to try and go to Poland or find out about anybody in Poland, or was that a possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Now -- the funny thing was that we -- very, very few of us Polish boys -- Polish young -- youngsters wanted to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1181">Don’t ask me why.</span> <span id="s1182">I -- when I think back today I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1183">But unfortunately some of them went back and were killed by the Poles.</span> <span id="s1184">You see, the Poles were very scared of the Jewish people coming back and trying to claim their properties.</span> <span id="s1185">I mean, those people lived in those properties for five years, and all of a sudden a Jew will come and take their properties away.</span> <span id="s1186">They were beaten, they were killed in many, many places.</span> <span id="s1187">There was a pogrom in Kielce, you know, in Poland, where they killed a lot of Jewish people, you know, because they were terrified that they’re going to take away their homes.</span> <span id="s1188">I can understand that, you know.</span> <span id="s1189">Why they should kill, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1190">They didn’t have to kill them not to give them back their homes, but they did.</span> <span id="s1191">I -- I asked questions, you know, but I didn’t look properly til years later, you know, but like I said, you know, I was in business and I got married in 1954.</span> <span id="s1192">In 1956 my wife became pregnant.</span> <span id="s1193">October -- the eighth of October I went to the hospital, she was in labor.</span> <span id="s1194">And I will never forget that moment, it was the happiest moment in my life, you know.</span> <span id="s1195">And you know, when I walked in -- because at that time there wasn’t such a thing as a husband watching the birth of a child, you know, and that woman presented me with that bundle, and I looked at it and I couldn’t stop crying.</span> <span id="s1196">And I said, at last, I know I’ve got a family of my own, you know.</span> <span id="s1197">When I look at that child, it was the greatest thing, that whenever I say that and my younger daughter is there -- because a few years later I had another daughter, she says, Dad, what about me, you know.</span> <span id="s1198">And she knows how much I love both of them, there is absolutely no different.</span> <span id="s1199">But you know, it did something to me, you know, that I cannot explain, you know.</span> <span id="s1200">I know that every parents is -- it’s the most happiest day of their life when their child is born.</span> <span id="s1201">But the Holocaust survivor, when he’s lost almost everything -- I mean some of my friends, they’ve got -- they had families, they had siblings and they’ve got not one member of the family survived, you know.</span> <span id="s1202">You know, and I was lucky enough that my mother survived.</span> <span id="s1203">Unfortunately -- I mean, she was lucky enough to see grandchildren, you know, which was a great thing for me and for her.</span> <span id="s1204">And unfortunately I think she died thinking that I’ve never forgiven her for leaving me.</span> <span id="s1205">And when we discussed it, and I used to -- about leaving me, she never said why and I never asked, but I said, if you would have stayed, most probably both of us would have been dead today.</span> <span id="s1206">So, at least both of us survived.</span> <span id="s1207">And I certainly did -- did not hold it against her.</span> <span id="s1208">You know, I did, most probably as a child, but in later years, you know, when I came to England, you know, it never crossed my mind that she’s guilty of something.</span> <span id="s1209">And she got on better with my wife than she got on with me because she had it in the back of her mind that I must hate her, or -- and I know, I -- I -- I loved her as much as I could, you know.</span> <span id="s1210">I’m sure I didn’t love her as a normal child will love a mother, you know.</span> <span id="s1211">But I did love her, I respected her, you see?</span> <span id="s1212">But then, as I said, I had children, and eventually they grew up.</span> <span id="s1213">Good kids.</span> <span id="s1214">They produced three children each.</span> <span id="s1215">You know, I’ve got six grandchildren and I think how lucky I am, you know.</span> <span id="s1216">In 1981, I -- unfortunately I did work very hard, you know?</span> <span id="s1217">I also played very hard, you know.</span> <span id="s1218">I -- I smoke and I drunk and I goed -- went to casinos and I -- I -- I went to football, I did everything.</span> <span id="s1219">I wasn’t a father like I -- I even apologized to my two daughters for not being a father like I should have been.</span> <span id="s1220">They don’t think so, but you know.</span> <span id="s1221">But today they think I’m the greatest thing alive.</span> <span id="s1222">I don’t know why, you know.</span> <span id="s1223">They are wonderful, wonderful kids.</span> <span id="s1224">And when I think I came to England, without education I couldn’t read and write.</span> <span id="s1225">Never mind English, I couldn’t hardly read and write in Polish.</span> <span id="s1226">And the -- my oldest grandson has a master’s degree in mathematics and statistics.</span> <span id="s1227">From a poor little boy to come to this country, to meet her Majesty the Queen and shake hands with her.</span> <span id="s1228">To meet the prime minister of this country and go to his place where he lives and where he works, why me?</span> <span id="s1229">In 1981, as I said, I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1230">I had to go to hospital and they sent me home, they said there’s nothing wrong.</span> <span id="s1231">Four hours later I was in hospital again with a heart attack and they -- I think it’s cutting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Okay, we’ll take a break, all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I’m nearly finished anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: I’d like to go back and ask you about this group of survivors that you met six months after you came to London, and -- and I’d like to just t-talk a little bit more about who they were and what kinds of things you did together, and you -- did -- just -- just give me a little bit of better sense of what that group of people was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: You see, they’re a group of retired soldiers, they were the ones that came here in -- between August 1945, and sort of end of 1947.</span> <span id="s1238">But tha -- on the 14th of August 1945 was the first lot that came here from Theresienstadt concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1239">They were there -- they were liberated in Theresienstadt, then they went to Prague and from Prague they came to England.</span> <span id="s1240">Originally they came to the north of England to a beautiful place called Windermere.</span> <span id="s1241">And I don’t know the reason why they brought them there, but people think it’s because they were scared to bring them into a capital like London or Manchester, because they didn’t know who they were bringing in here.</span> <span id="s1242">They are bringing young people that were five years interned.</span> <span id="s1243">Now, how are they going to behave?</span> <span id="s1244">Now, within a few months they dispersed them, they sent them to London and Manchester, Liverpool and so on.</span> <span id="s1245">Now, the people that I met, of course, they were the Londoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Now, who is they?</span> <span id="s1247">Who brought them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: They Central British Fund, which Leonard Montefiore was the head of Central British Fund, it was a charity, and they brought them to England, they supplied teachers and doctors.</span> <span id="s1249">Everything was supplied by Central British Fund.</span> <span id="s1250">They even paid for the transport, they paid for everything.</span> <span id="s1251">The government allowed a thousand children, but the government didn’t pay for it, the Central British Fund paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And it was a non-governmental organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Yes, completely charity.</span> <span id="s1254">Was a complete charity organization, they’re still in existence now, but they -- they amalgamated with the big charities, they are not any more the Central British Fund, the Jewish [indecipherable] this -- this -- the whole thing involved, you know.</span> <span id="s1255">And they had homes, you know, for the survivors and for refugees that came before the war to Britain, you see?</span> <span id="s1256">And that group that I was with is the group that came.</span> <span id="s1257">They were -- they were survivors originally from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1258">Very, very few from Germany, but they were all a mixture of [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1259">And we -- we came -- and when they came to London they lived in hostels and then they decided -- the CBF decided that they should form a club to keep the youngsters together.</span> <span id="s1260">And they formed a club and it was like any other club.</span> <span id="s1261">We did a lot of sport.</span> <span id="s1262">One of our members, which today is the chairman of our society, which after the club finished we formed a society, became British lightweight champion in weightlifting.</span> <span id="s1263">Now him they made British very quickly because he was very good.</span> <span id="s1264">He represented England in the Olympic games, in the commonwealth games and of course in the Maccabee in Israel.</span> <span id="s1265">And we had -- and some went to college, some went to university.</span> <span id="s1266">Some became doctors, lawyers.</span> <span id="s1267">You know, we had one who was working in -- in university as a lecturer, you know, and so -- well, actually two.</span> <span id="s1268">One was a mathematician, you know, and we did -- they did quite well.</span> <span id="s1269">And most of them went to trades or business, and -- and -- but the most important thing was that because of the club, we kept together.</span> <span id="s1270">Now, eventually, you know, we got married and had children, we couldn’t have a club, because it wouldn’t work, because we wouldn’t have time to go to a club.</span> <span id="s1271">And we -- you couldn’t carry on playing football, basketball, cricket and so on.</span> <span id="s1272">We had other -- we had to work and we had to look after families.</span> <span id="s1273">So they decided to form a society, which we still got up til today, which is called the 45 Aid Society, I think I told you that.</span> <span id="s1274">We raise money for charity, for eng -- in England and in Israel, mainly for children.</span> <span id="s1275">Because we feel we were children when it happened to us, we want to help children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: Is it just for Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: No, no, in England it’s -- whoever approaches us, we try to give.</span> <span id="s1280">But of course, in -- in Israel it is for children.</span> <span id="s1281">We -- we have been giving to a home for deaf children, you know, for -- for oh, for about 30 years now, if not longer.</span> <span id="s1282">And we feel we should, you know, and -- and also, I think, because of that, having had a club and then having this society, which we look after also our own members, if they need help, we are there.</span> <span id="s1283">They’ve got somebody to turn to, because they’ve got no other families.</span> <span id="s1284">Of course, they got married and have got their children and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1285">But otherwise they’ve got nobody.</span> <span id="s1286">They got no brothers or sisters, so -- or very few have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: When you -- when you found this group, six months after you arrived, how many people were there wi -- more or less?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Oh, I wouldn’t like to say, but there must have been at least about oh -- members, about 400.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: Oh really, that many?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: Yeah, but, you see, a lot of them went to the United States, Canada, Australia, a few Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1291">And of course, you see we are scattered all over Britain.</span> <span id="s1292">Like, in Manchester we’ve got some members and of -- we’ve got a lot of members that were then in Israel are now -- that wer -- are now in Israel were originally in England, and some of them -- in 1948, or ’47 and ’48, they decided to go and fight in the War of Independence when the state of Israel was born.</span> <span id="s1293">Some came back.</span> <span id="s1294">Those that w -- came back, had to come back within a year, otherwise they wouldn’t have been let into Britain.</span> <span id="s1295">And some of them didn’t want to come back, and they stayed in Israel.</span> <span id="s1296">And we’ve got quite a big grou -- well, not a big group, but a biggish group in Israel of those people.</span> <span id="s1297">So much so that this year we had our own reunion every -- we have a reunion every Sunday -- every year in the first Sunday in May, because most of the people are liberated in that time.</span> <span id="s1298">So, we have a fa -- a reunion of everybody.</span> <span id="s1299">People come from the States, people come from Israel.</span> <span id="s1300">This year nobody came from Israel, the reason being that a lot of the people in England went to Israel on the sixth and seventh of May to be -- and they had their own reunion in Israel, the Israeli people put on the reunion, and it was also because it was the 60th anniversary of the birth of the state of Israel, so they went.</span> <span id="s1301">So we’re a very close family and I think this helped a lot, because when you think that very few of us of that whole group needed psychiatric help, or being counseled -- I don’t know anybody who was counseled through the years, because we had such a family, we had.</span> <span id="s1302">And a lot of survivors that were in England or in Britain, I should say, needed help because they were on their own.</span> <span id="s1303">And you know, they didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s1304">Like my children -- I mean, I never had a brother, never had a sister, but my children had a lot of uncles and aunts.</span> <span id="s1305">And up til today, they call my friends, many of them, I mean it’s, it’s not everybody, uncle or aunt.</span> <span id="s1306">You see, because this -- I think this helped us a hell of a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: You see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Let me ask you also about your grandmother.</span> <span id="s1310">You said goodbye to her as you were being taken away --</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: -- to go and work in this railroad yard, with those other young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: Well, this was the last time, of course, I saw my grandmother, and -- and this is one of my main regrets, you know, that I didn’t have a chance, you know, to thank her for what she did for me, to bringing me up.</span> <span id="s1314">I’m sure it wasn’t easy, you know, but there was nobody else that could help me at the time, only her.</span> <span id="s1315">And she was like a mother to me.</span> <span id="s1316">And what I am today, I owe it to her.</span> <span id="s1317">And unfortunately, a few years ago -- well, quite a while ago now, I found out that she died in Theresienstadt, but she died on the day of the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: She got moved to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yes, all of them finished up in Theresienstadt from Stutthof, because Stutthof was overrun very quickly by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1320">And she finished up in Theresienstadt and she died out -- on the day of the liberation.</span> <span id="s1321">That means she didn’t even have one day to say, well I survived the war and maybe my grandson survived the war, maybe my son survived the war, or sons, I should say.</span> <span id="s1322">Which one did.</span> <span id="s1323">You see, my father -- the other regret is, I don’t know when, I don’t know where my father died.</span> <span id="s1324">And I would have liked to have gone -- I’m not religious, but I would like to go and stand in front of his grave and say Kaddish for him, and you know, to say a prayer, you know, and -- and that’s about all, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: You don’t know anything about where he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: I’ve been to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem years ago and I tried to find out, I couldn’t find anything out.</span> <span id="s1329">I -- I tried everything you know, and those are the only regrets.</span> <span id="s1330">Otherwise, I consider myself one of the luckiest people alive.</span> <span id="s1331">Listen, I survived all that.</span> <span id="s1332">I -- in 1981, unfortunately I had to go to hospital because thought I was -- I -- I thought I was a heart attack, but they finished up saying me, I had -- it’s nothing.</span> <span id="s1333">Four hours later I was back in hospital having had a heart attack.</span> <span id="s1334">And but they said, well, it’s -- it’s a mild one, we’ll keep you here for three, four days and then you can go home.</span> <span id="s1335">I said, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1336">They took me up to the coronary care unit.</span> <span id="s1337">I was there, my wife came in and for some reason when she walked in, must have been two hours after they brought me in, I started speaking in Yiddish, not in English.</span> <span id="s1338">And I said to her in Yiddish, you know, I -- I don’t think this is a good business being here.</span> <span id="s1339">And the next thing I know I had six doctors around me.</span> <span id="s1340">And one of them said, do you know what happened to you?</span> <span id="s1341">I said, I was talking to my wife and I must have fallen asleep.</span> <span id="s1342">When I said the word sleep, I realized -- I was conscious enough then to realize that I didn’t fall asleep, that I must have gone, you know, and they resuscitated me.</span> <span id="s1343">And then later I found out, you know, they told my wife and my two daughters, who were there already, that my chances of surviving were nil, you know.</span> <span id="s1344">That the -- the next 24 hours and they said go home and pray.</span> <span id="s1345">And my wife said, you know the Germans tried five years to kill him and they didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s1346">So -- and all I can tell you, three weeks later I walked out without medication.</span> <span id="s1347">And that was 27 years ago.</span> <span id="s1348">I don’t know how I’m going -- how long I’m going to live, but I certainly survived 24 hours.</span> <span id="s1349">And I ask again, why?</span> <span id="s1350">Why did I escape such a lot of incidents, such a lot of -- the gas chambers, a massive coronary?</span> <span id="s1351">I don’t know, I can’t, you know, there’s no answer to that.</span> <span id="s1352">But I cannot thank enough the British people what they did for me, first of all they liberated me.</span> <span id="s1353">They let me come into their country and I could do whatever I wanted, I had no restriction of movement, I had no restriction of business, I could open any business I wanted, you know?</span> <span id="s1354">So I am thankful to them.</span> <span id="s1355">I’m thankful -- if there is a God, I thank God for what happened to me and I had a very good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Are you a religious person?</span> <span id="s1357">Do you attend synagogue?</span> <span id="s1358">Do --</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: I am not a religious person.</span> <span id="s1360">I go to synagogue twice a year on new year, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1361">This is what I go, it’s nothing to do -- as far as I’m concerned it’s nothing to do with religion, because I sit down and I think of my family and what happened to them, and of course my grandparents were very religious, so I owe them that, you know.</span> <span id="s1362">And I -- as I st -- as you remember, I said that I was brought up in a very religious home, but unfortunately after the war, you know, when I asked questions, I couldn’t accept the answers that were given to me when I asked like a foolish 15 year old, I asked questions that there were no answers to that.</span> <span id="s1363">But the question the rabbis gave me, I wouldn’t accept.</span> <span id="s1364">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: What was the question and what was the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Well, I ask why.</span> <span id="s1367">The thing I’m ask that everybody ask.</span> <span id="s1368">Why.</span> <span id="s1369">I said okay, grown-up people I can understand.</span> <span id="s1370">I mean, people committed so many things against people, against God, they were punished for it.</span> <span id="s1371">But a six month old baby being violated, put in a gas chamber?</span> <span id="s1372">No, I couldn’t accept the answer and I was very, very much against religion, so much so when it came to Yom Kippur, which is, you know, we got to fast 25 hours, we mu -- all we are allowed to do is to pray, I used to eat twice as much as normal that day.</span> <span id="s1373">I used to go to football, I used to go to dog racing, I used to do everything, I -- I hated the religion so much.</span> <span id="s1374">But you know -- because, you know, like everybody else wif -- you always blame God for good or bad, you know?</span> <span id="s1375">And then I thought -- you know, you get older, you’ve got a family and you start thinking.</span> <span id="s1376">Well, I cannot tell anybody that there is a God and nobody can tell me there is no God.</span> <span id="s1377">I don’t know, and nobody else knows.</span> <span id="s1378">We -- we think we know.</span> <span id="s1379">But what I cannot understand, why, if there is a God, why do we blame God for everything?</span> <span id="s1380">We are the people that doing all those things.</span> <span id="s1381">God doesn’t tell us.</span> <span id="s1382">It doesn’t say anywhere God tell us to kill people, to let people starve.</span> <span id="s1383">You see, I -- I mean, six million Jews alone were killed, for no reason.</span> <span id="s1384">One and a half million children were killed.</span> <span id="s1385">And not only Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s1386">The Gypsy population of -- of Europe was almost wiped out.</span> <span id="s1387">Homosexuals were killed.</span> <span id="s1388">Disabled people were killed, including German disabled people.</span> <span id="s1389">And it’s only us that doing it, it’s not God.</span> <span id="s1390">When I look today, you know, that I looked -- I watch television, when I speak to students and I ask them what they ask me, that old question, can it happen again, I say, don’t you ever watch television or read the newspapers and you what’s happening in Rwanda, Darfur and other places like that?</span> <span id="s1391">And I think to myself, when I look at children starving, I -- I’m in such a state.</span> <span id="s1392">And I don’t see a black child, I don’t see a white child, I see a child.</span> <span id="s1393">And I think -- like I said to the Prime Minister of England, I said, when I was invited to his place, I said why can’t we do something about it, to give a -- to give them each at least in -- a day a -- a bowl of rice, that would keep them alive?</span> <span id="s1394">I mean, we’ve got so much and we give nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: I want to ask you about when you met your wife, you were -- I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: -- 18 years old, and you missed your teenage years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: You were -- well, you were a dra -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Well, I was very much grown up.</span> <span id="s1401">I certainly wasn’t an 18 year old normal boy, I wa -- I must have been a 30 year old man, you know, and -- but it was no problem, you know, it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Yeah, we -- tell me about -- tell me her name and where she was from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Her name is Jeanette Shipper -- now she’s Shipper, she was Gorge, G-o-r-g-e.</span> <span id="s1404">She was born in France, in [indecipherable] Alsace Lorraine.</span> <span id="s1405">Father was born in Germany, her mother was born in Paris.</span> <span id="s1406">In 1939 they came to England.</span> <span id="s1407">Luckily they both managed to come to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: They Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: -- very much so.</span> <span id="s1412">They came to England, you know, I think on a visa or wha -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1413">She didn’t come on Kindertransport, she came as a -- with her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: And she lived here, ma -- and as I told you, I met her in the club, and you know, and I met her once before, funny enough and I -- she didn’t realize and then one day I said, you know, I know you from somewhere.</span> <span id="s1416">I said, oh yes, yes, they all tell the same story, you know, and -- and we started eventually, you know, not straightaway, eventually we started sort of dating and the reason was because she lived near a football club, so I thought if I go in the afternoon to -- to the football match, after the football match I’ll be able to pick her up and we can go out, and -- and that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1417">And we’ve been married for 52 years.</span> <span id="s1418">Like I said, I’ve got six -- I’ve got two daughters, six grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1419">Four grandsons, two granddaughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Was it ever hard for her, you think, because I mean, even though she was Jewish she didn’t see the same kinds of things that you saw as a young person --</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Mm, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: -- you know, she left with her family and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: -- she wasn’t in a camp or a ghetto or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: No, no, no, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: -- anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: -- nowhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: So she had a different ki -- quite different experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: And was it hard for you to explain some of the things that you’d been through?</span> <span id="s1431">Was that ever a problem for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Well, we have -- we never -- she knew about it, you know, what she had me speak to other people and so on, and she didn’t ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s1433">But you know, belonging to that club that she belonged, that every boy there was a Holocaust survivor, not a refugee, not a Kindertransport, he was a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1434">So she knew quite a lot about it without me telling her, you see?</span> <span id="s1435">Then my children -- and even today my children ask more than she does because she knows most of it, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Did you ever have -- did you ever hesitate telling your children, or do you think that your children ever hes -- hesitated asking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Well, I think it was both.</span> <span id="s1438">I -- for the first, I would say 25 years, very few of us Holocaust survivors spoke about it, whether it was [indecipherable] I think there’s many reasons, you know.</span> <span id="s1439">When we first survived and came to this country, we were 15 - 16 year olds, you know, would people believe us if we told them, you know?</span> <span id="s1440">They would say well, you know, kids exaggerate, children, oh it’s a lot of nonsense, you know.</span> <span id="s1441">And then, you know, we were so wrapped up in -- in work and in marriage and in bringing up a family, now are we going to tell the children?</span> <span id="s1442">Is it fair to tell the children what you went through?</span> <span id="s1443">But the children started reading.</span> <span id="s1444">My two daughters at least, you know, that’s t -- watching films and -- and then asking questions, you know, and they realized what it was.</span> <span id="s1445">And then, you know, the time came that some of us decided we’ve got to do is talk about it, you know.</span> <span id="s1446">And my two daughters insisted on going to Auschwitz, and going to Lódz where I’m -- was born.</span> <span id="s1447">They wanted to see we -- I’m very close to my daughters and I -- they are very close to me and they wanted -- I said -- I said, why do you want to go?</span> <span id="s1448">You -- you know all about it, you’ve seen it, you’ve read about it.</span> <span id="s1449">They said no.</span> <span id="s1450">We want to feel what you went through.</span> <span id="s1451">I said, that’s not a -- what for?</span> <span id="s1452">Anyway, they -- they said if I don’t go, after time and again refusing, you know, they said right, we go alone.</span> <span id="s1453">So I said I can’t allow that, so we all went.</span> <span id="s1454">And it was one of the better things I did in life, by doing it, because I felt then that I owe it to people -- I owe it to the people that did not survive when I speak to young students, I say -- when they ask me, why do you come and give talks?</span> <span id="s1455">Surely it hurts you, you -- brings back memories.</span> <span id="s1456">I said, doesn’t matter what it does, I said, there are -- there were families, you know, that not one member of them survived.</span> <span id="s1457">Now who is going to tell their story?</span> <span id="s1458">Because all the stories are very similar, you know?</span> <span id="s1459">So I decided then that I want to do a lot before it’s too late.</span> <span id="s1460">I don’t know how long I’ve still got.</span> <span id="s1461">So for the last sort of 15 years, 20 years, I’ve been going more and more to speak to students mainly, you know, to tell them what happened because of hatred, bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, and the main -- the main thing I tell them is hate.</span> <span id="s1462">And I insist -- my last two words to the students is, do not hate.</span> <span id="s1463">And never give in, never give up.</span> <span id="s1464">I don’t hate and I certainly didn’t give up.</span> <span id="s1465">I’m not saying that’s why I survived, but I feel it -- it’s a little bit of a reason why, maybe.</span> <span id="s1466">The rest -- 99 percent is -- was luck.</span> <span id="s1467">It wasn’t that I was clever, it wasn’t such a -- that I was such a good person or something.</span> <span id="s1468">No, it was luck and never have the -- the willpower, maybe, to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: You mentioned that when you went to -- back to Poland, that you went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: And that your grandson was with you and that he was the same age --</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yes, he was 16, you know, he was the youngest of my grandsons.</span> <span id="s1473">He was 16, of course, I was 14 and a half, was there.</span> <span id="s1474">I went, was for the 60th anniversary of liberation of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: What was that like, how did he react?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: He -- he wrote about it and he really -- I -- I was very happy that I took him, you know, because where we were standing on the last day in Auschwitz, with the snow falling, 18 below zero an-and he wrote an article, I’ve got it here and I certainly will give it to you.</span> <span id="s1477">It’s a very short article, and he says how he felt standing there, and he wanted to come over to me and say, Grandpa, can we go now, you know, in the coach to go back to Kraków because I’m so cold.</span> <span id="s1478">And then I thought, I’ve got two pair of trousers, three pair of socks, two coats -- a pullover, a coat and a hat, boots.</span> <span id="s1479">And he said -- and in it he says, and then, I thought, there were people like my grandfather here wearing lit -- like pajamas, standing in that cold.</span> <span id="s1480">How can I go to my grandfather and tell him that I am cold?</span> <span id="s1481">And he didn’t, and I didn't know about it til I came back to England and I found the article, my daughter gave me the article wrote, and it was published in a magazine as well afterwards, you know, and I felt -- I felt very proud of him.</span> <span id="s1482">Like I do about all my grandchildren, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Elliot Stern.</span> <span id="s1485">Yes, he’s -- he’s very, very much.</span> <span id="s1486">He’s one of them -- they’re all interested in it.</span> <span id="s1487">I think he’s -- might be more.</span> <span id="s1488">He comes, tries to listen to those things, you know, and asks questions, you know.</span> <span id="s1489">A-Another one of my grandson wrote an article -- wrote a play on the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1490">He is now finishing university, but he was taking the A levels -- I’m sure you know what the A level is, that’s the last exams the last two years before you go to university.</span> <span id="s1491">And for that -- so he wrote an article that -- for his -- on the Holocaust and he performed.</span> <span id="s1492">There were seven boys performing [indecipherable] and it was very good.</span> <span id="s1493">And he asked me very little about it, so he must have gone on the internet or books or -- he knew a lot from me without me telling him.</span> <span id="s1494">And he did well on it.</span> <span id="s1495">So yes, he’s good.</span> <span id="s1496">But I was gl -- you asked me before about me going back to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1497">He was very good because, you know, I saw things that I’ve never saw when I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1498">There was no way I could see those things, you know, you didn’t walk around.</span> <span id="s1499">And first of all, I was in biren -- Birkenau and Auschwitz is just the -- the -- today the exhibition place, you know, where you see everything and we all cried, especially when I saw that room under glass with th -- with the babies, with the children’s toys and toothbrushes and little spectacles, little shoes.</span> <span id="s1500">And we hugged and we all cried.</span> <span id="s1501">Said listen, under different circumstances that could have been my children’s things, you know, and -- and they were somebody’s children’s things and it’s -- it’s tragic, you know, it’s -- it -- it was one of the worst things.</span> <span id="s1502">But when I stood in the tower of Auschwitz [indecipherable] you know, where the things are, and I said to my kids, you see, whatever Hitler wanted to do, he did not achieve the end.</span> <span id="s1503">We won, he lost.</span> <span id="s1504">Unfortunately, six million people died, but -- Jews, I mean, I -- like I said before, other people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Let’s take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: -- question about your stepfather.</span> <span id="s1509">You came into this family, he didn’t know you, he’d never met you, he’d probably heard stories about you before.</span> <span id="s1510">What was it like -- when you mentioned that it was, you know, a little -- you had trouble feeling like your mother was your mother, but how was it for your stepfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: It was ver -- he was -- he was a very good man, he was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s1512">He certainly treated me like his own son.</span> <span id="s1513">Whether he knew much about me, I don’t think so, for a simple reason; my mother didn’t know much about me.</span> <span id="s1514">She didn’t know what I was, what person I was.</span> <span id="s1515">Listen, I certainly, at 16 or almost 17 wasn’t the same person that she left in Poland when she left us.</span> <span id="s1516">So I don’t know what he knew about me, you know.</span> <span id="s1517">My mother certainly didn’t know what she’s getting herself into when I came to England.</span> <span id="s1518">What is he going to be like, you know, as a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: They didn’t have children of their own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: So you were it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: I was it -- no, well the funny thing is he was married before and he had children and one of the boys lived with my mother during the war, you know.</span> <span id="s1525">But then he left, I think he went to live with his brother and his mother somewhere in South America, Argentina, I think, or Brazil, I’m not quite sure, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: And what was your stepfather’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: Joseph Kilberg.</span> <span id="s1528">Joe Kilberg.</span> <span id="s1529">And he was very good, he was a -- he treated my grandchil -- my chil-children, his grandchildren, like his own grandchildren, you know.</span> <span id="s1530">He loved them to bits and -- unfortunate --</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Yes, very much so, Polish Jew, very much so.</span> <span id="s1535">But he left Poland, you know, well before the war, you know, he must have left Poland in the 20’s, or something like it.</span> <span id="s1536">But I don’t know much about the background, you know.</span> <span id="s1537">I know he didn’t come from Lódz where I come from.</span> <span id="s1538">I know very little about his sons and his ex -- first wife I also know -- he never discussed it, I never asked the question, but I knew there were two boys, you know.</span> <span id="s1539">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Okay, couple more questions.</span> <span id="s1541">You mentioned that you had the opportunity to meet the queen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: And was that in your capacity with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: No.</span> <span id="s1545">Well, it was -- you see, it was funny, because it’s a very, very similar thing that you got here.</span> <span id="s1546">We -- in -- a few years ago the -- the museum, the Holocaust Museum was opened in the Imperial War Museum in London and the quee -- queen was invited to open the museum and when it was finished she was leaving, she was coming across to meet people and the president of the museum, or -- Englishman, that is the -- was involved in the Holocaust Museum, must have said something to her, whispered something, that there are some survivors here, and she came over and she shook hands with us, you know, with a few of us, and I was one of them that she shook hands with me and through my work for the Holocaust Education Trust I was invited to her garden party, that was the second time.</span> <span id="s1547">But years and years ago, quite a long time ago, I was, through the work I was doing for Save the Children Fund, my wife and I were also invited to the garden party.</span> <span id="s1548">But that was a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1549">So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Same queen -- same queen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Same queen, much younger, you know, but same queen.</span> <span id="s1552">No, I -- I -- I felt -- I was honored.</span> <span id="s1553">You know, to meet the head of state, you know, i -- I wouldn’t like to meet Mugabi of -- or people like that, but to meet -- I should call her by the right name, Her Majesty, the Queen, you know, it was a big honor.</span> <span id="s1554">It was a big honor for me to meet Gordon Brown, whatever I think of him or don’t think of him, you know.</span> <span id="s1555">I didn’t tell him whether I’m going to vote for him or not, you know.</span> <span id="s1556">But no, I felt, as a Holocaust survivor, you know, I felt it’s not only I was invited, most -- I was representing the Holocaust survivors, not only me, and I can tell you one thing, I think my two daughters are more proud of the thing.</span> <span id="s1557">Everybody I -- people ring me up and you know and it’s friends of my daughters’.</span> <span id="s1558">Oh, you met the queen, oh, you met -- oh, you’re going to Washington, oh, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: Well tell me more about your work with the Holocaust Education Trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Well, the Holocaust Education Trust is -- was formed, oh about 10 years ago by -- it started by a rabbi, not Holocaust Education Trust, but he decided -- a local rabbi, Barry Markus, in London, and he took a group of people to Auschwitz for the day and then somehow they got together with a group of other people and they decided to form a Holocaust Education Trust, which is a working people, it’s not a -- they work there full time, and what they do, they also teach teachers about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1561">Teachers that have retired, or they want to be in teaching profession any more, and they devote their time for that.</span> <span id="s1562">They do it -- they get paid for it, naturally, otherwise they couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1563">And they do seminars for young people.</span> <span id="s1564">But the Holocaust Education Trust is mainly interest in taking young people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1565">Now that, after that rabbi, Rabbi Barry Markus did that, they decided they would be able -- they can afford to take two groups of children, around 200 people -- there would be like 160 children.</span> <span id="s1566">There’ll be teachers from each school.</span> <span id="s1567">Because it’s not as a school, it’s about 80 schools.</span> <span id="s1568">They take two students from a school, you see, local, in London, plus teachers, plus journalists.</span> <span id="s1569">And they take them just for one day, they go very early in the morning and come back late.</span> <span id="s1570">And they go to Auschwitz, they go to birk -- to Kraków, Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1571">The main thing is Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1572">And they come back and they’ve got the bef -- but, so what I do, or people like me, we come and talk to them, because they know very little about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1573">They know very little about the second World War.</span> <span id="s1574">But now it’s a thing that they’ve got to learn in school, it’s -- it’s a must, it’s not whether they want or not.</span> <span id="s1575">But how much is not -- doesn’t come into it because how much they can just learn one hour in three months about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1576">So they go -- so by doing -- what the Holocaust Education Trust does is they bring them -- they get them together, and they listen to a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1577">Then they get another seminar, then they go to Auschwitz and when they come back they go to write about it, what they thought of it, what they -- the whole thing and they’ve got to send it in to the Holocaust Education Trust, and a panel sits then pick four schools of two children each and they got to come back to the Houses of Parliament or to the House of Lords, here in -- and start presenting their stories, what they think, they’re int -- they’re interviewed, they ask questions, you know, and usually some of the survivors are also there, a few of us.</span> <span id="s1578">And then one of them is voted as ambassadors of the year.</span> <span id="s1579">So what they have to do, they’ve got to go to other local schools and tell them all what they saw, what they heard.</span> <span id="s1580">And being young people I am very much involved in it because I lungya -- I like young people, and I think it’s very, very imporstant they should know what happened, because -- and they are lovely students, most of them.</span> <span id="s1581">I’ve never had any problems, you know?</span> <span id="s1582">It’s as quiet as anything, you know, and I talk to them for about an hour or so and they ask questions and -- you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: What kind of questions do they ask?</span> <span id="s1584">A: Well, all different.</span> <span id="s1585">Some are a bit silly ones, you know, like naturally young people, they want to know whether I met Hitler, you know.</span> <span id="s1586">I haven’t been invited to tea by Hitler, but -- but that th -- one of the main question, it’s always asked is, do I hate the German people.</span> <span id="s1587">And they cannot understand when I tell them no, I do not hate the German people.</span> <span id="s1588">Why should I hate people for -- most probably the people that they think I should hate are not alive today.</span> <span id="s1589">You know, they’re grandparents.</span> <span id="s1590">And most German people are the same as any other people.</span> <span id="s1591">Why should I blame something -- body for what their grandfather did, you know?</span> <span id="s1592">Do I ask me -- do I forgive them?</span> <span id="s1593">Now the people that did it, I haven’t got the right to forgive.</span> <span id="s1594">If there is a God, God can forgive them.</span> <span id="s1595">The others are the people that died can forgive.</span> <span id="s1596">I certainly haven’t got the right to forgive, but I certainly do not hate, and I beg of you, when I talk to them, do not hate.</span> <span id="s1597">Because this is not an answer, to hate.</span> <span id="s1598">You are the one that will suffer if you hate.</span> <span id="s1599">So no, I -- I love the questions.</span> <span id="s1600">Some, like I said, are silly, but some are very [indecipherable] how they -- the usual thing, how did you survive?</span> <span id="s1601">I wish I could tell them.</span> <span id="s1602">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1603">It’s one of those things.</span> <span id="s1604">People that are -- there are some students that are religio -- religious and they, do you think God wanted you to stand -- to stay -- to save you so that you can tell the story?</span> <span id="s1605">I said maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1606">But I feel it’s very important it should be told.</span> <span id="s1607">We’ve got to have awareness of what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Because you know, in another few years there won’t be -- the only thing you’ll be able to do is to read about us, what happened to the people in Europe between 1933 and 1945.</span> <span id="s1610">There won’t be anybody, you know, to substantiate the story.</span> <span id="s1611">So people say well, is it true, is it not, and you can be the one to say, well, I met a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1612">I have been to Auschwitz, I have seen with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s1613">And I feel that’s important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Thank you very much for sharing your story with the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: Well, it was -- it was really -- I don’t know whether pleasure’s the right word, but it was certainly my duty.</span>
