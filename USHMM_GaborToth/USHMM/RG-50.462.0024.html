<p><span id="s18">Q:An interview with Erica Van Adelsberg on December 8, 1981, interviewed by Lucille Fisher.</span> <span id="s19">Perhaps at the beginning you can tell me a little bit about where you were born and when and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A:I was born in Munich in 1928; I am 53.</span> <span id="s21">My parents had lived in Munich and their parents had lived in Munich.</span> <span id="s22">My grandmother actually came, my maternal grandmother came from France and my maternal grandfather came from Augsburg, and we were quite well off.</span> <span id="s23">My maternal grandfather had a factory where they made silverware cutlery and my father’s parents, his father, rather, was in the textile business.</span> <span id="s24">They were manufacturers and then in ‘32, was the Depression, my father’s family lost everything, and with Hitler coming, my father and mother decided to leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q:What made them decide to leave Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A:I think it ...</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q:This was ...</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A:1932.</span> <span id="s29">I think it was probably a combination of things.</span> <span id="s30">It was Hitler, it was the loss of the business, and I guess they had a fear of what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s31">However, they also felt that going to Holland would eliminate any kind of danger, and there they, you know they didn’t look forward enough.</span> <span id="s32">They were willing to leave, to make a move, and, to this day, I really don’t know why they didn’t immediately move to the United States.</span> <span id="s33">I’ve asked and they said they don’t know, they don’t know, they can’t, my father died but ...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q:You were a little bit of a girl then.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A:I was four years old when we moved.</span> <span id="s36">My brother was nine months old.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q:Did your parents ever discuss with you what life was like before they left?</span> <span id="s38">Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s40">I think you would consider them to be part of a sort of an upper middle class.</span> <span id="s41">Everything was terribly proper.</span> <span id="s42">Life was, had a lot of expectations.</span> <span id="s43">My mother was expected to get married at an early age.</span> <span id="s44">She was expected to marry into a family with money.</span> <span id="s45">My father was expected to do well.</span> <span id="s46">I was expected to be nice.</span> <span id="s47">You know, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s48">We had a lot of expectations but it was also a life that was, we were surrounded by beautiful objects.</span> <span id="s49">We had a beautiful apartment in Munich.</span> <span id="s50">I remember that though I was only four when we left.</span> <span id="s51">There was always classical music.</span> <span id="s52">There was always art.</span> <span id="s53">It was sort of a genteel surrounding and even in Holland when things were not that great financially, I remember that.</span> <span id="s54">You know, we always, my parents had art books, my parents had classical music.</span> <span id="s55">This was just part of our life style.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q:Of your life style.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s58">And they traveled, even then.</span> <span id="s59">I know my parents, my mother was 21 when she got married and they went to Italy on their honeymoon.</span> <span id="s60">You know, they traveled.</span> <span id="s61">She was in Portugal.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q:How about their feeling of any antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A:They must have felt it because they left Germany.</span> <span id="s64">Right?</span> <span id="s65">But I don’t think they, in Germany, they themselves had no incidents; nothing happened to them.</span> <span id="s66">They were accepted in school.</span> <span id="s67">My mother was at the conservatory of music.</span> <span id="s68">They themselves didn’t feel it until the ‘30’s when Hitler started.</span> <span id="s69">They were afraid they might be involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q:Did they ever tell you what they were afraid of?</span> <span id="s71">What incidents made them fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A:No, they, no, no.</span> <span id="s73">They were not religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q:How about their parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A:Not a bit.</span> <span id="s76">Not a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q:No identification with the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A:No, no, they were members of a Reform, it was called a liberal synagogue in Germany, but there was really no great emphasis.</span> <span id="s79">There was emphasis on being German much more than being Jewish.</span> <span id="s80">It was an emancipation, you know, the Emancipation, and you didn’t do this because it might be too Jewish or you didn’t do that because it might be too Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q:That was the feeling, and there were no Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A:Yes, there were Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s83">I’m sure that...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q:But they didn’t belong to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A:You mean in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q:Yes, I mean did your family belong to any Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A:That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q:But they did belong to a liberal synagogue.</span> <span id="s89">It would be interesting to speculate what they felt that caused them to pick up and go to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A:I think they knew that in Holland there was a much greater, a much more liberal attitude towards religious freedom, and they just felt that once they were out of Germany, you know, once they crossed the border, Hitler’s influence would disappear.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q:For them.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A:For them.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q:But did they feel that it was a real menace for Germany...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A:They must have felt that it was a menace for Jews because, I’m sure they must have felt very strongly that, combined with the fact that my father’s business failed and it was probably a schande, you see, and so in order to start somewhere they didn’t feel they wanted to invest money in a country where Hitler was running it.</span> <span id="s95">You know, it was [not clear].</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q:So, they left family and...</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A:They left family and very shortly after that the rest of the family also left.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q:Where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A:My mother’s parents to Holland.</span> <span id="s100">My mother’s brother to Portugal.</span> <span id="s101">My father had three brothers.</span> <span id="s102">One went to South Africa where he became director of the opera company in Johannesburg.</span> <span id="s103">The second brother went to London and was very big in textile business.</span> <span id="s104">The third brother went to Rhodesia—a tobacco farm.</span> <span id="s105">My father’s mother went to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q:And this was the early ‘30’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A:In the early ‘30’s and they all stopped in Holland.</span> <span id="s108">That’s why, you know, I remember, all of them stopped in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q:En route?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A:En route, and visited with us from between one week to three months and then went on their merry way.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q:How farsighted they were!</span> <span id="s112">Have you ever discussed this with family, how they were so farsighted to be able to...?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A:Yes, but of all the farsighted ones, my parents were the least farsighted, because they just made a..</span> <span id="s114">.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q:A small leap.</span> <span id="s116">So tell me, did any of the family ever serve in the national army in Germany?</span> <span id="s117">Do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A:Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q:Not that you know of.</span> <span id="s120">Did you say that, when you got to Holland, what happened, where did you go?</span> <span id="s121">To what town?</span> <span id="s122">To what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A:We went to a suburb of Haarlem [Aerdenhoudt], which was like twenty minutes by train from Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s124">It was a nice little suburban area and we moved there next to a family who had moved in from Cologne, Germany, and the husband and my father started a new business in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q:What kind of business was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A:Again, representation of textile manufacturers, rather than manufacturing themselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q:Now before 1940, say the spring of 1940, did you experience any antisemitism in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q:None at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A:I really, I knew I wasn’t Dutch.</span> <span id="s131">I knew that, and I wanted desperately to be one of them, one of the Dutch.</span> <span id="s132">I knew that I was stateless.</span> <span id="s133">Once we moved to Holland, we lost our German citizenship.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q:So you were stateless.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A:So, in 1940 I was like 11 in the spring, and I knew I wanted to be Dutch.</span> <span id="s136">I had not really experienced antisemitism.</span> <span id="s137">I experienced, you know kids say, “Oh, but you are not really Dutch,” or something like that, but not often.</span> <span id="s138">Very seldom.</span> <span id="s139">It was a very pleasant lifestyle.</span> <span id="s140">Very pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q:And that pleasantness lasted until about what?</span> <span id="s142">‘40?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A:1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q:That you felt secure and your family made a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A:Yes, made a living, and it was nice.</span> <span id="s146">There was an awful lot of talk all through the years about what could happen, what could happen.</span> <span id="s147">It was not the greatest feeling of security, no.</span> <span id="s148">I mean I never truly thought about it in terms of security.</span> <span id="s149">But, I don’t think I ever felt terribly secure as a child.</span> <span id="s150">I felt secure as in the family, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s151">But I remember ever since I was a little girl there was always talk about Hitler, and this could happen, and that could happen.</span> <span id="s152">This uncle is leaving and that uncle is leaving.</span> <span id="s153">It was not, it wasn’t a settled kind of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q:So, the statelessness that you described, they kind of left you feeling that you didn’t belong here or there.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q:How did your family life change after the Nazi occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A:Well, drastically.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q:They attacked quickly, didn’t they?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A:Holland was attacked on May 10th, 1940, and it was within five days Holland fell.</span> <span id="s160">O.K. By May 15th we were finished.</span> <span id="s161">Now there was a, we tried, my parents tried to go to England, and I think this attempt lasted at least two hours and you couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s162">So, we knew we were stuck.</span> <span id="s163">So, from the 15th of May on, we knew that things were going to be very, very different.</span> <span id="s164">And then, in September 1940 [EVA later specifies September 9, l940], my family being stateless, was taken by the Germans.</span> <span id="s165">We were told that within 24 hours we had to move from this little suburb, which was right on the North Sea, ten minutes from the North Sea by train, we had to move east, inland.</span> <span id="s166">So we moved, but we didn’t have a place to stay right away and, you know, you asked about family life.</span> <span id="s167">So what happened is my parents stayed in a little pension with a Jewish lady and her husband by the name of Blumenthal.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q:These were Dutch people?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A:These were German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q:German also.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A:Yes, Resi Blumenthal and her husband Reinhardt.</span> <span id="s172">And my brother and I stayed with our former housekeeper.</span> <span id="s173">When we moved to Aerdenhoudt, a little suburb, a German housekeeper moved in with us and she took care of my brother and me for about five years.</span> <span id="s174">So that made it like to ‘37.</span> <span id="s175">Then she got married she moved east of Amsterdam, to Hilversum, and she was there with her husband, a German Jew [EVA later identifies hem as Erna and Rudi Asch].</span> <span id="s176">And when we had to move to this particular town, she took my brother and me, and my parents went ten minutes down the road to this little pension where they had a room.</span> <span id="s177">So, for half a year we lived like that.</span> <span id="s178">So, it was a big change.</span> <span id="s179">Once in a while we would eat with our parents.</span> <span id="s180">Like on a Sunday, we would have a meal, you know, something would happen and finally, my parents rented a house in this community and we had a..</span> <span id="s181">.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q:Was your father able to earn a living during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A:He was still able to go to Amsterdam because it was as close from that place to Amsterdam as it was from the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q:So that he could run his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q:He could run his business.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A:I went to school there.</span> <span id="s188">By then I was in 7th grade and it was the first time that I did have antisemitic experience.</span> <span id="s189">With my math teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q:A Dutch man?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A:A Dutch math teacher and he failed me for being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q:How do you know that he failed you for being Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A:Because I did all the work.</span> <span id="s194">I was no great mathematician, but he would always grade me lower than other people who did the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q:Did you feel that there were many Dutch who were antisemitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A:Very, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q:Very, very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A:He was the only one, he and a French teacher.</span> <span id="s199">I don’t even know that she was truly antisemitic.</span> <span id="s200">She was just very nasty, and I had a horrible time for a while.</span> <span id="s201">And then, you know, I got over that and I did all right in her class but the math teacher, he was very rough on me.</span> <span id="s202">And I was really no great math student, but I was not that terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q:But the other Dutch people were...</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A:Wonderful, absolutely wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q:Did you have any experiences with Nazis or Nazi sympathizers?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A:Not then, not at that time that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q:Do you recall a Jewish Council being set up or any sort of...</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A:I know there was a big Jewish organization set up and the name escapes me [Joodse Raad, February 1941],but you know, I have books if you are interested in Dutch, of the destruction of the Dutch Jews and there are photos of that in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q:I would love to see them sometime.</span> <span id="s210">Are they books that came from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A:Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q:You brought them with you from Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A:I didn’t.</span> <span id="s214">I found out when I was in Israel that I’m in the book three times.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q:Oh my, I would love to see them and perhaps there’s parts of them that we could photostat for our archives, if they have any meaning to Dr. Levin [Professor Nora Levin of Gratz College, founder of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive.]</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A:You’re welcome to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q:O.</span> <span id="s218">K. I’ll have to connect with you, I’ll pick them up from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A:I have them here.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q:Oh, you have them here.</span> <span id="s221">Great.</span> <span id="s222">That’s great.</span> <span id="s223">Are there any, now that we are talking about it, are there any mementos of the family that might bear xeroxing, that would have significance for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A:I don’t know whether my mother has anything.</span> <span id="s225">I don’t think my brother has anything.</span> <span id="s226">I have a book of poetry that I brought that I wrote.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q:That you wrote?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q:When did you write it, Erica?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A:When I was in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q:Oh, I’d love to.</span> <span id="s232">Did you bring that along too?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q:You’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s235">Will you leave it with me?</span> <span id="s236">Can we xerox what we want?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A:You can xerox if you want, if you can understand it.</span> <span id="s238">It’s in Dutch, or in German, I forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q:That’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A:And I brought the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q:You brought the star.</span> <span id="s242">When did you have to begin to wear the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A:I don’t know.</span> <span id="s244">‘41, I think, but I truly, I forget.</span> <span id="s245">[Beginning May 3, 1942 every Jew aged six years or older had to wear the yellow badge.]</span> <span id="s246">I know it was before we went to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s247">Because I know that I had to sew it on my coat to go, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q:Do you remember how you felt when you had to put that on?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A:No.</span> <span id="s250">I know I didn’t feel terrible because a lot of people wore them and a lot of Dutch people put them on.</span> <span id="s251">It was sort of a defiant thing.</span> <span id="s252">A lot of Dutch people would wear them.</span> <span id="s253">In the beginning, not later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q:To come back to this Jewish Council or the community body, did Jews in your community look to that Council for leadership, guidance?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s256">I forget the name.</span> <span id="s257">I have to look that up.</span> <span id="s258">[Joodes Raad] Yes, they did look for leadership.</span> <span id="s259">They did look for leadership, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q:And did they trust it?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A:Yes, because, you know, I think this is why all these horrible things happened to us is because people were much too trusting.</span> <span id="s262">People were sheep.</span> <span id="s263">In 24 hours you had to move, in 24 hours people moved.</span> <span id="s264">There was no resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q:But we’re talking about the Jewish Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A:The Jewish Council, well, people knew after a while that they were working with the Germans, in part.</span> <span id="s267">They had to work with the Germans, but they trusted it.</span> <span id="s268">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q:There was no resentment?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A:Yes, there was a lot of resentment.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q:Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A:I don’t even know about individuals, but you know you got to hear that so and so is on the Council or he is a rich Jew, he has all the diamond business.</span> <span id="s273">But that was all along.</span> <span id="s274">It was the Jews who had connections.</span> <span id="s275">It was called “protection” and they picked that up in Israel after the war and called “protektsia.”</span> <span id="s276">Those that had it, that have this connection, they were able to save their skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q:Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A:To certain degree.</span> <span id="s279">I know my father, when we were, running now ahead, you know, when we were in Westerbork which was a Dutch concentration camp, my father had to work on some job where he had to be in an office, a German, you know a Kommandant, was in charge of this whole operation, and because my father was very precise, which most German Jews probably were, you know, when we had to go in front of the Kommandant in June ‘42, June ‘44, June ‘42, excuse me, he said no, we could stay in Westerbork, and it was because my father had done a good job.</span> <span id="s280">Had he not done a good job, we would have been sent to Auschwitz in June 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q:This way you weren’t.</span> <span id="s282">I better change this tape.</span> <span id="s283">[Side one ends before tape is fully used.]</span> <span id="s284">Tape 1 of 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q:This is tape #1, side #2 of an interview with Erica Van Adelsberg on December 8, 1981, interviewed by Lucille Fisher.</span> <span id="s286">[Long interval before interview resumes, approximately 1/4 of the tape.]</span> <span id="s287">Do you mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A:No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q:So, anyway, your family were feeling, did they feel then that they were going to try to emigrate and go someplace else?</span> <span id="s290">Was there that kind of feeling, then, when this was happening, or wasn’t this in their mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A:When?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q:In Holland, when things were closing in.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A:Yes, well, then, they would have liked to but it was too late.</span> <span id="s294">There was absolutely no way of getting out.</span> <span id="s295">Then they knew they were stuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q:Well, now, tell me, did you know anything about the experience of the Jews in other parts of Europe?</span> <span id="s297">How did you get to meet them?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A:I knew, for instance, that neighbors of ours in Aerdenhoudt left in ‘38 on a boat.</span> <span id="s299">I think it was called “Simon Bolivar” and I knew that the boat hit a mine in the English Channel and I knew that the wife survived and that the husband...</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q:Where were they going?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A:They were going to England, or possibly from England to the United States but, whatever, they got out in ‘38.</span> <span id="s302">I knew others who got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q:From Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A:Yeah, I mean these people died, all right.</span> <span id="s305">The wife survived and the children and husband died.</span> <span id="s306">We knew that.</span> <span id="s307">We knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q:But did you know about the experiences of Jews in Poland and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q:Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A:No, I didn’t really.</span> <span id="s312">I knew about Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s313">We did hear about that.</span> <span id="s314">That was ‘39 [1938].</span> <span id="s315">November 9th, that we knew about.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q:How did you get the news?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A:By radio and by, you know, people telling this.</span> <span id="s318">But I truly can’t say that I was aware of Polish Jews and Russian Jews and Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s319">I was not even a teenager at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q:Do you recall newspapers at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A:Yes, we used to read the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q:Was there anything in the newspapers about?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A:I can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q:Of course you were a little girl, a young girl but did you get any feeling from your family that they were really fully able to accept the reality that all over Europe, Jews were being murdered and gassed, and things like this were happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A:I don’t think people knew that there were gas chambers.</span> <span id="s326">Who knew about gas chambers?</span> <span id="s327">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s328">We never knew about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s329">We knew that we were being sent to Auschwitz, but we didn’t know that Auschwitz had gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q:What did you think it was?</span> <span id="s331">What was your conception?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A:You might get killed on the way.</span> <span id="s333">You might get starved.</span> <span id="s334">You might get beaten to death.</span> <span id="s335">You might be tortured, but you didn’t know which way you were going to be tortured.</span> <span id="s336">I never knew that.</span> <span id="s337">Nobody knew that.</span> <span id="s338">How did you know it here?</span> <span id="s339">You didn’t know there were gas chambers till after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q:Yes, you’re right.</span> <span id="s341">Well, tell me about the deportation, for your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A:We were in Hilversum, which was this...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q:How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A:H-I-L-V-E-R-S-U-M.</span> <span id="s345">It’s a middle size, a nice size town.</span> <span id="s346">It had four radio stations, a very pretty town, and, again, it was the German Jews who were told, and it was again 24 hours, pack up, you are going to, I don’t know what they called it, a detention center, or something.</span> <span id="s347">So we did.</span> <span id="s348">We packed up and it was extremely cold.</span> <span id="s349">So cold, that I remember that the toilet was frozen and I do remember that the rabbi from the Portuguese synagogue came to the station to say good-bye to me.</span> <span id="s350">This I remember.</span> <span id="s351">He was our neighbor and he had always been very fond of me.</span> <span id="s352">His name was Rodriguez-Pereira.</span> <span id="s353">He came, and that just stuck with me, okay, that the rabbi, and he was the Chief Rabbi in Holland, of the Sephardic.</span> <span id="s354">And we went on a train, and this was a regular coach.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q:Coach?</span> <span id="s356">The Germans put you on a coach?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A:Yes, there were maybe 60, 80, 100 others.</span> <span id="s358">I don’t know how many there were from this little town, and we took this train ride.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q:Did they tell you where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A:And they said we were going to Westerbork, and they told us where it was.</span> <span id="s361">It was in the northeastern part of Holland, and it was in January, and it was very, very cold, and I wore a lot of clothes.</span> <span id="s362">And I remember my father introduced me, met somebody on the train as we walked through, and he introduced me to another young girl and she was the same age, but three weeks difference and her name was Jo and we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s363">Until this day we’re very good friends.</span> <span id="s364">And this was my first friend in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s365">And all people who had children kept the children except for two and it was me and she and we had to live in the barracks for women because we were just over thirteen.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q:So you were separated from your parents when you got to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A:My brother was with my parents, but Jo and I were separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q:When you got to the concentration camp, was there any procedure there that?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A:Yes, when we got there we got food and we were told to register, you know, very orderly, and it was not a bit scary, I thought.</span> <span id="s370">I remember...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q:Did your parents get scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A:I didn’t ask them.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q:But you didn’t get a sense of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A:My parents were always worried.</span> <span id="s375">My mother was always worried.</span> <span id="s376">So, she was worried.</span> <span id="s377">It was a sort of fait accompli.</span> <span id="s378">I had accepted that.</span> <span id="s379">There’s always worry.</span> <span id="s380">And my father, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s381">They managed reasonably well and they did what they, you know, they were very, they were, sheep.</span> <span id="s382">You know, you had to register, so they registered; you had to drink coffee, so they drank coffee; they had to go to the left, they stood left.</span> <span id="s383">They did everything they were told to do, so they were conformists.</span> <span id="s384">You know, they did what they were supposed to.</span> <span id="s385">But I remember that a young man came, and he was much older than me, he was 20 or 22 years old, so he was really...</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q:An older man.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A:An older man, and he told me that there was a youth group in the camp, and I immediately took a liking to him and his name was Leo Blumensohn and he did have a youth group.</span> <span id="s388">And I thought it was going to be great fun and it was.</span> <span id="s389">It was great fun!</span> <span id="s390">Can you believe?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q:No, I can’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A:This was before the transports started.</span> <span id="s393">The people who were in this camp so far were illegal immigrants from Germany who had crossed the border in ‘37, ‘38, ‘39, ‘40, ‘41.</span> <span id="s394">They were there for years and years.</span> <span id="s395">Maybe 500, 600, a thousand, all German...</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q:Not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A:All Jewish.</span> <span id="s398">But they had been stuck in this camp first by the Dutch—they had been put there by the Dutch—and the Germans left them there.</span> <span id="s399">So they were referred to as “Alte Camp Insassen,” “old campers,” and when we came we were the first contingent of new ones and they were delighted to see us, you know.</span> <span id="s400">And they made such a welcome for us and there was no talk about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s401">Nothing.</span> <span id="s402">The whole idea was we were being detained in Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q:What did you take with you to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A:One suitcase a piece.</span> <span id="s405">Winter clothes, some summer clothes, some toilet articles, a couple of books, maybe some writing material.</span> <span id="s406">Maybe my mother took some medicines and, I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q:But all of your family possessions you left behind, your furniture and all.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A:Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q:And what happened to that, you have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A:It was stored by gentile friends and we got it back after the war.</span> <span id="s411">Not all of it, but most of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q:So, was there,</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q:tell me about the conditions of life in Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A:The first half year was, it was really not bad.</span> <span id="s415">I lived in this barracks with the women, but I ate at my parents’.</span> <span id="s416">They had a room in a two-room apartment, which was a long barracks divided into two-room apartments.</span> <span id="s417">And then finally we moved into another barracks where we had a bigger room and we had all four of us in this one room.</span> <span id="s418">So then I moved out...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q:Did they do their own cooking or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A:We could do our own cooking and, also, we got from the camp, we got fed.</span> <span id="s421">Like, when I was in the barracks, we always got our coffee in the morning, and the bread, they brought it over.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q:This was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A:1942.</span> <span id="s424">January to June, July.</span> <span id="s425">It’s all before July 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q:And what cooking you did, they were allowed to go out and buy food?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A:You got food rations, and from that you could make things.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q:But money, you didn’t have?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A:No, you didn’t get paid money, but you could still go to Amsterdam once in a while.</span> <span id="s430">I got permission to go for a weekend to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s431">And I remember, I went to Amsterdam and then I went back to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q:How amazing.</span> <span id="s433">And your parents could go off if they wanted to?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A:I don’t know whether they were able to go more than once, but I did.</span> <span id="s435">I went once.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q:Did you work in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A:Not in the first half year.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q:Your parents either?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A:Yes, my father did office work.</span> <span id="s440">That’s what he did, and my mother, she must have done something.</span> <span id="s441">I do not remember what she did.</span> <span id="s442">[Telephone interruption]</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q:So, you went to school?</span> <span id="s444">What kind of schooling did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A:It was in German, because the kids who had lived there for several years they all came from Germany, and they didn’t know much Dutch.</span> <span id="s446">And it was in a little school house and the teacher’s name was Mr. Gabel...</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q:A little school house in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A:Yes, a little room.</span> <span id="s449">Really, like a little schoolhouse and we had lessons in German, we had lessons in, and then because there were some Dutch speaking one of them taught us about cosmetology, I remember we had lessons in cosmetology and textiles.</span> <span id="s450">I was thirteen.</span> <span id="s451">We had lessons in English, we had some English lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q:How about Hebrew or Jewish content?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A:No, not in school.</span> <span id="s454">That was the youth group.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q:There was a youth group that taught this?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A:Yes, the youth group met on Saturday afternoons and there are pictures in the books on that.</span> <span id="s457">We used to do a lot of hora dancing and we used to have a lot of intellectual discussions on Saturday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q:Do you feel that this was Israeli-inspired or Zionist-inspired groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q:You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s462">But also there was a much more traditional Judaism than I had ever experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q:What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A:I was not brought up with any kind of religious background.</span> <span id="s465">I mean, I went to Sunday school to learn a little bit and I went to the synagogue once in a while, but, it was much more Orthodox-oriented than I’d ever been exposed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q:The Jewish spirit?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A:Yes, and we studied the holidays and we observed the holidays and we prayed and it was really, you know, it was the works.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q:Did you enjoy that?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A:I loved it.</span> <span id="s470">My parents thought it was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q:But you felt strengthened from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A:I felt tremendous.</span> <span id="s473">I mean this really gave me a lot of strength.</span> <span id="s474">I had my prayer book in Belsen and I used to say the prayers and I used to remember all of the people that I was with who by then most of them had been killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s475">But I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s476">I knew they were sent to Auschwitz, but I didn’t know whether they would have made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q:Did you get a feeling for Zionism, then?</span> <span id="s478">Did you hear about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A:Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q:And, your parents kind of pooh-poohed it, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A:I was called a rebbitsin [rabbi’s wife] and they pooh-poohed it.</span> <span id="s482">And they thought it was pretty hairy...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q:Pretty tacky, huh?</span> <span id="s484">So, what about an underground?</span> <span id="s485">At that point you didn’t know that there was an underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A:No, I was never involved in an underground.</span> <span id="s487">There was no such thing as far as I know in Westerbork, an underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q:But did you have an underground in Holland at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A:I know that...later on I learned that my, Martin (who I was married to) had been in the underground, but I hadn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q:Uh huh!</span> <span id="s491">So, here you are in Westerbork and you are going to school and learning to be Jewish and your family are working and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A:And then in July, things changed drastically.</span> <span id="s493">Suddenly the men were called from whatever they were doing to build barracks, because we were told more people were coming, and they did come in droves.</span> <span id="s494">And, then, the old campers were called in, as I told you, and some were sent up right away but most were not.</span> <span id="s495">Most were able to stay.</span> <span id="s496">A group that was sent was a group that...</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q:Sent to...</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A:Sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s499">O.K. I was for a while in the women’s barracks.</span> <span id="s500">I was with a group of orphans from Utrecht, German-born orphans, and it was a very nice group and, again, they were all brought up very Orthodox and I learned [unclear] when I associated with them, and I was considered part of the group because I wasn’t living at home.</span> <span id="s501">This group, as a unit, was all sent to Auschwitz, with the first transfer.</span> <span id="s502">And that was my first realization that...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q:Did you know they were being sent to something...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A:We knew they were being sent to something horrible, but we didn’t know what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q:How did you escape it if you were with this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A:Because I wasn’t an orphan.</span> <span id="s507">I was registered as a child of Margo and Walter.</span> <span id="s508">My living quarters were for awhile with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q:Did your health, was your family’s health good, was it considered good in the camps.</span> <span id="s510">Did you ever get medical treatment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A:Yes, once.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q:Tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A:In Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A:Medical.</span> <span id="s516">Yes I had, I don’t know what I had, like a sleeping sickness.</span> <span id="s517">I think I must have had mononucleosis because I couldn’t stay up and awake.</span> <span id="s518">I kept falling asleep and they put me in the hospital.</span> <span id="s519">And I do remember Leo Blumensohn was my first visitor, and I was sure he was in love with me!</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q:How about the medical treatment at the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A:It was, what did I know?</span> <span id="s522">It was fine.</span> <span id="s523">It was Jewish doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q:Jewish doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A:Oh yes.</span> <span id="s526">We had our own hospital.</span> <span id="s527">We had our own orchestra.</span> <span id="s528">We had everything, before July.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q:Then tell me about in July.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A:So then they started with the transports and that meant that every week, Tuesday and Friday, people were sent to Auschwitz, and every week people would come in, and masses and masses and masses and the next Tuesday half of them would be shipped out or three-quarters of them would be shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q:You didn’t know how they made the selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A:The selection was made simply if they had no papers to show that they were sponsored, that they had the passport of Paraguay, which many of them did.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q:What is that, Erica?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A:You could buy a passport from South American countries.</span> <span id="s535">Some people, many Jews did that.</span> <span id="s536">So, how can you ship away Paraguay nationals?</span> <span id="s537">You can ship away stateless but not Paraguayans.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q:I see, but your family were not able to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A:We weren’t Paraguayans, but we had our own little papers, which a lot of people did, too.</span> <span id="s540">We had an affidavit to go to Israel which an aunt in Israel sent, from Israel.</span> <span id="s541">That saved us, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q:So, then, how long did you go on...?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A:In Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A:From, we got there in January ‘42 and we left in February ‘43.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q:Where did you leave for?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A:Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q:And, tell me about how you were selected to go there and what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A:It got so that anybody whom they could send, they sent to Auschwitz, O.K.?</span> <span id="s550">They just kept sending people to Auschwitz more and more and more; because we had the special papers, they couldn’t send us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s551">Since they started decreasing the numbers in Westerbork, we were then picked to go to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s552">I must tell you that when these people came in masses, my mother had to start working as a Baracken Leiterin, you know, to be in charge of barracks.</span> <span id="s553">She was in charge of the women’s side and a guy was in charge of the men’s side.</span> <span id="s554">So, she came home one day and she told me she was going to be Baracken Leiterin, and a man is coming over to meet her.</span> <span id="s555">He just came from Amsterdam, and he is Hungarian.</span> <span id="s556">So, he came in, very attractive, very charming, and after he left, I said to my mother, “You better watch out.”</span> <span id="s557">Thirteen!</span> <span id="s558">I’m pretty mature.</span> <span id="s559">“I think he likes you.”</span> <span id="s560">Well, this is my stepfather now.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q:Oh, for pity’s sake, this was the man she eventually married after...</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A:What happened was that she fell in love with him and he fell in love with her.</span> <span id="s563">He was married, she was married, and after the war, when they met...He was shipped to Buchenwald, she was sent to Bergen-Belsen, so they were separated.</span> <span id="s564">After the war, when we all got back to Hol...</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Tape 2 of 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q:This is tape #2, side #1 of an interview with Erica Van Adelsberg on December 8, 1981, interviewed by Lucille Fisher.</span> <span id="s567">I think that we didn’t watch the timing on that other tape too well, so, you were talking about your mother eventually divorcing your father and how did that go?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A:I think what I was saying on the other tape was that after the war, when we all returned—his wife had died; she died about four days before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s569">She was on her way to Denmark, and the bus, or the car, or whatever mode of transportation she was in, was bombed and she was killed.</span> <span id="s570">His name is Eugene Por.</span> <span id="s571">In Hungarian, Jeno Por.</span> <span id="s572">He and my mother finally did get married.</span> <span id="s573">She came to the United States; he did, too.</span> <span id="s574">She divorced my father and married him, but she stayed very friendly with my father, who subsequently also married but who died very young.</span> <span id="s575">He was 58 when he died in 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q:Tell me, as a Hungarian, how did your stepfather get to Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A:He got to Westerbork because he had lived in Hungary, then in Vienna, and then moved to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s578">He was picked up as a Hungarian Jew.</span> <span id="s579">As a matter of fact, he had tried to escape this by being baptized and it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s580">A lot of Hungarian Jews did that.</span> <span id="s581">They got baptized, thinking they were automatically Catholic, and Judaism was wiped out, but it didn’t work that way.</span> <span id="s582">I must tell you that after the transports started the school sessions stopped, especially for those of us who were thirteen or older, and we were required to do some work.</span> <span id="s583">And I had a friend who was a lab technician.</span> <span id="s584">She was in charge of a lab.</span> <span id="s585">Her name was Gisa Wall [born Gisa Wolf].</span> <span id="s586">She was from Vienna and she was very charming.</span> <span id="s587">As a matter of fact, she got married in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s588">I was at the wedding and one of the poems in the little book is about them getting married.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q:When there was a wedding in Westerbork, how did that happen?</span> <span id="s590">Did you need permission?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A:I don’t know about that.</span> <span id="s592">I know they got married and...</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q:By a rabbi?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A:I don’t remember whether it was a rabbi or a civil ceremony, but they did get married and her husband’s name is Harold Wall.</span> <span id="s595">[In Europe, Horst Cohen married Gisa Wolf.</span> <span id="s596">Names changed in U.S. to Harold and Gisa Wall.]</span> <span id="s597">I think it was something else in German.</span> <span id="s598">And they moved to California after the war.</span> <span id="s599">At any rate, because she was a lab technician, I was able to get a job in the lab that she was heading, and I was trained at age not even 14 to be a lab technician.</span> <span id="s600">I learned to do urine analysis, and I learned to do blood testing, and after a while I was sent around the hospital taking blood from patients’ fingers and to think that I was able to do that at fourteen seems, quite amazing.</span> <span id="s601">I enjoyed that work.</span> <span id="s602">It was with doctors and with other lab people and it was a good job.</span> <span id="s603">It was considered a very good job.</span> <span id="s604">And I stayed with that til we went to Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q:Your parents kept on with their...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A:My parents kept on with their work and my brother did go to some sort of a school program at times.</span> <span id="s607">It wasn’t very regular.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q:But there was no cruelty, no beatings, no anything that identifies a concentration camp going on to the Jews at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A:I can only speak for our family.</span> <span id="s610">There was nothing as far as we were concerned.</span> <span id="s611">I know that in the barracks where my parents worked, it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s612">Where my mother and Jeno worked it was very crowded, and there were some altercations between people, between Jews themselves.</span> <span id="s613">I don’t know whether the Germans actually came in and did anything.</span> <span id="s614">Not as far as I know.</span> <span id="s615">I’m sure when the transports left on Tuesday and Thursday there was pushing and shoving, at least.</span> <span id="s616">I mean, there may have been more, but I did not go to those.</span> <span id="s617">I did, at one point, go, get up on a Tuesday morning very, very early, like at 4:00 in the morning, because a friend was to be shipped to Auschwitz, and he was alone and his name, I think, was Abie or Abbie Abram, and I was very, very fond of him and I brought him food to take on this trip and I did see him and this was one of the very few times that I actually went to the train early in the morning to see people.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q:And that train came right into the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A:Yes, there was a railroad track that ran right into...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q:Were they frightened when they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A:Yes, they were petrified.</span> <span id="s622">You would be, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q:Of course.</span> <span id="s624">So, you think they had some idea that they were going to something pretty horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A:Yes, because most of the time the trains were not regular trains with window seats and windows.</span> <span id="s626">These were cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q:Did the people who knew they were going in the transport ever think at any time about escaping?</span> <span id="s628">Was there any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A:I’m sure they all thought about it but, you see the camp was surrounded with very high barbed wire fences, and there were outposts all over with Germans and machine guns, so there wasn’t that much.</span> <span id="s630">There was probably an escape attempt here and there, but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s631">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s632">I remember one in Belsen, but I don’t remember one in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s633">I also think that I have blocked out so much that I don’t remember because of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q:I can understand that.</span> <span id="s635">It was such a frightening, horrible experience, because you talk about it living in such an unnatural situation, so, naturally, that I can well believe that you must have blocked out a good bit of it.</span> <span id="s636">So now, these transports are going.</span> <span id="s637">The people who had hunks of papers that permitted them to stay felt relatively safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A:They felt that time was on their side, because the longer you were in Westerbork the better off you were.</span> <span id="s639">But as time went on, and they cleaned out the cities in Holland, and the Jews were moved east to Auschwitz, there were fewer and fewer left, and that is what happened.</span> <span id="s640">Finally they got to the people with all the papers and, instead of sending them to Auschwitz, they sent them to places like Theresienstadt and to Bergen-Belsen and other places.</span> <span id="s641">My friend Jo she went to Theresienstadt, after which she went to Auschwitz, after which I saw her again in Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q:What made a person be selected for Theresienstadt and then moved and then moved again?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A:I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q:No rhyme or reason that you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A:No.</span> <span id="s646">Theresienstadt was supposed to be less threatening, less horrendous than Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s647">Everything was better than Auschwitz, and so maybe what they did...I don’t know, but I suppose that they may not have had enough room for everybody at once to Theresienstadt, so they gave the impression that you were going to something that was a little better, and then when they had room in Auschwitz when they...you know, they would ship them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s648">This is conjecture.</span> <span id="s649">I do not know.</span> <span id="s650">I know that people going to Theresienstadt felt that they were better off than going to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q:Your parents in their particular job at the camp, did that make them feel any more secure?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A:Up to a point.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q:And then?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A:And then we were selected to go to Belsen because we had the papers, the affidavits for Israel, so...</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q:How did that tie up with going to Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A:Belsen was a camp where they had people with all different kinds of papers as I told you, the Paraguay passports, the Israel affidavits, and, I don’t know what else.</span> <span id="s657">All sorts of exceptions.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q:So that’s what qualified you for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q:And how long did you know in advance you were going, or did they just come and say tomorrow...?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A:I don’t know, maybe a day or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q:Maybe a day or two.</span> <span id="s663">So, you got your things together and you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A:Yes, we went, and that was February 15th, 1944.</span> <span id="s665">We went to Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q:Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A:Belsen is in North Germany.</span> <span id="s668">It is not too far from Hannover, which is not too far from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s669">It is in the northwestern part of Germany.</span> <span id="s670">It is flat, very flat country, as was Westerbork.</span> <span id="s671">It was not a very long ride.</span> <span id="s672">I don’t remember—six hours, seven hours.</span> <span id="s673">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s674">And this was not in cattle trains.</span> <span id="s675">This was in a regular coach.</span> <span id="s676">And we went there and when we got there we were greeted by the people in charge at the section of Belsen where we were going to be.</span> <span id="s677">Belsen was gigantic and different sections were surrounded by barbed wire so one section of the camp couldn’t go to the other section.</span> <span id="s678">We were...</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q:When you say gigantic, how gigantic?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A:Maybe, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s681">More than 50,000.</span> <span id="s682">I’m guessing, but I would imagine that at one point that was possible.</span> <span id="s683">Maybe a little less, but it went on.</span> <span id="s684">But it was enormous.</span> <span id="s685">O.K.</span> <span id="s686">But it was not all Jewish.</span> <span id="s687">There were Polish criminals, there were Gypsies, there was a section of Hungarian Jews.</span> <span id="s688">We were in a Jewish section and top dogs in that section were Greek.</span> <span id="s689">They were Greek Jews from Salonica and they were in charge.</span> <span id="s690">They were the big machers.</span> <span id="s691">Why?</span> <span id="s692">Because they were there first.</span> <span id="s693">So you had to be very friendly with them, and I remember there was a woman that was the milk lady.</span> <span id="s694">She gave milk to children and teenagers and pregnant women, of whom there were very few, but you had to speak to her, and you had to do it in French.</span> <span id="s695">“Madame, s’il vous plait, un peu de lait.”</span> <span id="s696">And she would say, “Oui, oui,” or, “Non,” or whatever and you would say, “Un peu, a little bit, a little bit,” and she would say, “Demain, tomorrow come back,” or she would say, “All right, today.”</span> <span id="s697">But that is where I did a lot of speaking, you know, you had to speak French, in that part of the camp, because the Greeks were in charge and they spoke Ladino and they spoke Greek and many of them spoke French.</span> <span id="s698">Then, they had Jews coming into that section from Tripoli and Africa.</span> <span id="s699">Why, I don’t know, because that was Italian and the Italians shipped them, and those people were pretty cold.</span> <span id="s700">Because they had never been in a cold climate.</span> <span id="s701">So they didn’t have to do much for them to die.</span> <span id="s702">All they had to do was not give them enough warm clothing.</span> <span id="s703">So this was a very international section of Belsen.</span> <span id="s704">They did not have gas chambers.</span> <span id="s705">They had work kommandos and work groups.</span> <span id="s706">I worked every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q:What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A:Different kinds of work.</span> <span id="s709">At one point, I was in charge of children in a day care center as it were.</span> <span id="s710">People would have little children, and mothers would work and I would be babysitter.</span> <span id="s711">Ten, twenty, thirty, whatever number.</span> <span id="s712">At another point in time, I was in a factory.</span> <span id="s713">We made some sort of material for the war effort, for the Germans.</span> <span id="s714">It was plastic piping that had to be woven in a certain way.</span> <span id="s715">It was like braided in five different ways, and I truly don’t know what it was for, but it went on for hours and hours we had to sit and do the braiding.</span> <span id="s716">Those were my main jobs.</span> <span id="s717">You worked all day.</span> <span id="s718">And at that time I was 15, and the barracks were lousy.</span> <span id="s719">They were cold in the winter and very hot in the summer.</span> <span id="s720">It was triple deckers.</span> <span id="s721">And they got so crowded that you had to have two in a bed.</span> <span id="s722">At that point, there was a lot of disease because of lice, and a lot of people had typhoid.</span> <span id="s723">I had it twice.</span> <span id="s724">I had one case that was called para-typhoid and at the end of the war, after we were freed by the Russians, I had typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s725">I also had jaundice.</span> <span id="s726">I had that twice.</span> <span id="s727">So that was life in Belsen which was much less...</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q:You were not with your parents then...?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A:I was living with my mother and my brother, and my father was in a barracks for me.</span> <span id="s730">They separated men and women.</span> <span id="s731">There wasn’t much family life.</span> <span id="s732">I mean, you did get together for meals once in a while, and they would bring in the big containers, and the main staple was turnips.</span> <span id="s733">Every day we would have turnips, once a day.</span> <span id="s734">We did get some soup the second meal, and in the morning, some sort of coffee substitute, Ersatz, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q:Was it sanitary?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A:Sanitary to a certain degree.</span> <span id="s737">We went to bathhouses and they would turn on the water and you would take showers, hot water, and this was maybe once every so often.</span> <span id="s738">I don’t even remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q:And what about the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A:There were long lines with sinks and toilets.</span> <span id="s741">No, toilets were outhouses.</span> <span id="s742">But they had bathrooms with sinks and you could wash there.</span> <span id="s743">But I remember very often in the coldest winter months that we would use the coffee instead of to drink it to wash ourselves because it was hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q:And your mother and father did what kind of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A:My mother was in charge of a barracks there, too, and my father—he had all sorts of jobs and I do not remember exactly what he did.</span> <span id="s746">But I know it was a hard physical labor at one point.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q:Was there any thread of Jewish life existing there at any...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A:Yes, there was.</span> <span id="s749">We would have our little meetings which were, you know, outgrowth of this youth group in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s750">We would have that once in a while but it wasn’t as often.</span> <span id="s751">It wasn’t as nice.</span> <span id="s752">I know one group would make little matzos for Passover.</span> <span id="s753">They got some milk, I mean not milk, but some flour and water, and they would make little matzos over the fire, but it was really a nothing.</span> <span id="s754">There were no services, there were no meetings, not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q:And family and friends, did any of them ever turn up?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A:Well, my father was in the same camp.</span> <span id="s757">He was just in the men’s barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q:No, people from the other camp, people that you had known in Holland, did you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s760">Once in a while, say, when another transport came—actually from Westerbork I only remember that there were two or three after us, and that was it.</span> <span id="s761">And so yes, people would turn up and you would see each other.</span> <span id="s762">And a lot of them would die, you would be aware, you know.</span> <span id="s763">They died because of starvation and because of lack of medical facilities and because of lack of will to live, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q:Well, when you came down with the para-typhoid and the jaundice, were you given medical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A:No, not in Belsen.</span> <span id="s768">I was sick with the para-typhoid for weeks and weeks and weeks.</span> <span id="s769">Maybe 7, 8 weeks.</span> <span id="s770">As a matter of fact, after that was done, very close to the end of my illness, we were at the end of the war practically and we were told to move out of the camp and go on another train, which was supposed to go to Auschwitz, and I had to walk, and I remember that, 7 kilometers, after I had lost a lot of weight and I was extremely sick, and I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q:Was the news seeping down into Belsen about what was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A:To a certain extent.</span> <span id="s773">We had a lot of bombardments around the area.</span> <span id="s774">Not in the camp, although at one point a British plane strayed and did hit the camp a little bit.</span> <span id="s775">It killed one woman and she was standing next to me.</span> <span id="s776">Next to me.</span> <span id="s777">As close as you stand to me.</span> <span id="s778">She was hit and I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q:You can well wonder why.</span> <span id="s780">Were you guarded by Germans in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A:Yes, constantly.</span> <span id="s782">My grandparents were also in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q:Oh, tell me about your grandparents.</span> <span id="s784">They had gone to...</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A:My grandparents had come to Holland and they stayed in Amsterdam much longer than my parents and my brother and I, but they finally were sent to Westerbork and they came with us to Belsen.</span> <span id="s786">I believe we all came together.</span> <span id="s787">My grandfather died of a heart attack in June ‘44.</span> <span id="s788">My grandmother held on pretty well.</span> <span id="s789">At one point did not have to go to the Appel, which was the morning call where you had to line up five in a row, and so she was exempt from that because she was over 65, or whatever the age was, and so she could stay in bed, and I remember very clearly that I, on a very cold morning, hid under her covers not to go outside and an S.S. came in and he pulled the covers from her and there I was, and he could have done all sorts of things, and I just gave him a little smile and said that I wouldn’t do it any more and he let me go.</span> <span id="s790">But that was pretty risky.</span> <span id="s791">But, then, you did a lot of things that were pretty risky.</span> <span id="s792">But this was one of them.</span> <span id="s793">But grandmother did get very sick and towards the end was really bedridden and you could see that she did not have much longer to go and she also went on the train that we went on to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s794">This was in April 1945 and she died three days before the end, before we were freed.</span> <span id="s795">She died the day after President Roosevelt died and we got the news that he died and she knew it and after he died, she died.</span> <span id="s796">It was just before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q:Do you make any connection between his death and her death?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A:Yes, to a certain degree, because he was her hero and she always...</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q:Why was he her hero?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A:She felt that Roosevelt would win the war and we would all get out...but basically, Roosevelt didn’t help the Jews very much, or the American government was either powerless or unable or unwilling—I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q:Well, tell me, were there guards other than Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A:Yes, there were Kapos.</span> <span id="s803">These were the Polish convicted criminals who were acting on behalf of the Germans, and they were extremely cruel, and they would guard the camp, and you needed to be on good terms with them.</span> <span id="s804">A number of the women went to sleep with them to be able to save their skin, practically their lives, because they were tough.</span> <span id="s805">They were mean and they were tough, and they had nothing to lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q:Were any of the guards, either Germans or Kapos, civil at any point to the prisoners, can you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A:I don’t know particular times, but I would imagine that there must have been something because there wasn’t total harassment at all times, to everybody, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s808">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s809">I mean I was lucky when I was discovered and he didn’t beat me and he didn’t kick me.</span> <span id="s810">So, I must say, at that point, you know, he was not cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q:Would you just briefly review the routine in the camp, the daily routine?</span> <span id="s812">You got up at what time and you did what at what time?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A:I know we got up early and we did get some of this hot brew, and you got approximately a slice of bread to go with it.</span> <span id="s814">If you sliced the bread thin enough, you could manage it, and after that, very often there was the call, the Appel, and you had to go outside in cold and rain and snow and ice and heat and you had to line up five in a row.</span> <span id="s815">This was done evidently to get work crews together and also so they could see who was where.</span> <span id="s816">Now I don’t even remember whether it was done every single morning, or most mornings, but I remember that it was often.</span> <span id="s817">There were days when it was done twice a day, morning and night, but, again I don’t know how often.</span> <span id="s818">And, after that very many of the people would go to work, they would go to their work detail.</span> <span id="s819">Like I would go to the place where they made plastic, whatever, and my mother would take care of the barracks and my father would go to whatever job he had, and my brother would sort of wander around or be in a group where they took care of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q:Were there many children in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A:Well, there were quite a few.</span> <span id="s822">I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s823">Most of them did reasonably well; some died.</span> <span id="s824">Some died, little kids for the most part, they did reasonably well.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q:Do you know of any religious services that were held or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A:I don’t know, but don’t forget, probably there were more of them in the men’s barracks, too, because a lot of the Orthodox men would have their prayers, but I don’t know when and where.</span> <span id="s827">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q:I’m going to turn this tape on to the other side now because I think we are kind of getting to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Tape 2 of 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q:This is tape #2, side #2, of an interview with Erica Van Adelsberg on December 8, 1981, interviewed by Lucille Fisher.</span> <span id="s831">[Long gap before interview is resumed] Were there any, or was there any particular leader in the camp, any figure in the camp who helped the others to kind of hold on?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A:Yes, the leader for the particular section that we were in was the man who had been our neighbor in the little suburb where we first lived.</span> <span id="s833">He was my father’s business partner.</span> <span id="s834">His name was Joseph Weiss.</span> <span id="s835">And he was a very kind man.</span> <span id="s836">He was very highly respected by everybody and he was the leader for the German and the Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s837">There was a leader of the Greek Jews.</span> <span id="s838">He was a big, handsome, tough sort of a guy and I don’t remember his name, [not clear] or something of that sort.</span> <span id="s839">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s840">So there were various leaders, but they worked together.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q:What did they offer you that helped to sustain you?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A:They were able to make some contact with the Germans that evidently benefited us from the point of view that they would, from my understanding, assure them that we would cooperate but would they please, you know, let the sick people lie down and would they give some medical help?</span> <span id="s843">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q:Sort of intermediaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A:Yes, it probably is described in that book which I didn’t bring today, of the destruction of the Dutch Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q:And were there any spiritual leaders there, people who spiritually kind of lifted you out of despair?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A:I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q:You don’t remember that.</span> <span id="s849">Where were you when you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A:I was in a small German town called Tröbitz, which was near Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q:How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A:We were told in April ‘45 that we had to leave, and we knew that the war was close to an end.</span> <span id="s853">There were some reports that seeped in.</span> <span id="s854">So we were told to go on a train and the rumor had it that we were going to go to Auschwitz and, as I told you before, we had to walk seven kilometers.</span> <span id="s855">My friend Jo Seelman was in another section of the camp, but we were able to get together and I asked her to come with us and she was afraid too, and she told me recently—after I left she was so upset that she didn’t go with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q:Her family were not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A:She lost everybody.</span> <span id="s858">And, anyway, we walked the seven kilometers and reached a station or platform with a train that was cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q:Now, the Germans were supervising this exit?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A:Oh, they sure were, yes.</span> <span id="s861">There were several hundred of us: German Jews, Dutch Jews, French Jews—they also came, a lot of French Jews were in our section—Greek Jews...</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q:Belgians, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A:I don’t know about Belgians.</span> <span id="s864">I don’t know, but it was a whole conglomeration of people, a lot of languages.</span> <span id="s865">We got on the trains and I remember sitting on the platform before going in and it was the only time in all these years that I broke down and cried and I sobbed and I thought I would never make it, but I got on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q:Because you were so tired?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A:Because I was so tired and I thought that it was the end.</span> <span id="s868">I figured this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q:And, your parents were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A:My parents were on the train, my grandmother was brought on the train, somehow with some kind of transportation, because she couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s871">We got on the train and it was a horrendous ride.</span> <span id="s872">It was from April 7th or 9th until April 23rd on the train.</span> <span id="s873">Okay?</span> <span id="s874">Every day we would be attacked by planes, or there would be alarms and we had to hide.</span> <span id="s875">We...</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q:Whose planes were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A:British, French, American, whatever.</span> <span id="s878">They didn’t know who we were.</span> <span id="s879">We crossed the River Elbe on the way to Berlin, and we were in the middle of the river and there was an alarm and we couldn’t go back and we couldn’t go forth, and we were told this is it, guys, and I remember saying the Sh’ma Yisroel.</span> <span id="s880">But, we made it, we weren’t bombed.</span> <span id="s881">We were in Berlin two days before it fell.</span> <span id="s882">The train stopped in Berlin, we saw the destruction, and we moved on.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q:You didn’t leave the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A:We left the train in certain places, not in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q:But as the trip went along you could get off?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A:We got out because we had to find food.</span> <span id="s887">We ate raw potatoes, we ate whatever we could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q:They were under no obligation to feed you.</span> <span id="s889">You fed yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A:They couldn’t give us enough food because they didn’t know where to get it from, evidently, and they weren’t interested in getting it.</span> <span id="s891">We were in one town where, suddenly, there was an alarm again and everybody had to get out of the cars, and I lost my family and I ran and I hid under a locomotive, and then I thought, this is stupid and I ran and I ran away, and just as I was running away, maybe a hundred yards, the whole locomotive was hit and it blew up.</span> <span id="s892">And, that’s the kind of trip it was.</span> <span id="s893">We did not have places to wash so we at one point stopped at a little lake or a pond and many, many people would bathe together in this little lake.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q:How many people were on this train?</span></p> <p><span id="s895">A:I would say it was 600 to 800, but many of them died, and more of them died after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q:So, finally, this train ended where?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A:The train ended...can you stop a minute...[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q:There were about 600-800 people you think on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s900">However, after we were free at Tröbitz, many of them contracted typhoid and many of them died after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q:You don’t know who was responsible for your liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A:Yes, I know exactly who was responsible.</span> <span id="s903">[laughter] The Russians.</span> <span id="s904">We were liberated by two young Russian soldiers on horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q:Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A:This was the 13th or 14th day and the train stopped, and it was early in the morning, and we could see the Germans, and we were not that many by then, and they had white flags, and two Russian soldiers appeared on horses, and that was the liberation.</span> <span id="s907">And we couldn’t understand them and they couldn’t understand us, but we knew we were free.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q:And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A:Then, through some people who did know Russian, we were told that we should go to the nearest town, which was Tröbitz, and find ourselves apartments, which we did.</span> <span id="s910">We were told the Germans would leave or they would make room for us so we would have housing.</span> <span id="s911">I went and found an apartment for my family.</span> <span id="s912">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q:Did you have to displace someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A:Actually I didn’t have to displace.</span> <span id="s915">They lived downstairs and they gave us the upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q:These were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A:Germans.</span> <span id="s918">So, they made room for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q:Did they do this willingly or angrily?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A:Yes, because they knew if they didn’t they were going to be shot, so they did it, quickly.</span> <span id="s921">So we moved in and the next day, we went and looked like scavengers, looked for food.</span> <span id="s922">We found a German abandoned army train with enormous supplies of food, especially cheese, and we took it back.</span> <span id="s923">Also the man I was going with to find this, he and I killed rabbits, and we had rabbit stew, and we ate, and we all got sick promptly because it was too much.</span> <span id="s924">After that, a lot of us got typhoid, and even though we had been inoculated, evidently it wasn’t strong enough at that point, and many, many people died right after being liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q:Where were you cared for?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A:The Russians set up a hospital and they gave excellent care.</span> <span id="s927">As a matter of fact, they took my brother, because he was very sick, I was terribly sick, too, but they took him away and they cared for him, shaved his hair and he recuperated.</span> <span id="s928">My father was very sick and they took care of him.</span> <span id="s929">He had a heart attack in addition to having typhoid.</span> <span id="s930">My mother was very sick.</span> <span id="s931">I took care of everybody and then I got it.</span> <span id="s932">I got it worse than they did, I was really near death, but I made it, and then two Russian soldiers wanted to come and take me with them and I kept saying, “Typhoid, typhoid,” and that sort of scared them off, but otherwise, I think, I am sure, they would have taken me, to rape me.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q:The Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A:Yes, but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s935">We stayed in this little town for about six weeks.</span> <span id="s936">One of the people who died there was the wife of Joseph Weiss.</span> <span id="s937">She died there along with many others, and after six weeks the Americans came in and said they would resettle us back in the west; first in the western part of Germany and then into Holland.</span> <span id="s938">This trip took many weeks because the roads were in poor condition.</span> <span id="s939">The bridges were blown up.</span> <span id="s940">But we did finally make it back to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q:Did you get together with any of your family that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A:Not the family, no.</span> <span id="s943">When we got back to Holland, we stayed at the house of some friends who had been with us in Belsen.</span> <span id="s944">Their name was Perlberg and we roomed there for several months.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q:Was there any contact with Jewish agencies, like the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A:Oh, there were lots of contacts.</span> <span id="s947">Once we were on the way, repatriated, the American Jewish agencies, the American governmental agencies, everybody did whatever they could.</span> <span id="s948">Then we were taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q:How long did you stay in Holland before coming here?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A:I was in Holland, I got back in July of ‘45, and I left in July of ‘46, a year.</span> <span id="s951">I went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q:Who guaranteed your admission to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A:The Quakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q:The Quakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A:I was the first European student to be admitted to a Quaker school after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q:And, your parents also came under their aegis?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s958">My mother came as a visitor, I came as a student, and my brother was sent to boarding school in Switzerland, and my father stayed in Holland, so that the family was completely split up, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q:Did your father stay in Holland by choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A:Yes, because he assumed my mother was coming back, because she went to the United States as a visitor, but then she wrote him that she would divorce him and marry Jeno Por.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q:Who had gotten to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q:Had they been in contact with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A:Yes, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q:And, then, he eventually came to the United States, your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A:My father married a Dutch woman and they came to the United States and they lived in California and they were very good friends with Gisa and Harold Wall, the one who I worked with in the laboratory in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s967">So, yes, and I am in touch to this day with people that I was in Westerbork with.</span> <span id="s968">Or in Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q:Then your brother and you eventually stayed and your mother stayed also?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A:My brother arrived in 1947 as a student, and he was admitted to the same boarding school that I had been to.</span> <span id="s971">He also came as a student to go to Quaker school.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q:Well, Erica, I think that kind of ends our soiree.</span> <span id="s973">I am so sorry that that second tape really was not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A:In closing, I think I should say that you are a very good interviewer.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A:And, while it was painful, I think it had to be said.</span> <span id="s977">I personally am of the opinion that it’s very important not to forget what happened during the Holocaust, and also of the very strong opinion that certain people or certain institutions are using the Holocaust to financial benefit that I do not agree or subscribe to.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q:For instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A:I don’t like to name names.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q:O.</span> <span id="s981">K.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A:I think that...</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q:Are you talking about people who are writing books, who are...?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A:I think there are certain people who have made the Holocaust their livelihood or their profession, and I just find it...I know I could not do this, at this point.</span> <span id="s985">I’m not saying never, because you can never say never, but I find this somewhat distasteful.</span> <span id="s986">I think it has a place in history, and I think that I have made my contribution.</span> <span id="s987">I would very strongly urge those who are putting this together to use my poems simply as a record.</span> <span id="s988">They are not to be published, they are not to be translated by anybody without my permission.</span> <span id="s989">I think, basically, I would give, I gave this interview to remember those that did not make it, and that’s really what it is all about.</span> <span id="s990">We’re here and we go on, and this interview is in the memory of those who didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q:Erica, just one more, because you are so clear in what you say in your convictions.</span> <span id="s992">Do you think it could happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A:I think anything is possible.</span> <span id="s994">I think that the same thing couldn’t happen identically.</span> <span id="s995">I don’t think it’s an identical thing.</span> <span id="s996">I do believe that many similar events have already happened and the world has taken very little notice of them.</span> <span id="s997">I would point out Campuchea, for one, and Afghanistan, and these are two examples that certainly are tremendous tragedies and loss of human life.</span> <span id="s998">We don’t know the number but it runs into many hundreds of thousands, and we’re not taking any active role in that.</span> <span id="s999">Whether it can happen to Jews again, I would imagine things can happen.</span> <span id="s1000">I don’t think ever to the degree.</span> <span id="s1001">I think the State of Israel is, in a way, our hope of something not happening, and I do think that cruelty will continue forever, and that’s a terrible pessimistic thing to say, but I have seen nothing to indicate that people are less cruel in 1982 than they were in ‘42.</span> <span id="s1002">Maybe some different methods.</span> <span id="s1003">On the other hand, I also think that there is always hope and I am a great optimist by nature, and I feel that, even throughout this horrendous experience, had it not been for my strong hope, I would have never made it.</span> <span id="s1004">And I do look for good things in any situation and I told you earlier that some of the things in Westerbork, as crazy as it sounds, they were good for me, in a certain way, not that I was in Westerbork, but some of the connections I made, and some of the experience I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q:And your alignment with Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A:Yes, so that there were some things that weren’t totally horrendous.</span> <span id="s1007">They were...I had some good times, and I don’t mean to say that the experience in general was good, no, but there were some snips of it that were definitely good, because I met some wonderful people, and did some very interesting things, and joyful things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q:Let me ask you.</span> <span id="s1009">Your experiences were as a young girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q:Would you venture what your mother might have said in conclusion?</span> <span id="s1012">Would she have echoed your kind of feeling, or do you know if she subscribes to a different point of view?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A:I think my mother has also blocked out a great deal.</span> <span id="s1014">Maybe even more than I have, and I am quite sure she would subscribe to that, too.</span> <span id="s1015">I don’t even know that she would be willing to be interviewed.</span> <span id="s1016">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1017">My parents, my mother and stepfather, have tried to let the past be the past and they went forward.</span> <span id="s1018">And they visited Austria and Switzerland and Germany, fully aware of antisemitic tendencies there even to this day, but also aware that they enjoyed certain aspects of it as vacationers and that’s all they were.</span> <span id="s1019">They were on vacation and they enjoyed certain amenities and certain parts of that.</span> <span id="s1020">They do not wish to be awakened again and again over what happened.</span> <span id="s1021">They know it happened.</span> <span id="s1022">I’m sure there are certain guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s1023">I’m sure there are certain scars.</span> <span id="s1024">My stepfather had nightmares for years, but they have buried it to a large degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q:What about their feeling of Jewishness, their feeling for the State of Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A:Their feeling for the State of Israel is very positive, philosophically, and they would make contributions, but they do not have a personal involvement.</span> <span id="s1027">My brother also has buried much of it, and he was so young that his experience...again, different.</span> <span id="s1028">My brother, Ernest Hilton, changed his name from Herz to Hilton, he was married twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q:Why did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A:Because he felt that it would be better for business and he changed it a long time ago.</span> <span id="s1031">He was married to a woman from Australia for 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q:A Jewish woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A:No.</span> <span id="s1034">And he divorced her and he is presently happily married to a woman from Thailand by the name of Saisampan and they have a son a year-and-a-half old and I think my brother is in a unique position.</span> <span id="s1035">My brother was the first to be bar mitzvah in Holland after the war and I would...</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q:Whose idea was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A:My parents, and I would imagine...</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q:Well, that was a switch for your parents, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A:No, no that was not.</span> <span id="s1040">That was part of it.</span> <span id="s1041">Bar mitzvah was part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q:It was part of the ritual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1044">He was the first to be bar mitzvah in Holland after the war and he probably is the last, or one of the last, to have a baby from the people who were in camps.</span> <span id="s1045">His baby was born a year-and-a-half ago.</span> <span id="s1046">And that was his first and only child.</span> <span id="s1047">So that he has two records.</span> <span id="s1048">The first bar mitzvah and the last to become a father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q:Well, that’s on a positive rebirth.</span> <span id="s1050">O.K., thanks Erica, a million.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A reference to the album-journal Erica Van Adelsberg kept, a copy of which is in The Gratz College Holocaust Oral History
