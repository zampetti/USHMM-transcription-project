start by telling me a little bit about your parents, especially in terms of what type of people they were.</span> <span id="s13">Were they strict, were they lenient, were they nice, were they preoccupied with things-?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Well, you have to understand that I was born in 1937, and I really parted from my parents, somewhere close to ’42, close to ’43.</span> <span id="s15">So, that I quite frankly, don’t remember my parents as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Not at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Only in a very sketchy way.</span> <span id="s18">For instance, I have a scar on my wrist which happened, I remember distinctly when my father was cutting some string, and I came by and I somehow got my wrist under there and the knife went into my wrist.</span> <span id="s19">And, you see, that I remember vividly because there was such an uproar.</span> <span id="s20">I mean, my mother got hysterical.</span> <span id="s21">There was all that blood, and- so that’s the sort of incident I remember.</span> <span id="s22">I just-.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: You don’t remember what kind of person he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I don’t remember at all.</span> <span id="s25">I only know what people have told me afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: What have they told you?</span> <span id="s27">First of all, what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: His name was Avraham....Kesten...and I remember the last time I saw him, which is when he walked with me and took me, it was late in the evening, and it was dark, and he was taking me over to the people who were going to keep me during the war.</span> <span id="s29">To the ?</span> <span id="s30">Krupas?</span> <span id="s31">That I remember...I don’t think he was strict, because I don’t remember that he ever laid a hand on me, you know, I remember him as a kind man.</span> <span id="s32">So I don’t think he was strict.</span> <span id="s33">But you see, he wasn’t around very much.</span> <span id="s34">He was the oldest son, the son who took care of the business.</span> <span id="s35">The family business.</span> <span id="s36">They were in building materials.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: He was from Lancut?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: No, he was from ?</span> <span id="s39">Pyreworsk?</span> <span id="s40">- that’s where my mother moved after she was married.</span> <span id="s41">I was born in ?</span> <span id="s42">Lanzig?</span> <span id="s43">because she went home to her mother’s home to give birth...he was twice in the war, he was in the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: What do you mean, ‘twice in the war?’</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Well he was a soldier...I can’t remember exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Was he a religious man?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: He was not ultra religious.</span> <span id="s48">My mother was actually more religious than he was.</span> <span id="s49">But he was modern religious.</span> <span id="s50">I mean, he didn’t wear the orthodox garb.</span> <span id="s51">You know, like the strummel...he dressed in modern clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What happened to him during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: During the war he was captured.</span> <span id="s54">My parents found places for themselves.</span> <span id="s55">After they found a family who took me in, they found...he knew a lot of people...he and my mother were able to find other Polish families who were willing to hide them.</span> <span id="s56">My father, my mother told me that the agreement was that my father was going to leave a certain sum of money every specified period of time for the people who were keeping me in a certain place.</span> <span id="s57">And, he was captured.</span> <span id="s58">Apparently, one of those times, when after he had deposited the money, he was captured by the Germans.</span> <span id="s59">And he was brought to the jail.</span> <span id="s60">He didn’t have any papers.</span> <span id="s61">He was brought to the jail, the local jail in ?</span> <span id="s62">Shavrusk?</span> <span id="s63">and at that point he was identified by some Pollacks who knew him, that he was a Jew and, we were told after the war that the Germans tortured him, because the Pollacks had told the Germans that, uhm, he had a family.</span> <span id="s64">That he had a wife and daughter.</span> <span id="s65">So they wanted to find out where the wife and daughter were, and obviously, he didn’t tell them, and they killed him.</span> <span id="s66">And they killed him right there.</span> <span id="s67">In that jail.</span> <span id="s68">And that’s what happened to him during the war.</span> <span id="s69">So, basically, I don’t remember him.</span> <span id="s70">I don’t remember my mother, either before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: But you remember her after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How was she-?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: You see, I don’t think my parents were strict with me.</span> <span id="s75">First of all, they didn’t really do the daily- they had a nanny for me.</span> <span id="s76">And I remember her, you see.</span> <span id="s77">Her name was Angela.</span> <span id="s78">I remember her very well...I remember her laugh.</span> <span id="s79">I remember her more intimately than I remember my parents.</span> <span id="s80">Because she’s the only one who really handled me...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Were they well off at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Everybody tells me that they were well- I mean people who I met after the war, all seem to be very much taken with the fact that I was a (inaudible- Avrahamchik’s?)</span> <span id="s83">daughter and from the tone and the manner in which they spoke, I had the impression that the family had been well off, and also that he was well thought of, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Do you have any relations on that side who you still have contact with?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes, there’s actually just one relative.</span> <span id="s86">It’s a cousin who lives in New Jersey...</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: His name is (inaudible)...and he’s the lone surviving cousin.</span> <span id="s89">There was another one, but he’s dead now...my father’s brother survived, but he lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s90">I haven’t seen him from 1947 until 1987, when I was in Israel...recently.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Must have been quite a reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: Yes...he lives in B’nei Brak.</span> <span id="s93">He became Orthodox...</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: From what you’ve heard about Avram, would you characterize him as having been a fighter, a person who would fight to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s96">But the problem was, he would have fought to survive...he was a soldier, he had been in the army, so he knew how to conduct himself.</span> <span id="s97">And everybody said that he was very strong...after 1939, and before 1943 when we had to separate and go into hiding...I remember for instance, that he would get up in the middle of the night and have to go and hide, run away, because the Germans came looking for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: And not for your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: And not for my mother.</span> <span id="s100">And I don’t really know why...</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Would you say that your mother was a fighter?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: My mother was a fighter...she said that my father basically stayed because he felt that he had to take care of his wife and his child...I know that my mother is a fighter because as a widow after the war, with a child, how she managed to survive.</span> <span id="s103">She is, she is what is truly called a survivor.</span> <span id="s104">You know, I think that when you talk about survivors, I mean, I was a child, I’m a survivor, but I think I survived because other people managed to take care of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Your fate was not really in your hands, was it.</span> <span id="s106">You were 5 years old, and if they chose to get rid of you, they could have.</span> <span id="s107">Tell me just a little bit about that experience.</span> <span id="s108">Your mother left, and you were given over to this family, the ?</span> <span id="s109">Krupas?</span> <span id="s110">Now, were they friends of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: How did you determine- was it just a deal, that for money they would shelter you?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: My mother told me that they came forward when this order came through...that the Jews should- leave...they came forward to my father, and they said that they would be willing to take me.</span> <span id="s114">They didn’t think in terms of a long period of time...my mother said that a business deal was struck...my father naturally felt immediately that if they take me, then he and my mother had a chance, and that he would be willing to pay for that.</span> <span id="s115">What my father did...he buried a good deal of money, and my mother knew where it was, and in fact, my mother was able to recover a lot of it after the war.</span> <span id="s116">What he did was, he buried gold pieces...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: How did they get the money to the ?</span> <span id="s118">Krupas?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: They didn’t...there was an agreement made that each month my father would leave a certain amount of money in a certain place.</span> <span id="s120">He actually buried it...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What happened (to you) when he was captured?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: ...they realized that there wasn’t going to be any more money...they told me that both my parents were dead...I was 7 years old...as bizarre as it may seem, the Germans were becoming very vicious at that time...?</span> <span id="s123">Krupas?</span> <span id="s124">decided to dispose of me.</span> <span id="s125">Basically...they were going to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: They were afraid you were going to be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: ...they felt that my parents were gone, and they were afraid for their own safety and for their own child, they had a daughter and I guess they were desperate...they had taken me to a village where they knew some people who had a farm, and they told them- I was blond...and had blue eyes...I was a member of his family, that my mother had died and...they wanted this family to keep me...</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: That was how they were going to dispose of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: No...they couldn’t keep me in their house in the open because people in the town knew me...my mother said, they had told my parents that they knew this family out in the countryside whom they could take me to...but apparently I had nightmares about what had been happening and one night I started screaming, ‘I’m not a Jew!</span> <span id="s130">I’m not a Jew!’</span> <span id="s131">I had nightmares, and the people woke up and heard me, and so they immediately put two and two together, and what my mother said was, ‘that it was very nice of them, they didn’t immediately take me to the Germans’.</span> <span id="s132">They returned me back to the Krupas and...said they didn’t want anything to do with harboring a Jewish child and they should take me back.</span> <span id="s133">At that point, they had to take me back...they kept me up in the attic...and a shelter for me under the stairs to the attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: How did this all strike you?</span> <span id="s135">How aware were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: By that time I was...in such a constant state of fear that I think I was very passive.</span> <span id="s137">I didn’t fight.</span> <span id="s138">They told me to keep quiet, and I kept quiet and I remember cringing in fear under those stairs...</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: They couldn’t pass you off?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, they couldn’t pass me...they had to keep me out of sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Did you have to stay in the attic the whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: I was in the attic all the time.</span> <span id="s143">I never left.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: What did you do all day?</span> <span id="s145">It must have been very boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: I used to catch the mice...and there was a cat and I used to, you know, play around with the cat.</span> <span id="s147">It’s hard to imagine now, that I was able to spend almost two years that way.</span> <span id="s148">It’s just- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s149">I don’t know how I did it.</span> <span id="s150">I really don’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Did it ever occur to you to ask, ‘Why do they want to kill me because I’m Jewish?’</span> <span id="s152">I mean, surely you didn’t know what that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: I don’t remember asking them much of anything.</span> <span id="s154">I remember that every once in a while they’d bring me down to the apartment, and they had a yellow canary...I remember sort of, I have these images.</span> <span id="s155">But I don’t remember my day to day routine.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Do you remember the Germans ever coming, and you cowering in the stair shelter?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Oh, yes, that I remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: You were very, very frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yah, I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s160">I remember very well one night when my father’s brother came to see me, and he had a long beard and a very bushy beard.</span> <span id="s161">I was petrified because I thought he was some horrible man who was coming to- you see, in a way, they had to keep me being afraid.</span> <span id="s162">They were always telling me that if I don’t behave myself, or if I make noise, or if this and this, then they will have this terrible man come and take me away.</span> <span id="s163">And when he came, I thought he was the terrible man who came.</span> <span id="s164">So, I remember that.</span> <span id="s165">Because that made an indelible impression on me...(inaudible)...I started screaming, he remembers that.</span> <span id="s166">He remembers that.</span> <span id="s167">When he came to see me-.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: He didn’t have a religious beard?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: No, no...he was unshaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Were the Krupas nice people?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I think they were nice people...they just had to make me mind-.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: How about the daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: She was not mean to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Was she older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: She’s older than I am...probably 5 or 6 years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: How did your father know you were alive when he deposited the money.</span> <span id="s177">Merely the fact that they picked it up doesn’t mean that-.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: My mother said he didn’t know.</span> <span id="s179">He just assumed...my mother said it was a small town where people knew about other people, and she always felt that if anything happened to me, somehow they would have gotten wind of it...but I don’t think I ever asked, you know, why is this, why is this happening to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you think that your parents were going to come back?</span> <span id="s181">You told me that you were at the point, where you were saying that they were going to dispose of you because they heard your parents were captured...that was in ’44, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: That was in ’44, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: What happened with the disposing - I mean, they didn’t obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Well, what happened was, and you see, that’s it.</span> <span id="s185">There are certain things that I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s186">I remember that it was cold.</span> <span id="s187">It was a very cold night and they got me dressed warmly, and there was an air raid siren went off, and when there was an air raid, nobody was suppose to be outside or you’d get shot...they didn’t take me out that night...what they said was, that they felt it was a ‘sign from G-d’ to them.</span> <span id="s188">And they were religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Lucky you.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Right.</span> <span id="s191">And they just didn’t have the courage to do it.</span> <span id="s192">I’m sure it wasn’t easy for them to do it to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: They were religious people, they thought it was a sign from G-d, did you think that there was any kind of divine reason that you attribute anything supernatural to the fact that you survived altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: How about now?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Well, you see now because of the condition I’m in now, in terms of my health, one of the things that I feel is that G-d didn’t go to all the trouble of saving me then, to make me die an early death now, so, I sort of have the faith that I’m going to survive this too.</span> <span id="s197">Because, you know, to some degree it’s not as difficult, although- so, I don’t know that I ascribed it to G-d, although I believe that there is a force or something which is G-d.</span> <span id="s198">But I don’t believe that you know, G-d specifically selected me to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: On the other hand, there is the fact that you wouldn’t have survived, did you survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: But on the other hand-.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: (inaudible) It’s a mixed feeling isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: It’s a mixed feeling, yes, but it’s, you see, I don’t have the belief that G-d looks after each one of us individually.</span> <span id="s203">I sort of feel that the sense of G-d is there for us, to use in a positive way, in other words, it’s comforting to think that we can appeal to a higher force in the universe, for our well-being.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: And maybe it’s true.</span> <span id="s205">Maybe he’ll answer you.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Right.</span> <span id="s207">And maybe it’s true.</span> <span id="s208">That’s right.</span> <span id="s209">And maybe he’ll answer, that’s exactly it.</span> <span id="s210">So that in itself is a help.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: You mean just the possibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Just the possibility, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: That there maybe someone out there.</span> <span id="s214">In other words, you’re not embracing this thought, but you’re discounting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: I’m not discounting it.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: You’re, in a way, an agnostic on this issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well, I might you know, but in the true sense, I don’t think I’m an agnostic because I also really believe in the Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s218">You know, I don’t feel there is one universal.</span> <span id="s219">I feel that everybody has to have their own way of reaching G-d.</span> <span id="s220">But yet, it has to be somewhat structured.</span> <span id="s221">And the structure is the religion.</span> <span id="s222">So if you embrace the Jewish religion, well then you do it through the structure of the Jewish religion...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: When you embrace it through the Jewish religion, is it only like a happenstance?</span> <span id="s224">Coincidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: It’s by coincidence of birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Once that coincidence has occurred, do you find yourself in stronger agreement with that than any other religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Simply by the fact that it is familiar to me, because that’s what I was raised into-.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: You don’t think G-d played any favorites?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: People within the structure of Catholicism, Protestantism, pray to G-d, he is as likely to answer them as he is to answer you?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And if you pray to Jesus?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span> <span id="s234">it doesn’t mean anything because you see, basically I don’t view Jesus the way the Catholics, or the Protestants view Jesus...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: ...were your parents, to your knowledge, involved in ?</span> <span id="s236">Shvorsk?</span> <span id="s237">in communal life, in religious life.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s239">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: No, not politics, because being Jewish they were already excluded...</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And how were they involved communally, or religiously?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Religiously, they were involved because they were members of the religious community.</span> <span id="s244">I mean, they were Orthodox.</span> <span id="s245">They were observant Jews...and the Jewish people in the small towns of Poland , if they were involved in their synagogue, that was there communal life...the communal life centered around the shul...</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: They weren’t like the president of the synagogue or vice-president-.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Not that I know of.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Communally involved, you mean their life centered around the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Right...I don’t know if there was such a thing as a president of the synagogue...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: How did the war end in terms of your- the war ended and your mother came back-.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: The war ended, and I knew that something had happened.</span> <span id="s252">Because, one day there was an air raid alarm...and they took me to the air raid shelter.</span> <span id="s253">It was the first time- because prior to that every time there was an air raid siren that went off, they would go to the shelter and leave me in the house.</span> <span id="s254">And I would stand in the attic and watch the bombs fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: You were told that your parents were dead, in ’44.</span> <span id="s256">So that means after that, you had no hope that your parents that the Krupas would continue to shelter you.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: But you have to understand that my feelings, I remember that distinctly, that I really, my senses, rather, were very muted.</span> <span id="s258">Almost non-existent at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Do you think that was a way of protecting yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: It’s possible...I was almost indifferent to anything that...went on around me...I don’t remember crying very much, I really don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: ...you were numb.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: I was numb, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: So, what happened after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Well, the thing- so that I remember, because that was such an amazing thing that happened in my life.</span> <span id="s265">You know, at that point, that I was able to leave their house, and go to this air raid shelter with them.</span> <span id="s266">So I remember that.</span> <span id="s267">And the next thing I remember is that this woman appeared and they told me that she was my mother.</span> <span id="s268">And I didn’t want to have anything to do with her because number 1 they had told me that my mother had been killed, and number two this woman who appeared didn’t look anything like my mother.</span> <span id="s269">And so, I- at that- and then I remember getting hysterical and I did NOT want to go with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: It was your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s272">It was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Did she not look like your mother.</span> <span id="s274">I mean, it was only three years since you’d seen her.</span> <span id="s275">You had seen her through the age of five-.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: It was two years.</span> <span id="s277">Two and a half years...this was ’45.</span> <span id="s278">Already three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So, how could you have possibly forgotten her?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: She was very emaciated.</span> <span id="s281">She didn’t look like my mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: She must have been distressed to find that you rejected her when she traveled all that way to come get you.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: My mother said she was very distressed, but she had enough presence of mind to say to them that she was going to leave me there and come and visit me regularly until I accepted the fact that she was my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Did you ever feel at any point, around the age of 6 or 7 that the Germans were looking for you because you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: ...the Krupers taught me some prayers and to cross myself...and when I went to those people who had the farm I went to church with them all the time...I kneeled and I said all the prayers...when I was with the Krupers they had me doing that all the time because just in case.</span> <span id="s286">So they had ingrained in me the sense that I must never say to anybody that I’m Jewish because I’ll be killed instantly.</span> <span id="s287">So I think I began to think of myself as not being Jewish- because as a matter of fact, when I did finally go with my mother, I insisted that I have to say the prayers every night and it was sort of like-.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Security.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: When you went with your mother, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: ...we were liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s292">Well, we went back to our house where we had one little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: In ?</span> <span id="s294">Shvorsk?</span> <span id="s295">?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: in ?</span> <span id="s297">Shvorsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: No one had ever taken over the room?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: ...houses were damaged...everyone got a little room.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You were there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Not very long...it was summer or fall...and sometime during that winter we left.</span> <span id="s302">I think it was in 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Where did you leave for?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: ...?</span> <span id="s305">Chestachala?</span> <span id="s306">...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: So you went to ?</span> <span id="s308">Chestachala?</span> <span id="s309">and you stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yes, we lived there under the protection of a Russian lieutenant colonel.</span> <span id="s311">My mother befriended in ?</span> <span id="s312">Shvorsk?</span> <span id="s313">and that’s how we went to ?</span> <span id="s314">Chestachal?</span> <span id="s315">...it was dangerous for my mother and me to remain in ‘Shvorsk’...the people who had told the Germans who my father was, and basically helped to bring about his murder, and had decided to do away my mother and me, and the reason they decided to do this, was because my mother had gone to (needs translation) and said that these two men were responsible for her husband’s death and so she wanted them punished...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Your mother knew that?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: She got friendly with this Russian officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: You see.</span> <span id="s320">That’s why I say my mother is a survivor because the Russian soldiers were real womanizers.</span> <span id="s321">And my mother, being a widow, was fair game I guess.</span> <span id="s322">So she managed to befriend this Russian Colonel with whom she had an affair, basically, and he was our protector...</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I assume though, that she was quite attractive...she came back and you said she was emaciated...I guess she nursed herself back to health.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: She did, and my mother was a very feisty woman at that time.</span> <span id="s325">And I think that was appealing to men.</span> <span id="s326">Because I remember a number of men who were quite interested in her.</span> <span id="s327">She was a strong woman, and...I don’t know why, you know, because we don’t think of our parents that way.</span> <span id="s328">But she must have been attractive to men because they were there...she was a very energetic woman...</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: I guess she must have imparted some of that strength (inaudible) applies to you...(inaudible)...you can draw strength and sustenance from her example.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Oh, and she certainly set an example for me.</span> <span id="s331">She herself was sick for many years, and she didn’t really let it destroy her life completely.</span> <span id="s332">I mean, she carried on in a normal way as best she could.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: ...went to ?</span> <span id="s334">Chestachalov?</span> <span id="s335">with this Russian group.</span> <span id="s336">What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: ...I remember that as being a happy time...we had enough good food and that made an impression on me...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">End of Tape #1, Side A Tape #1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I don’t remember how long...</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: What did you do after ?</span> <span id="s342">Chestachov?</span> <span id="s343">?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">A: ...the Colonel had to go back.</span> <span id="s345">I think that was 1946...and my mother married Fred...She met him in ?</span> <span id="s346">Shvorsk?</span> <span id="s347">after the liberation...there was a time that my mother left me with a friend, and then she came back, and she told me that she had married this man, Mr. Singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So suddenly you had-.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: So suddenly I had a father.</span> <span id="s350">I wasn’t happy about it, because I was very attached to this Russian Colonel.</span> <span id="s351">I liked him.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: ...do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Ya, because well, I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s354">When we were leaving Poland, you see, we left Poland through the underground...and one of the things we had to do was to get rid of everything that had any pictures in it, or any Russian writing, or any connection to Russia...I remember distinctly how I cried when I had to get rid of these pictures that we had of this man.</span> <span id="s355">But we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: How did you leave Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: ...we went to live in ?</span> <span id="s358">Shames?</span> <span id="s359">which is Fred’s hometown.</span> <span id="s360">And that’s where I went to school for the first time.</span> <span id="s361">I went to Polish school which was horrible.</span> <span id="s362">And then we went to live in Cracow...we left Poland in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: How long did you stay in Polish schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: Not long.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Not long...half a year at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: ...from Cracow you went to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: From Cracow we left Poland...</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Why didn’t you stay like hundreds of thousands of Jews stayed in Poland after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: My mother had always wanted to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s371">The agreement with my father was, that when he was able to train his brother well enough to take over the family business, so they were going to go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s372">My mother was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s373">And this was something that was agreed upon before they were married...</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: ...she was an aggressive person, an adventurous person.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: She was an adventurous person...she wasn’t a fearful person.</span> <span id="s376">She was very courageous that what it is...</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Where was your mother during the war while you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: She was also in hiding.</span> <span id="s379">She lived with a Polish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: She never wound up in a concentration camp...?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: ...so you wanted to leave Cracow...you got out through the underground, and where did you wind up?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: First we ended up in Vienna.</span> <span id="s384">Then we ended up in Germany, in a town called Lanzut...</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Why Lanzut?</span> <span id="s386">What was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: ...there was a certain route that this took through the border, and I guess Lanzut was en-route...that was a camp of tents.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: A D.P. camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: Well, it...was a temporary place, a very temporary...so that was our first resting place.</span> <span id="s390">Tent City.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: who guided you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Smugglers.</span> <span id="s393">You had to pay them.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: (inaudible)...so from Lanzut, Germany, you went to where?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: ...an army camp.</span> <span id="s396">We lived in these army barracks.</span> <span id="s397">These HUGE rooms, you know, where every family had a little corner.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t remember where that was, but that was also temporary.</span> <span id="s399">And there, I had my first encounter with American soldiers and chewing gum, you see (laughing).</span> <span id="s400">And from there we ended up in Vasseralsingen and that was the first time when all our travels started that we ended up in an apartment.</span> <span id="s401">That WAS a D.P. camp... I don’t know why my parents then went to another D.P camp which was ?</span> <span id="s402">Felderink?</span> <span id="s403">.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: How long were you in both D.P. camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: We got to Germany in 1947.</span> <span id="s406">and we left in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: You were in the D.P. camps for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Ya.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: From the age of 10 to 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: I wasn’t quite 10 when we got to Germany, and I wasn’t quite 14 when we-.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What did you do all those 4 years...what were those years...like?</span> <span id="s412">Did you go to school there?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yes...by that time I did know how to read...and write Polish...my mother had tutors for me...</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How far did you get in school, altogether, today, I mean when you came to America, did you go to school again?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s416">Sure.</span> <span id="s417">I started high school here, I went to college and I went through 16 credits of graduate school, then I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: 16 credits towards a M.A. in what?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: In Business Education...which I never completed.</span> <span id="s420">I went to Hunter College.</span> <span id="s421">City College during the summers...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: You were in the camp for four years.</span> <span id="s423">Why were you in the camp so long?</span> <span id="s424">Your mother was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s425">Did you think about going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s427">We even had two crateful of things that went to Israel because we were going to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Why didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Well my mother in Germany, started getting quite ill.</span> <span id="s430">She ended up in the hospital several times.</span> <span id="s431">And it was her heart.</span> <span id="s432">Nobody really knew why or what.</span> <span id="s433">But that was when her heart condition became really evident.</span> <span id="s434">And the doctor very much discouraged her from going to Israel.</span> <span id="s435">He said that, ‘You’re not a well woman.</span> <span id="s436">Life is very difficult there and that’s the wrong place for you to go to.’</span> <span id="s437">And by that time Fred’s brother had come here to New York and he was able to get an affidavit, and Fred really didn’t want to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s438">Fred wanted to come here.</span> <span id="s439">He was really going along with it because my mother was so insistent.</span> <span id="s440">That that was where she wanted to go.</span> <span id="s441">But he wasn’t that interested.</span> <span id="s442">So then when she got sick...then Fred said, ‘Well, I want to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s443">My brother is there,’ and so the brother sent him-.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Oh, I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s446">I had been learning Hebrew, and I was learning Hebrew songs, and I was imbued with the spirit of going to Eretz Israel and it was a horrendous shock to find my parents were going to change direction on me.</span> <span id="s447">My life had been a whole series of upheavals.</span> <span id="s448">I had gotten T.B. after the war, and so, that was the other reason why my parents weren’t- I spent a whole year in a T.B. sanitarium...in Germany...by that time Esther had joined us...shortly after we got there, no sooner did I start going to school, and life seemed somewhat normal...</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: ...cured you?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s451">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s452">They did cure me.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: What was it like in the D.P. camp there?</span> <span id="s454">Friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: You had an apartment there?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes...the Americans had apparently designated a certain part of town as a D.P. camp.</span> <span id="s458">So, actually we had apartment, there was a Jewish administration.</span> <span id="s459">What I remember was, everything was done in a very inefficient way.</span> <span id="s460">That’s why going to Israel was such a wonderful experience.</span> <span id="s461">Because my recollection of what life was like with the Jews, was of constant upheavals, and things not working, and fights, and arguments, and I came to Israel, and I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s462">There was a country that seems to be very efficient, the transportation system is efficient, the public toilets are clean, there is toilet paper.</span> <span id="s463">They all flushing.</span> <span id="s464">The hotels seemed to be run efficiently and people are pleasant and courteous.</span> <span id="s465">And, I- it was such a wonderful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: You hadn’t expected that.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Well, I didn’t know what to expect.</span> <span id="s468">My memory was so altogether in the reverse of what I found.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: In a Jewish environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: In a Jewish environment, right.</span> <span id="s471">I mean there was just constant fights, and constant unpleasantness, people were not pleasant to each other after the war.</span> <span id="s472">That was very upsetting.</span> <span id="s473">I found that I was very timid.</span> <span id="s474">I was always sort of uncertain how people would react .</span> <span id="s475">People were very unpredictable.</span> <span id="s476">That’s really what I recollect mostly of my years in Europe, that you could not depend on people, you know.</span> <span id="s477">People were, just- I suppose it had something to do with their horrible experience during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: But you didn’t suppose that then.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Then you were just annoyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Did Uncle Herman try and help you get an affidavit also?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: No.</span> <span id="s484">That was a very sore point with my mother.</span> <span id="s485">Uncle Herman tells me now, and he has told me that he was really afraid.</span> <span id="s486">Here was a woman who wrote to him that she was sick, she had a child, her husband didn’t have a trade- and he just, I guess he was also struggling and he didn’t want to bring out this family that he was afraid he might have to support.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: ...what happened if somebody came here, and- supposing you had come here and he couldn’t have supported you.</span> <span id="s488">What would they have done...thrown him in jail?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Apparently, when you sign an affidavit- of course not!</span> <span id="s490">Because when we came, the HIAS supported us, anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: There were numerous cases on HIAS winding up supporting people who had come here because other people said they could take care of them, then they couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Right...Fred’s brother who came here on an affidavit and wound up being supported by the HIAS got some stranger to send an affidavit.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: For you?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Ya.</span> <span id="s495">For us.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: ...if your mother hadn’t gotten ill-.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: If she hadn’t gotten ill, she would have definitely gone to Israel, because she was the dominate force in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: You remember her being the dominant force.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Even being ill.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: ...you have this affidavit, you were still happy to go to America rather than stay in a D.P. camp, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well you see, no.</span> <span id="s502">When we were leaving, it was an adventure.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: You finished elementary school?</span> <span id="s504">A: I finished elementary school- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s505">I must have finished something because during the last year and a half, or last year, that we were in Germany, I was going to school in Munich.</span> <span id="s506">You see, all throughout the years that we were all these travels, whenever possible, there was always a tutor there.</span> <span id="s507">My mother always got me a tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: She had a passion for education-.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: I don’t know, but you see, I didn’t have any regular schooling.</span> <span id="s510">There was constant interruptions, so that I-.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: In the D.P. camp, what language were you speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Well, I learned German, but we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s513">But I was learning Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How did you get to America?</span> <span id="s515">You got the affidavit and you left ?</span> <span id="s516">Felderfing?</span> <span id="s517">?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: We left ?</span> <span id="s519">Felderfing?</span> <span id="s520">via Hamburg, on the S.S. General Taylor, it was an army ship...and it was a terrific adventure, I mean, you know being at sea we came it was in February, I think it took us three weeks to get here, it was very stormy seas.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Tell me about the ride- what do you remember about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: I remember sleeping- my mother was on the bottom, Esther was on the second bunk, and I was up on the third bunk because I wasn’t sick.</span> <span id="s523">Everybody was very seasick.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: How many people were in this general bunk area?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Oh, it was- there must have been thousands on the boat.</span> <span id="s526">Really.</span> <span id="s527">It was just a tremendously large amount of people.</span> <span id="s528">I don’t know how many people can-.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: You didn’t have your own room did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh, no, (illegible) it was a huge room.</span> <span id="s531">It was three-.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: How many were in that one room- the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Hundreds, really, hundreds.</span> <span id="s534">There were several of those rooms, there were hundreds of us.</span> <span id="s535">That’s why it was such an adventure because it was a very large ship.</span> <span id="s536">With all those people, and there were people my own age, and there was the first time that I met a boy that I had a crush on that remained the love of my life for many years after I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Well he ended up in Vineland and he ended up at Drexel Institute in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: His family was in-.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: That’s right...</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Barry- Baruch Markman...I don’t know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: ...did you have any permanent injuries as a result of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: No.</span> <span id="s545">Just the T.B. I contracted T.B., but that was probably after the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: When did you come to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: March, 1951.</span> <span id="s548">BLEAK, DREARY March 3rd, 1951.</span> <span id="s549">WHAT a drear-!</span> <span id="s550">It was a typical dreary March day.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: We arrived-.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: ...You were for three weeks (inaudible)...on this boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s555">I remember swings, I had a lot of fun on the swings, lots of marching around, there were other kids, you know-.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: Marching around-?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I mean, just walking around.</span> <span id="s558">There was ups and downs, all these different decks.</span> <span id="s559">It was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s560">And you see, most of the older people were sick, so we the younger ones really had the run of the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Was it a nice boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: No.</span> <span id="s563">It was sort of gray.</span> <span id="s564">Basically, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s565">It was gray.</span> <span id="s566">I remember that the table was fastened to the floors, the chairs- these chairs.</span> <span id="s567">Stools.</span> <span id="s568">That’s it.</span> <span id="s569">It had no stools that were fastened on to the boat and the food was atrocious!</span> <span id="s570">(laughing).</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: What did they serve you, and how did they serve you.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Lots of grapefruit.</span> <span id="s573">Well, you would just go over and they’d just ladle it out.</span> <span id="s574">You’d get a tray and this and that, and then if the ship started heaving, it all- pssssst- (laughing) I tell you!</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: (inaudible) you were in a dining room when they served you?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s577">We ate in a dining room.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Sat down at long tables?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: We sat down at these long tables that were fastened with these stools, and everybody had their tray, and you got your spoon and your fork on the tray.</span> <span id="s580">The food was awful.</span> <span id="s581">I just don’t remember it.</span> <span id="s582">The only thing I remember is the grapefruit, because I never had grapefruit before.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: No meat?</span> <span id="s584">They didn’t serve any meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: They served meat, but I just- the food was non- descript.</span> <span id="s586">I remember, for instance, I always liked eggs very much.</span> <span id="s587">And I remember that the eggs they would give was just tasteless.</span> <span id="s588">Were absolutely awful.</span> <span id="s589">They weren’t real eggs.</span> <span id="s590">They was this reconstituted egg powder.</span> <span id="s591">I remember somebody explained to me that these were not real eggs, because I could not understand how eggs could be- there was one thing I loved.</span> <span id="s592">Always loved.</span> <span id="s593">And I remember after the war when my mother would give me eggs , they were just as delicious in Poland and in Germany.</span> <span id="s594">And here we had these awful eggs.</span> <span id="s595">And I found out it was powder, it wasn’t real.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Did they boil it or what did they do, fry it?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: No.</span> <span id="s598">I think they mixed it with water.</span> <span id="s599">You know, you have egg powder, and you mix it with hot water and it gets the consistency of scrambled eggs.</span> <span id="s600">But it was awful.</span> <span id="s601">That’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s602">And white bread.</span> <span id="s603">You see, I had never eaten white bread.</span> <span id="s604">I mean, that kind of white bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: No.</span> <span id="s607">It was awful too.</span> <span id="s608">I mean it was very mushy, white bread.</span> <span id="s609">I guess it was this American white bread.</span> <span id="s610">I don’t know how they got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: What was the crew like?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Well, I don’t remember the crew.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: No cooks, chefs, nobody chasing you around telling you to get away from-.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No, that was the funny thing.</span> <span id="s615">I don’t remember anybody being in any way punitive or saying, you know, shooing us away.</span> <span id="s616">We really had the run of the boat.</span> <span id="s617">I just don’t remember that anybody was there keeping watch, or- I just don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Your parents didn’t bother because they were sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: They were sick, they didn’t bother with us.</span> <span id="s620">It was really wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: It was for three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Really wonderful, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s625">I mean, you know, I remember it as a very happy experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Right.</span> <span id="s628">I was gleeful most of the time.</span> <span id="s629">And it was the first time in my life that I became interested in boys.</span> <span id="s630">And you know, there were boys there.</span> <span id="s631">I liked playing around with them.</span> <span id="s632">And- I mean, there was nothing that went on that was not proper, but I remember there were boys and I decided that I liked boys!</span> <span id="s633">(laughing) I was 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: (inaudible) why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: So I remember it as a happy trip.</span> <span id="s636">I remember that.</span> <span id="s637">But the arrival in the United States, was not a happy time.</span> <span id="s638">It was a very- it was really a very bleak day.</span> <span id="s639">And-.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: You didn’t see the Statue of Liberty or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s642">I-.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Were you looking for it?</span> <span id="s644">Was anybody talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: Yah, I remember that everybody ran up to see the Statue of Liberty but to me it had no significance.</span> <span id="s646">I was unhappy that I came to the United States instead of going to Eretz Israel, you know.</span> <span id="s647">I remember that.</span> <span id="s648">And I was also unhappy that the trip had come to an end and I had made friends-.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: To go back, weren’t you free in the D.P. camp?</span> <span id="s650">Did you have the run of the place there?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: So why would you be gleeful on the boat, when you’d been free for four years already?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: When you say ‘free’ as I say, during a lot of that time I was ill.</span> <span id="s654">You know, when I came down with T.B. I remember having to deal with doctors.</span> <span id="s655">I mean my mother took me to doctor’s a lot.</span> <span id="s656">And then I had to, when I went to the sanitarium I had to be in bed, and I was very confined.</span> <span id="s657">You know, that’s how they treated T.B. at that time.</span> <span id="s658">No medicine.</span> <span id="s659">Just bed rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: The last two years you were free, right?</span> <span id="s661">I mean, in the D.P. camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: No.</span> <span id="s663">By the time I came out, my parents were already in ?</span> <span id="s664">Felderfing?</span> <span id="s665">I would say, about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s666">What happened was, while I was in the sanitarium, I had gained a great deal of weight.</span> <span id="s667">That was another thing about the cure.</span> <span id="s668">You had to eat fattening food, and I became very heavy.</span> <span id="s669">So when I went back home, I mean, when I rejoined my family, I was quite heavy-set.</span> <span id="s670">I was a heavy-set adolescent.</span> <span id="s671">I was 12 years old, and I was heavy, and I was very unhappy with myself.</span> <span id="s672">You know, a lot of changes had occurred in my body.</span> <span id="s673">It was just a very unhappy time.</span> <span id="s674">I remember, my mother had to get clothes made for me.</span> <span id="s675">Oh- and you see, Esther was an adorable slender little girl.</span> <span id="s676">And there I was, you know, I was 12 years old, and I’m as tall as I’m now, and I was almost as fat as I was tall.</span> <span id="s677">I was, really- and it took a long time for the weight to go.</span> <span id="s678">And I felt very awkward during all that time.</span> <span id="s679">And I felt unattractive and unappealing, and I guess on that ship, I had- it was sort of if I had regained mine- as if I had found myself again.</span> <span id="s680">You know, I was back to normal size, and maybe that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s681">Because I remember being heavier than most of my friends and I mean, after I came out of the T.B. sanitarium.</span> <span id="s682">So that was not a very happy time.</span> <span id="s683">Before I went in, before I went into the sanitarium, you know, the beginning, I think I was just about coming out of my shell, and then I got sick (laughs).</span> <span id="s684">It was another set-back.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So now you came to the boat.</span> <span id="s686">It was a gray, dreary miserable day.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Yah, we arrived someplace on one of the docks and I remember that we came off the boat, and we were taken to a hotel on Madison Avenue and 27th Street.</span> <span id="s688">And it was called the Madison Avenue Hotel.</span> <span id="s689">It no longer exists.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Who took you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, it was arranged by the HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Who greeted you at the pier?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s694">There were a lit of official looking people you know, who- there were no relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Why didn’t your uncle come to greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I guess he didn’t know that we were arriving.</span> <span id="s697">But I remembered-.</span> <span id="s698">?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Any trouble getting through customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: So, you said, ‘I remembered.’</span> <span id="s702">?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: I remember that while we were at the hotel, Herman came to see us.</span> <span id="s704">My mother called him...he came with the car, he took us for a ride, I got extremely car-sick and he took us to a Horn and Hardart.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: ...I’d like to know what the hotel was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: The hotel was fairly nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: You had private rooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: We had the four of us, we were all in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: And there were other immigrants?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: And there were other immigrants who were there.</span> <span id="s711">And-.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: ...were any of these people on the boat not Jewish, on the S.S. Taylor?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s714">I think...not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: You went to the hotel, that was your first night in America, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Tell me, how did you get to the hotel?</span> <span id="s718">By car or something?</span> <span id="s719">By taxi?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: I think it was a bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Do you remember what it looked like to you when you came into New York?</span> <span id="s722">What did you think of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: It wasn’t pretty.</span> <span id="s724">It wasn’t pretty at all.</span> <span id="s725">It was not pretty.</span> <span id="s726">I remember thinking that it was- you see, I had been used to Munich and Munich was a very pretty town.</span> <span id="s727">Though it was bombed out, the bombed out buildings had their own attraction.</span> <span id="s728">But the areas that hadn’t been bombed-...I went to school in Munich so everyday I would get on the train and go to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: So, New York was not too impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: No.</span> <span id="s731">I thought New York was really ugly (laughing).</span> <span id="s732">I didn’t like it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: What was ugly?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: The street.</span> <span id="s735">There was nothing green.</span> <span id="s736">You know, there were no trees.</span> <span id="s737">I had been accustomed to a lot of greenery.</span> <span id="s738">The people seemed very dowdy.</span> <span id="s739">You know, the Germans were very well dressed.</span> <span id="s740">Even though it was after the war, people- that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s741">I thought the people were very dowdy.</span> <span id="s742">They were dressed in very unattractive clothing.</span> <span id="s743">The buildings weren’t attractive.</span> <span id="s744">The architecture- I’m always intrigued by architecture and in that area, on the way to that hotel, and in that area, particularly, I didn’t see anything pretty.</span> <span id="s745">But, what cheered me up, was to see some of the people from the boat in that hotel.</span> <span id="s746">And, particularly, this Baruch who I liked very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: He was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Right (laughing).</span> <span id="s749">So that made everything alright because after that, we used to walk all over.</span> <span id="s750">I remember we used to take these long walks, and I remember thinking that when we got to First Avenue and First Street, that would be the end of New York, because the streets seemed to go 27, 26, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s751">And then-.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: You were able to walk by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s754">Well not by myself.</span> <span id="s755">I walked with this boy Baruch.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: But your parents let you go around New York by yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yah.</span> <span id="s758">We didn’t have a sense of fear, you see.</span> <span id="s759">That was in a way that was very nice.</span> <span id="s760">I had felt- I felt very safe in New York.</span> <span id="s761">And though my first impression of it was that it was you know, a very ugly place, for instance, once I saw 42nd Street, I thought that was a marvelous street.</span> <span id="s762">You know, in those days, 42nd Street was the real center of New York as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s763">All those movie theatres, and what I remember particularly, is the Camel sign.</span> <span id="s764">Do you remember that?</span> <span id="s765">The camel with the smoke?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Ah-h-h-h!</span> <span id="s768">That was a real marvel to me.</span> <span id="s769">The smoke coming out of that face advertising, you know, Camel cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: You would walk there to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: What else struck you in those early days?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Not having to go to school.</span> <span id="s774">That was very nice (laughing).</span> <span id="s775">And I guess just being- you know, I felt a certain freedom.</span> <span id="s776">It was sort of an extension of the freedom I had felt on the boat, that I had no responsibilities.</span> <span id="s777">I had no duties, you see, when we were- prior to our going to the United States (in D.P. camp).</span> <span id="s778">I really had a heavy load.</span> <span id="s779">I was going to school, I was being tutored, my mother wasn’t well, we had to do a lot around the house.</span> <span id="s780">My mother, you see my mother was very strict.</span> <span id="s781">She wouldn’t let me read certain books.</span> <span id="s782">I mean, I had- you know, I wanted to read novels, and romantic novels particularly, and she wouldn’t- and I had to do it in secret because she sort of watched every move I made.</span> <span id="s783">And she wanted to who my friends were, and whether they were the right friends for me to associate with, and you know, I had to do my homework, and I had- life just seemed to be full of responsibilities, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Who were the right friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Whoever my mother considered to be a right friend, who’s parents were the right people.</span> <span id="s786">And I don’t know what criteria my mother used to determine that, you know, that this girl’s parents were the right people.</span> <span id="s787">I really don’t know what criteria she used.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Did it matter, for example, what country they came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Well I think to her mattered how they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s790">You see, if they spoke Polish in an educated fashion, then they were alright.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: She, herself, had been educated in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s795">That’s right.</span> <span id="s796">That was the thing.</span> <span id="s797">I mean, people whom she didn’t consider to be in her class, were not proper friends for me.</span> <span id="s798">She was very (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s799">sensarus?)</span> <span id="s800">about that.</span> <span id="s801">There were just some children she didn’t want me to associate with.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: That continued in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s804">Except, you see in America, she really had no way of judging people, so it really couldn’t continue.</span> <span id="s805">She wanted it to continue in America.</span> <span id="s806">But in America, I became much more rebellious.</span> <span id="s807">You have to understand that in America, I sort of became a helpmate to my parents because I learned the language, and they needed to make use of it.</span> <span id="s808">Although they learned the language they weren’t as proficient in writing as quickly as I was because I went into school.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Were they appreciative of your position?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Or did they resent having to depend on you.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No.</span> <span id="s813">No.</span> <span id="s814">They were very appreciative.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Why did you become rebellious?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: I suppose I started feeling my oats.</span> <span id="s817">I felt that if I was so terrific in one way, why couldn’t I be terrific in picking my friends (laughing).</span> <span id="s818">It backfired a little.</span> <span id="s819">But, basically, they had no way of judging whether an American girl or boy was appropriate for me or not.</span> <span id="s820">Except when they were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s821">If they were not Jewish, they were not appropriate.</span> <span id="s822">And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: You went to Horn and Hardart?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeh!</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s826">That was like your first day here?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: No, it was not a first day here.</span> <span id="s828">It was shortly after we got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: (inaudible) you seem to remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Well I remember it because again, it was something very new and novel in my life, that you could insert coins and get food.</span> <span id="s831">First of all, when we were in Europe- when we were in Poland, I remember eating in restaurants.</span> <span id="s832">But when we were in Germany, I never remember- very rarely do I remember going into restaurants in Germany.</span> <span id="s833">And, so that in itself was very interesting.</span> <span id="s834">And the fact that there were not waiters, you know that they had this whole counter full of food, or that you could insert coins, and, and- this plate- you would open up the little window and you could pull out the food.</span> <span id="s835">That was- something that I had never seen before.</span> <span id="s836">So that was remarkable.</span> <span id="s837">The Horn and Hardart was remarkable.</span> <span id="s838">And then you see, Uncle Herman took us to the Bronx on the Henry Hudson Parkway.</span> <span id="s839">And I remember distinctly that the sun was setting, you know it was sort of dusk, and it was, it was beautiful.</span> <span id="s840">The Hudson was beautiful, and the park, and Riverside Park on the other side, that was beautiful.</span> <span id="s841">And, I had an eye for these things, you know.</span> <span id="s842">I always had an eye for these things, even when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s843">So, that was very pretty and where he lived, Moshulu Parkway, lots of trees and that was very pretty.</span> <span id="s844">So I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: So I guess even if the sore point about him not helping out was sort of-.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Well I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s847">That time I didn’t know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Once you came, and he extended himself he wanted-.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yes, he did.</span> <span id="s850">He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: He probably felt a little bad himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: I guess.</span> <span id="s853">He said to me...I became close with Uncle Herman.</span> <span id="s854">He said that once we were here-.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">End of Tape #1, Side B Tape #2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: When you were in the hotel, there were other people in the hotel, your friend was there, Baruch Markman.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: When you walked around Manhattan every day, how far could you walk?</span> <span id="s859">I mean, weren’t you afraid, like you’d get lost- you didn’t know the language?</span> <span id="s860">Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Well the interesting thing was, he was two years older than I was.</span> <span id="s862">He was 16 to my 14.</span> <span id="s863">And he was a very adventurous, you know very cocky sort of fellow.</span> <span id="s864">And, I felt very comfortable following him around.</span> <span id="s865">So, we walked- I also remember that we took buses.</span> <span id="s866">I think it was a dime or a nickel at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: What was your impression, for example you had never seen black people before had you?</span> <span id="s868">Except for soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Well, I had seen black soldiers in Germany and actually, my big wonder at black people was when I saw the soldiers in Germany- and actually I was well disposed towards the blacks, because these soldiers were very kind.</span> <span id="s870">They would give us candy and chewing gum and they were- we were not fearful of them...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: You saw them as benefactors?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Right.</span> <span id="s873">A positive reaction to them.</span> <span id="s874">So when I came to the United States, the interesting thing is, that our wanderings around lower Manhattan, which extended I would say, up to 42nd Street, perhaps a little bit higher than 42nd Street.</span> <span id="s875">We didn’t see many black people.</span> <span id="s876">Or at least, I don’t recall seeing many black people.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Did you ever go down to the lower East Side where Jews lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s879">Not at the time we were-.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did you go to the Empire State Building?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: We didn’t go up the Empire State Building.</span> <span id="s882">We only went in front of it and we looked up in great amazement at these tall buildings.</span> <span id="s883">I had never- neither one of us had ever seen such height.</span> <span id="s884">So, but we didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s885">You know, we didn’t really have any money, so we pretty much did what we could on foot.</span> <span id="s886">We didn’t go any further.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: You were suppose to go to school, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Well, eventually.</span> <span id="s889">Except that we arrived here in March and that’s why I say, these were- I think it was March and April they were two wonderful months.</span> <span id="s890">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s891">They were carefree.</span> <span id="s892">My parents, I don’t remember what Esther was doing, but at least I wasn’t responsible for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: She’s younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: She’s younger...about two years...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: You didn’t take her along with you on these trips?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: I guess because I wasn’t forced to.</span> <span id="s899">Because I remember that later on when we had the apartment and so on, I was required to sort of administer to Esther.</span> <span id="s900">But during those months, during those two months-.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: What was that like, having a step-sister that you never had before, suddenly walk into your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Well that happened in Germany, and I loved it.</span> <span id="s903">One of the things- you see, when my mother married Fred, Esther wasn’t with him.</span> <span id="s904">That’s a story.</span> <span id="s905">Fred survived on Aryan papers.</span> <span id="s906">So he was in the open in Poland.</span> <span id="s907">And He really couldn’t take care of Esther because he was a widower, his wife had perished in the Ghetto- so he passed her off as his child, and he left her in the Cloister across the street from where I was hidden...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: You never knew that- ?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Because she never...you didn’t meet until after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Right.</span> <span id="s912">That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Your mother knew Fred from before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: She didn’t know him from before the war.</span> <span id="s915">The interesting thing was, that after the war, Fred came to ?</span> <span id="s916">Shvorsk?</span> <span id="s917">to visit Esther.</span> <span id="s918">He had been coming all the time.</span> <span id="s919">And after the war, he heard via the grapevine that there was a Jewish woman with a child in town.</span> <span id="s920">So he knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s921">He came to visit.</span> <span id="s922">And that’s how Fred came into our lives.</span> <span id="s923">And he told my mother how he survived the war, and that his daughter was in the Cloister, and Esther came to visit us, and ran away from us because for some reason she discovered that we were Jewish so she ran to the Cloister and informed the nuns that she didn’t want to come back to us ever again, because we were Jews...so they somehow put two and two together.</span> <span id="s924">They knew who Kestenaver?</span> <span id="s925">Was.</span> <span id="s926">You know my mother, they knew who she was, they knew she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s927">And they felt that, if my father had placed his daughter with us, then he must be Jewish also.</span> <span id="s928">So then they gave him an ultimatum.</span> <span id="s929">Either you let us convert her, or you have to take her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: He had already placed her with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No.</span> <span id="s932">He didn’t place her with us.</span> <span id="s933">He just had her visit us for Christmas vacation because it was after the war...</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: ...so March and April passed.</span> <span id="s935">What were your parents doing?</span> <span id="s936">Were they just hanging around the hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: No.</span> <span id="s938">I think they were looking for an apartment.</span> <span id="s939">They were going to the HIAS.</span> <span id="s940">And they were I think, trying to get their bearings.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Was HIAS helpful to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s943">Very helpful.</span> <span id="s944">First of all, they paid for the hotel while we were staying there.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: It was a decent hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s947">It was a decent hotel.</span> <span id="s948">It was fine...27th Street and Madison Avenue...but New York didn’t appear fearful.</span> <span id="s949">You know, I was not afraid of New York.</span> <span id="s950">It did not appear to be a fearful place.</span> <span id="s951">After that first initial day that we arrived in New York , where it was bleak and dreary, and- I just felt very unsettled.</span> <span id="s952">I remember after that, I felt very comfortable in New York.</span> <span id="s953">I really came to like New York.</span> <span id="s954">I came to enjoy it’s largeness and diversification.</span> <span id="s955">You know, there were so many- it had so many different looks.</span> <span id="s956">You know Manhattan was different.</span> <span id="s957">We went to visit relatives in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s958">That was different.</span> <span id="s959">We went to visit Uncle Herman in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s960">And that was different.</span> <span id="s961">And we went to visit...on the Upper West Side...Fred’s brother on 105th Street...and it all had a different look about it.</span> <span id="s962">And I fell in love with Manhattan, and I remember telling my parents that I only wanted to live in Manhattan.</span> <span id="s963">I didn’t want to live in the Bronx, and I didn’t want to live in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s964">I only wanted to live in Manhattan.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Your wish wasn’t really Park Avenue?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: But I didn’t really get to see Park Avenue until I started going to Hunter College.</span> <span id="s967">I didn’t see-.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: So, you did see, though, a nice part of Manhattan, around in the 30’s and everything but it was more industrial, more work place.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yah, you know that area is not beautiful around Madison Avenue, Park Avenue.</span> <span id="s970">Although, you know which is a nice area, the area around Washington Irving High School.</span> <span id="s971">That was in that area.</span> <span id="s972">And I remember being very much taken with that...what is that area down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Gramercy Park.</span> <span id="s974">Do you remember the first time that anybody came up to you and said anything to you about being a survivor or having come from the D.P. camps, do you remember anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Well everybody was extremely interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: In what way (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Well naturally the people that we came over on the boat with were all survivors.</span> <span id="s978">And it wasn’t discussed very much.</span> <span id="s979">I don’t remember hearing- the adults talked about it a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: These people who you said before were very interested in what happened, who were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Well actually that happened later, when I started going to school.</span> <span id="s982">The people I met during the time we were in the hotel, I mean, for instance, we were visiting...the relatives didn’t ask me ...it was, once I started school, my classmates were very interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: By then you were already living in an apartment when you started school, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: March and April passed.</span> <span id="s986">What happened in May and June?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well, at the end of April we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s988">This was 1951...On 175 Claremont Avenue.</span> <span id="s989">That was it.</span> <span id="s990">I was in my glory.</span> <span id="s991">Because we were living in Manhattan, and I just-.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: What was the neighborhood like in those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: ...Broadway was the dividing line.</span> <span id="s994">West of Broadway where we lived it was all white.</span> <span id="s995">And east of Broadway, it was all black.</span> <span id="s996">(laughs) I mean, really.</span> <span id="s997">Tenement black.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: Puerto Ricans?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Well no.</span> <span id="s1000">Not in my area...up where I was it was strictly black.</span> <span id="s1001">Strictly black.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: It was Harlem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes, it was Harlem.</span> <span id="s1004">I was not afraid of the blacks.</span> <span id="s1005">I did not fear them at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: At night you could cross the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: I could cross the street.</span> <span id="s1008">I did not feel fearful of them at all.</span> <span id="s1009">That came really, much, much later.</span> <span id="s1010">My mother and I used to walk down 125th Street, all the way over to Lenox Avenue where- when we had to pay a Con Edison bill...the telephone bill later on...they had lots of big stores there.</span> <span id="s1011">We used to go and shop- I was not fearful of the blacks.</span> <span id="s1012">In fact, when I started school, at George Washington High School, which was in May, you can imagine, May, it was the end of- practically the end of the term.</span> <span id="s1013">The teacher assigned a black girl to be my guide.</span> <span id="s1014">To take me around to the different classes...</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: What was your English like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: My English was terrible!</span> <span id="s1017">That’s why I had a great deal of difficulty communicating, yet I remember that many of these kids were very patient and very interested in me.</span> <span id="s1018">There just didn’t seem to be that many foreign students at George Washington High School at that time.</span> <span id="s1019">But they did have a class called, ‘English for Foreigners.’</span> <span id="s1020">And that’s where they put me.</span> <span id="s1021">They did not put me in an English class.</span> <span id="s1022">But they gave me Science, Math, for a foreign language I took Hebrew...I was a freshman for two months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Did you have to repeat the Freshman year in September?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: My report card at the end of the freshman year had 65, 65, 65, -they gave me credit- because the last year I went to school in Germany...it was also a school for Displaced People, where they- the report card was written in Hebrew and in English, so that if I went to Israel the marks were in Hebrew, and if I went to the United States, the marks were in English.</span> <span id="s1025">And when my report card was presented to...George Washington H.S. administration, they were very impressed.</span> <span id="s1026">I had Latin...Algebra...</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did you have, like a passion, for education?</span> <span id="s1028">Did you feel it was very important to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No.</span> <span id="s1030">I didn’t have a passion, but it had been installed in me that it was very important to learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Well, my mother constantly had these tutors for me...</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Did the other people in the D.P. camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No.</span> <span id="s1035">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: In other words, all the people there had a passion for education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1038">The children were, they were constantly, no matter how make-shift it was, there was some form of education going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: When you went to George Washington High School- did you feel that your aspirations or attitudes towards school were any different than that of your classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: I wasn’t perceptive enough at the time to view the other kids.</span> <span id="s1041">You have to understand, that I was too involved with myself.</span> <span id="s1042">Things were too strange for me.</span> <span id="s1043">I was in a strange country.</span> <span id="s1044">I was using a strange language.</span> <span id="s1045">The faces were different-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Then you came back in the fall.</span> <span id="s1047">What did you do in the summer?</span> <span id="s1048">You just hung around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No.</span> <span id="s1050">Actually, partly I hung around.</span> <span id="s1051">But- we were sent to a camp from Jewish Federation Camp, it was called Camp Edaliah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: You and Esther?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: ...where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: In Bear Mountains...</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: What was the camp like?</span> <span id="s1057">Was it a camp for children of other Holocaust families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1059">no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: They just asked Federation to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: I don’t know how my mother found out about it, but she did.</span> <span id="s1062">And for 3 weeks I went to a summer camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: And did people there ask you about what happened to you during World War Two?</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1065">Oh, they were so taken with me.</span> <span id="s1066">I tell you, they-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: Who was taken with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: The counselors mainly, because-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Do you remember what they said to you, what you told them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Well, they were always sort of displaying me.</span> <span id="s1071">I was sort of a wonder child.</span> <span id="s1072">You see, here I was in the country only since March, and I was already able to read English, so that on Friday night when we had- we sort of had an oneg Shabbat, and we would all gather you know, around the flagpole and they would have you read a piece from the Bible.</span> <span id="s1073">I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s1074">And I remember it being very difficult, because Bible reading is not like reading from fiction or non-fiction.</span> <span id="s1075">It was very- I remember this one counselor practicing with me.</span> <span id="s1076">And they would announce the fact that, this Cina, they called me...</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Ciona, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: No...I came here as Ciona.</span> <span id="s1079">But...the administrators in the school agreed that that was an impossible name.</span> <span id="s1080">So they took the ‘o’ out of my name, and they called me ‘Cina’ and that was my name...</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: So, the counselors prepared you, and you were suppose to read it in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Well...the Hebrew was very easy.</span> <span id="s1083">Then I had to read the translation in English.</span> <span id="s1084">And the translation was very difficult (laughing).</span> <span id="s1085">I mean, the biblical translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Did anyone make fun of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: No, nobody made fun of me.</span> <span id="s1088">That was it.</span> <span id="s1089">It was a very nice environment.</span> <span id="s1090">And, they taught me to swim.</span> <span id="s1091">That was the most wonderful thing.</span> <span id="s1092">They taught me to swim.</span> <span id="s1093">And, really, to swim well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: You never swam before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1096">So I learned to swim, and generally, it was wonderful for me because I realized that I really enjoyed sports.</span> <span id="s1097">And summer camps are very sports oriented.</span> <span id="s1098">All those ball games, and the hiking and the sleeping outdoors, and the over-nights, sleep-outs, it was just- it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1099">It was just- it was a child’s dream come true, really.</span> <span id="s1100">Although I was an adolescent at this point, it’s something that I guess, perhaps I would have enjoyed doing as a child, but never had the opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Did you find that when they asked you questions, did they ask any questions that were kind of silly- because they didn’t know, out of ignorance...or in school later on in the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: What happened in camp was, they weren’t silly, but they couldn’t imagine what had happened.</span> <span id="s1103">I think that it was very difficult for them to understand.</span> <span id="s1104">That I was confined to one place, for a period of about two years.</span> <span id="s1105">You see.</span> <span id="s1106">I don’t think that they believed.</span> <span id="s1107">It was painful for me.</span> <span id="s1108">I remember that distinctly that when I came here, and all these people were asking me what had happened to me during the war, it was painful for me to tell them the story, because when I was telling them that, I realized that it was incomprehensible to them.</span> <span id="s1109">And you know, in those early years, after the war, I really had this very strong sense that they did not believe me.</span> <span id="s1110">And it’s not that they thought that I was lying, but they simply- it was too horrible.</span> <span id="s1111">It was- it was-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: You weren’t in Auschwitz, so what were you describing to them that was so horrible?</span> <span id="s1113">That you were hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: That I couldn’t go out.</span> <span id="s1115">That I was- that you know, I was...in danger because I was Jewish, and I couldn’t go out and there were people who wanted to kill me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Do you remember anyone reacting to you in a funny way, when you were telling them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: What I remember was, that they didn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1118">Once I said- I had this sense that it was very unpleasant, and they didn’t want to deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Couldn’t deal with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Well, I didn’t know at that time they couldn’t deal with it.</span> <span id="s1121">I see it now...at that time I could see that the interest would sort of wane.</span> <span id="s1122">I really had a sense that they really didn’t believe me, and I became very defensive about it.</span> <span id="s1123">And after I..</span> <span id="s1124">.</span> <span id="s1125">had a few of these experiences, when people asked me about the war, I just said, ‘Well, it was very unpleasant.’</span> <span id="s1126">And I left it at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: These experiences you had in school as well as in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1129">But more in camp than in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: I think in camp there was more leisure...and school the environment was more structured.</span> <span id="s1132">There were more common things to talk about.</span> <span id="s1133">There were the classes, the teachers, you don’t have that much time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Did it ever happen that you had given a paper to do in school, an assignment in English where you’re supposed to talk about learning experiences in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: No.</span> <span id="s1136">Never.</span> <span id="s1137">Never.</span> <span id="s1138">The teachers never asked me in a classroom to express what had happened during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Did you find that any particular group of kids seemed more interested in what had happened to you during the war than another?</span> <span id="s1140">Jewish kids, Black kids, Irish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Not the Black kids, and definitely not the Irish kids.</span> <span id="s1142">And not too many of the Jewish kids (laughs).</span> <span id="s1143">- I would say there was a casual interest.</span> <span id="s1144">There was not a very deep interest-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Did you learn anything about in school- did they teach it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">AL No.</span> <span id="s1147">History class never came that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">Q: What factors do you think were most helpful or not helpful to your adaptation to life in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: The fact is, that what helped with my adaptation, it was very specific.</span> <span id="s1150">And that is, the goal on the part of everybody that I came together with, seemed to be to assimilate into the culture and society of America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: The goal of whom (inaudible)...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Teachers, of friends, the relatives.</span> <span id="s1153">What was the term?</span> <span id="s1154">Americanize, I think.</span> <span id="s1155">I’m pretty sure that that was it.</span> <span id="s1156">That everybody said the tone, or the climate was- you have to Americanize.</span> <span id="s1157">You have to become like an American girl.</span> <span id="s1158">That was it.</span> <span id="s1159">Become like an American girl, dress like an American girl, speak like an American girl.</span> <span id="s1160">But don’t do the things that American girls do.</span> <span id="s1161">Like my parents, for instance.</span> <span id="s1162">They didn’t want me to date.</span> <span id="s1163">You know, they didn’t want me to go out with boys.</span> <span id="s1164">They didn’t want me to stay out late.</span> <span id="s1165">They- (laughing).</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: Just be American.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: But be American!</span> <span id="s1168">(laughing)...the teachers completely discouraged any foreign characteristics.</span> <span id="s1169">The retention of foreign characteristics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: You spoke with an accent, certainly in the early years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Terr- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Were you embarrassed about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: No.</span> <span id="s1174">As a matter of fact, that was another sort of distinctive part about me.</span> <span id="s1175">You know, teenagers always want to be special, or at least I think that teenagers...I think that kids in some way, seek their own identity.</span> <span id="s1176">And that was one thing that I always had.</span> <span id="s1177">I always had an identity because I did have an accent, people would immediately- people’s ears would prick up.</span> <span id="s1178">If I was at a party, for instance, boys would immediately- oh!</span> <span id="s1179">And I was always a very nice approach.</span> <span id="s1180">‘Oh, you have a very nice- you have a cute accent,’ or something.</span> <span id="s1181">‘Where are you from?’</span> <span id="s1182">It was sort of easy to start a conversation with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Where did you say you were from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Well, I would say I’m from Germany.</span> <span id="s1185">I came from Germany.</span> <span id="s1186">I was born in Poland, you know, and then they would start asking questions, but nobody really ever questioned me that about World War Two, and I think that the kids here at that time really didn’t know very much about World War Two.</span> <span id="s1187">I became convinced that that was a fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: So, those things were helpful, that people were trying to help you adapt.</span> <span id="s1189">Did you have any special problems when you first came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Well, I had a language problem...in school.</span> <span id="s1191">I was very timid because I always felt that I was different.</span> <span id="s1192">On the one hand it hand...I would say in a social setting, my accent being foreign was helpful.</span> <span id="s1193">But other than that, I was very timid because in school, I had a great deal of difficulty in school.</span> <span id="s1194">For instances, they put me in a biology class and I didn’t understand anything about biology.</span> <span id="s1195">The only way I made it through biology and passed the regents, is that I really committed pages and pages of it to memory.</span> <span id="s1196">That was the only way I was able to get through biology.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Were you timid by nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1199">I certainly was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Were you a shy person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: I was very shy.</span> <span id="s1202">Well, I think it had a lot to do, with first of all being alone for a number of years, and even after the war being with my mother, not really being among other children, not having a great deal of opportunity to talk.</span> <span id="s1203">I was very quiet.</span> <span id="s1204">I really didn’t speak very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Was Esther also, that shy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: No.</span> <span id="s1207">Esther was never shy...</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q: So, they gave you monetary assistance, when you came- HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: HIAS gave us monetary assistance.</span> <span id="s1210">But of course we also came in with money because my mother was able to recover a good bit of the money that my father had buried as I told you, and we came into the United States with gold pieces sewed into all our clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: (inaudible) did they see them when you went through customs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: You didn’t tell them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No!</span> <span id="s1215">(laughing) I mean, my mother was very clever about that.</span> <span id="s1216">She would put it in the hands of coats where it wasn’t very noticeable.</span> <span id="s1217">Hands-of-arms, sleeves...because we came as Displaced Persons, I don’t think that our thing was scrutinized that greatly...</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Why did you keep them sewed in there.</span> <span id="s1219">Did you think that your mother was afraid that they’d take them away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1221">I don’t think that my mother felt secure in bringing it in openly, and it really helped us too.</span> <span id="s1222">HIAS was very helpful, but the point is that they certainly- they pay for the hotel and I think they helped us financially until Fred got some sort of job.</span> <span id="s1223">And they helped him get a job.</span> <span id="s1224">They weren’t exactly munificent in there-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">Q: Did you see any social workers when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1227">I had nothing to do with any social workers.</span> <span id="s1228">Strictly my parents.</span> <span id="s1229">In fact, I didn’t even know until some years later, when I asked my mother what happened when we came here, and she explained that HIAS was a help.</span> <span id="s1230">She always felt that we should make charitable contributions to the HIAS and she explained why...</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">Q: (inaudible) that was important to their help, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Oh, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1233">Look, they took us off the boat.</span> <span id="s1234">They settled us in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1235">They gave us a stipend for food.</span> <span id="s1236">And shelter.</span> <span id="s1237">I think it’s a wonderful organization.</span> <span id="s1238">I mean, imagine if we shad arrived here by ourselves, without language, coming in to New York City without relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: ...were you- they offered any psychological counseling at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Your parents might have been offered and they turned it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: How did you find the apartment...by coincidence (inaudible) HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: No.</span> <span id="s1245">No.</span> <span id="s1246">As a matter of fact, in that respect, Joe Helmreich was very helpful.</span> <span id="s1247">Joe lived in an apartment, and his landlord owned that building that we moved into on Claremont Avenue.</span> <span id="s1248">And Joe is the one who signed for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Why did he have to sign for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Because we didn’t have- my parents weren’t working at the time, and there was no visible means of income and so he wanted to be sure, the landlord wanted to be sure that he would get his rent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You felt pretty wanted when you came here didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Yeh, yes.</span> <span id="s1253">I did not feel rejected.</span> <span id="s1254">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s1255">You know, meeting all these new members of the family.</span> <span id="s1256">Everybody was very kind and very welcoming.</span> <span id="s1257">I can’t really remember- I would say that at first, other than the difficulty of the language, and the customs, and the summer heat, which I was totally unaccustomed to, I mean, the New York summer heat, was unbearable (laughs).</span> <span id="s1258">But, Riverside Drive Park, was a wonderland.</span> <span id="s1259">We spent a lot of time in Riverside Park Drive.</span> <span id="s1260">We used to have picnics there, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: (inaudible) picnics there?</span> <span id="s1262">When, Sunday- Saturday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Oh, sometimes when it was very hot, my parents, you know we would pack a meal and go to Riverside Park Drive and eat it there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Did you go with friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yes, not my friends.</span> <span id="s1266">My parent’s friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Who were your parent’s friends?</span> <span id="s1268">Were they people from the neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: There was some people they knew who had come over, also from Germany.</span> <span id="s1270">Not on the same boat.</span> <span id="s1271">But people they had known in Germany who came within a month or so.</span> <span id="s1272">And we would all meet, and they all lived on the west Side, I guess, and so we would meet at a designated spot, and it was-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: How many couples would there be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: Three, four, five.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Where was the spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: It was- you know where Grant’s Tomb is?</span> <span id="s1277">Well if you cross the street in Riverside Drive, down from Grant’s Tomb, there is a grassy sort of- I remember, it was a little bit on an incline, and they would spread out there, and you know, get the nice breeze from the Hudson, if there was a breeze, because there was no air conditioning.</span> <span id="s1278">And, Europeans you know like the outdoors, and picnicking and eating outdoors was very much their lifestyle, and so we did that the first few years we were in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And they made sandwiches and things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yeh.</span> <span id="s1281">Sandwiches, fruit...my mother was a very good baker.</span> <span id="s1282">And there was cross sharing, and it was really nice.</span> <span id="s1283">And you see, it was before the time when everybody became intensely involved in making a living, what was called here, ‘making a living.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: When life ceased to be gracious.</span> <span id="s1286">At that time, life was still gracious.</span> <span id="s1287">People didn’t have very much.</span> <span id="s1288">But there was a great deal of cross visiting, (all immigrants (unable to translate) it recreates community (unable to translate) and there was- we couldn’t go out to restaurants.</span> <span id="s1289">There was no money to go to restaurants.</span> <span id="s1290">Going to movies- I don’t remember when was the first time I went to the movies here.</span> <span id="s1291">That was a great big treat.</span> <span id="s1292">But going to the park, playing cards, or we would play dominos, we would play checkers.</span> <span id="s1293">Somebody would bring a set of dominos, somebody would bring a checker game, somebody would bring cards.</span> <span id="s1294">And there was all this activity going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: What kind of cards did they play there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Rummy.</span> <span id="s1297">Some kind of Rummy-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: They would sit on folding chairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: No.</span> <span id="s1300">On blankets.</span> <span id="s1301">Everybody brought blankets...</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: (inaudible)...dominos and blankets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: ...dominos was a big, you know, that was a big game.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: How often did you do this?</span> <span id="s1305">Every week?</span> <span id="s1306">For a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1308">Weather permitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Every Saturday, Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: No, it wasn’t necessarily even Saturday or Sunday.</span> <span id="s1311">It would even be during the week-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Your parents weren’t working then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: They were looking for a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: They were looking for a job, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Did they look less hard, I mean, did they enjoy this life.</span> <span id="s1317">Did they feel that-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: No.</span> <span id="s1319">They looked hard.</span> <span id="s1320">I mean, not my mother, I mean, my mother- they were learning English.</span> <span id="s1321">I mean, they immediately somehow got into some...evening courses where they went to learn.</span> <span id="s1322">And my mother immediately went and she learned to be a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s1323">First she got a job in a factory.</span> <span id="s1324">She got a job first...her health was not up to that kind of rigor, going in early, and sitting in- there was no air conditioning then.</span> <span id="s1325">It was heated, and she had learned- you see in Germany while we were in the D.P. camp she had learned to sew.</span> <span id="s1326">Fred had learned to do carpentry with the idea that when they went to Israel, they would have to have some manual skills to earn a living- she got a job in a factory.</span> <span id="s1327">And that was it, you see, the factory, even though she worked- I think they started early in the morning, they came out early, so in the evening, we would all go down to Riverside Drive.</span> <span id="s1328">There was no television.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: But you didn’t have a picnic then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: Yes...that was evening activity.</span> <span id="s1331">Because summertime- it was still light for many hours-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: In this place where you had this, were there other families too, who were doing the same thing in the grassy area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: I don’t remember...there was one family with a child.</span> <span id="s1334">But mostly there was just the adults, and Esther and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: What do you mean the adults?</span> <span id="s1336">You mean the other families too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yah, the other couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: They lived in various parts of (inaudible) Manhattan, Riverside Drive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: Yah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: But there weren’t other groups of immigrant couples scattered throughout, who also would engage in this activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: No...this was just this one particular spot where we would gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: This group of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s1345">Play dominos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I played dominos, I played checkers.</span> <span id="s1347">I didn’t play cards at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: Each of these families had kids and they played with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: They didn’t- no.</span> <span id="s1350">Not each of the families had kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: It was just you and Esther.</span> <span id="s1352">And you just joined the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: Pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: But you looked forward to it?</span> <span id="s1355">You enjoyed it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yes, I guess we enjoyed the outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: In fact your mother made dinner there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: We brought food along.</span> <span id="s1359">I don’t remember what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: ...and you would stay there until it got dark and then you’d go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: And you might do this twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: ...when we came...it was March, by the time we moved in, it was May, and it was into the summer months, and then it was early Fall, and then- so actually, we came here at a time when daylight was getting longer, and the days were very pretty.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: When you started school, did you continue going down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yes...I made one friend in school.</span> <span id="s1366">She was also a survivor, except she was from Vienna, and she had spent her war years in Italy.</span> <span id="s1367">And, the reason we took to each other was that we both spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Your major language then was German or Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: German.</span> <span id="s1370">When I came here it was definitely German.</span> <span id="s1371">But, you see it was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1372">My mother immediately encouraged us to (inaudible) speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">End of Tape #2, Side A Tape #2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: It was always, ‘speak English,’ ‘speak English,’ you know, from the moment we started school, Esther and I, and my parents were taking courses.</span> <span id="s1375">It was always, ‘speak English,’ ‘speak English,’ and in a way it’s too bad because I think because I was pretty proficient in German, and I was proficient in Polish, and I lost it.</span> <span id="s1376">I really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Which people would you say, had the greatest imprint on your life in younger years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Well, Uncle Herman certainly did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: He’s a dominant personality.</span> <span id="s1383">He and Tanta Deborah, they were sort of gay and carefree...he was here 14 years by the time we came here...They were very approving, they were loving, they were magnanimous...everything was, ‘Oh yes darling.’</span> <span id="s1384">Everything was ‘Yes darling.’</span> <span id="s1385">...everything we did was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1386">Whatever Esther and I said or did, was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1387">And, I guess, because he was the oldest brother, and maybe because he was compensating for the fact that he had been less than encouraging about his sister coming here, and probably because he wanted to hear about what happened to the rest of the family, and my mother was really the last one who had seen the family, and because she was the youngest sister.</span> <span id="s1388">They became a force in our lives.</span> <span id="s1389">And also because he had a car.</span> <span id="s1390">That was the other thing, he had a car.</span> <span id="s1391">When we were in camp that first summer, he brought my parents to visit- That was a big event, because nobody came to visit their children in camp.</span> <span id="s1392">They only went away for two or three weeks I guess, and the parents didn’t come to visit.</span> <span id="s1393">Well, one day, unexpectedly, there was Uncle Herman with my mother and Fred.</span> <span id="s1394">Coming to visit us...and also, you see, Anita became a force in my life.</span> <span id="s1395">Anita took me to school.</span> <span id="s1396">She registered me in school.</span> <span id="s1397">And your mother.</span> <span id="s1398">You see, your mother was someone who’s company I enjoyed because she was very interested in everything we did, Esther and I.</span> <span id="s1399">You know, I remember she would question me very specifically about school, and how I, you know, and when we came to visit, she wanted to know specifically what I wanted to eat...she was sincerely interested.</span> <span id="s1400">I felt that very specifically...and Mark was close to my age...I was fascinated by the stories he was telling me...</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: ...did you ever have nightmares from what you went through at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: I don’t remember having nightmares at that time.</span> <span id="s1403">The nightmares really came later.</span> <span id="s1404">It was interesting...</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Later, meaning when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: When I was in college.</span> <span id="s1407">They started coming when I was in college and they’re still coming.</span> <span id="s1408">In fact, when this whole Holocaust issue- at that time, of course we didn’t call it a Holocaust, you know, it was World War Two.</span> <span id="s1409">I don’t really remember when ‘Holocaust’ came into existence.</span> <span id="s1410">I don’t know...and when it became a subject that became a greater interest to the population here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1411">I found that I started remembering more, and having nightmares.</span> <span id="s1412">And, really, it’s- I’m surprised that I still have nightmares about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: What do you remember- I don’t know if you remember your dreams when you wake up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: I don’t really remember, but really, I wake up in a sweat, and it seems so real, this, this whole business of- I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s1415">One of the things that I dream about, that seems to be a recurring dream.</span> <span id="s1416">Is something that happened to me, really, when I was a very small child.</span> <span id="s1417">When the ‘Krupas?’</span> <span id="s1418">gave me to this family who lived in the country, they were near the forest, and I remember walking.</span> <span id="s1419">I was able to walk from the farm there was a- I remember that distinctly, there was a running brook, with a little bridge, and once you went over there behind you was the forest.</span> <span id="s1420">And I used to enjoy going there, and I remember one day, seeing this horrible looking person, who I assumed was a Jew who was hiding.</span> <span id="s1421">And, I can’t describe it.</span> <span id="s1422">I can’t describe that- it was, you know, I can’t even remember if it was a man or a woman.</span> <span id="s1423">But I remember that it was a human figure, that seemed so frightened at seeing me, or at being discovered.</span> <span id="s1424">And, and just you know, running.</span> <span id="s1425">And I still dream that.</span> <span id="s1426">And I remember thinking at that time, that this must be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1427">This must be a Jew.</span> <span id="s1428">And that I wasn’t suppose to tell anybody that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1429">And, I still dream about that.</span> <span id="s1430">You know, this is something that I still dream about.</span> <span id="s1431">And I’m so furious when I wake up that I should so many years later, I mean, you know, this is what- 40-45 years later?</span> <span id="s1432">And I’m still dreaming about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: What makes you furious about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Well it makes me angry because it’s such an uncomfortable dream.</span> <span id="s1435">And so I don’t have to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Would like to erase it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1438">I don’t want to have these.</span> <span id="s1439">I don’t want to have these dreams.</span> <span id="s1440">I don’t want to remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Do you think that the attention that’s focused on the Holocaust brought back bad memories in an unnecessary way?</span> <span id="s1442">Like you, didn’t dream about this, right before all these shows began, and the Eichman Trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1444">No, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1445">And I tell you frankly, I can’t- for instance I tried to watch Shoah- I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1446">I mean, I was in constant- I was crying so hard, and it evoked so many unpleasant memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: Especially a lot of it takes place in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: In Poland, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1449">And what it particularly- you see, after the war, in Poland when I learned to read in Polish there was a lot of sort of yellow journalism that was coming out at that time about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1450">Now, I had been a small child.</span> <span id="s1451">And I had had my own unique experience.</span> <span id="s1452">But I didn’t really know what had happened to the other people during the war.</span> <span id="s1453">When I started reading, and I started reading about these horrible things that happened to my people, the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1454">And as a child, I didn’t have a strong identity being a Jew but I knew that I was one of these people.</span> <span id="s1455">But I think what horrified me was to read that people- other human beings could be such,- act in such beastly way towards other human beings, and degrade them in that way.</span> <span id="s1456">And humiliate them, and it’s- I think that that was even more horrible than what I experienced personally.</span> <span id="s1457">Because what I experienced personally, I thought, as I said my senses were kind of dulled and you know, I didn’t experience my own pain but I couldn’t accept that other people were treated in such an inhumane way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: I suppose you felt doubly lucky that you weren’t caught, because you would have been treated that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Well consciously I don’t know if that was what I thought.</span> <span id="s1460">But I had this, this terrible sense of pain when I read about how people were treated in concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Did you ever meet people here in this country who evoked such thoughts in you, like if these people were capable of acting this way, then that person is capable of acting that way?</span> <span id="s1462">What did it do to your faith in humanity in general?</span> <span id="s1463">To know that people had acted that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Well, you know, I’m surprised that I’m- it must be towards Fred’s and my mother’s credit in a way that I’m an upbeat person.</span> <span id="s1465">I was always- though I’m not a cheerful person.</span> <span id="s1466">I’m not really pessimistic.</span> <span id="s1467">I’m an anxious person.</span> <span id="s1468">I’m very anxious because I just- I always- I think what made me anxious was the fact that my mother was- you know, from the time I was a teenager my mother was always ill, and I always felt that imminently I’m going to lose her.</span> <span id="s1469">You know, I had just found her.</span> <span id="s1470">And imminently I was going to lose her again.</span> <span id="s1471">In Germany when she became sick and she was in the hospital, you know, I had only been with her for a few years because I had been sick, and this and that- so when she started becoming very sick, I became petrified that she would die.</span> <span id="s1472">And if she died, I really didn’t have anybody because Fred did not give me a sense of security.</span> <span id="s1473">I did not fear- you see, I felt that my mother was the only person who really took care of me.</span> <span id="s1474">Who was my shelter, and my shield.</span> <span id="s1475">So, I’ve always been an anxious person, but I always felt that people were basically good.</span> <span id="s1476">You know, I never really became cynical about people.</span> <span id="s1477">I don’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Well certainly nothing like that could happen here, in terms of what these people did, what the Nazi’s did.</span> <span id="s1479">But, have you ever experienced anti-Semitism in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">Q: Never personally had anything to you about the fact that you’re Jewish- not at work, professionally, not at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: Definitely not at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: What about work, and what about during the sixties when all the riots-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Well, you see, during the sixties I wasn’t working because I was raising my children.</span> <span id="s1487">So I wasn’t working at that time.</span> <span id="s1488">The only time I met- this was interesting.</span> <span id="s1489">This was after I had graduated college, I had lived in California for about 7-8 months.</span> <span id="s1490">And on the way back from California I was traveling by train, and it was just this long, tedious ride in the train, and I met a fellow who was a Southerner.</span> <span id="s1491">He was from Louisiana.</span> <span id="s1492">He didn’t know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1493">And he was making remarks about the Negroes and the Jews.</span> <span id="s1494">And, I remember being struck by that because it was so strange to find an American who would make negative remarks.</span> <span id="s1495">Sort of insulting remarks about the Jews.</span> <span id="s1496">I expected him to make remarks about the Negroes because he was a Southerner.</span> <span id="s1497">But I was really taken aback that he felt that way about the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Did you say anything to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: No, and that was the funny thing.</span> <span id="s1500">I didn’t tell him that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1501">At that point, I really felt it was better for me to not to tell him I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: I can understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: So, I probably experienced a sense of fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: When you told me you had these nightmares, how often would you say you have them, if you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: It’s usually when I am anxious about something in my life.</span> <span id="s1506">And so I really can’t put a number on it.</span> <span id="s1507">But, how can I say- I don’t even know if it happens once a year.</span> <span id="s1508">Maybe it does happen once a year.</span> <span id="s1509">I really don’t- the other thing about it, I’m not the sort of person that dwells on unpleasantness.</span> <span id="s1510">I don’t know- I think it’s a protective mechanism I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Well before when you were in hiding, you sort of made sure you didn’t have too much feelings about things...</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: What’s your occupation?</span> <span id="s1514">You went to Hunter and you studied Business Education, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: I studied Business Education and I was very interested in teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: What is Business Education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: Business Education is teaching commercial subjects in high school.</span> <span id="s1518">Teaching stenography, typewriting, office practice, secretarial practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: So teaching would be one area of your profession, but you don’t do that now.</span> <span id="s1520">What is your occupation now?</span> <span id="s1521">What would you call the work you do (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: I’m what’s called the Legislative Aide.</span> <span id="s1523">And that really encompasses doing anything which a legislative might require.</span> <span id="s1524">Constituent service, community service, public relations.</span> <span id="s1525">A lot of public relations.</span> <span id="s1526">I was surprised for instance, a hospital, a quite prestigious hospital offered me $35,000 starting salary if I would come and work for them as a community outreach person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Now, you’re already worth something, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Yah!</span> <span id="s1529">I said, ‘well my experience is really worth something to someone else.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: So you’d say you’ve done well on your work, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: I like my work.</span> <span id="s1532">I like my work very much.</span> <span id="s1533">It’s made me part of a community for the first time.</span> <span id="s1534">Part of a community where I give back- I know the institutions, I know the make-up of the population.</span> <span id="s1535">I feel comfortable (?</span> <span id="s1536">Inaudible- Washington Heights?)</span> <span id="s1537">I feel I have a sense of continuity.</span> <span id="s1538">I’ve seen children grow up.</span> <span id="s1539">I’ve seen people go from point one- we’ve been living here in this area for 24 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: How long have you been doing this work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: I’ve been doing this work now for eleven years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: What were you doing before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: I didn’t work for ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: And before those ten years?</span> <span id="s1545">Twenty-one years ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Not 21 years because before I started working in this job, I went back to teaching for about 3 years...</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Would you consider yourself, in financial terms, upper middle class, middle class, lower class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: Well, you see, I always have this discussion with Ralph because I yes, I consider us upper middle class, because in terms of statistics, when you read the breakdown of the income levels, etc., I would consider ourselves upper middle class, but you see Ralph, who used to be the son of a wealthy man and no longer is the son of a wealthy man, considers himself what he calls a proletariat.</span> <span id="s1549">So it depends on which member of the family you speak to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: I’m trying to get some kind of a breakdown on the financial level reached by the people who came here.</span> <span id="s1551">So, if you give me a broad figure- you said that this place offered you $35,000.</span> <span id="s1552">Does your salary come close to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1555">If you had to think back now, what achievements in life, would you say you’re most proud of?</span> <span id="s1556">What do you take the greatest pride in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Well, the children.</span> <span id="s1558">I think that- I’m very proud of my children.</span> <span id="s1559">And I’m proud, so I would say that that’s the prime achievement of my life.</span> <span id="s1560">I think that I had brought up two children who are going to be positive- who will make positive contributions to this community, or their community wherever they live.</span> <span id="s1561">I think that they have high moral standards, they are honest.</span> <span id="s1562">I think they are going to be an attribute to whomever they make contact with in their lives.</span> <span id="s1563">I think they’re going to be productive.</span> <span id="s1564">I think they’re going to be a positive force.</span> <span id="s1565">Whomever they meet up with.</span> <span id="s1566">Whatever they do.</span> <span id="s1567">And I think that that’s something that’s a tribute to Ralph and me.</span> <span id="s1568">That we were able to bring up- you know, I don’t think that they’re going to be geniuses in life, but I think they are going to be good people.</span> <span id="s1569">And basically, that’s, you know,-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: ...well.</span> <span id="s1571">I think they are...</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: I like them.</span> <span id="s1573">You know, I like them.</span> <span id="s1574">I think they’re likeable people, so that the other thing in my life is that I think I was able to form a good marital relationship which is something that is important in life to me and you know, I have some very good friends.</span> <span id="s1575">I think I’ve been able to form good friendships.</span> <span id="s1576">And, I’ve been productive in my work.</span> <span id="s1577">I’ve helped a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1578">I’ve done things that count in this community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: No wonder your children are the way they are.</span> <span id="s1580">Because those are the things you value.</span> <span id="s1581">And you’ve been able to transmit that to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Not so much in words, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: Was there anything that you’d say you were least proud of?</span> <span id="s1584">I don’t mean that you robbed a bank, but is there anything that you felt you would have liked to accomplish and you’re sorry you didn’t accomplish?</span> <span id="s1585">Unrealized ambition?</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">A: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s1587">I’m sorry that I never finished my master’s studies.</span> <span id="s1588">I’m really- I was always furious with myself that I allowed myself to be bamboozled into the idea that I would never have to work for a living after I got married, and so therefore there was really no reason why I should continue going to school, and so I never- I guess I never went back to finish my master’s, and then I became too lazy to go back.</span> <span id="s1589">Once I had two kids, and...then I was enjoying, you see, I became very active in terms of sports activities.</span> <span id="s1590">I fell in love with playing tennis and skiing and ice skating and all of that.</span> <span id="s1591">And that took a lot of my time and energy, really.</span> <span id="s1592">And I didn’t want to give that up to go back to school, so I never-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Before this recent problem, did you ever go to a hospital or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: No...and what happened in the Spring, really caused a real upheaval in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: I’ll say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: It required an adjustment (her voice slows and lowers ending with a sigh).</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: You’re making an understatement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1599">(her voice picks up with a short laugh).</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: It’s an adjustment to Elizabeth too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Well, it really, it hit Elizabeth very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: Well, think back on yourself.</span> <span id="s1603">You were worried when your mother got sick (inaudible) and (inaudible) she’s going to lose you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1605">I think so...it really created a great deal of difficulty for me, and in a way I wanted her out of the house, because-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: I mean, that it was particularly why I wanted her out of the house, because I feel she’s young, and she really shouldn’t have to live on a daily basis with serious illness.</span> <span id="s1608">And basically, that what it is.</span> <span id="s1609">You know, I live- I mean, if you were to see me after one of my treatments, you’d see that I- I’m really just, I’m ill!</span> <span id="s1610">I really am.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: But the amazing thing is, that when you’re not ill...it’s like you never had anything wrong with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: I know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: (inaudible)...you have to see like a social worker or somebody to adjust to something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: I joined the American Society Cancer Support Group.</span> <span id="s1615">There is a support group.</span> <span id="s1616">I joined them, and it meets once a week.</span> <span id="s1617">It doesn’t fill all my needs.</span> <span id="s1618">But it’s very helpful to meet with other cancer patients who are basically leading their lives-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Until then, you never had any experience like that with a social worker... sometimes people who came over after the war would see psychologist or somebody like that, or they’d be asked to see somebody like that, or do you trust them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Well, maybe it would have been very helpful if I had had that available to me when I first came here.</span> <span id="s1621">I think it would have been helpful because the strikes that you and I had against us, other than our feeling that we were different because we weren’t born here, and we weren’t raised here, and we didn’t really share the experiences with our classmates.</span> <span id="s1622">We hadn’t lived through the same elementary school or whatever.</span> <span id="s1623">There were also our parents who were different than the parents of the kids who were brought up here, who were born and raised here.</span> <span id="s1624">And, our parents philosophy of life.</span> <span id="s1625">Our parents expectations of us, and our parents fear for our safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Well, on that score, that’s how your mother was, but do you consider yourself a cautious person?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: Very.</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">Q: Very?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">A: Not so much cautious for myself, but when it comes to my children, I really, I was in a constant state of anxiety about their safety.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">Q: What about you, yourself?</span> <span id="s1631">Are you willing to take risks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: I was, when I was- I was.</span> <span id="s1633">You see, but the way the risks- the way I took risks was that I was very adventurous in terms of the physical things that I did.</span> <span id="s1634">You know, I became a very good swimmer, and I would go into the ocean no matter what the wave-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: You mean, not since you had children, you’re not so risk-taking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s1637">I was still taking risks.</span> <span id="s1638">It’s really only since I got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: That’s really atypical...</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: No, but it’s really made me very- cautious...for instance...the doctor...said I can’t go skiing this winter.</span> <span id="s1641">It’s very difficult for me not to go skiing...so I can’t go- I don’t know what you mean by ‘taking risks.’</span> <span id="s1642">I, you know, I took risks- physically I wasn’t afraid to take risks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: There are some people who will not walk in a bad neighborhood at night.</span> <span id="s1644">They are afraid to.</span> <span id="s1645">There are some people who will not go skiing, because they might break a leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: No, I suppose in that respect, you can say that I take risks.</span> <span id="s1647">But I take the subways...but I’m not stupid.</span> <span id="s1648">When I take the subway, I try to stick to where the conductor is, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: ...do you like being in charge of things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1651">I certainly do.</span> <span id="s1652">(laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Would it be more important to have a job that provides security or more important to have one that’s challenging, exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: I definitely would take a job that- I mean, security is a factor, I’m fortunate that I have a job that provides both, but,</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: If it came down to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: If it came down to it, I would take a job that provided security.</span> <span id="s1657">Because earning a living was always an important part of-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Q: When you see, you know, some people seem to be luckier than other people.</span> <span id="s1659">Some people, luck seems to go their way.</span> <span id="s1660">Do you think it’s just a matter of, what happened to the people in terms of luck, or do you think that there’s some element where lucky people make their own luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: I think that luck is a matter of attitude.</span> <span id="s1662">Depends on what- it’s very subjective, what you consider luck.</span> <span id="s1663">I consider myself consider myself lucky, although, you know, I’m very unlucky that I got sick.</span> <span id="s1664">But, I think I have a loving mother.</span> <span id="s1665">I think that is primary in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">Q: But you didn’t make that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: So my question to you is do you think that people who are lucky, that sometimes make their own luck, in other words, they create circumstances which are obviously in the case of having a loving mother, you can’t create it.</span> <span id="s1669">But I mean, like some people see to make a million dollars, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1670">Did they make their own luck- or do you think it’s just how the chips fall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: No.</span> <span id="s1672">I think they make their own luck, because in that respect, there are certain people who just have the ability to make money.</span> <span id="s1673">They have a need to do it, and they have the ability.</span> <span id="s1674">And it’s a combination of it.</span> <span id="s1675">But you know, there are some people who make a lot of money, and they don’t consider themselves lucky.</span> <span id="s1676">That’s why I say that luck is sort of subjective.</span> <span id="s1677">It’s the way people perceive themselves either to be like you or not to be like you.</span> <span id="s1678">Know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: I do.</span> <span id="s1680">Well, when you make a decision, do you tend to make a decision quickly, or do you like to think things over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: I agonize over decisions.</span> <span id="s1682">I don’t make decisions quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Do you ever find yourself regretting decisions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: ...well, I don’t regret it keenly.</span> <span id="s1685">As I said, I made a decision not to go back to school, and I regretted that I didn’t finish my master’s studies...</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Would you say you are more or less satisfied with the way your life turned out?</span> <span id="s1687">Discounting this illness, I understand that, but besides that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Yes, I considered myself very fortunate that I have whole family, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Do you feel you’ve done as well as could be expected under the circumstances, considering everything that happened here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Considering everything that happened, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Do you think that things might have turned out better or worse, if you had lived elsewhere in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: I never really thought about it, because basically, I’ve always lived in New York.</span> <span id="s1693">I was a little time in California, about 7-8 months, and I like it because it was a very outdoor life, but I think that eventually I probably wouldn’t have liked the climate in California.</span> <span id="s1694">I think that because I’m New York, I’m politically more aware, I think I’m politically more liberal, I think that the people running around are very stimulating, and life is exciting, you know!</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Is there any way in which you think you might be different, than say the average American Jew in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: That I’m different?</span> <span id="s1697">I think I’m different because- to some degree I’m different because I think I have a unique relationship with Ralph, for instance, where he- my identity as a Jew is so much stronger than his, and so, in that respect, he and I really don’t share this sense of Judaism being important in our lives.</span> <span id="s1698">It’s not important in his life.</span> <span id="s1699">And, I notice that other couples have, well, sort of shared that either religious or irreligious identity much more than that aspect of their lives, I should say.</span> <span id="s1700">There’s a greater commonality between them in terms of the way they view their religion or irreligion or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: This would be true of Jews who married people who are not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yes, but you see, then it’s expected.</span> <span id="s1703">It’s understandable whereas Ralph and I are- although, I know- I think I’ve meet other people with the issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Did he go with you to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1706">Ralph didn’t go to Israel with me.</span> <span id="s1707">He wasn’t interested at all.</span> <span id="s1708">But basically, it’s not that he didn’t go because he’s not interested, but Ralph doesn’t like to go on the plane, and particularly he doesn’t like to travel by plane when it’s a long trip, so- since basically, I wanted to spend time with my family, I didn’t feel that I should make an issue of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Do you feel- and I can see it, that your adjustment to life in this country is pretty successful on the whole?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yah, on the whole.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Of all these factors, which factor would you say contributed most (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s1712">often?)</span> <span id="s1713">of all the things we’ve been talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Well, I was young.</span> <span id="s1715">I think it’s because I was young and because I had to make so many adjustments in my early years, that coming here was just another adjustment</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Do you think that having lived through the Holocaust, that nothing terrible can really happen to you?</span> <span id="s1717">It’s almost as if you lead a charmed life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: No, I don’t feel that way at all.</span> <span id="s1719">In fact, I think that particularly because I lived through the Holocaust, you see, that I always had the sense that something really horrible will happen to me.</span> <span id="s1720">I always had this sense of impending doom.</span> <span id="s1721">That I tried to push out of my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q: You were just lucky it didn’t happen then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1724">I think it made me-</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: ...just the other day you said to me, that you ‘don’t think that you were spared during the Holocaust, to have yourself die of this illness.’</span> <span id="s1726">Isn’t that sort of different than what you said just now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Yes it is.</span> <span id="s1728">But you see, this is in my moments of- when I-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">End of Tape #2, Side B Tape #3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: When I’m rational, I feel optimistic and that’s when I feel that I’ll pull through, and I’ll be fine, and that’s when I feel that I couldn’t have survived this awful war, and really, where the odds were so much against me, just to succumb to this...(inaudible)...but sometimes I am overcome by this sense of doom, and I feel that- you know, sometimes I have these visions of something terrible happening.</span> <span id="s1731">For instance, I’m afraid of heights.</span> <span id="s1732">And as much as I love skiing, I’m comfortable on the chair life when it rises very high, when we go up the mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: You don’t mind living on the tenth floor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: No...what bothers me, is when I’m out on the terrace...</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: You don’t live with your ‘bags packed,’...like some survivors think that gee, it could happen again...did you live in a state of that after this happened during the war, that you just can’t take anything for granted, you can never be sure-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: How much do you feel that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: It’s not something that haunts me every day.</span> <span id="s1739">But it comes- it hits me every once in a while yesterday in the newspaper I just read that anti-Semitism had risen 12 % between ’86 and ’87 and immediately I thought to myself, maybe I should encourage- I mean, this really exactly what happened to me.</span> <span id="s1740">I said, maybe I should encourage Elizabeth and Paul to move to Israel...</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: Do they have any desire to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: No.</span> <span id="s1743">Elizabeth said to me after she had been to Israel- that she was really very impressed with everything, except she couldn’t live there because she said she couldn’t live with the idea of her children having to go into the army and perhaps being killed.</span> <span id="s1744">She said, ‘You have to be born in Israel and to live with it to be able to accept it.’</span> <span id="s1745">...</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: How old is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: 23.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: How old is Paul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Your kids all had pretty good education, your kids.</span> <span id="s1751">You considered it important for them, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: Do you think it’s really worth it, to spend all the years that are necessary to get a good education?</span> <span id="s1754">Or is it better to get a minimum amount and then go into business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: (laughs) I needed the education.</span> <span id="s1756">I had to have college, because when I graduated high school, I just hadn’t had enough schooling, because I had missed elementary completely.</span> <span id="s1757">I had missed Junior High School.</span> <span id="s1758">I really had very few years of school.</span> <span id="s1759">Formal school by the time I came to this country.</span> <span id="s1760">So actually when I finished high school I only had 3 years of high school...I was a very ignorant young person when I graduated high school...nothing to do with passing...I was not an educated person...</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: What about your kids?</span> <span id="s1762">Do you think it was necessary to get all that education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: For Elizabeth, it was very necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: I think she- again, when she finished high school, she was half-baked.</span> <span id="s1766">She really hadn’t developed very much scholastically, or intellectually, basically, intellectually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">Q: Is that a main benefit of education in your eyes?</span> <span id="s1768">Intellectual development?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1770">Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s1771">I think it enriches your life to have the tools with which to pursue further knowledge, if you are so inclined.</span> <span id="s1772">It is a great enrichment in life.</span> <span id="s1773">Otherwise, really, what is there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: ...some people might say, go to any old college, get your degree and go out and go into a business, marry a rich girl-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: I don’t think it’s necessary to go to an ivy league college...neither Ralph or I, really felt that it was necessary for her to go to Barnard...she’s the one who decided that that’s where she wanted to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: How Jewishly did you raise them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">A: As Jewishly as it was possible for me under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s1778">And when I say, ‘under the circumstances,’ I mean, considering that they had a father who is totally uninterested, paternal grandparents who said to me, ‘Why are you sending them to Hebrew School?’</span> <span id="s1779">– Ralph’s father basically said to me, it’s not good for them to be so Jewish.</span> <span id="s1780">That’s basically what he said.</span> <span id="s1781">And he, of course the reason he said it is because of his experience as a Jew in Europe, because he had to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: ...he came here when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: He came here in 1939...they were assimilated in Czechoslovakia, except that Ralph’s father was an industrialist and so he had business in Vienna, Germany and Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: And he doesn’t feel proud to be a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Do you think that if Ralph had married someone not Jewish it wouldn’t have bothered him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: Ralph have brothers, sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: Ralph is an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: You did send them to Hebrew School, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1792">Well, after school, yes.</span> <span id="s1793">So we sent them to Hebrew School and I really must say that, whatever Jewishness Paul and Elizabeth have was single handedly accomplished by me, because by that time my parents had moved to Florida, so you see, that was really unfortunate that my parents moved to Florida when the children were so young, because they would have reinforced-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: They had a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: They went to shul?</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Right- they were members of...(Rabbi Kret?</span> <span id="s1798">And then the Vermedea?</span> <span id="s1799">Synagogue here in the Inwood section)...orthodox synagogue...and I had to join a Reform Synagogue because Ralph doesn’t know any Hebrew, and so-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: How would you feel if Paul or Elizabeth married someone who’s not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: As long as my mother was alive, I thought that it would pain me terribly if they did it, because it would cause her so much grief and distress.</span> <span id="s1802">I really, fervently hoped that they married Jews.</span> <span id="s1803">Because, as my uncle said in Israel when I asked him what he thinks the situation, you know, why the Jews have such problems there, and he said, ‘Our biggest problem is that we are three and a half million.</span> <span id="s1804">If we were ten million, we wouldn’t have a problem.’</span> <span id="s1805">And, so in a way I feel that a Jew really has an obligation to remain a Jew and retain the faith.</span> <span id="s1806">But I also have mixed feelings about that.</span> <span id="s1807">I must tell you, because on the one hand, I say to myself, well, if they weren’t Jewish, life would really be easier for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: And if they married someone not Jewish, they might escape being Jewish (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: Do you ever feel that being Jewish is a big burden to carry around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: Yes, I certainly do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: In some other life, like to be relieved of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: Well, I never thought in terms of- you see I don’t dwell too much on what my life might be like and so on, if I were not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1814">In fact, I never thought in terms of what it would be like if I wasn’t Jewish, I never thought of that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: But your kids, you see, didn’t have the same experiences that define them as Jews, and therefore for them, it’s quite possible.</span> <span id="s1816">They are bona fide Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Well, I think it’s not unlikely that they might be faced with that.</span> <span id="s1818">Because, let’s face it, they really don’t live in a singularly Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s1819">They don’t.</span> <span id="s1820">They’ve gone to schools that weren’t particularly Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Did their visits to Israel affect their identity in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: Yes, I think that their visits to Israel were a turning point in their sense of being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: Yes, I think- it sort of made them aware of the fact that there is a Jewish nation, there are Jewish people, and that it’s a Jewish nation that needs them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: In one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: If they married someone who’s not Jewish, would it matter to you if that person converted to the Jewish faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: I think I would probably prefer that.</span> <span id="s1829">But I really hope they don’t.</span> <span id="s1830">I really hope they marry Jews- What I face is this.</span> <span id="s1831">Let’s say that they really passionately fell in love with someone who wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1832">And that I could see that it was a really decent loving type of person.</span> <span id="s1833">I couldn’t really, I couldn’t object to that.</span> <span id="s1834">Simply on the grounds that the person wasn’t Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: Do you feel that your children’s identification with Judaism is different from that of your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1837">I think it’s less intense.</span> <span id="s1838">But on the other hand, I think that it may be less intense, but I think that it’s growing in awareness...</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: Did you ever think that, like when you (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s1840">talk behind the children?)</span> <span id="s1841">that the world is really a bad place, and do you want to bring children into such a world?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Never?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: No, I mean, I had children in 1960.</span> <span id="s1845">I thought the world was a pretty good world...Elizabeth was born in 1966.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: What did you tell them about the Holocaust, do you remember?</span> <span id="s1847">Or have you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Interestingly enough, I have, but- it hasn’t been one (inaudible-tale?)</span> <span id="s1849">It’s been bits and pieces here and there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Did you start at any point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: No, I didn’t start at any point.</span> <span id="s1852">I think it just sort of came out.</span> <span id="s1853">I didn’t one day decide that I have to tell them about the Holocaust and sit them down and say, ‘Well, you know, you should know that such and such happened to me.’</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Do you think that you’re being a survivor has affected them in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1856">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: It’s hard to say how.</span> <span id="s1859">It’s probably very subtle.</span> <span id="s1860">I think that it has shaped my personality.</span> <span id="s1861">So in that respect it has affected them.</span> <span id="s1862">They’ve been brought up with a sense that the Jews experienced this terrible tragedy during W.W.2.</span> <span id="s1863">Elizabeth, for instance, got terrible flack from Ralph’s mother because she spent the summer in Germany.</span> <span id="s1864">She was given a scholarship to spend the summer in Germany and it really caused sort of a rift between her and her grandmother because her grandmother just couldn’t accept the fact- and you know, Ralph’s mother also gave me a very hard time about allowing her to go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: You think that it would be the opposite, since they don’t care that much being Jewish, while they feel that terrible things happened-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: But they feel that we should not have any relation with Germany.</span> <span id="s1867">We ( following line is illegible) German people.</span> <span id="s1868">(illegible) that they feel that way actually.</span> <span id="s1869">Ralph’s mother feels that way actually.</span> <span id="s1870">Ralph’s father never felt that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: You feel then that being a survivor has affected your children (inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1873">Also, I think it’s made them aware that Jews are not really acceptable to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Did you ever feel that they couldn’t really understand what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1876">They can’t understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Can anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: (heavy sigh) Now, maybe yes.</span> <span id="s1879">‘Cause there has been so much written about it and there has been so much visual-visually there has been a lot.</span> <span id="s1880">In films, and on television.</span> <span id="s1881">So, I don’t know if people want to, you know, it’s really such horror.</span> <span id="s1882">I don’t know that-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: ...(inaudible)...war movies...they put on these shows, T.V. Everybody watches...(inaudible)...whenever something’s on about the war do you watch it (inaudible)...love seeing the Nazis get beat up, killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: These WW.</span> <span id="s1885">2 movies- I enjoyed the WW .2 movies, but not concentration camp-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: too close to home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: Do you like WW.</span> <span id="s1889">1 movies too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">A: No, not particularly.</span> <span id="s1891">WW.</span> <span id="s1892">2 movies, you know, that’s an interesting- yes, I do like to see the Germans being made fools of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">Q: ...did you spend a lot of time with Paul and Elizabeth when they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1895">I didn’t go to work for ten years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: What did you do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Well when they were little I did the normal things with them.</span> <span id="s1898">I took them to their dance classes, and sand boxes, and I took them to school and brought them back.</span> <span id="s1899">But as they got older, they basically did the same things we did.</span> <span id="s1900">I taught them to swim, they’re very good swimmers, they’re very good skiers, they’re very good tennis players.</span> <span id="s1901">We took them hiking, we took them hiking when they were still little- I taught them to water ski...</span></p> <p><span id="s1902">Q: Did your relationship differ between one and the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">A: No- well, except to the extent that Elizabeth is a girl, and Paul is a boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: Did their attitudes towards the Holocaust differ one from the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: When they were kids, when they were in Hebrew School, they were shown a lot of films about WW 2 and when they were kids, they felt it was cruel of the school to do that.</span> <span id="s1906">I guess because undoubtedly it was painful or it was unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1907">But that’s exactly what they felt.</span> <span id="s1908">They felt it was stupid-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: But now their attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: But now their attitudes are different.</span> <span id="s1911">They still don’t like, for instance, Elizabeth couldn’t watch Shoah either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: But between them, their attitudes are pretty similar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1914">I would say that they talk a great deal to each other-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: Do they ever complain that you were in any way over-protective?</span> <span id="s1916">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Do you think they were right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: No.</span> <span id="s1920">No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1921">I think I was very fearful for them, but I over-compensated and let them do a lot of things that perhaps other parents wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: On this question of their attitudes towards the Holocaust- how do they respond to the fact that you survived?</span> <span id="s1923">In other words, do they respond to it with respect, (inaudible), shame, indifference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: No.</span> <span id="s1925">I would say that they respond with respect and admiration.</span> <span id="s1926">And they feel I’m very strong and that I’m capable of overcoming anything and everything.</span> <span id="s1927">You know, they always had this sense that-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: And you don’t sense that they ever had any emotional difficulties in dealing with this or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: No, they had emotional difficulties.</span> <span id="s1930">When they were younger, they felt very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1931">You see, both Elizabeth’s Hebrew school teacher, and Paul’s Hebrew school teacher invited me to come to speak about the Holocaust to the children.</span> <span id="s1932">And I sensed that it made them both very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1933">There was their mother who was telling these terrible tales about her own childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: But this didn’t have a long lasting impact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">A: No-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">Q: They’re pretty stable kids, (inaudible)?</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">A: Pretty.</span> <span id="s1938">Paul more so than Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s1939">But I don’t know that Elizabeth’s difficulties stem from the fact that she’s the child of a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s1940">I think-that they, that’s not what was the focus of her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Were they harder to raise than the average child?</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: They get along well with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: They get along well with each other.</span> <span id="s1945">They have a pretty solid-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: They’re independent now from you...Elizabeth moved out...Paul’s away at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: Yeh, they’re pretty independent...Paul is more independent.</span> <span id="s1948">Elizabeth is more involved with me and that’s why my getting ill really hit her so hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q: They don’t have nightmares like what you described?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A: No...</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Do you feel sometimes that it’s a problem that Ralph isn’t a survivor in relating to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A: Well in a way Ralph is a survivor.</span> <span id="s1953">He didn’t really spend the war years in Europe, because they came here in 1939, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Does the fact that he’s a survivor in the sense that he came here as a refugee- does that make a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: Well...I look at Ralph as a survivor, but he does not look at himself as a survivor.</span> <span id="s1956">Because he was very young.</span> <span id="s1957">In a sense it makes it easier, and I think that was something that very much that I liked about Ralph, because I think he has a greater sense of security- I don’t think he has the same sense of impending doom that I experienced when I was living with my parents.</span> <span id="s1958">And, so, it just felt more normal to be living with Ralph than to be living with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Was your home a religious one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Traditional.</span> <span id="s1961">It started out being a religious one, but it didn’t-once Fred bought the store, and he had to have it opened on Saturday...actually when we came here, we used to go to shul every Saturday and we observed the Sabbath...</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: ...did your mother mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: I think she minded at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1964">Yes, she always minded.</span> <span id="s1965">But, then she became non-observant too.</span> <span id="s1966">And just sort of-drifted away from it, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: You belong to a..</span> <span id="s1968">.</span> <span id="s1969">reform synagogue.</span> <span id="s1970">How often do you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: After I got sick, and when I found out this horrible diagnosis, when it was (?</span> <span id="s1972">finding?)</span> <span id="s1973">, told me in no uncertain terms, that I had lung cancer and when seemed very dire at that time, I you know, I thought I-I probably didn’t have very much time to live.</span> <span id="s1974">Well, anyway, there was one point that I just felt actually desolate about it, and I called up the Rabbi just on the spur of the moment.</span> <span id="s1975">I called up and I said that you know, I’d like to come and talk to him and so he said, ‘Sure,’ and I went to talk to him and well, I can’t say that it was-and I must say that I’ve had contact with him because of my job so I had more contact with him than just as a congregant who came on some odd Fridays</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: What’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Rabbi Steven Franklin.</span> <span id="s1978">That I came on some odd Fridays or the High Holidays, you know, I really knew him in a more personal way.</span> <span id="s1979">I used to meet them socially...any way he said that prayer might help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Do you believe in G-d?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Yes, I believe in G-d.</span> <span id="s1982">I don’t believe in G-d in the sense that there’s some human form there that’s G-d.</span> <span id="s1983">I believe there is a G-dly force.</span> <span id="s1984">And, he suggested that prayer might help, and so now I go almost every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Do you find it comforting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: The thing is, not in the spiritual sense, but I find it comforting.</span> <span id="s1987">I haven’t really decided why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Is it maybe gives you a tiny bit more control over the situation in the sense that you’re doing something about it...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: ...right...</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: ...are there any Jewish holiday that you consider especially important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Well, I always enjoyed Pesach very much because first of all, because it was a spring holiday.</span> <span id="s1992">Because it was sort of like a renewal, you know, we would clean the house, and I just like the whole ritual.</span> <span id="s1993">And I like the Pesach foods-.</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Do you ever make Friday night special?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Do you have a mezuzah on your door?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: You see, this is very interesting.</span> <span id="s1998">I have a mezuzah on the bedroom door, right?</span> <span id="s1999">I wanted to put the mezuzah on our front door.</span> <span id="s2000">And both Ralph and Paul objected to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">Q: They didn’t want to be identified.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">A: Right...Ralph said that religious symbols make him very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2003">And Paul said- and you see that was when I realized that while Paul feels very comfortable as a Jew, he doesn’t feel comfortable with the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s2004">And that’s basically it-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: ...did you ever think about the whole question of why the six million died?</span> <span id="s2006">...some people think that there was some reason why the six million died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: Well, I- you see, I don’t agree with that.</span> <span id="s2008">Of course, what people tell me, what I’ve read and what people tell me is that the way to justify the death of the six million, is that we got Eretz Yisrael.</span> <span id="s2009">- But I’ll be darned if I’m going-you know, if I accept that.</span> <span id="s2010">I don’t accept that at all.</span> <span id="s2011">But I think that the Orthodox community feels that they can justify that in those terms-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Except that the real Hassidim don’t want the State of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Except for the real Hassidim.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: I was with a man the other day, and he told me that- I said, ‘Why didn’t you go to Israel after the war?’</span> <span id="s2015">He was a Hassid.</span> <span id="s2016">And he says, ‘Well, it was 1945,’ and I said, ‘Yeh, I guess it wasn’t set up as a State.</span> <span id="s2017">You didn’t have anything to go to.’</span> <span id="s2018">He said, ‘No.</span> <span id="s2019">It was because I was afraid that it was going to be set up as a state (inaudible).’</span> <span id="s2020">(SM laughs heartily)...what organization do you belong to now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: ...I don’t belong to any organization now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: Do you belong to the Democratic party?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: ...I belong to the Benjamin Franklin Reform Democratic Club...</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: That’s professional...what else?</span> <span id="s2025">...</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">A: ...other than the Temple...I’m a member of the Social Action Committee of Riverdale Temple...I’m not a member of any groups...because I have so many meetings...</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">Q: Too busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: ...when you described these evening gatherings...they weren’t like these morbid type of Holocaust (inaudible.)</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: They were not at all morbid.</span> <span id="s2031">That was a very-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Found that amazing, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Right...</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: How do you think after everything your mother went through, lost her family and everything, how did she retain the ability to laugh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Well, again because I think that human beings have a certain resilience here.</span> <span id="s2036">And I think that, you see, you can’t live with a constant sense of morbidity.</span> <span id="s2037">I mean, there are people who do, but those are the people who are- emotionally unsound.</span> <span id="s2038">Or who are psychotic, or- but I think that most people who are sound, who are of sound minds, or you know, as sound as a mind can be for people who have gone through such horrors.</span> <span id="s2039">I think that’s what makes them survivors.</span> <span id="s2040">That they are able to go forward.</span> <span id="s2041">You know, to pick up their lives-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Q: How do you think they get the strength to do so?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: I think it’s innate.</span> <span id="s2044">And I think because, and I’m really not sure about this, but I think that Jews have very strong family ties...Jewish parents, I think, were very involved with their children and gave them a sense that they were very important in a way, you know, that, that Jewish children and maybe that made them sturdy, even though they weren’t lovey dovey and so on, but I think that they were a presence.</span> <span id="s2045">The Jewish parents were a presence in the children’s lives, and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">Q: You remember that your parents got together in parks- did they ever get together in clubs or cafeterias, or any other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">A: They got together in each others homes a great deal.</span> <span id="s2048">There was a lot of visiting back and forth.</span> <span id="s2049">Particularly for coffee and cake.</span> <span id="s2050">Cake was always a part of my life as I was growing up.</span> <span id="s2051">Sweets, people were always getting together for sweets.</span> <span id="s2052">And really, I mean really elaborate spreads.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: You would go with them to other people’s homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Yeh!</span> <span id="s2055">...every place you went there was this spread of sweets and tea.</span> <span id="s2056">A lot of tea...in a glass.</span> <span id="s2057">Right.</span> <span id="s2058">No, they weren’t morbid people...</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: ...what do you do in your spare time?</span> <span id="s2060">You ski, travel, read.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: I used to read a great deal.</span> <span id="s2062">Now I mostly have to read things that are related to my job.</span> <span id="s2063">You know, reports, newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: What was the last book?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: ...what I’m reading now is, ‘Holy Days,’ by ?</span> <span id="s2066">Louis?</span> <span id="s2067">Harris...the book before that was...Rosa Luxembourg...I found that fascinating about the early Socialist movement in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: ...sticking to Jewish topics...</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: ...just very recently I’ve been reading these Jewish topics...</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: What about newspapers and magazines?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: I read the Times every day.</span> <span id="s2072">Not cover to cover obviously, I don’t read any magazines...I only read the New York Times- the Sunday Times magazine.</span> <span id="s2073">I read the Riverdale Press, the voice selectively, the Village Voice...</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Mostly what do you do in your leisure time?</span> <span id="s2075">If I gave you a choice, like between say, having friends over, watching T,V., movies, having relatives over, reading, sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">A: Up until the time I got sick, I mostly did sports in my leisure time.</span> <span id="s2077">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">End of Tape #3, Side A Tape #3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: How often do you take a vacation?</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">A: ...we have systematically taken vacations.</span> <span id="s2081">Ralph has always worked in places where he either had three weeks during the year or four weeks during the year.</span> <span id="s2082">And I have four weeks during the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">Q: You take off once a year for sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">A: Oh, more than that.</span> <span id="s2085">We used to go skiing two weeks during the winter, one week at a time, and summers, so I would say three times a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Where did you go the last time you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: Together?</span> <span id="s2088">We went to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: You never had any pets, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: No.</span> <span id="s2091">We were a highly allergic family.</span> <span id="s2092">We’re all sneezing and- we had gerbils and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: This neighborhood is mostly Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: It became so, when we moved in now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Is it 50-50?</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: ...I guess Riverdale you would say 50-50.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Are any of your good friends not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">A: No.</span> <span id="s2099">Ralph’s good friends are not Jewish (laughing).</span> <span id="s2100">I mean, you know, friends that he has from school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Where did he go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: Ralph went to (illegible)...he graduated with honors...</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: But you wouldn’t say that any of your good friends (inaudible)- of your four best friends, would you say all of these are Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">Q: Of these four best friends, how many are survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: One...</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: This time you went to Israel, it was the first time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Do you ever contribute to...Jewish charities?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2111">I contribute to the usual.</span> <span id="s2112">UJA, the temples, Anti-defamation League, American Jewish Congress, the HIAS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: You give a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Yes, but I don’t really give that much.</span> <span id="s2115">Maybe once Paul’s finished with school- and (laughs) I’ll give more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q: ...Israel Bonds?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">Q: Have you ever given money to support Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: ...my parents always bought bonds...I’ll tell you how I support Israel.</span> <span id="s2120">I buy Israeli tomatoes, you know, which cost $3.45 a pound- I buy Elite chocolates, things like that.</span> <span id="s2121">I buy their products.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q: You told me before that you couldn’t really watch Shoah- did you watch that film ‘Holocaust’?</span> <span id="s2123">...</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: No.</span> <span id="s2125">My parents watched that.</span> <span id="s2126">My mother really- she suffered watching it.</span> <span id="s2127">I turned it on, and it just made me so uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2128">I turned it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Because of the memories evoked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: Again for the same reason that I found it so painful to read about it.</span> <span id="s2131">It’s, it’s just- it hurts so much to, you know, to know that my people were made to suffer like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: You don’t buy German products do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: You avoid that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Well...recently...I really wanted to buy and I just couldn’t bring myself to buy...a present...when I saw it was made in Germany and I said to Elizabeth, I can’t buy it.</span> <span id="s2136">You know, and I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2137">And yet I really wanted to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: How do you feel now about Germans who were born after the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: I find it very difficult to have any contact with any German after the Holocaust, before the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2140">But I tell you, I had a very interesting experience in Israel, that sort of made me feel that I really have to rethink the subject but I haven’t had the opportunity to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Do you know what it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: I’ll tell you what it was.</span> <span id="s2143">We were in a gift shop, or in a store, and there was this group of Germans, about 5 or 6 who were older than I am.</span> <span id="s2144">Not much older, but somewhat older, and they were buying things.</span> <span id="s2145">They were buying hats which said, ‘I love Israel.’</span> <span id="s2146">And they were buying tee shirts, you know, which said something about, ‘I visited Israel,’ or something like that, and I was amazed!</span> <span id="s2147">I said to myself, you know.</span> <span id="s2148">I just couldn’t- I couldn’t, my mind couldn’t accept that.</span> <span id="s2149">That here were Germans and they were acting like normal tourists in Israel.</span> <span id="s2150">They were buying Israeli souvenirs!</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: Did you feel that they didn’t feel guilty about what they’ve done?</span> <span id="s2152">What are they doing her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2154">Right.</span> <span id="s2155">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: How dare they show up here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: I just felt that how come that I feel such an aversion to them, and they can come to Israel...(inaudible)...I feel an aversion to the Germans.</span> <span id="s2158">I tell you.</span> <span id="s2159">I once had a ski instructor who was a German.</span> <span id="s2160">He was younger than I was.</span> <span id="s2161">I was about 36 at time, and he must have been 26, or whatever, and he was a young German.</span> <span id="s2162">I couldn’t- I finally had to tell him.</span> <span id="s2163">You know, I had to tell him.</span> <span id="s2164">You know, he was blond and blue eyes, and tall, you know, and this real German- and I had to tell him that, you know, you are a very good ski instructor, but I must tell you that I feel very uncomfortable with you, and I feel a sense of hostility towards you, simply because you’re German.</span> <span id="s2165">I had to tell him why I feel this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: He said that- you know, he was a wise-alecky guy, and he said that ‘People always see evil in what they want to see evil in,’ he said, and it’s just- he said, ‘Like we in the West,’ he said, ‘We see evil in everything that’s Russian,’ He said, ‘They’re not evil people,’ he said, ‘The Germans are not evil people.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">Q: Not much point in discussing it with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">A: No.</span> <span id="s2170">But- and after that he felt very uncomfortable with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: ...he didn’t say to you, ‘Well, I had nothing to do with it, I’m younger,’ he didn’t say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: What he said was that he didn’t feel that it was his responsibility that what the older generation did.</span> <span id="s2173">That’s what he said.</span> <span id="s2174">I thought that was a terrible attitude.</span> <span id="s2175">(laughing).</span> <span id="s2176">I told him that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2177">Q: ...how do you feel about Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">A: Well, I don’t like Polish people either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: You have an aversion to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">A: You see, I haven’t had much contact with Polish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">Q: ...contact with Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: I had more contact with Germans...Paul has a very good friend who’s mother is German, whose mother is the same age I am.</span> <span id="s2183">Paul went to school with this boy, and Ingerbord always wanted to be friends with me.</span> <span id="s2184">She like Paul very much, and she liked me very much, and I didn’t tell her, but I couldn’t be friends with her...she made many attempts to be friendly with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: And you never told her why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Think she knew?</span> <span id="s2188">Suspected?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2190">But I just- you see, rationally, I said to myself, she’s the same age I am, she obviously had nothing to do with the war-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: ...(parts inaudible)...do you think most Americans are anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: I think to some degree they are...I think the Westerners are probably more anti-Semitic...I think that there are people in the United States who have very askewed ideas about Jews, who think that Jews have it all.</span> <span id="s2193">It makes me in a way, it makes me fearful.</span> <span id="s2194">I think the Blacks are anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2195">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s2196">But I think that the Blacks are becoming anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s2197">And maybe in a sense it’s because- I think that they have a sense that they are the only minorities who were wronged by the American culture and the Americans, and that any concession made to minorities in this country should be for them.</span> <span id="s2198">Affirmative action, whatever.</span> <span id="s2199">And I think that in a way, the Jews are oppressed to them.</span> <span id="s2200">And you see, I sense, I don’t know if they sense that, but I sense that perhaps the Jews have been spared a great deal because a lot of this anti feelings have been directed towards the Blacks.</span> <span id="s2201">And so they’re the scapegoats.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: It would make a big difference...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: If the Blacks sense that?</span> <span id="s2204">Why would that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: It would account the way you’ve explained it for some of their dislike of the Jews...(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2206">A: I don’t know if they sense it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">Q: I wonder how many Jews sense what you just said...(inaudible)...what’s your own attitude towards Blacks in terms of their (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s2208">suffering?)</span> <span id="s2209">their minority group (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s2210">suffering?)</span> <span id="s2211">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">A: ...when I started treading about how they were treated as slaves, and so on, I felt as badly for them, as I did for those people who suffered in concentration camps and other atrocities.</span> <span id="s2213">I feel that they have-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: ...(inaudible)...what about other minority groups, like Hispanics?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: I don’t feel that way about Hispanics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: And they don’t feel that way about Jews.</span> <span id="s2217">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">A: No, I don’t think the Hispanics have- I don’t feel that way about the Hispanics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Well I’d like to get some idea, you own attitudes towards different groups...I’ll give you a couple people, and I’ll say to you that this particular person wants to make a speech in your community...and what I want to know is, whether or not you think he should be allowed to speak.</span> <span id="s2220">Just tell me ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</span> <span id="s2221">Supposing somebody wants to give a speech here about...Backs are genetically inferior.</span> <span id="s2222">He’s a racist.</span> <span id="s2223">Should he be allowed to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">Q: What about somebody who is, let’s say, a communist?</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: What about somebody who advocates doing away with elections and letting the military run the country?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">Q: What about somebody who says he’s gay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">A: Oh, I think a gay person should be allowed to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">Q: What about a person who admits he’s a Nazi- neo-Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">A: ...in this community, yes.</span> <span id="s2233">But do you know why in this community?</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: Yeh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: In this community yes, because he would speak to mostly a Jewish audience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">Q: They know what to tell him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Do you have this feeling that America is like the land of opportunity for everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">A: Yes, I feel it’s a land of opportunity for everybody, and in a way, I’m somewhat annoyed with the Black people that they haven’t been able to advance themselves- as a group.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: You mean the have the opportunity and they’re not taking advantage of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: Why is it (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: I don’t know...I just really don’t know.</span> <span id="s2244">You know, I think the color of their skin is really against them, because they’re so- you see, when a Jew- a Jew is white and so, he can’t always be recognized immediately as a Jew.</span> <span id="s2245">And Hispanic people, most of them are white as well, but I think that someone who is Black, immediately evokes a certain response among whites.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: ‘Course Hasidim have done pretty well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: Hasidim has done well, but I think that’s because they were able to do well among their own...(inaudible)...Jews have businesses and- Blacks don’t...I think that those Blacks who had advanced themselves and made it, haven’t really played enough of a role, as role models, and haven’t- I mean, I can understand it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Given the fact that there’s all this prejudice, how can you reduce it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: Well, by making yourself a little bit more part of the mainstream.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: ...when you say ‘mainstream’ you mean what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: For instance, learning to speak the way the general population speaks rather than speaking this jargon, or whatever they speak- very often I can’t understand.</span> <span id="s2252">It makes me angry that I had to struggle so hard to learn to be understood, and they were born here, and I can’t understand them.</span> <span id="s2253">That they speak in a certain way.</span> <span id="s2254">That’s one difference.</span> <span id="s2255">Making themselves understood.</span> <span id="s2256">Trying to get a job, even if they think it’s a dead end.</span> <span id="s2257">I don’t know why this guy has to standout there with a squeezie mop and swoosh around everybody’s window shield, when he could probably get a job in Mc Donald’s or wherever.</span> <span id="s2258">They keep saying that there’s a lack of- unskilled workers in service industries.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: ...there are people who are prejudiced against people, and they’re not right.</span> <span id="s2260">To them, it’s a deep-seeded prejudice against Jews, (inaudible-?</span> <span id="s2261">other?)</span> <span id="s2262">- colored?</span> <span id="s2263">people, how can you reduce prejudice among people like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: (laughs).</span> <span id="s2265">I think the only way to reduce prejudice among people like that is to expose them- I don’t know if it’s possible.</span> <span id="s2266">You know, I think that familiarity sort of does away with prejudice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Now, these people have views about Jews, but from your perspective, do you consider yourself an American first or a Jew first?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: I consider myself a Jew first.</span> <span id="s2269">But I’m loyal to this country.</span> <span id="s2270">You know, I think this country has been good to me, but I consider myself a Jew first.</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Do you think that the Jews can ever fully be accepted in American society if they don’t give up their Jewish identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: ...I think so.</span> <span id="s2273">I think that Jews are very loyal Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: And you are a loyal American yourself.</span> <span id="s2275">Is there anything about American culture in life that you really didn’t like?</span> <span id="s2276">Of course, you came here at the age 13, so you were really brought up in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">A: It was interesting.</span> <span id="s2278">There were things that I disliked about Americans, and right now, I can’t really think about anything in particular.</span> <span id="s2279">I think what I disliked about Americans, in a way, they were very self-involved.</span> <span id="s2280">When I came here, they really didn’t know about other people</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: Insular.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Right, insular...but I think that’s changed.</span> <span id="s2283">Americans are traveling a great deal more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">Q: How do you think they’re too materialistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">A: Are they too materialistic?</span> <span id="s2286">Probably.</span> <span id="s2287">Probably they are too materialistic.</span> <span id="s2288">Yes.</span> <span id="s2289">I- the people I associate with on a really daily basis, are really not that materialistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: ...you do deal with people’s problems, right?</span> <span id="s2291">Do you deal with people on welfare?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: I do, but not really, not that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: Do you get the perception that most people on welfare really need it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">A: Well I do deal with people on welfare, but not really enough so that I can make a generalization that way.</span> <span id="s2297">So I don’t think that would be fair but I can tell you something else, that I deal with people who have other types of subsidies, and they don’t all need them.</span> <span id="s2298">They stash their money away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: ...do you have an opinion about psychiatrists, psychologists?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: Do I have an opinion?</span> <span id="s2301">I think that they perform a necessary service.</span> <span id="s2302">I do.</span> <span id="s2303">I don’t have negative feelings about them.</span> <span id="s2304">I’ll tell you what my reservation about psychiatrists and psychologists.</span> <span id="s2305">I think that if you have the misfortune of getting stuck with going to someone who is not very good at that sort of craft, they can probably do some harm.</span> <span id="s2306">(inaudible)...and that is what scares me about-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: The mind is a very delicate (inaudible?thing?)</span> <span id="s2308">.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: Right...but I think that there’s a need for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: ...do you think it’s okay in general for Jews to marry Gentiles (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: No, in general I don’t think it’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: No...(inaudible)...you see, again, it’s not totally black and white.</span> <span id="s2314">Sometimes I say to myself, well, the Jewish people have survived (inaudible) and this (?</span> <span id="s2315">Persian?)</span> <span id="s2316">, and all kinds of persecution and so on and so forth, and so somehow, I want to believe, I have a need to believe, that there is, that it is important for the Jewish people to be- one of the people’s of the world.</span> <span id="s2317">But, you know, when I read about what’s going on in Israel right now, between the Arabs and- I mean the Palestinians, and you know, how- the Israeli’s have to respond, you know, sort of with this violence and fatalities.</span> <span id="s2318">It makes me uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">Q: ...what did you think of the Viet Nam war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: The Viet Nam war, I must say, passed me by without my feeling one way or another about it.</span> <span id="s2321">It was a time of great involvement with my kids, you know they were little.</span> <span id="s2322">I was having one child, then another child, I was much more interested in their development.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: ...take the next crises in this country...Watergate...</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: My reaction to Watergate was one of total disbelief.</span> <span id="s2325">You know, that- sort of thing could occur in this country.</span> <span id="s2326">That there was this whole network of- in the upper echelon of government, to suppress information, and to suppress the freedom of political activity...it was depressing in a way.</span> <span id="s2327">The Iran Contra affair was in a way frightening.</span> <span id="s2328">But on the other hand, there was also a ray of sunshine, because I said to myself, we’re here with all these powerful people, and they were found, and there’s a mechanism to-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Do you consider yourself a Liberal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: ...and you’re more worried about going to the Left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yes...</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: ...(inaudible)...was there any political leader over all these years that impressed you (inaudible)?</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Well, of course Kennedy did...there was a charisma about Kennedy and there was a spirit about Kennedy that I liked very much.</span> <span id="s2335">And that’s irregardless of what type of president he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: What did you think of Kissinger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: ...it made me uncomfortable that a Jew played that type of role, vis-a-vis the Viet Nam war.</span> <span id="s2338">I mean, he was you know, I was really sort of in sympathy with the people who marched against the Viet Nam war, even though I wasn’t an activist myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">Q: ...is there any leader in this country that makes you especially nervous politically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">A: Well, I mean- Jackson makes me uncomfortable...I don’t like Pat Robertson...people who are evangelist make me very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2341">George.</span> <span id="s2342">.</span> <span id="s2343">Rockwell-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: ...I read a statement from a survivor who said, ‘please don’t be shocked by (inaudible).</span> <span id="s2345">The survivors of the Holocaust, in my opinion, (inaudible) are not the best people, are not the most noble people, the most good-hearted people, the (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">A: I agree with that statement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">Q: Could you elaborate a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">A: Well, I think that life had dealt them such a blow, they had to- that some of their nobler feelings or characteristics disappeared, utterly disappeared.</span> <span id="s2349">Or they, you know, they didn’t exist to begin with.</span> <span id="s2350">But also, I think again, it’s a blanket statement that you really can’t accept fully because he said, ‘Some of the people,’ right?</span> <span id="s2351">Some of the survivors, he doesn’t say, ‘the survivors.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">Q: No, he says, (inaudible) survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2353">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: Because, again, there are those- I mean, look, we know for instance that in the concentration camps there were...right, these kapos.</span> <span id="s2355">So there were certainly not admirable people.</span> <span id="s2356">And I think that in the concentration camps there was probably a mixed-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">Q: There were people who say that the nicest people didn’t make it- they couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: (laughs) The nicest people didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s2359">That’s an interesting statement.</span> <span id="s2360">I don’t know that (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: You almost have to have been there to judge it anyway...(inaudible) you know, we all think about these things, right?</span> <span id="s2362">Perception (inaudible)...think about it...</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: I can tell you though, that after the war in Germany, when we lived in the D.P. camps, I was not impressed with the Jewish population and the way in which they conducted themselves.</span> <span id="s2364">I think I told you that- toward each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">Q: No, you didn’t tell me (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">A: ...they were not people who would come forward and be helpful to others.</span> <span id="s2367">They were very much involved with their own little group, clique, or family.</span> <span id="s2368">They were very quick to anger, they were very accusatory, they were quick to accuse others of doing things that were harmful or crude, or whatever.</span> <span id="s2369">People were not nice to each other in those D.P. camps.</span> <span id="s2370">I don’t know why...(inaudible).</span> <span id="s2371">When I thought about it later, I thought the reason was also, that they were displaced people.</span> <span id="s2372">That was basically it.</span> <span id="s2373">They had no sense of commonality with those whom they met in those D.P. camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">Q: Unless they came from their home-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2376">Unless they came from their hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">Q: (inaudible)...when you think about it, do you see differences between what happened to Jews during the Holocaust and what happened, say to- remember Biafra (inaudible) or in Cambodia, a couple million Cambodians were killed, (inaudible), Moslems, and Hindus killed each other, India, the Armenians that died- (inaudible) do you see differences between Jews (inaudible)...</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">A: Well I think that those were territorial disputes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">Q: Moslems and Hindus were religious disputes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">A: Those were religious-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">Q: Cambodians were not disputing (inaudible) territory (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">A: They were political disputes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2386">And the Armenians-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Well I think that that is sort of always compared to the Jews being exterminated...</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: So you do see the difference or you don’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: I see a difference because first of all, it wasn’t done on the same scale.</span> <span id="s2390">And these, as I said, when it comes to the Hindus and the Moslems these religious wars are not uncommon.</span> <span id="s2391">Religious intolerance has existed all the time, I think since modern history began, and even before modern history, so I don’t view that as the same.</span> <span id="s2392">And I think the other conflicts were political.</span> <span id="s2393">Or economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Do you think it’s possible that the Holocaust might occur here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">A: I have not thought that it’s totally- that it could be ruled out completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: It’s unlikely, but not impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: You don’t think that there’s a particular reason, (inaudible) you look back in terms of the most important reason for surviving?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: For surviving?</span> <span id="s2400">(inaudible) No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: Given everything that you went through.</span> <span id="s2402">And you went through a good deal, but you also had- you’re happy you were born, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: (inaudible) You see, I- I never, uhm,.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: You don’t think that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: I don’t think that way.</span> <span id="s2406">I mean, I never thought, ‘Oh gee, I wish I wasn’t born.’</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Did you ever think it would have been better if you had been born a Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">A: I never thought of that either (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">Q: Remember, you said something, ‘innate’ before.</span> <span id="s2410">What do you think- we Jews, we’ve been around a long time, right.</span> <span id="s2411">Thousands of years.</span> <span id="s2412">Syrians have died off, the Babylonians are gone, all of these people gone, and we, as opposed to the (inaudible) other nationalities, we survived without any land of our own.</span> <span id="s2413">(inaudible)...what do you think accounts for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">A: Yes, I have thought about it.</span> <span id="s2415">I have thought about it.</span> <span id="s2416">And I haven’t come up with an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">Q: You’re not the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">A: I haven’t come up with an answer, except that I think people, you know, people need some anchor, or some tradition, and uh-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">Q: We have it, and the others don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: ...right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Why did we have it?</span> <span id="s2422">...or what was our anchor?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: (laughs) Well, you know, I could say the Torah, but-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Well, until...200 years ago, there weren’t any Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, assimilated Jews, so you could say ‘The Torah’...you wouldn’t be imitating a Rabbi when you say that .</span> <span id="s2425">It’s an answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Well, but you see, I think that it’s probably more than that.</span> <span id="s2427">I think maybe because it was always ingrained in the Jewish people that they were- you know I remember from way back when I started learning about Judaism and so on- that the Jews were a Chosen People.</span> <span id="s2428">Not chosen as a preferred people, but you know, chosen to carry the word of G-d.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: So you think it’s a form of specialness?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Yeh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: (inaudible) enable us, that we believe that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yes, I think that the Jews have always felt-been enbued with the sense of responsibility-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Well, in a sense, surviving Holocaust is like surviving the greatest catastrophe (inaudible)...did the fact that you went through the Holocaust help you in any way?</span> <span id="s2434">Did you see any shred of (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: No.</span> <span id="s2436">I didn’t see anything positive coming out of it.</span> <span id="s2437">At ALL!</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: (inaudible)...what do survivors think can be done, if anything, to prevent future Holocaust from occurring?</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Great vigilance.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Do you think that the Holocaust in any way, changed the course of history?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: I’m sure it did.</span> <span id="s2442">I’m sure it did, but I- well, as I say, one of the things that came as a result of it is Eretz Yisrael.</span> <span id="s2443">I’m convinced that, you know world felt very guilty and-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: Wouldn’t have had it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: Well, I don’t know if we wouldn’t have had it.</span> <span id="s2446">But,-</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: It helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: I think it did, probably, yes.</span> <span id="s2449">It accelerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">Q: When you think about why you survived, what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: I think it was just a set of circumstances that were in my favor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: Would you call it luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">A: Well for want of a better word, yes, I think luck plays a role in our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Do you think your kids would have a chance of surviving, a good chance of surviving if there was a Holocaust again?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: (sigh and pause).</span> <span id="s2456">First of all, I fervently hope that, you know, nothing like that will ever befall them or any of my (inaudible) but I can’t speculate on something on something like that.</span> <span id="s2457">It’s really too horrible.</span> <span id="s2458">- But you see, the way I think about it is this way: I thought about it.</span> <span id="s2459">I feel that hopefully they would be smart enough to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s2460">Because you see, we couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: In time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: In time, right.</span> <span id="s2463">I mean, we-there was no Israel.</span> <span id="s2464">And that’s why I feel so strongly that there has to be an Israel.</span> <span id="s2465">But-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: In this visit really.</span> <span id="s2467">(inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Oh, yes, it gave me a very good sense (laughs) of safety (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: (inaudible)...do you know of any survivors...have you ever met any survivors in the United States who were passing as Gentiles or who at least refused to admit that they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: ...I haven’t met anybody whose refusing to be Jewish, you know, who...I mean, I have met through Ralph’s family and so on, I’ve met people who were as far removed-.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">End of Tape #3, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
