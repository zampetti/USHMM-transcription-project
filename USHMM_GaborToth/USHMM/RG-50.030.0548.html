2008</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with José Coltof, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on November 9th, 2008 in Alexandria, Virginia.</span> <span id="s12">Thank you very much for agreeing to talk to us today, José.</span> <span id="s13">We really –</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Answer: José.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: – appreciate it.</span> <span id="s16">José, sorry.</span> <span id="s17">Let’s start like we always do in these interviews, at the beginning.</span> <span id="s18">Tell me about your – your family, tell me about where you were born, the circumstances, your mother, father, brother, sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s20">I come from a typical Dutch Jewish middle class family.</span> <span id="s21">My mother came from a family of five, she had two brothers, two sisters and parents, and everybody was married.</span> <span id="s22">My father came from a family of three, he had two sisters.</span> <span id="s23">One was married and had six kids, and the other one never married.</span> <span id="s24">My father’s sister with the six kids had only one surviving child, my cousin, who was my only survivor other than my mother, that survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: What were their names [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Their names were – my mother’s name – my mother’s maid – my mother’s name was Hannah Feldman(ph), her maiden name was Feldman(ph), and my father’s name was Marwitz(ph) Farp(ph).</span> <span id="s27">And my father dealt in animal hides, and my mother – my grandfather del – was a butcher, a ko – kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s28">And everybody lived in Amsterdam at the time, except my grandparents on my mother’s side, they moved about 10 years before, to The Hague, for health reasons.</span> <span id="s29">My grandfather had some respiratory problems and the doctor suggested that he should be near the salt sea air, so they moved to the – The Hague.</span> <span id="s30">And the life was, you know, very typical, like in the Dutch way.</span> <span id="s31">We were a religious family and life was good, everybody –</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Did you have a – brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: My mother had – my parents married in 1929, and two years later my mother had a child, a – a daughter, called Judith, who had some sort of a disease that they couldn’t treat at the time, at the – when she ate, sh-she vomited or she had diarrhea, and they couldn’t stop it, and eventually, at age two, she died.</span> <span id="s34">So I never knew – [coughing] – sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: That’s all right, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: – another sibling.</span> <span id="s37">But sh – they did have another child.</span> <span id="s38">And then, I’m the only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Well, tell me a little bit – I mean, if you were born in 1942, as it says here on our – our questionnaire, tell me a little bit about the circumstances you heard of when the war erupted.</span> <span id="s40">What happened with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What happened before your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s44">My mother, it’s very ironic that she and I are the only ones that survived.</span> <span id="s45">When “Mein Kampf” was written, my mother was very smart, and she says, this guy is not fooling around.</span> <span id="s46">He’s really gonna kill us all.</span> <span id="s47">We better get the hell out of here.</span> <span id="s48">And a lot of Dutch Jews had the misconception that Holland would stay neutral.</span> <span id="s49">And why was that?</span> <span id="s50">Because during World War I, Holland stayed neutral.</span> <span id="s51">And they figured – so they said, well, even if, you know, the war breaks out, we’ll just stay neutral in Holland and we have nothing to worry about.</span> <span id="s52">And my mother was very smart and she says, we may want to stay neutral, but Hitler won’t let us.</span> <span id="s53">And she made everybody crazy, said, let’s get out, we have to get out of here.</span> <span id="s54">If we – th – it’s not good, we must leave Europe.</span> <span id="s55">She was obsessed with leaving Europe and going to America.</span> <span id="s56">And nobody wanted to listen to her, because in Holland, like I said, they – they all thought nothing was gonna happen there.</span> <span id="s57">And there were other people like my mother.</span> <span id="s58">My – as a matter of fact, after I got married, my father-in-law – my – my husband’s grandfather was the same thing, he also saw it come.</span> <span id="s59">And it got to the point that people didn’t invite him any more, because they didn’t want to hear this doomsaying, and i – this – they didn’t want to get depressed, and they said he’s crazy.</span> <span id="s60">And that’s how a lot of people felt.</span> <span id="s61">My whole family could have been saved, because my mother had a brother whose wife had a sister in England, in London, married to a famous hazan there, and she would have –</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Can you tell me what that is, hazan?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: A cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: A cousin?</span> <span id="s65">A cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: A cantor, a cantor.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Uh-huh, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: And she would have happily you – you know, let everybody come.</span> <span id="s69">But they just didn’t see it, they just thought that everybody that said, let’s get out, let’s get out, let’s go crazy.</span> <span id="s70">So finally my mother said, okay, if nobody will listen to me, I’ll try to get papers on my own, and I’ll leave on my own.</span> <span id="s71">And she went, as she told me, she went already to the American consulate and started to get things going a little bit.</span> <span id="s72">But of course, then the war broke out and she got stuck like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And the war broke out when?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: The war broke out May – I believe it was May 10 – in May, was May 10th or May 15th.</span> <span id="s75">Broke out in May 1940, in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: And she got stuck.</span> <span id="s78">So then I was born, and even already before I was born, in beginning of 1942, things started to get – the very first year or so, things weren’t so bad yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Can I ask a few questions about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s81">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Were you born in your family’s home?</span> <span id="s83">A: No, I was born in the CIZ, it was called.</span> <span id="s84">Th-The Central Israeli Ziekenhuis.</span> <span id="s85">It was th-the Jewish hospital in Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s87">But your parents still lived in their own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Did they still have –</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: They had an apartment, and they lived in their apartment, yes.</span> <span id="s91">And then what they did is, the men were called up to so-called work camp, and the Dutch are very gullible, and they said, well maybe if we do as we’re told, it won’t so bad if we – you know, don’t try to get away with something.</span> <span id="s92">And my mother again was smart, and she says – my father was – I was born in March 4, 1942, and they started to call up the men, and my father’s call-up came and my mother said, let’s go into hiding.</span> <span id="s93">Being that my father was dealing in animal hides, he knew every farmer in town, and he was apparently a very nice man.</span> <span id="s94">And somebody would have gladly put him up.</span> <span id="s95">No, no, no, I’ll go, I’ll go.</span> <span id="s96">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: This was in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: This was in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s99">And he never went into hiding.</span> <span id="s100">Then, when I was four months old, my father left.</span> <span id="s101">They – people had to go to the train station and at s – at the platform of the train station, my mother said, I beg of you, don’t go.</span> <span id="s102">Come – come with me, come, let’s go into hiding.</span> <span id="s103">He went.</span> <span id="s104">That was the last time she ever saw him.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: And you never knew him?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Of course not, of course – I was four months old.</span> <span id="s107">So then what happened, she went home to the apartment.</span> <span id="s108">And one night, not long after my father had left, maybe a couple of days later, whatever, the Nazis came, you know, they came and did house searches to take people out.</span> <span id="s109">And she went upstairs to the bedroom and she put the covers under her head.</span> <span id="s110">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s112">Okay, sh – covers were over her head.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: So, the covers were over her head, and it’s like a miracle, I was a four month old baby, most of the time babies cry, right?</span> <span id="s114">I don’t know, instincts, I didn't cry.</span> <span id="s115">And it was dark, and my mother describes they – they had flashlights and they went over the – with the flashlight and said – and then one said to his partner, said, ah, there’s nothing here, let’s get out.</span> <span id="s116">At that point my mother said, this is getting a little bit too hot, we better go into hiding.</span> <span id="s117">So my mother had an address.</span> <span id="s118">Her sister worked in a bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did your mother, by the way, was she a homemaker, or wi – did she also have a job someplace?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No.</span> <span id="s121">No, no, she was a typical –</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Homemaker.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: – [indecipherable] homemaker, yeah.</span> <span id="s124">And her sister worked in this bakery.</span> <span id="s125">And one of her customers said to her once, if you ever need a place to hide, or any of your family, this is our address.</span> <span id="s126">And sh-she gave her the [indecipherable] to my mother, so my mother had that address.</span> <span id="s127">And after this little incident, she went over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Can I st – interrupt again for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: By this point, was the rest of the family still not believing the danger that was going on?</span> <span id="s131">I mean, I – I take it that what you are telling me now is a retelling as your mother explained it to you, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Right.</span> <span id="s133">Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: And – and while one could be incredulous and not believe it when “Mein Kampf” comes out in 1920 –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: – in the 1920s, by the time you’re rolling around and it’s 1940 and people are being taken away and there’s searches, then that could change a few minds.</span> <span id="s137">What was that like?</span> <span id="s138">I mean, did she ever talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: By – by then you couldn’t get out, unless you had li – you had a lot of money and a lot of connections.</span> <span id="s140">By the time people realized, yeah, that maybe she was right, you tried to get out, it was almost impossible.</span> <span id="s141">You had to, as I said, lots of money and lots of connections, and lots of luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: My in-laws got out, I can tell you about that later, that’s nothing to do with me particularly, but they did get out in 1940, four months after the invasion.</span> <span id="s144">But by the time the people realized, it was too late, it real – really was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: There was nothing you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s148">So let’s go back, she has this address –</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: So, she has this address, and she goes to this family, and they let her in, and Amsterdam was the more Protestant family.</span> <span id="s150">The sou-southern part of Holland was more Catholic, bordering Belgium.</span> <span id="s151">The northern part in Amsterdam was more Protestant, but there were also Catholic families, they just tended to have bigger families, I guess they didn’t believe in birth control or whatever, they just tended to have bigger families.</span> <span id="s152">And that particular family also they had a bunch of daughters.</span> <span id="s153">There was about six kid – five, six kids in the family, seven, whatever, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s154">And so my mother was 35 at that point, and they had a bunch of daughters all in their 30s, so my mother could blend in.</span> <span id="s155">My mother also did not look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s156">My mother could easily have blended in.</span> <span id="s157">Some of the Catholics looked more Jewish than she did, so – she was a little woman, she was slight, and she did no – my friend here to see – no, Mama, no, didn’t look Jewish at all.</span> <span id="s158">So, she blended in.</span> <span id="s159">So they let her in, and while she was there, not very long, they said look, Annie, they’re – she went by the name Annie – they said Annie, you know, we – we want you to stay and you’re welcome to stay with us, but you have to find a place for the child, because our neighbors know that none of my daughters were pregnant, and when all of a sudden a baby cries, and a baby appeared, they know that something is up, and the baby will give us all away.</span> <span id="s160">And my mother realized, of course, they were right, and she certainly didn’t want to jeopardize their life and her life and my life, so she set about finding a place for me.</span> <span id="s161">And she really didn’t have a place.</span> <span id="s162">But apparently, from what she told me, there was an org – an underground organization consisting of doctors, nurses and medical students.</span> <span id="s163">And if you needed a place for a child, you could go there, and they would place the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: But she didn't know them personally?</span> <span id="s165">She didn’t know the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, no, no, she just went to that organi – it was an underground organization, like, you know, like anything.</span> <span id="s167">So, my mother went there and she said, I have a four months old that needs to be placed, do you have a spot for her?</span> <span id="s168">And they said, okay, on such and such a day, a couple will appear, and they will take your child away; they will take your child into hiding.</span> <span id="s169">And they tried to match up the couples with the ages.</span> <span id="s170">Like, if there was a teenager, they wouldn’t give it a couple in their early 20s, that would look out of place, you didn’t want to walk – so, like I was four months old, so they gave me to a couple in their 20s.</span> <span id="s171">And my mother did, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Must have been a tough day for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: And, as she describes, she packed my things, and she put a few special things in there, like a – what do you call that thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: A rattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: A rattle.</span> <span id="s176">A special rattle and some other things.</span> <span id="s177">And I had a little birthmark on my thigh, I think, but I don’t have it any more, but I had that.</span> <span id="s178">And she figured if when the war is over, and she didn’t – nobody knew when it would be over, and a four months old, after a year you don’t recognize your own child, she would ask for the things, at least she would be able to identify her own child.</span> <span id="s179">Which, by the way, is exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s180">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Smart lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: – I can just imagine my poor mother, two strangers come to the door, and she handed me to two strangers, not knowing if she would ever see me again.</span> <span id="s183">In the beginning of the war from ol – this is all what she told me, they would tell the parents where they took the children.</span> <span id="s184">The Nazis soon found out about that, and they would get the parents and torture them long enough that it would give away the address of the children.</span> <span id="s185">By the time I was hidden, my mother wasn’t told anything.</span> <span id="s186">They wouldn’t tell me wha – what ci-ci – what city I went to, who I went to, where, she knew nothing, just handed me, and that was it.</span> <span id="s187">I was extraordinarily fortunate.</span> <span id="s188">Why?</span> <span id="s189">Because I came to a childless couple who were absolutely fantastic to me, who loved me dearly, who did everything and anything in their power to make things bearable…</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: We were talking about your foster parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: And – and your luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: As I said, they were very – they were a childless couple, extraordinarily nice to me, and what was my luck?</span> <span id="s194">Number one that they were childless.</span> <span id="s195">In a way that was very lucky because they put all their love and – you know, devotion to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: And for some reason, I stayed with them the whole war.</span> <span id="s198">They – I guess we clicked.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: So your earliest real memories would be of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s201">So, but – well, why I say I was lucky, because I have many friends that were in hiding, and they were bounced from place to place to place.</span> <span id="s202">And that was a terrible th-thing.</span> <span id="s203">Every time you were attached to something, you know, they – they had to leave again, for a variety of reasons.</span> <span id="s204">That’s why I consider myself lucky that they were good people.</span> <span id="s205">They treated me like their own.</span> <span id="s206">Their extended family were very good.</span> <span id="s207">My foster mother had a brother, a-and a s – a sister and mother-in-law that lived in town, and their children, they were good to me.</span> <span id="s208">Her parents lived in town.</span> <span id="s209">They were all very good to me.</span> <span id="s210">And ber – being a very good [indecipherable] I mean, the neighborhood – I was wa – hidden in a town called Utrecht.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And I was hidden in an area called rivier er buurt, which means the river – the river neighborhood.</span> <span id="s213">Why?</span> <span id="s214">Because a lot of the streets were named after rivers.</span> <span id="s215">And apparently there were a lot of Jewish children hidden in that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s216">So – and the underground knew about that.</span> <span id="s217">So, when they staged a raids, most of the time, the underground had enough time to ring the doorbell and said, get the kids out of here, a raid is coming.</span> <span id="s218">And guess where they took me?</span> <span id="s219">To her parents, to her sister and brother-in-law and their children.</span> <span id="s220">So not only did they –</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Also in Utrecht?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: All na – all in Utrecht, yes.</span> <span id="s223">So, not only did they themselves risk their life, her parents, her sister and brother-in-law, their children.</span> <span id="s224">I mean, it’s unbelievable, and they were all good to me, I have the fondest of memories.</span> <span id="s225">I was playing with their children –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: I’d like to ask you about your earliest memories, then.</span> <span id="s227">Now we’re at a point of your story where it’s no longer as it was told to you –</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: – but where you start –</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: I re –</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: – remembering things.</span> <span id="s232">Can you tell me, what are those things you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Probably I remember being with them, being with my foster parents.</span> <span id="s234">I remember them –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did you call them Mommy and Poppy?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: So they were your Mommy and Poppy.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh, there’s no question.</span> <span id="s239">And her parents were Oma and Opa and – and her sister and brother-in-law were, you know, Ome and Tante, aunt and uncle, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s240">And they were my cousins, no question.</span> <span id="s241">Of course, it was lucky for their part also that I was a baby when I came there.</span> <span id="s242">A child that comes at a year or two had a recollection of their parents, can give it all away by saying something wrong.</span> <span id="s243">I didn’t know anything but them, so I could never speak out of tur-turn, I could never say anything wrong, because all I knew was them.</span> <span id="s244">I remember going to look for food.</span> <span id="s245">They would go out of town to the farms, I think – and buy some f – get some food.</span> <span id="s246">And I remember they went on like a – a car, a flat car with big wheels, and somebody would pull it.</span> <span id="s247">And it was like – like a hay – like today kids would go on a hayride, and it was kind of – of an adventure for a child.</span> <span id="s248">And they told me we’re gonna look for food.</span> <span id="s249">I remember those things very clearly.</span> <span id="s250">We went, you know, as often as we could, whatever they could get.</span> <span id="s251">I remember whenever I went outside, if you look at me, brown eyes and brown hair – brown hair, and as a child too, I was, for Holland, a very Jewish looking child.</span> <span id="s252">And whenever we went outside, I was told to look down so that my eyes couldn’t be seen, and I always got a kerchief or a hat on my head so my brown hair wouldn’t show.</span> <span id="s253">And I remember that.</span> <span id="s254">Yoka(ph), I was called Yoka(ph), we all had a name, they gave us a name.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And what was your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: My name was – th-they called me Yoka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: Yoka(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Yoka(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Is that a nickname or a full, normal name?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: No, they gave me that name, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: – every child got an – got a ha – a hiding name.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Especially if they have Jewish sounding – José is not particularly Jewish sounding name, but every – they – they identifal – you know, they – they give the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: I remember them very fondly.</span> <span id="s267">(Oh, sorry.)</span> <span id="s268">I remember very fondly them sitting in Holland – you know, you had no central heating, you had like a – a st – what do you c – pot belly stove –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: A little stove, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: – you know.</span> <span id="s271">And we would sit around it and they would sing songs to me at night.</span> <span id="s272">And, now you shouldn’t think there was anything in that potbelly stove, they had nothing to heat it with, but just the illusion, you think you sit in front of the stove, you feel warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: It’s warm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It’s warm.</span> <span id="s275">And I remember the singing their songs to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What were their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Turner Hefferness(ph).</span> <span id="s278">And the beauty of this, why I tell you this in particular, after I moved to America and I got married, I had them come.</span> <span id="s279">And when my daughter was si – what – how old was she?</span> <span id="s280">She was four, my son was six, something like that, was the last time they were here together, they would sit with my daughter on their lap and sing the same songs they sang to me.</span> <span id="s281">So life really came full cycle.</span> <span id="s282">I remember that, I remember being taken to her parents, to my f – f – I don’t know, to my foster mother’s parents, playing with the children.</span> <span id="s283">I have pictures of my playing in the yard with them, I remember the – the – the house.</span> <span id="s284">All those things I do remember.</span> <span id="s285">I guess when you live – and it was very clear that we were living under very bad circumstances.</span> <span id="s286">I mean, the na – the word Nazis was – was used, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: It was something you remember being – hearing, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: – like the Nazi is a boogeyman.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: You remember it very well, that outside the house there was danger.</span> <span id="s293">And of course, there were also a number of close calls.</span> <span id="s294">Like I told you before, then the na – th-the underground would come when they knew they were staging a raid.</span> <span id="s295">A few times – this is all they told me, this I don’t remember, of course.</span> <span id="s296">One time they had no time to get me out, so they had to do a little quick thinking and my foster father decided he was going to lay in bed and say he was sick, and they would put me on the foot end of the bed, and he made believe he was laying with his feet up on the pillow, and I was put in the foot end.</span> <span id="s297">And they really came in looking at the house, and they didn’t see a child, and they left again.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: That was a very close call.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: [indecipherable] a close call, I could have coughed, cried.</span> <span id="s300">I was, you know, by that time where I could have been a year old, I don’t know how old I was, I didn’t ask him how old I was at that point.</span> <span id="s301">But it’s like a child senses fear, and those went to, you know, do what’s right, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s302">Another close call was my foster mother’s mother [indecipherable] that they took me to her too sometime.</span> <span id="s303">Came for a visit one day, and she – the underground came and told them, you have 10 minutes to get out, they’re very close, get the children out.</span> <span id="s304">So she said to my foster mother, I’ll take her home, just – and she says, and give me her dirty laundry, go to the laundry.</span> <span id="s305">And my foster mother says, why?</span> <span id="s306">She says, just – I just have a hunch, do me a favor, you never know where they’re looking.</span> <span id="s307">Because babies clothes meant evidence.</span> <span id="s308">So, to satisfy her mother, okay, here’s the dirty laundry.</span> <span id="s309">And off we went.</span> <span id="s310">They came, is a child here?</span> <span id="s311">No, no child, they went looking through the house, no child.</span> <span id="s312">Can I see your dirty laundry, please?</span> <span id="s313">If it wasn’t for her instinct I probably wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you.</span> <span id="s314">Those are the things that happened.</span> <span id="s315">You always have to go by your guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Yeah, it’s amazing what that instinct can tell people.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Always go by your guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Always.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: So, aside from – aside from that memory of going out to the fields in the – you know, in that hay, in th – in that sort of like cart that someone is pushing, what are some of the other memories that you have of them, of the larger family, of your first years.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Getting together.</span> <span id="s322">I remember going to church, my first religious experience was not in a synagogue, was in church.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Was it a Catholic church, did you – or was it a Protestant –</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: No, they were Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: They were Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: They were Protestant, they were Protestant.</span> <span id="s327">It was very important to know that not only were they Protestant, they were very devout Protestant, they were very religious.</span> <span id="s328">And the reason they took me was their Christian duty.</span> <span id="s329">They felt it was their Christian duty.</span> <span id="s330">Somewhere in the back of their minds, they also figured, well, if they don’t come back, they’ll have another Christian child.</span> <span id="s331">That was in the back of all their mind.</span> <span id="s332">Doesn’t bal – bother me, because you know, what they did was good, the rest doesn’t really matter.</span> <span id="s333">But it was definitely – I don’t know if they were not such devout Christians that they would have done it.</span> <span id="s334">They felt it was their Christian duty to save a – to save a Jewish child.</span> <span id="s335">It was that motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Do you remember anything about the church they would take you to?</span> <span id="s337">Any kind of thoughts, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: No, no, I just remember walking in – in a building, it was a church and of course when you’re a young child everything seems very big.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: And there was a children’s choir and towards the end of the war I remember singing in it.</span> <span id="s341">They – the little – there were little kids singing a song.</span> <span id="s342">That was my first, you know, recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s344">Let’s go forward then.</span> <span id="s345">I mean, if those are the memories that you have, you’re sitting around a potbelly stove, or you’re – or you’re in the choir, or you’re going out to the – to the fields –</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: And walking around after dinner, we would take a – take a walk, usually, if the weather permitted.</span> <span id="s347">Holland doesn’t have such great weather always, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s349">So, when did – when did things change?</span> <span id="s350">What happened?</span> <span id="s351">A: Interesting you should ask that.</span> <span id="s352">For us hidden children, the worst was not during the war.</span> <span id="s353">Believe it or not, the worst was after the war was over.</span> <span id="s354">Because specially those of us that were born during the war were so young and were given as babies, we didn’t know our families.</span> <span id="s355">All we knew is what we knew.</span> <span id="s356">These are our parents, this is our family.</span> <span id="s357">And one day, I came home – like I said, we – I would take a walk after dinner with my father, the war was over, and something amazing happened.</span> <span id="s358">The war was over and my mother, of course, went to look for survivors, first looked for her child.</span> <span id="s359">And that same organization where she went to place me, she went to to find me.</span> <span id="s360">And she stated her name and the name of her child.</span> <span id="s361">And they produced a neat, nice, little list, and they said, oh your child is there, and there in that address [indecipherable] Utrecht.</span> <span id="s362">And I often think to myself, if the Nazis would have found those lists, again I wouldn’t be sitting talking to you.</span> <span id="s363">But they were so organized, they could tell her immediately where I was.</span> <span id="s364">So, she couldn’t get to me right away, because there was no transportation of any kind in – you had to have, I guess, some money, I don’t know what.</span> <span id="s365">But, after about a couple of month, the next month or so, or two months, she came for a visit, she came to see me.</span> <span id="s366">And I remember going for my evening constitutional with my foster father, and we come home, and in the kitchen on a four prong stool – I’ll – never in my life do I look at a four prong stool and not associate that – there’s a lady sitting.</span> <span id="s367">And I was raised to be a polite little girl, and I s-stretched my hand out, and I want to shake her hand.</span> <span id="s368">And I said, good evening lady.</span> <span id="s369">And just like I’m sitting here talking to you, she says, you don’t have to call me lady.</span> <span id="s370">You can call me Mommy.</span> <span id="s371">I am your mother, these are not your parents.</span> <span id="s372">When you’re a three year old, your life as you know it at that point falls apart.</span> <span id="s373">So, like I said, I had kind of a secure little world with people that I loved and loved me, and there comes this strange lady, and telling me she’s not my mother.</span> <span id="s374">What is a three year old supposed to think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: It’s terrifying.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: They weren’t psychologically very astute in those days.</span> <span id="s377">This is not the way you tell a child, you know, her whereabouts.</span> <span id="s378">And life after that was, for us children, very traumatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Well, tell me how it was for you.</span> <span id="s380">What happened to you?</span> <span id="s381">A: M-My mother came for the visit, she stayed a little bit and she went home.</span> <span id="s382">And then she would come to visit.</span> <span id="s383">And after she got away from her foster family and established herself in the apartment, which was – the Jews in those days didn’t invest their money in stocks and bonds and mutual funds, there was no thing in those days.</span> <span id="s384">And the stock market they didn’t trust, so if you had a little money, you bought a house, you bought real estate.</span> <span id="s385">And those typical European houses, you know, were three, four story homes.</span> <span id="s386">So everybody had real estate.</span> <span id="s387">So one house, two house, 10 house, whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: And my grandfather had a home in amster – you know, several houses in Amsterdam, and what my mother did is first after she looked to establish herself, she went into one of her house of her father and took an apartment and went to live there.</span> <span id="s390">So after she came to visit a few times here and there, she took me for a few days to stay with her.</span> <span id="s391">Now, also, you have to understand something else.</span> <span id="s392">They didn't give me up willingly.</span> <span id="s393">My fa – foster father and mother made a pact that if the war is over and one of my parents would survive or both, they would give me back to parents, but to nobody else.</span> <span id="s394">So if, for instance, my mother would not have survived, and my father did not survive, and an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent would come back, they weren’t going to return me.</span> <span id="s395">And they had the law of the land with them, because the Dutch decided that it was in the best interest of the children not to be uprooted.</span> <span id="s396">S – and a lot of parents had big problems getting their children back.</span> <span id="s397">And they didn’t give me willingly.</span> <span id="s398">They tried to convince my mother that maybe it was better I should stay with them.</span> <span id="s399">Now, I can –</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Do you remember – I – I’m sorry to interrupt here, but do you remember any of your response after that first time when she came and she said, they’re not your parents, I am your mother?</span> <span id="s401">Did you cry, did you ask about it when she left, did you – do you remember anything of –</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I was so dumbfounded, I don’t think I cried.</span> <span id="s403">I – I must have just stood there, not knowing what to think.</span> <span id="s404">What do you think?</span> <span id="s405">What do you mean this is not my mother?</span> <span id="s406">A child doesn’t understand –</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: – the reproductive system.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: When somebody says call me mommy, you’re mommy.</span> <span id="s411">And they were good to me, I had no reason to doubt that they were my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: They couldn’t be better if they tried, they were wonderful people.</span> <span id="s414">It’s – all of a sudden the – I mean, I was just so stunned and dumbfounded, but you sure don’t know what to think any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Did you think you – do you think you changed in who you were and how you acted?</span> <span id="s416">Do you think – did they ever tell you, your foster parents, that they saw a change in you?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No, no, because I think they were all trying to pull their own weight.</span> <span id="s418">My mother, yes she had lost her whole family, which by the way, she didn't know yet at that point, because people didn’t know until a few years after if people had survived the war.</span> <span id="s419">It wasn’t the computer age, and the Red Cross gave you the information.</span> <span id="s420">And people went for years after to look at lists at the Red Cross to see if anybody had survived.</span> <span id="s421">So my mother was not aware that everybody had been killed.</span> <span id="s422">She didn’t know yet.</span> <span id="s423">But I can imagine, after her own source, and her own – you know, it wasn’t easy for her to be in hiding either, and then you find your child and your child is a stranger to you and the child doesn’t want you, and my mother didn't even know right away that it was right, and she asked to see that rattle, and if you remember in the beginning I told you she packed some things.</span> <span id="s424">She asked to see if they had the suitcase that she packed for me.</span> <span id="s425">And sure enough they produced it, and she looked to see if I had the birthmark on my thigh and there it was.</span> <span id="s426">I don’t have it any more, but it was, I guess, a sign from God to show me who I was.</span> <span id="s427">And I can imagine how terrible for my mother.</span> <span id="s428">I mean, she would – the children that were older, that were reunited with their parent, they run to their parent, Mommy, Mommy.</span> <span id="s429">I didn’t run to my mother, I didn’t want to go to her.</span> <span id="s430">On the other hand I also understand my foster parents, who knew when they took me, it wasn’t an adoption.</span> <span id="s431">It was – I was given there for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s432">They knew that they weren’t supposed to keep me.</span> <span id="s433">But I can also understand, I have children and a grandchild myself, you get attached to a child, especially when you shelter a child against such horror.</span> <span id="s434">You don’t want to give the – I understand their point too, as an adult.</span> <span id="s435">As a child, I didn’t, of course.</span> <span id="s436">So I remember it was very tense between my foster parents, especially my foster father and my mother.</span> <span id="s437">It wasn’t an easy relationship.</span> <span id="s438">And my mother would have liked nothing better than I would have said to her, oh, I don’t want nothing to do with these people, I only want to be with you.</span> <span id="s439">And I didn’t do that.</span> <span id="s440">I loved these people dearly, and I’ve loved them til the end of their days, and I had them come here to America and they met my husband and my children.</span> <span id="s441">And, you know, I did whatever I could to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: It is –</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: It is just such a sad – I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: It is tragic, and it – and requires such a sacrifice.</span> <span id="s445">You know, as I hear you speak and – and – and point out, you know, the heartbreak on all of the sides –</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: All of the sides –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: All of the sides.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: – I mean, it is so unfair, I mean, I can understand it was terrible.</span> <span id="s449">It wouldn’t have been as bad for my foster parents, even though they were very attached to me, of course, to give me up, had they had their own children.</span> <span id="s450">I guess that made also a bit of a difference.</span> <span id="s451">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s452">And many years after the war they told me, no matter how bad the war was, having me were the best years of their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: Oh, how wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Yeah, imagine that.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: How wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: And I was an adult, I was living in America already.</span> <span id="s457">I have a – that’s what they said to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: But you know, there’s also something else that – in what you say that in many ways it’s – there’s a great deal of joy in this.</span> <span id="s459">We’re talking this weekend with a lot of people who are child survivors, who were hidden, and one of the themes that comes through in many stories, and a sadness that just doesn’t go away, is the abandonment.</span> <span id="s460">Children were abandoned because they had to be, because the parents wanted them to find some way of surviving.</span> <span id="s461">And then, after the war, sometimes there were relatives who were never interested in picking up those abandoned children.</span> <span id="s462">And in your case, what you have is the opposite of that, is that everybody wanted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: That, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And then – and when you think developmentally, what a child needs, every single one, a chi –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: Is to be wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Is to be wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: That, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: And the foundation that that gives –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: That yes, that yes, that yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: – for a future life.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: But it was very hard for me.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, I couldn’t understand why – my mother was very grateful to them, but you wouldn’t know it in the way she expressed it.</span> <span id="s473">Like – like I said, there was a jealousy.</span> <span id="s474">And I belong to a child survivor group and when we sat around and talking about it, most of us that were babies that were born, you know, during the war, they all have the same experience.</span> <span id="s475">The – the parents really would have liked the children to be estranged from the foster parents.</span> <span id="s476">But we kids, we wouldn’t let.</span> <span id="s477">We really – I – it’s probably a sign of strength on our part, as little as we were, I wouldn’t let my mother not have contact with them.</span> <span id="s478">She would have loved it if I would have said, you know what?</span> <span id="s479">You’re my mother now, I don’t need them any more.</span> <span id="s480">Oh no, I wouldn’t let them do that.</span> <span id="s481">I wouldn’t let them do that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: So, do you remember the – do you remember the day that you no longer lived with them?</span> <span id="s483">A: No.</span> <span id="s484">No, I – I – I think I probably blocked it out, it must have been so traumatic for me to leave them, that I probably totally blocked it.</span> <span id="s485">Like there’s certain things you block out, and I must have blocked that out.</span> <span id="s486">I don’t remember the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: So, do you remember – do you remember how you felt to your mother, your real mother in the beginning, and how that grew and cha –</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: I resented her.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: I resented her for taking me away from them, and it was very difficult to be with my mother.</span> <span id="s491">She loved me, but she didn’t express it in a way that I express my love for my children.</span> <span id="s492">She didn't pick me up and hug me a lot, she wasn’t very demonstrative.</span> <span id="s493">And she loved me conditionally, not unconditionally.</span> <span id="s494">And it went something like this, you know, I can take all this love – loss of all my family, and she really never lost her whole family, if you’re only a good girl, if you’re only – it was very conditional.</span> <span id="s495">And I remember, I was married –</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: It’s a huge burden on a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: It’s ridiculous.</span> <span id="s498">And I remember – I think I was married already and I said to my mother, you know, what you expect of me is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s499">You had – lost her whole family, as I said.</span> <span id="s500">I said, I only know how to be your daughter.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t how to be your husband, I don’t know how to be your brother, your sister, your brother-in-law, your sister-in-law, your nieces, your nephews.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t know – I can’t make up for all these people.</span> <span id="s503">I only know how to be your child, that’s it.</span> <span id="s504">And, you know, it’s – she expects it – something [indecipherable] and wasn’t possible to give to her.</span> <span id="s505">But never – she was – she felt all alone, and she was all alone.</span> <span id="s506">But, I think if she would – she never gave me a compliment for anything, never, never.</span> <span id="s507">And it was very stupid.</span> <span id="s508">If she would have done that, I would have maybe done more of what she wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: How sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Like, she never told me she loved me til she was almost dying, but she would tell other people, oh she’s so wonderful, I love her so much.</span> <span id="s511">That’s not the way to raise a child.</span> <span id="s512">So – and the insecurity by living alone was terrible, as some – every child worries about what happens if their parents die.</span> <span id="s513">You know, children are not stupid, they hear the plane crashes, cat – car crashes.</span> <span id="s514">What happens if – if my parents die?</span> <span id="s515">So I didn’t have parents, I had my mother alone.</span> <span id="s516">And I had, as I said before, I had one surviving cousin, who moved to Los Angeles, at my mother’s assistant.</span> <span id="s517">As a matter of fact, after the war, when my cousin came back, my mother stood there, and I remember her waving her finger at him.</span> <span id="s518">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Yes, waving her finger.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Margrits(ph), get out of Europe, get out of Holland.</span> <span id="s521">If you think this was a bad experience, this was kinderspiel compared to what’s going to come.</span> <span id="s522">Get out.</span> <span id="s523">And she literally forced him out of Holland.</span> <span id="s524">And this lady that you just saw, her parents left in 1949, and they also went, so he had a pla – he went to Los Angeles.</span> <span id="s525">When my cousin left, I was 10 years old.</span> <span id="s526">As long as he was around, I felt I had a little moral support, a little something.</span> <span id="s527">So, after he left, I really felt all alone.</span> <span id="s528">Now, my mother had remarried after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Excuse me, let me back up just a little bit.</span> <span id="s530">How old were you when you switched your families?</span> <span id="s531">When you went – left your first – first –</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Oh, about three and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: So it was very soo – actually very soon after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yeah, probably it was about five, six months after that my mother took me full time.</span> <span id="s537">Before she took me – you know, you – she was smart enough to realize you can’t just take me away full time.</span> <span id="s538">But – but it’s a – a pr – yeah, probably about four</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Was that through –</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: So – so – so nevertheless, you knew – at four or five and six, you started having other memories, of not living with the family –</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: – but living with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Sure, sure, sure.</span> <span id="s545">Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: And can you tell me a little bit about those, some of those early memories that come like episodes in a child’s mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: We lived, as I said before, in the house that my grandfather had owned.</span> <span id="s548">And my mother found somebody she knew from the past, it was a third cousin or something, in The Hague, an elderly lady, she would come to visit.</span> <span id="s549">I admire my mother, she did try to establish a life for herself.</span> <span id="s550">I remember going with her, being in the house, going out with her.</span> <span id="s551">My – then in ’46, my cousin came back, he came to visit.</span> <span id="s552">They tried to live things normal.</span> <span id="s553">She tried to get some of her – the houses back, it was very complicate –</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Did she get them?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Some of them, but that’s a whole different story.</span> <span id="s556">Things were kind of – I – there was no nursery school, my first school experience was five years old.</span> <span id="s557">My mother was smart enough – there was one Jewish school only in Holland, and my mother, thank God, was smart enough to send me to that, and I say smart enough, because all of us children had gone through the war, be it in concentration camp, hiding, so we became like a family.</span> <span id="s558">I had very close friends [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s559">I remember my fort – first Simkhes Torah in – when she took me –</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: You must tell me what these are.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Oh, Simkhes Torah is – is – is a holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: And after Rosh Hashanah, the last holiday, we have a month long of holidays, and the last holiday is Simkhes Torah, and there was – one of the ceremonies at Simkhes Torah in the synagogue is that you take all the children on the retalli(ph) and you bless the children.</span> <span id="s564">And one of my first memories as I went to shul with my mother, to the synagogue and they called up the children to bless the children, and I remember all the adults around, everybody was crying, the tear – crying, and I couldn’t figure out what they’re crying.</span> <span id="s565">Of course, now I know why.</span> <span id="s566">This was the remnant, these were the children that had survived the war, here they were.</span> <span id="s567">And every time I see them do that in synagogue on Simkhes Torah, I think back of that first time.</span> <span id="s568">You ne – you – certain things just stay with you.</span> <span id="s569">You never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: This may sou – sound like a strange question, but it’s born out of that experience that you described.</span> <span id="s571">You were with these foster parents, whom you loved, with whom you felt secure, who were Christian, who took you to church.</span> <span id="s572">When did you start feeling Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: When my mother took me in, she took me to synagogue.</span> <span id="s574">I don’t know if the word Jewish meant something, or Protestant, but it was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did you feel at home there in that synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Yeah, it was my mother.</span> <span id="s577">It didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s578">As a matter of fact, I often think about if my mother wouldn’t have come back, and I would have stayed with them, if they wouldn’t have told me I would have been a Jewish child, whatever, figured it out.</span> <span id="s579">I think I would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: I guess I looked different than them.</span> <span id="s582">I-I look – I have very Semitic looks, and I think I would have figured it out.</span> <span id="s583">I think there’s a certain – I think there’s a certain warmth to synagogue, and a certain coldness to church.</span> <span id="s584">I think I would have figured it out.</span> <span id="s585">But I wonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: I was – I was after something like that, because at some point a person starts identifying themselves.</span> <span id="s587">They find –</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: I was – I was very comfortable in synagogue, I was very comfortable in a Jewish – not knowing the difference between Christian and Jewish.</span> <span id="s589">You don’t know, when you’re that young a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I was very comfortable with it, and we went to school, our first school experience was when we were five years old, kindergarten, and it was very Jewish and I was very comfortable in it.</span> <span id="s592">That I never wanted to go back for, I never said I want to go to church.</span> <span id="s593">It’s interesting that you bring that up, because I never, ever said I would like to go to church.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: Well, see, what I’m trying to do –</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: I would love – I always loved seeing my foster parents, that I always was happy to go, but I never once in my life uttered the phrase, I’d like to go to church again.</span> <span id="s596">Isn’t that interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Well, one of the reasons where it becomes a question to me is because you – you drew a picture of – of warm foster parents and a – and a relationship with your mother that was fraught with certain tensions and anxieties –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: – that wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: So – so that, if you go from a place that was warm, to a place that has problems, and yet today you are someone who is very Jewish –</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: – and you – okay, something else must have brought you there.</span> <span id="s604">That’s what I’m trying to –</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Well, first of all, my mother came from a very religious background.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: And she continued that, contrary to some other people that came through the war and threw everything away.</span> <span id="s608">Now, again, my mother was hidden, she was spared the tragedy of the camps.</span> <span id="s609">People – although things weren’t easy, but people were civil to her and decent to her.</span> <span id="s610">And people that went through the camps saw, of course, such cruelty that thank God, my mother was spared from.</span> <span id="s611">And, like my cousin, who believes in nothing any more, says, where was God when we needed him?</span> <span id="s612">And I la – and my cousin questioned my mother, Tante, why are you still religious?</span> <span id="s613">And my mother answered him, so if I’m not, would life be better?</span> <span id="s614">At least she felt it was something to hold onto, because she was brought up in that home.</span> <span id="s615">And it gave her a s – it gave her life and it did me the same.</span> <span id="s616">I went, as I said, to the only Jewish school in Amsterdam, there’s only one Jewish elementary school to this day, it’s called Rosh Pina, and the high school is now called Maimonides, I went there.</span> <span id="s617">And I’m very grateful my mother didn’t send me to public school because I hear when I sit in our groups, kids that went – were sent to public school, they stood out, they were different.</span> <span id="s618">Even though th-the – the Christian children had als – you know, also had gone through a war, but a totally different experience.</span> <span id="s619">They were with their parents, they weren’t separated from their families.</span> <span id="s620">It was a whole different experience.</span> <span id="s621">And they felt strange, and they felt out of place, where even though we didn't talk about our experience, but we all went through the same.</span> <span id="s622">And on vacation time, when people said, what are you doing on vaca – oh, I’m going to my foster parents, I’m going to my foster parents.</span> <span id="s623">And we had very close bonds, and I’m very grateful for that, that was one of the best things my mother ever did, because I didn’t have a family.</span> <span id="s624">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: It became something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: It became – absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Another question.</span> <span id="s628">You know your story before you are conscious of it, that is you know of her story, you know of sh – so at some point she started talking to you, she started telling you.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: She did.</span> <span id="s630">She fa – she talks – very interesting, she talked a lot about her own family, very little about my father.</span> <span id="s631">And not too long, not too many years before she died, I said to her once, I said, you know, I’d like to know a little about my father’s family.</span> <span id="s632">You never talk about him, tell me something about my father.</span> <span id="s633">She said, he was a very good man, he worked very hard, at night he was tired and he went to sleep after he ate.</span> <span id="s634">But she was very instrumental in giving me a very vivid picture of her life with her parents, with her two brothers and sisters, what that was like.</span> <span id="s635">That she – she talked about a lot.</span> <span id="s636">That was important to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: It – it’s also, in a totally different context, but I remember as a journalist I once interviewed someone who was a victim of torture in South America and had ended up in Denmark in a rehabilitation center.</span> <span id="s638">And he didn't want to tell his children about what he had gone through.</span> <span id="s639">And through his work in this rehabilitation center, he found out that that was a mistake.</span> <span id="s640">That when he kept that from him – from them, they could not get as close to him as they wanted to be.</span> <span id="s641">And when he started talking to them about his life, his – you know, the difficult parts, but when he started really saying, this is what my life was made up of, it changed the dynamics.</span> <span id="s642">And – and so, it sounds that – that it was a cau – she – she was a complicated, amazing woman, your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: But ag – but again, she was hidden, and I find that the people that were hidden, talked about their experience much easier than the ones in the concentra – I – that – that hell was much harder to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: And I think that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: For understandable reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s648">My only cousin, who I saw a couple of years ago in Los Angeles, and I said to him, I said, you know, I know you don’t want to do the Spielberg thing, but I begged him to do the Spielberg thing, or what you are doing, and he wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s649">I said, for my own personal collection, would you – and for the tape recorder, would talk with him a little bit?</span> <span id="s650">Okay, so he sat down, he talked some basic fact.</span> <span id="s651">But when it came to anything real, he just got tears in eyes, he said, I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s652">After all these years.</span> <span id="s653">You mention the name of his siblings and he starts to cry.</span> <span id="s654">After all these years.</span> <span id="s655">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Oh, it’s horrible.</span> <span id="s657">Because it’s – it’s – it’s ir – an irrevocable loss.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: It’s an irrevocable, but again I – I credit my foster parents with making the – I have a lot of friends that are in therapy, and this and that, and I think the love that they were able to give me, in these very early month and years of my life, they very, very important foundation.</span> <span id="s659">I’m not in therapy.</span> <span id="s660">My kids would probably say you beli-long in therapy, but that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: But – Ma, you crazy, but that’s a different story.</span> <span id="s663">But I function better, I think, than a – than a lot of other, beca – because it’s different where you p-pa – when you schlep from home to home, as many of my friends have.</span> <span id="s664">They went from place to place, and so in the end wound up even in the camps, after being in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Oh yeah, a lot of the kids went in a hiding place –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: So they were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah, of course.</span> <span id="s669">Of course.</span> <span id="s670">So, with everything, I consider myself pretty lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: Tell me a little bit more about your life after the school, and when you –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Oh, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: – married, came to the United States and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s675">As I told you before, my mother was obsessed with getting out of Europe.</span> <span id="s676">The obsession never stopped.</span> <span id="s677">She told my cousin to go, and he listened, and as soon as the war was over and things started to normalize a little, my mother still wanted to get out of what – of Europe.</span> <span id="s678">What happened, she met a man in the late 40s, pr-probably ’48 - ’49, and they wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s679">They couldn’t get married right away because I’m sure you’re familiar with the fact that you needed death certificates, and the only ones to provide them were the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s680">So she needed a death certificate that her husband had died, and he needed the death certif – he was a man, a German Jew, he needed the death certificate that his wife had died.</span> <span id="s681">And it took a couple of years, so they finally got married in 1951.</span> <span id="s682">And so he was in Bergen-Belsen in the camps, and it didn’t do any good to his health.</span> <span id="s683">And eventually, he had a heart condition, after three years he died.</span> <span id="s684">So in 1954 he died.</span> <span id="s685">So my mother was –</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Do you have memories of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Very unpleasant memories.</span> <span id="s688">He was very resentful of me, because he had an 18 year old daughter that died, and my mother’s daughter lived.</span> <span id="s689">So he tolerated me.</span> <span id="s690">He wasn’t bad to me, but he wasn’t any good, and I was a little child when they married.</span> <span id="s691">So, you know, it would have been nice to have somebody that is nice to you –</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Is warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: – and warm and kind.</span> <span id="s694">He tolerated me.</span> <span id="s695">He wanted my mother, I was the child, he couldn’t very well say to my mother, get rid of the child.</span> <span id="s696">That she wouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s697">So I was tolerated, and I – I knew it.</span> <span id="s698">And it got to the point that I felt so unwanted that I was trying to think to myself, I want to get out of here.</span> <span id="s699">I don’t – if my mother wants to be with this man, that’s her story, but I want to get out.</span> <span id="s700">And I actually hatched a plot how to get out.</span> <span id="s701">I had heard about youth aliyah and kids going to Israel at that point, and I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s702">Maybe I can go to youth aliyah, and I heard about kibbutzim.</span> <span id="s703">I said, you know, my – let me see, maybe I could go on my own to a kibbutz and live there.</span> <span id="s704">I don’t want to be with this man any more.</span> <span id="s705">But that’s up to my mother what she want.</span> <span id="s706">And I hate to say it, but when he died, I wasn’t very unhappy.</span> <span id="s707">And, so then, after he died, my mother went again for her papers, and HIAS helped people with papers, and we went to – 1955 to America for three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: HIAS being the Hebrew –</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: Yeah, aid society, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: And we came, we got an affidavit through our friends.</span> <span id="s712">This lady that you just saw, her parents gave us the affidavit, and we went for three months to America.</span> <span id="s713">And in those days you had to go every two years to America, otherwise you lost your a – your – your papers.</span> <span id="s714">So, we traveled back and forth, my mother had still things to do in Holland.</span> <span id="s715">And when – and we lived for one year in Los Angeles, we went for one year to L.A. And then we went back, I finished my school.</span> <span id="s716">My mother wanted me to finish high school, so fine, I did.</span> <span id="s717">And then in ’62 I came permanently.</span> <span id="s718">And I met my husband, let’s see, in 19 – yeah, December ’65, and in February ’65 – ’66 we got married.</span> <span id="s719">And I have a daughter and a son, and they were born in ’71 and ’74.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: And your husband was an American, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Very interesting.</span> <span id="s722">I met my husband through mutual Dutch friends.</span> <span id="s723">As I said to you when you were talking before –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: – how come you stayed in, people didn’t get out, as I said, only people with money and connections got out.</span> <span id="s726">My in-laws lived in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s727">Both my families, my – my family on my side know that they go back hundreds of years in Holland, and my husband’s side also.</span> <span id="s728">We’re not Dutch, you know, for one generation that came from Poland, or what.</span> <span id="s729">We’re as Dutch, real Dutch Jews.</span> <span id="s730">My husband’s family, as I said, lived in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s731">My father-in-law was a physician, my mother-in-law for her day was extraordinary well educated.</span> <span id="s732">She – women in those days were educated when they finished elementary school, very well educated if they finished high school, and exceptional to go to the university.</span> <span id="s733">My mother-in-law went to the University of Leiden, my – to study law.</span> <span id="s734">My father-in-law went to study medicine, they met at the university, they got married.</span> <span id="s735">My f – mother-in-law actually practiced law in those days, in the 30s and all that.</span> <span id="s736">And my father-in-law had a practice in Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s737">And they had connections.</span> <span id="s738">My f – mother-in-law’s family was in the scrap metal business, and there was somebody that they knew that got a group together.</span> <span id="s739">And they said, if you can get 50,000 guilders, which is like a half a million today, or more, you can get out.</span> <span id="s740">And he had a group and all – every couple have to pay 50,000 guilders to get out.</span> <span id="s741">And my father and mother-in-law described a scene where they went to this Nazi’s place, and the money was piled up on tables to the ceiling, practically.</span> <span id="s742">And they did manage to escape.</span> <span id="s743">Their flights – Steven Spielberg could make a movie of the story how they got out, via Holland, Belgium, France, finally Spain.</span> <span id="s744">When they were in Spain, I think for a cou-couple of months, and then they finally wound up in Cuba and then to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: To the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: To the United States, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s747">My father-in-law had to get again his license to study medi – to practice medicine in America.</span> <span id="s748">After he had got that and then they moved to Queens.</span> <span id="s749">And there was a Dutch family and they heard, oh, there is a Dutch doctor in town, let’s go to him.</span> <span id="s750">And from being doctor patient relationship, developed a very wonderful friendship.</span> <span id="s751">I knew that family, they know me, they know my husband and they put us together.</span> <span id="s752">So even though we – my husband was raising his second – that ship that they went to, went to Havana, and then they came to America, so his second birthday was in Havana.</span> <span id="s753">And I married a Dutchman here in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Wow, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah, as he is fond of saying, she is from Amsterdam, I am from Rotterdam, and together we have a damn good time.</span> <span id="s756">[laughter].</span> <span id="s757">That’s – that’s his quote.</span> <span id="s758">But yes, I did marry a Dutchman, and we do speak Dutch at home and my children understand Dutch and speak it also.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: How interesting, how interesting.</span> <span id="s760">And you now live in Los Angeles [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: No, no, I don’t live in Los Angeles –</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, so sorry –</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: – [indecipherable] live in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: – you live in New York, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t live in – in Los Angeles, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Somehow or other, Los Angeles, maybe it’s because your cousin –</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Because my friend is from there, and my cousin went to Los Angeles, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: That’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: And my first, when we went to America the first time, we stayed in Los Angeles for – for three months, and we lived in Los Angeles for a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And tell me a little bit about how you maintained contact with your foster family.</span> <span id="s771">You know, how you forced your mother to do so, and how –</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Oh –</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: – and how you maintained that contact then?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, in those days, you know, there was no email, it was snail mail, so we wrote letters to each other.</span> <span id="s775">Later on – the telephone was a luxury in Holland, you know, in the early years, so they – they got the tele – yeah, telephone, we would have, you know, phone calls back and forth, but mostly letters.</span> <span id="s776">I mean, people were big in writing letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Did you go st – did you go stay with them then, let’s say [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: After I came in amer – to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: No, no, I meant when you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: When I was a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Yeah, my mother would – sometimes she would let me stay with them a little bit, an overnight or something.</span> <span id="s783">Not much, we usually would go for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: I-I don’t know if she was fearful of – that they wouldn’t give me back again, I don’t know what was it a ma – mostly we went, spent the day.</span> <span id="s786">And they came to me to spend the day, they came for a visit.</span> <span id="s787">It was mostly visits.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s789">And then when you became an adult, did your ties in somehow or other change?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Well, I was in America, so that was oh – you know, I came to here when I was 20 years old.</span> <span id="s791">And I always corresponded.</span> <span id="s792">When I came to Holland for a visit, of course, I went to see them.</span> <span id="s793">But I had them come to America.</span> <span id="s794">They came together twice as a couple, and then my – so, they had the pleasure of seeing my children and my husband.</span> <span id="s795">And of course it’s nice that my husband’s also Dutch, so they could communicate, because they didn’t speak a word of English.</span> <span id="s796">And after my foster pa – father died, she came once alone.</span> <span id="s797">And so my neighbors, my friends around where I live now, actually met my foster parents, which was very interesting for them.</span> <span id="s798">And my daughter remembers them.</span> <span id="s799">My son was too young, he doesn’t remember them, but my daughter remembers them, and like I said, it was really something for me to hear them sing.</span> <span id="s800">They brought du – books with Dutch songs, and they were sitting now singing to my children the songs they sung to me.</span> <span id="s801">I really came full cir – full circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Very warm – a very warm thought, a very warm kind of image.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s804">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add to what you’ve told, that you think is important for people to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Ah, yes, I think it’s very important to know that as much as I have a good life, and I’m very grateful for the life I have, it never leaves you.</span> <span id="s807">Like I said, I don’t know if I said it to you, when I go to weddings, or Bar Mitzvahs or places, and I see the people go into a family picture.</span> <span id="s808">And the picture, the le – wide angle lens isn’t wide enough, they fi – ho-how to fit everybody in.</span> <span id="s809">And, you don’t need a wide angle lens for my family.</span> <span id="s810">They si – except for my husband, my children and my one cousin, and he is ac – older already, he was born in 1924, there is no family.</span> <span id="s811">And no matter, you know, you miss that always.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: You always miss that.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: How long was your mother with you?</span> <span id="s815">A: A long time, thank God, she lived a long life.</span> <span id="s816">She died in 1998.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: She was almost 92 years old.</span> <span id="s819">So she saw my children into adulthood.</span> <span id="s820">I’m sorry she didn’t see my daughter get married, but she did have that – and she was – like it’s funny, like you say what else can you add?</span> <span id="s821">As I told you, I – her love for me was very conditional, but my – her love for my – my children was totally unc – she adored them.</span> <span id="s822">And I often say, you know, kids, you couldn’t do any wrong, and – I couldn’t do any good, but you couldn’t do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s823">And it was really, you know, I’m glad she lived to see my children, because she really, she adored them, and they – they knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: And it also is in a way trying to give you back what she couldn’t have given you directly, by loving your children, whom you –</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: – love, you know, it –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Also something funny, and I wonder if other people feel that way.</span> <span id="s828">When I was raising my own children, you just do what you do.</span> <span id="s829">You’re busy, yo-you – yo-you – you – you go, you change diapers, you make food, you shop, you dress, you bring them to school, whatever it is you do.</span> <span id="s830">And I did that.</span> <span id="s831">I never stopped to think of anything else.</span> <span id="s832">Now that I have a grandchild, it hits home even more in a way, because she comes and she goes.</span> <span id="s833">I look at this little child and I say, how could these bastards have hurt a little child like that?</span> <span id="s834">I look at this little girl, she’s now three years old.</span> <span id="s835">Some of these little children were left all alone in the world, looking for somebody to hold their hand, to take care of them.</span> <span id="s836">How could these bastards, and how can we ever ask to forgive this?</span> <span id="s837">Never.</span> <span id="s838">When my granddaughter turned four – my daughter knows my whole story, I – you know, I’ve never been not open about it.</span> <span id="s839">And when she turned four months old, I said to – her name is Yerwousha(ph), I said, Yerwousha(ph), would you imagine your having to give this little girl, somebody coming to your door and somebody taking this child from you?</span> <span id="s840">You never know if you will ever see her again.</span> <span id="s841">Then she broke out in tears.</span> <span id="s842">As much as she knows my story and m-my foster parents, now that she’s a mother herself, she understands really how it hits home.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: And what price was paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: And what price was paid.</span> <span id="s845">And like I said, it hit.</span> <span id="s846">And now I see this child, I say, how could they hurt a child?</span> <span id="s847">How can you do it?</span> <span id="s848">How can any human being do this?</span> <span id="s849">It – it hits me in a way even more now, because I take distance.</span> <span id="s850">It never leaves you.</span> <span id="s851">It never leaves you.</span> <span id="s852">As much as I function and I, you know, do everything I’m supposed to do, I-I think, it never leaves you.</span> <span id="s853">It will go with you to your grave.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: So hard to hear it, but it is true.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: It’s true, I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: I’m – you know, function an-and do everything and I don’t feel sorry – don’t think I ever feel sorry for myself.</span> <span id="s858">I consider myself the lucky ones.</span> <span id="s859">I also don’t have survivor guilt, like some people have survivor guilt.</span> <span id="s860">Why?</span> <span id="s861">The world would be better if I would be dead too?</span> <span id="s862">No, at least I’m survived and I have two children an-and grandchildren.</span> <span id="s863">I don’t have survivor guilt, maybe that’s bad of me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: No, no, I think you – I think it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: I don’t have that at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: A lot of people have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: No.</span> <span id="s869">Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: And my early – oh, one thing I want to say of my earliest recollect – you asked for my earliest recollection with my mother.</span> <span id="s871">I remember the first years, at least five years after the war, no matter what happened, at some point of the day, my mother would break out in tears and cry.</span> <span id="s872">And when you’re a little child, and there are two people in the house, you and her, well, if she’s crying, must be my fault.</span> <span id="s873">Now, I understand now, as an adult, of course how she cried, she always thought of – for her relatives.</span> <span id="s874">I mean, she missed them terribly.</span> <span id="s875">But that’s the environment we grew up in.</span> <span id="s876">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Take it or leave it, that was it.</span> <span id="s879">But I’m very lucky because I have a wonderful husband, a really sweet, nice guy and I have wonderful healthy children and a healthy grandchild, with another one on the way, so I’m really the lucky one.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: I understand what you’re saying.</span> <span id="s881">I – you know, it is – yeah, there are just some things can’t be filled in.</span> <span id="s882">They just can’t be.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Listen, there – there are lots of other tragedies.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s885">Well, thank you for sharing your story with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: You’re very welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: This concludes the United States Holocaust
