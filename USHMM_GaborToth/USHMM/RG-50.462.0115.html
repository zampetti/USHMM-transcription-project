one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">NL: This is Nora Levin interviewing Dr. Jacques Lipetz, July 21.</span> <span id="s3">So, Dr. Lipetz, would you be good enough to tell us a little bit about your family, your background, where you were born and grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">JL: I was born in Antwerp, Belgium, 1932.</span> <span id="s5">My father was born in Kaunas [Kovno], Lithuania.</span> <span id="s6">He had come to Belgium after World War II [He means World War I.] to study at the University in LiPge and then married my mother, who had been born in Belgium, or came to Belgium before age one year old.</span> <span id="s7">My mother's family came from somewhere in Russia and in her family there was a rabbi, Gabriel Halpern who was known as the Grand Rabbi of the town, the name of which I don't remember, who may've been the only rabbi, but he was the Grand Rabbi.</span> <span id="s8">My father's family came from Kovno, as I said, there have been scholars in the family.</span> <span id="s9">I don't know of any distinguished ones, particularly, and my father was in business in Belgium.</span> <span id="s10">He was in the business of selling animal hair, which he would import from China.</span> <span id="s11">And we, I grew up in a [pause; machine off then on.]</span> <span id="s12">I had two younger brothers.</span> <span id="s13">My father's business was in the house.</span> <span id="s14">We lived in a very large house in Antwerp, which is still standing to this day.</span> <span id="s15">And it's sort of interesting--a few years back my oldest son went to Antwerp by himself after college and he brought me back a picture of the house and the house had been converted into office buildings and, would you believe it, that the office is occupied by a psychologist?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NL: Which is what you are.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">JL: [chuckles] Which is what I am.</span> <span id="s18">Which is sort of ironic, I guess.</span> <span id="s19">I remember early childhood memories include hearing a lot of languages spoken around the house.</span> <span id="s20">There was obviously French, which was the language we used, and Flemish, which is the other language of Belgium.</span> <span id="s21">And there was a lot of Yiddish.</span> <span id="s22">There was some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s23">There was Russian, there was Polish, and there was English.</span> <span id="s24">My--the English came from my mother's side of the family.</span> <span id="s25">During World War I my maternal grandparents took the family to London, where my grandmother, who I've never met, died during the flu epidemic, and then they came back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s26">And my grandfather, who I also never met, and my maternal grandparents I never met, also died.</span> <span id="s27">My mother spoke fluent English with a very pronounced British accent and to her dying day referred to the faucet as a "tap".</span> <span id="s28">I think she stopped saying "lorry" at one point in favor of "truck," but she did have a number of Britishisms in her talk.</span> <span id="s29">As a young boy I was taken by my father twice to Lithuania, by train, to Kovno to meet my grandparents, my paternal grandparents, who were in the agricultural business.</span> <span id="s30">And I met a whole bunch of relatives.</span> <span id="s31">I don't remember much about Lithuania, but there's a story which my father tells which I don't remember happening, so it's [crying] very difficult.</span> <span id="s32">I was there at one time for the high holidays, and of course I didn't speak Lithuanian or Yiddish.</span> <span id="s33">I only spoke French.</span> <span id="s34">I was five years old at the time.</span> <span id="s35">And it was Yom Kippur and between services we were apparently walking in the streets and I, we passed by a bakery and I wanted a roll.</span> <span id="s36">And I was jabbering away in French to my father, saying, you know, I wanted this piece of bread.</span> <span id="s37">My grandparents were very frum [observant] and my father was very ashamed to say anything.</span> <span id="s38">And finally my grandfather said, "What does the little boy want?</span> <span id="s39">I don't understand what he's saying, but he wants something!"</span> <span id="s40">Father was very embarrassed at this point.</span> <span id="s41">He says he didn't know how to tell his father that his son wanted a piece of bread on Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s42">So, he finally told my grandfather that all I want is a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s43">He misunderstands it's Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s44">My grandfather said, "Well why don't you get it for him!"</span></p> <p><span id="s45">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s46">JL: So, I guess I was a brat even then.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">NL: No, you were just a hungry little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">JL: Uhhh...</span></p> <p><span id="s49">NL: How long did you stay in Lithuania?</span> <span id="s50">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">JL: I don't remember how long it was.</span> <span id="s52">It seemed interminable to me, but I'm sure it was a very short time.</span> <span id="s53">I remember, the only thing I remember is that I had a, I guess I must have been more than five, because I was reading.</span> <span id="s54">And I had a Babar the Elephant book in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">NL: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JL: Babar l'Elephant.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">JL: And I remember being in Berlin, and I remember we had to go from one railroad station to another in Berlin, and we had to cross a street.</span> <span id="s59">We had to walk for some reason, and there was a large parade.</span> <span id="s60">It turned out I may have seen Amalek1 himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NL: Mmm.</span> <span id="s62">This was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">JL: This was, this must have been 1937, '37 or '38.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">NL: Could have been some native fascists.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">JL: This, no this, no this was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: Oh, in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">JL: So, I believe that Adolf himself was passing by.</span> <span id="s68">And apparently I again made quite a fuss about crossing the street.</span> <span id="s69">And my father was kind of terrified.</span> <span id="s70">You know, here we were Jewish, making a fuss, and apparently the policeman just saw this little boy making a fuss and he stopped the parade and he waved us across just to get out of there.</span> <span id="s71">So, I guess my desires to have my own way go back quite a long way in that sense.</span> <span id="s72">I remember my grandfather had a long white beard.</span> <span id="s73">My grandmother was a sickly woman.</span> <span id="s74">I don't remember much else.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">NL: Was your grandfather affectionate toward you?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JL: I don't remember.</span> <span id="s77">I suspect he was.</span> <span id="s78">I remember being hugged and so forth.</span> <span id="s79">I was rather not liking it.</span> <span id="s80">I remember there being a lot of people.</span> <span id="s81">There was aunt, there were second cousins, and cousins and aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s82">I had an aunt Cilla, who was a dentist and I remember being absolutely fascinated by her office because, I'll remember this to my dying day I guess.</span> <span id="s83">She had a little alcohol lamp which was lit.</span> <span id="s84">And I thought this was the most marvelous thing I'd ever seen in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NL: [Laughs] Magical.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">JL: Magical.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s88">Were your folks observant, Dr. Lipetz?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">JL: Please call me Jacques.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">JL: Well, yes and no.</span> <span id="s92">Both my parents had come from observant families.</span> <span id="s93">As I remember, we did keep kosher at home.</span> <span id="s94">And when I was sent to school--I went to a private school called Tachkemoni in Antwerp--and I wasn't told about how this happened, but all I remember is, you know, that in the morning we, I just told you I was going to school and I was very excited and I went to the school and the teacher, you know, put us in our seats and so forth.</span> <span id="s95">I was I guess seven and a teacher said to us in French, "J'ai oublié tout mon français.</span> <span id="s96">Je parle seulement le hébreu maintenant."</span> <span id="s97">"I forgot all of my French and we are only going to speak Hebrew from now on."</span> <span id="s98">And we did.</span> <span id="s99">And by golly it worked.</span> <span id="s100">By the end of the first couple of months we were speaking to each other and I was able to converse with my father in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">NL: Amazing.</span> <span id="s102">May I hear again the name of this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">JL: Takhemoni.</span> <span id="s104">T-A-K-H-E-M-O-N-I [Tachkemoni].</span> <span id="s105">It's the name of a very famous medieval poem.</span> <span id="s106">I forget the author of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">JL: I've seen it listed in a number of...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">NL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s110">JL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s111">NL: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">JL: And, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s113">NL: Did you like the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">JL: I loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">NL: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">JL: I became an ardent Zionist within one week and wanted to take off right away.</span> <span id="s117">I asked my father why we couldn't go the way--we used to, my father and I used to go for walks occasionally along the docks in Antwerp.</span> <span id="s118">I remember asking "Why couldn't we just get one of those boats and go to Palestine?"</span></p> <p><span id="s119">NL: You sang Hebrew songs and stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JL: We sang Hebrew songs.</span> <span id="s121">We learned Chumash.2 And we learned to read and write Hebrew and in the afternoon we did the same thing in French.</span> <span id="s122">So I learned to read and write from left to right and right to left at the same time, and, it worked!</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NL: No confusion?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">JL: There was, yes there was [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s125">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JL: I can remember one summer trying to write a letter to a friend in French and trying to write the French from right to left.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s128">JL: It doesn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">NL: It doesn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">JL: It doesn't work.</span> <span id="s131">And I remember being very frustrated by this.</span> <span id="s132">But I had, my father had, I don't know what happened to this, most of this stuff is of course lost.</span> <span id="s133">I wrote letters.</span> <span id="s134">My father would go on business occasionally.</span> <span id="s135">Various parts of Belgium, France, and when I would write him letters, and you know, those days were before airplanes where people could come and go several hundred miles in one day.</span> <span id="s136">And I wrote him letters in Hebrew, without dots,3 and I've seen them since and for the life of me I have a hard time figuring them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">NL: Oh.</span> <span id="s138">Well but I guess if you spent more time and more intensively with the material you'd decipher it.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JL: I'm sure a lot would come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">JL: Although I'M amazed how much has come back over the last few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">NL: May I ask how long you were at this Tachkemoni school?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">JL: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">NL: Just two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">JL: Just two years, because then the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">NL: Was there any conflict between your associations with Jewish children?</span> <span id="s147">I suppose this was an all Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">JL: It was an all Jewish school.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NL: Any conflict in so far as your friendships with non-Jewish children, might have ever lacked this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">JL: I don't think I knew, I don't think I knew any non-Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: Ah hah.</span> <span id="s152">Did you live in an all-Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">JL: The neighborhood was not all Jewish by any means.</span> <span id="s156">I know the people next door were "the goyim".4</span></p> <p><span id="s157">NL: But you didn't have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">JL: I, non-, I had, no the only conflict I can remember, and it's only a conflict in retrospect, is my parents had a series of governesses for us kids and one of them was an ex-nun or had been or wanted to be a nun or something and was apparently trying to teach me all kinds of non-Jewish, mostly superstitious, superstitions.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">NL: Christian...</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JL: Christian superstitions.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">NL: Dogmas.</span> <span id="s162">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">JL: Dogmas, what have you.</span> <span id="s164">My parents found out about this, mainly because I got very scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">NL: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">JL: Something about devils taking me or something like that.</span> <span id="s167">My parents found out and they fired her immediately.</span> <span id="s168">That's all I can remember.</span> <span id="s169">I can remember going to synagogue and I don't remember which one.</span> <span id="s170">Joe has a book of synagogues.</span> <span id="s171">There were four in Antwerp and I don't recognize which one it was for sure.</span> <span id="s172">I remember going and what I remember in...</span></p> <p><span id="s173">NL: Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">JL: I think so, but I'm not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">NL: But you were what, seven?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">JL: Yeah, I remember, seven, eight, I remember wearing a tallit katan5 all the time.</span> <span id="s177">I was, I took it very seriously.</span> <span id="s178">And I can remember one of my parents' friends, Mr. Baygan, had gone to Palestine and come back on business of some sort.</span> <span id="s179">He brought us all back kippahs6 from Jerusalem which were hand embroidered and said "Yerushalayim"7 and I think that was one of the last things I lost in the course of our escape.</span> <span id="s180">I had that for years and years and years.</span> <span id="s181">It either got so worn out that it needed a decent burial or it fell apart.</span> <span id="s182">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">NL: You had said you were an ardent Zionist as a youngster.</span> <span id="s184">Did your parents share that fervor?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">JL: I think my father did.</span> <span id="s186">I'm not so sure about my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">NL: But they weren't thinking at all seriously about emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JL: To them, no, not that I know of.</span> <span id="s189">If they were, they didn't...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: Did they ever talk to you about any antisemitism that they had encountered in Antwerp, or, would you have been aware...</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NL: You were probably too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JL: I was not aware of any and I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">NL: They seemed happy in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">JL: They seemed happy.</span> <span id="s196">There was a very large Jewish community there, which had been established for some time.</span> <span id="s197">I think the Jewish community, well in Belgium dates back to I think the 13th century or earlier.</span> <span id="s198">But the modern Antwerp community dates back to the independence in Belgium, it was in 1831 or '32.8 And I was also a very ardent Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">NL: Loyal and supportive?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">JL: We, I used to occasionally get a, I remember one franc from my mother and I could buy a chocolate bar.</span> <span id="s201">The chocolate bar I liked best was Chocolat Jacques.</span> <span id="s202">I liked it because (a) was with chocolate but (b) it had my name on it...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">JL: It was very special.</span> <span id="s205">And in these, in this wrapper there was a picture, a picture with the royal family.</span> <span id="s206">And if you collected enough wrappers, enough pictures and wrappers, you could send in the wrappers and they would send you an album.</span> <span id="s207">And I had, I was working on my third album of photographs of the royal family.</span> <span id="s208">So I was, you know, a very loyal little Belgian boy and I watched parades where the king would come by and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">NL: From what I have learned of survivors and what I know about the history of Jews in Belgium, the experience was generally a very benign one, and Jews, as you say, liked their life there.</span> <span id="s210">Were you aware as a child of anything ominous happening before the invasion?</span> <span id="s211">Did your parents indicate any apprehension they may have had?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">JL: Yeah, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">NL: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">JL: There's one funny incident.</span> <span id="s215">It is not direct, it is related but indirectly there.</span> <span id="s216">Apparently just before the Russians invaded Poland, there had been some more talking about the bombing of Warsaw and so forth.9 I had some hunch that something terrible was happening in some very far away place.</span> <span id="s217">And apparently one morning, I would go down, downstairs in the morning and bring in a newspaper which was delivered.</span> <span id="s218">And I would then bring the newspaper up to my father.</span> <span id="s219">And I came in screaming one morning.</span> <span id="s220">I was not going to school and they weren't gonna get me out of the house.</span> <span id="s221">No matter.</span> <span id="s222">No way, I mean this was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">NL: Why didn't you want to go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">JL: Because the headline on the newspaper said, "L'ours est déchaîné."</span> <span id="s225">Which means, which translated is, "The USSR is unleashed."</span> <span id="s226">This is when Russia, but l'ours also means, it's spelled differently, "the bear."</span></p> <p><span id="s227">NL: The bear.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">JL: So I was convinced there was a loose bear in town...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">NL: Oh, oh...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">JL: ...and no way was I gonna tangle with this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">NL: How did your parents persuade you to...</span></p> <p><span id="s232">JL: They laughed.</span> <span id="s233">They finally showed me that l'URSS is, you know, l'Union de la Republiqne Soviétique Socialiste.</span> <span id="s234">I remember being absolutely terri-, I was not gonna go out and get mauled by a bear.</span> <span id="s235">I mean, no way was that gonna happen to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">NL: Was there any discussion in school as far as you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">JL: Not that I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">NL: Not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">JL: There was, no, there was a lot of discussion about aliyah10 about going to Tel Aviv and building the port and unloading the, I can remember not wanting to go to gym and my Hebrew teacher saying to me, "You know, if you are going to go to unload the boats at the dock, you'd better go to gym and be big and strong, because what we need there are people who are gonna be big and strong."</span> <span id="s240">So I went to gym.</span> <span id="s241">I haven't liked gym since either, but it worked on a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">NL: Were you aware of some Jews going to Palestine at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">JL: Only this man I mentioned before, Mr. Baygan on business.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">JL: I didn't know of anybody making aliyah.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NL: Or families going elsewhere...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">NL: To Italy possibly?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">NL: France?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">JL: See the community, the part of the community I was with was very cohesive and they all stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: They all stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">JL: The first sign I realized that there was something wrong was in 1940, when my father, my father had in previous summers, had every summer as far back as I can remember, rented a summer place where we would spend the summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">NL: In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">JL: In Belgium.</span> <span id="s258">And we usually went to the one or two or three places, Heiday [phonetic], and Knokke, and Zuka [phonetic], which was, Heiday was in the country, and Knokke and Zuka are on the sea shore.</span> <span id="s259">And this time he rented a villa in a place called La Panne [De Panne], which is on the Belgian side of the border of Dunkirk.</span> <span id="s260">And he also took us out of school--took me out of school--my brothers were too young--a month or two early.</span> <span id="s261">And, you know, I said, "Why can't I finish school?"</span> <span id="s262">I enjoyed school.</span> <span id="s263">I didn't, wanted to go more than ever.</span> <span id="s264">Cause you know at end of school year, exercises, and I was missing, I was really very angry.</span> <span id="s265">My father explained that he thought there might be a war and that the Belgians would hold out.</span> <span id="s266">In World War I the Belgians had held a salient in that area with King Albert, who was king of the Belgians at the time.</span> <span id="s267">And my father, I guess, really believed that somehow the Belgian army would hold back the Nazis and we would be safe.</span> <span id="s268">I can remember, you know, we lived in this villa and my father had bought 100 kilo bags of potatoes and things like, and we were gonna stay there...</span></p> <p><span id="s269">NL: The whole family would stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">NL: It's L-E-P-A-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">JL: No, L-A, capital P-A-N-N-E, which became sort of a joke, because en panne means, this is French slang for "broken down" Ma voiture est en panne, you know, "My car had a break-down."</span> <span id="s273">So there were all kinds of puns and...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">NL: This...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JL: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s276">That's, you know, I began to realize that there were something wrong.</span> <span id="s277">Things weren't quite right.</span> <span id="s278">Although we did go back to Antwerp for the, not commencement, but the exercises...</span></p> <p><span id="s279">NL: Closing

about that.</span> <span id="s282">I felt I'D been cheated.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">NL: How long did you stay in the city when you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">JL: Just for a day or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">NL: Ah, and then you went back to La Panne.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">JL: We went back to La Panne.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">NL: Were there many Jews as far

you occupy yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">JL: Well, you know, I was a little boy.</span> <span id="s293">We'd go to the beach and play on the beach and play on the sand and make mud pies, I guess, and things like that.</span> <span id="s294">And I read.</span> <span id="s295">I was always an avid reader.</span> <span id="s296">I would read anything and everything I could get my hands on.</span> <span id="s297">It didn't matter what it was.</span> <span id="s298">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s299">NL: You didn't have any trouble spending your time.</span></p> <p><span

weekend of May 10, 1940,11 I don't remember what day of the week it was, but we could find out.</span> <span id="s309">My mother went to Antwerp to spend a weekend with my father.</span> <span id="s310">Instead of him coming up, she went in and they would spend the weekend together.</span> <span id="s311">And that was the day that the war broke out.</span> <span id="s312">And I can remember this, being in the house and hearing all kinds of terrible noises and sirens...</span></p> <p><span id="s313">NL: You were still in La Panne?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">JL: I was in La Panne, with my brothers and governess, and hearing all kinds of terrible, scary noises, seeing flashes of light and the sirens and waking up and asking the governess, who was always known as "Mademoiselle," what was going on.</span> <span id="s315">And she made us, she knew what was going on, but she didn't want to frighten us.</span> <span id="s316">And she said that well, that, I knew that the French were at war with the Germans, that the, perhaps it was a French ship and it had been hit by shells or something and that the group making signals, whatever, some kind of cock and bull story, she said.</span> <span id="s317">And I sort of believed it, but I knew...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">NL: It was serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">JL: I could tell that, there's something which I've since labeled the smell of fear.</span> <span id="s320">You can feel it, and I could tell there was something very very wrong.</span> <span id="s321">It wasn't just...</span></p> <p><span id="s322">NL: Were you worried about your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">JL: I worried about, I don't remember but I can remember that, you know, my governess was, Mademoiselle was very good, and she was a very nice person as I remember her.</span> <span id="s324">She was a, we used to go for walks together and have long philosophical discussions about religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">NL: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">JL: Even though she was Catholic, but she was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">NL: She was [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s328">JL: She

<p><span id="s331">JL: There've been a number of them in my life.</span> <span id="s332">I know that when my parents finally got--you know it had normally been a two hour or a three hour trip took like a whole day to get out of Antwerp, you know, I can remember my mother hysterically holding us and then I found out that the war had been declared.</span> <span id="s333">Of course, I believed what my father said.</span> <span id="s334">I believed that, you know, the Belgian army, I had two cousins who were in the army, and I remember how brave and strong they looked.</span> <span id="s335">And they would come in for a weekend and I would help pull off their knee high boots.</span> <span id="s336">And I would polish their boots for them.</span> <span id="s337">This was really great.</span> <span id="s338">The Belgian army.</span> <span id="s339">The Belgians were going to hold out, and we'll show those Nazis a thing or two.</span> <span id="s340">Well, I guess we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">NL: When did your parents return to La Panne?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">JL: It must have been May 11th, That's the latest...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">NL: Ah, they came back very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">JL: They came back, it was that day, O.K.?</span> <span id="s345">May 10th, or maybe early morning on the 11th.</span> <span id="s346">They somehow made it back.</span> <span id="s347">O.K., from there on in, I think within a day or so, it became very clear to my father and to anybody else who cared to look that the Belgians were not going to hold out.</span> <span id="s348">The brave Belgian army was not going to hold back the Blitzkrieg and we were in for a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s349">And we elected to leave.</span> <span id="s350">And I remember packing up and getting on a train and we were going to go to France.</span> <span id="s351">And apparently, I was told later that night, my father's family was in the United States.</span> <span id="s352">His two older brothers were in the United States and he had a sister in the United Kingdom.</span> <span id="s353">So, it was all my mother's family.</span> <span id="s354">We were going to meet.</span> <span id="s355">There was a plan, a contingency plan had been made that we would meet somewhere in France.</span> <span id="s356">I forget where the place was supposed to be, where we would all try to get to in case of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">JL: And it's odd, because that, I did not learn that until I was an adult, because in 19, I guess it was '52, I guess it was '52, there was one of the perennial crises between the United States and the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s359">My father, I was at college at the time in Providence, and my father wrote me a letter saying that if anything happens, here is an address--he was in California--try and get there.</span> <span id="s360">This is what we are doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">NL: Mmm.</span> <span id="s362">Still conditioned to think about a retreat.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">JL: Right.</span> <span id="s364">As far [laughs] as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">JL: So I can remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">NL: Did you get to France then?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">JL: Yeah, we got to France by train, and I remember this was a horrendous train trip.</span> <span id="s369">There were stops and we were in this, the French trains have these compartments and in this compartment was a man who came in with a limp, and claimed he had a wooden leg.</span> <span id="s370">He'd been hurt in World War I or something.</span> <span id="s371">And my younger brother kept bumping into him.</span> <span id="s372">And he was, he got more upset over this little kid than, than he should have been.</span> <span id="s373">And I, I, think he was suspicious, to make a long story--as clear as I can remember--short, he was a German spy.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">NL: Ohhh.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">JL: He was caught, taken out, and shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">NL: On the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">JL: He wasn't shot on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">NL: I mean, taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">JL: He was taken off the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s380">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">JL: ...and they caught him.</span> <span id="s382">He apparently had a radio transmitter in his so-called wooden leg.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NL: In his wooden leg.</span> <span id="s384">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">JL: So, then I realized that this was not a child's game.</span> <span id="s386">Things were pretty serious.</span> <span id="s387">And, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NL: How long did your trip take, do you think, actually?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">JL: Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">NL: Days.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">JL: Days.</span> <span id="s392">I remember being in Lyon,12 which is still north of Paris, and I think we met in Paris.</span> <span id="s393">I seem to remember meeting relatives in Paris.</span> <span id="s394">I remember being in Paris.</span> <span id="s395">I also have very, very vivid memories of having diarrhea through the entire trip, which I'M sure was...</span></p> <p><span id="s396">NL: Nerves.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">JL: Anxiety, everybody being, feeling sick and food being around [laughs] [unclear].</span> <span id="s398">Somewhere we had bartered for some food in France, and We'd gotten some bread and butter.</span> <span id="s399">The French use salted butter, and at my home we'd only had unsalted butter.</span> <span id="s400">And when I tasted it I remember making a face or something and being told, "Be glad that you have something to eat."</span> <span id="s401">I don't remember much.</span> <span id="s402">I remember being in Paris.</span> <span id="s403">I remember we, seeing the Eiffel Tower.</span> <span id="s404">I remember being taken to a physician for some reason, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s405">The reason I remember that is because he was a real old fashioned physician.</span> <span id="s406">He didn't listen to my chest with his stethoscope, but he put his handkerchief over my chest and put his ear on the handkerchief, listening directly.</span> <span id="s407">[Phone ringing; pause] It was in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">NL: In Paris, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">JL: And then we had, somewhere around Paris we had teamed up with, let's see, with my uncle Jack and his wife Bertha and their two children, Rachel and Caroline.</span> <span id="s410">And then my Aunt Rosa and her husband David and his two children, Benny and my cousin Jack, who is about two years older.</span> <span id="s411">He was always known as the grande Jacques, either the large or the big Jacques, and I was the petit Jacques, and I sort of worshiped the ground he walked on and hated him at the same time.</span> <span id="s412">It was an interesting relationship.</span> <span id="s413">We teamed up, and they had cars, little Minervas, I think, which is Belgian made cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: They wanted to get out of Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">JL: They had gotten out, yeah, we did, we had met.</span> <span id="s416">This was, I think we met somewhere outside of Paris as I remember.</span> <span id="s417">I'M not clear on exactly where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">JL: We...</span></p> <p><span id="s420">NL: But they were already leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">JL: And there was also my Aunt Malvine, who was my mother's youngest sister, who was pregnant, and whose husband was in the Belgian army and we didn't know where he was.</span> <span id="s422">If he was alive or what.</span> <span id="s423">And there were maybe a few other people in that group.</span> <span id="s424">We went in this caravan of two or three cars through France and one place I remember we stayed at for a short while was a place called Saint Palais sur Mer.</span> <span id="s425">We had rented this very large, it was obviously on the sea, a very large villa and we stayed there for a while.</span> <span id="s426">And we were, we, when it looked like the French might hold out, when it became clear that the French would no longer, I remember the day that Belgium capitulated.</span> <span id="s427">That the week before, Life magazine had a cover story of, a cover photograph of the King of the Belgians, Leopold III, and his picture was proudly hung in the room we all, you know, the dining room we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">NL: How long did you stay there, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">JL: I don't remember how long.</span> <span id="s430">It couldn't have been very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">NL: Couldn't have been long.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">JL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s433">NL: The adults seemed apprehensive?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">JL: Yes, well, but when Belgium capitulated, I remember his picture was ripped off and torn apart and "Le sale cochon" [the dirty pig], you know, had given up, which turns out it was the only thing he really could do.</span> <span id="s435">And I also remember being in a small town in France and my two brothers were quite sick and we didn't know what was wrong.</span> <span id="s436">And so we looked for the doctor, and it turns out that the, this was after the capitulation of Belgium, the doctor, the physician in town, was also the mayor.</span> <span id="s437">And he found we were Belgians, we had two sick kids, and he said, "As mayor I cannot come to you traitorous Belgians.</span> <span id="s438">But after 5:00 I'm not the mayor any more."</span></p> <p><span id="s439">NL: He's the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">JL: He's the doctor.</span> <span id="s441">So he did come and, to add insult to injury, what do you suppose my brothers had?</span> <span id="s442">Nothing better than German measles.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">JL: Which was just a wonderful disease to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">NL: They were tots.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">JL: Yeah, they were, they were tots.</span> <span id="s447">Let's see, I was eight, I guess...</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s449">NL: Tape one, side two, continuing our interview with Dr. Lipetz.</span> <span id="s450">Leon was five.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">JL: Leon was five, and Eric must have been three-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s452">So we, we kept going.</span> <span id="s453">I remember going through towns whose names I just cannot remember am acquainted at this [unclear] like Bergerac and Ergerac [phonetic] and places like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">NL: You were still in two or three cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">JL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">NL: And all of the relatives were still intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">JL: So far.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">JL: Somewhere on that trip a decision was made that my cousin Benny, who is, Jacques' older brother, my Uncle David and Rosa's son, would, would try to leave, leave us and go to England, because they were afraid that he, he was I guess just seventeen or eighteen and the fear was that he would probably be forced into the army, one side or another, what have you, and I remember the tremendous...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NL: Trauma?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">JL: Trauma of his leaving, and the fear we would never see him again.</span> <span id="s462">And then I realized then that things were [weeping] very terribly wrong.</span> <span id="s463">That somehow the world I'd knew wasn't, just the one I liked.</span> <span id="s464">It's not what I'd been promised.</span> <span id="s465">Anyway, he left for Belgium13 amid much crying and wailing and when will we ever see him again.</span> <span id="s466">And I remember the other thing I remember [unclear] tremendous contagion of hysteria, because when I, his mother got hysterical, and of course everybody followed including kids.</span> <span id="s467">We didn't really know.</span> <span id="s468">I remember not knowing why we were crying, why we were upset completely, but you know, people went to England all the time.</span> <span id="s469">What was the big deal?</span> <span id="s470">Of course we feared that he might never get that far.</span> <span id="s471">He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">NL: He was planning to join the group...</span></p> <p><span id="s473">JL: No, he was planning on getting to London and seeing what would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">NL: But how, how would he...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">JL: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">NL: You don't know.</span> <span id="s477">There must've been some plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">JL: There must have been some plan or...</span></p> <p><span id="s479">NL: To get a boat somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">JL: And he did.</span> <span id="s481">He did make it.</span> <span id="s482">He spent the war years in England and then he came back to the States afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NL: And how many of the group were left then still in France?</span> <span id="s484">Still a large group.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">JL: It was still a large party.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">NL: And did the illness of your brothers hold the group up?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">JL: No.</span> <span id="s488">We kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">NL: You kept on going.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">JL: We kept on.</span> <span id="s491">There was no choice.</span> <span id="s492">The Germans were too close behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">NL: And you were going which direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">JL: We were going south toward Marseille.</span> <span id="s495">The plan, as I understand it, was to go to Marseille and we were hoping that my uncle Jack, who was in the Belgian army and his brother Emmanuel, or Marnie, who also was in the army, would come, and we would all meet somehow in Marseille.</span> <span id="s496">And every day, when we finally got to Marseille we went to this large villa where all the family stayed.</span> <span id="s497">And every day people went there, I remember to the CanadiPre, which was the, it's like the boardwalk I guess, in Marseille, and looking for news [unclear] people all over there talking and reading and trying to figure out.</span> <span id="s498">And it was in Marseille that I first, you know, got some first hand lessons about prejudice and, uh [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s499">NL: Antisemitism specifically?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">JL: Uh, well, I think there was some antisemitism.</span> <span id="s501">I think it would be more anti-Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">JL: I remember being called treniaf.</span> <span id="s504">[treniaf or trenief - Yiddish for not kosher] I went to school there because we speak French slightly differently in Belgium.</span> <span id="s505">We don't say soixant-dix for the number seventy.</span> <span id="s506">We say septante, and for the number ninety say nanante.</span> <span id="s507">In France it's soixante-dix, which is sixty and ten, and ninety becomes quatre-vingt dix.14 And I could never understand why they didn't, why they had seventy this crazy thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NL: And that kind of differentiated, marked...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">JL: That differentiated me from the other children and I al-, I remember the po-, I don't remember where there was specifically, well there were some anti-, I remember some, I seem to remember somebody saying saljuif, dirty Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">NL: Dirty Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">JL: I remember being made aware of the fact that I was a refugee and I was different and that things were very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">NL: How was the teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">JL: I don't

[unclear] somewhere in the flight we were, we had stopped the cars to get food or water or gas, I don't, we stopped in this small town for awhile and we were in this, I remember it as a parking lot.</span> <span id="s544">I don't know if there was a parking lot in those days, but whatever it was there were other cars there.</span> <span id="s545">And I remember there being a crust of bread on the ground and I was a little boy, I started playing soccer with it, football we called it.</span> <span id="s546">And my cousin Rachel started telling me not to do this because someday I would not have bread.</span> <span id="s547">And she was right.</span> <span id="s548">[weeping] To this day I can't waste bread.</span> <span id="s549">I find it very difficult to throw out bread, even if it's moldy.</span> <span id="s550">The other thing I can never forget is looking at other cars with my cousin and only seeing one car that was absolutely marvelous.</span> <span id="s551">And I asked what kind of car it was; it was an Oldsmobile.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">NL: So huge [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s553">JL: And it's odd that today I own an Oldsmobile.</span></p> <p><span

id="s562">JL: It was also American.</span> <span id="s563">Everything American was very well-made.</span> <span id="s564">So the idea was we were in Marseille, and the idea was we were going to apply for transit visas through Spain, to Portugal, and from Lisbon take a boat to the United States.</span> <span id="s565">And, I can remember, I don't know all the details other than that it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s566">And we had to apply here and we had to apply there, and there were these mysterious papers called affidavits which I had no idea what they were, but they were very, very, very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NL: You remember the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">JL: I remember the word.</span> <span id="s569">Because I thought it had something to do with my Uncle David, it's an affidavit!</span></p> <p><span id="s570">NL: Oh, [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s571">JL: It had something to do with him!</span> <span id="s572">But I wasn't clear what it was.</span> <span id="s573">I also thought that davening15 was named after him, because he was very religious.</span> <span id="s574">And I thought because David davened every day that it was named after him.</span> <span id="s575">I've learned differently since.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NL: [Chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s577">JL: Uh, may he rest in peace.</span> <span id="s578">Uh, and I can remember, you know, things being real tough, and we had this large, each family had a room and we had a, we used the kitchen communally and [unclear] and I remember at one point I could get, I don't know what had happened, but some particularly bad piece of news had come through and my uncles were throwing their arms up in the air and shrieking out "Was will sein mit uns."</span> <span id="s579">["What will be with us."]</span> <span id="s580">And this created...</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NL: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s582">And you knew what that meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">JL: Oh I understood Yiddish, because my parents didn't want us to, so obviously I picked it up very fast.</span> <span id="s584">And I remember absolute hysteria.</span> <span id="s585">Nobody could calm anybody else down.</span> <span id="s586">It was, the kids, all of us, it was one of the most horrifying things I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">NL: This was '42 I wonder?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">JL: This was already '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">NL: Could it have been, em...</span></p> <p><span id="s590">JL: Early '42.</span> <span id="s591">Late '41 or early '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">NL: Early '42.</span> <span id="s593">Cause...</span></p> <p><span id="s594">JL: No, wait a minute, no wait a minute...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">NL: If it was late...</span></p> <p><span id="s596">JL: '41, it was '41 still.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">NL: '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">JL: The war broke out in 1940 in Belgium and America didn't get into the war until December '42.16</span></p> <p><span id="s599">NL: It could have been the invasion of Russia.</span> <span id="s600">The Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s601">JL: I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s602">No, that came...</span></p> <p><span id="s603">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">JL: No, that could have been.</span> <span id="s605">I'm not, no, no that happened when we were in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s606">I don't know.</span> <span id="s607">I think it was just...</span></p> <p><span id="s608">NL: Some bad war news maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">JL: Absolute panic.</span> <span id="s610">I don't know what it was, but it was this horrible thing.</span> <span id="s611">Well, finally what happened was, it became clear that we should get to Lisbon, we could get passage because as I said, my, my father had two brothers in this country and my mother had a brother who was in this country.</span> <span id="s612">He'd married an American wife, and he, this was, going back, before the whole mess started I can remember my uncle Sam and aunt Dora--and they had two little girls--leaving Belgium and going back to the States because my aunt Dora was born in America and she was an American citizen and apparently American citizens were told to get out, so she, she...</span></p> <p><span id="s613">NL: She left.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">JL: She left, but I wonder, you know why they were going to the United States, and what was wrong with being here, and so forth.</span> <span id="s615">Well, they went to the States.</span> <span id="s616">So we had the proper affidavits, I guess, or whatever it took to get to the States.</span> <span id="s617">The problem was to get to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s618">Now at that time we were in so-called Vichy France.</span> <span id="s619">And, you know, apparently the French Pétain government had not become virulently antisemitic yet, so it seems as far as I know there were no problems.</span> <span id="s620">Obvious problems.</span> <span id="s621">The problem, the hangup came that my father would not be given a transit visa for Spain, because Franco's government had heard that no men under 40 years of age, above 17, between 17 and 40, could pass through Spain because they were afraid they would go to join the British in Gibraltar.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">NL: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">JL: Fat chance.</span> <span id="s624">My father, may he rest in peace, going Gibraltar was about as probable as sprouting wings, uh, but this was the official excuse.</span> <span id="s625">So, Mother and my two brothers and I took a train from Marseille and made very tearful goodbyes, wondering when we would ever see these people again.</span> <span id="s626">And we had enough food to last us for five days, and we thought that food would be very scarce, if available at all, in Spain.</span> <span id="s627">And we went through the crossing point at a place called Port-Bou.</span> <span id="s628">P-O-R-T dash, B-O-U-E [Port-Bou as per atlas].</span> <span id="s629">It literally means Port of Mud.</span> <span id="s630">And I can remember we went through Spanish customs.</span> <span id="s631">We were taken aside and we were interviewed by this woman for some reason.</span> <span id="s632">And there was a huge portrait of Franco on the wall.</span> <span id="s633">I looked at him, the little brat came out again, and I said, "C'est lui le rei des Espagnols?"</span> <span id="s634">--"Is he the king of Spain?"</span> <span id="s635">And the woman said to her, furious, she said, "You should teach your child we don't have a king here, we have a..</span> <span id="s636">."</span> <span id="s637">whatever.</span> <span id="s638">My mother was fit for me to be taken out and shot at this point.</span> <span id="s639">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NL: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s641">JL: You know, [unclear], how would I know?</span> <span id="s642">I mean, he was obviously, it was bad enough the French didn't have a king, but at least the Spanish could have one.</span> <span id="s643">We made it through Spain, mostly on, I guess you call it in this country, gingerbread, pain d'épice.</span> <span id="s644">And whatever we could get.</span> <span id="s645">We stayed in, we spent one night in Barcelona and one night in Madrid and I remember being shocked by the utter poverty and dirt of Spain.</span> <span id="s646">It was pathetic.</span> <span id="s647">Though we were treated nicely.</span> <span id="s648">It was pathetic.</span> <span id="s649">I could see even as a child the poverty and you know, they had just recovered from the civil war, which was over a year or two ago, burned out buildings and things like that.</span> <span id="s650">And it took, I think it took, I think it was probably shorter.</span> <span id="s651">I mean, I can't imagine taking five days to cross Spain by train, but see at least it seems like it was five years or something, going through Spain.</span> <span id="s652">It was, not knowing the language and you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s653">NL: And being separated...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">JL: My mother had never traveled with two kids alone and with three small children, not knowing whether We'd see anybody else again.</span> <span id="s655">And we got to the border to Portugal, and there was, of course, the fear, you know, that the Portuguese might change their minds or the Spaniards might change.</span> <span id="s656">We finally got to Lisboa, uh, Lisbon, and stayed at a pensione.</span> <span id="s657">My mother and my two brothers and I, we stayed at a boarding house waiting for my father to come and join us and we would then take the boat to America.</span> <span id="s658">And again, you know, we were, there was a large community of Belgians and other Europeans who had fled to Lisbon and every day there was a promenade along the port, along the Tagus River.</span> <span id="s659">I remember walking there and meeting other people and talking and asking, "Do you...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">NL: Mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s661">JL: Have, do you know anything, have you heard from so and so, and, you know, and people would carry their little carnets, their little books, with names and addresses and wondering and going to the post office every day because the only way you could get mail was through, what they call in Europe poste restante.</span> <span id="s662">There was a system in the city where you could write to somebody in care of such and such a post office.</span> <span id="s663">And then you come and ask, "Is there any mail for me, poste restante."</span> <span id="s664">And they just give to you; it was a great thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NL: Did mother hear from father that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">JL: Well, let me tell you.</span> <span id="s667">That's an interesting story.</span> <span id="s668">Finally my father decided the only way he was going to get through, there's no point petitioning the Spanish authority, was to go to Morocco and from Morocco go to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s669">And there apparently was a boat going from, through Tangiers, and from Tangiers to Lisbon.</span> <span id="s670">So somehow my father got boat passage from Marseille to Morocco, which was not terribly difficult.</span> <span id="s671">And he got to Morocco and he asked for a Portuguese visa which they gave him.</span> <span id="s672">And he tried to book on this boat.</span> <span id="s673">And he kept going, and the boat was postponed, the boat was postponed.</span> <span id="s674">Finally he went to the Portuguese consul and the Portuguese consul said, "Look Mr. Lipetz.</span> <span id="s675">I'm gonna have to tell you, that there is no such boat.</span> <span id="s676">And there never will be one again."</span></p> <p><span id="s677">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s678">Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">JL: Ah, and he didn't know what to do, and he explained his story and, my father, to his dying day believed this man might have been a marrano.17</span></p> <p><span id="s680">NL: He knew your father was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s681">JL: So he told my father, he says, "You know, I can't do anything for you, but you know, God forbid anything happen to your kids, very sick or something, I'd have to as an act of mercy give you a visa on an airplane."</span> <span id="s682">There is a plane that leaves.</span> <span id="s683">So my father understood what he meant, and he wrote to my mother, said, "Send a telegram saying "Kids are desperately sick.</span> <span id="s684">We need you."</span></p> <p><span id="s685">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">JL: My mother was a very superstitious woman.</span> <span id="s687">She wouldn't do it [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s688">NL: Oh my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">JL: She was afraid that...</span></p> <p><span id="s690">NL: It would happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">JL: If you say something like that, allevey, it should happen.</span> <span id="s692">And then she would, and to her dying day, whenever any of us got sick, fortunately nobody got seriously sick, she was always afraid it was just a curse coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">NL: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">JL: She was a simple woman that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">NL: So she wouldn't send such a letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">JL: Finally my father had the [unclear].</span> <span id="s697">He kept writing her stronger and stronger letters, finally I think he said, "Do it if you ever want to see me again."</span></p> <p><span id="s698">NL: Huuhhh!</span> <span id="s699">Dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">JL: So she said that was one of the hardest things she ever had to do in her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">NL: Imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">JL: So she sent the telegram, and sure enough, two days later, we got a telegram saying arriving on flight whatever it was on those days.</span> <span id="s703">I remember being very jealous because my father was flying in an airplane.</span> <span id="s704">That was a real neat thing.</span> <span id="s705">I was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">NL: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">JL: And, I remember he came, and I almost didn't recognize him because he'd grown a mustache.</span> <span id="s708">And asking about Morocco and so forth.</span> <span id="s709">We were in Lisbon for I guess a very short time, because in January '41 we embarked on the S.S. Siboney.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">NL: How do you spell it?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">JL: S-I-B-O-N-E-Y.</span> <span id="s712">Which was a tiny tub which used to travel between Florida and Cuba, and had been [unclear].</span> <span id="s713">At that time the Americans were sending anything they could over, or supposedly, I don't know.</span> <span id="s714">[unclear] and so forth I wonder what was going on, but anyway.</span> <span id="s715">We got on this leaky tub.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">NL: This was not for the Atlantic!</span></p> <p><span id="s717">JL: For the Atlantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">NL: Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">JL: We crossed the Atlantic in the worst January on record for that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">JL: We'd been reported sunk twice.</span> <span id="s722">I was seasick from the time we left the mouth of the Tagus River from the time we, we, we were to the time we were stopped in Bermuda by the British and searched by the British Navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">NL: How many people were on board?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">JL: On board I have no idea.</span> <span id="s725">All I know is I was sick.</span> <span id="s726">I was so sick.</span> <span id="s727">I thought I was, that was it.</span> <span id="s728">I just, why were they doing this to me?</span> <span id="s729">And my brothers were sick and my mother was sick and the one thing I remember, the one thing my mother could eat was [unclear] to get me, cream cheese...</span></p> <p><span id="s730">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s731">JL: But not just any cream cheese.</span> <span id="s732">It had to be Philadelphia cream cheese.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">NL: [laughs] Oh my word.</span> <span id="s734">That's really...</span></p> <p><span id="s735">JL: And that is when I first heard the name Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">NL: Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">JL: And here I am living here.</span> <span id="s738">Sort of interesting coincidence I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">NL: Do you have any idea how long this took?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">JL: I think the boat took us nine or eleven days.</span> <span id="s741">It took a long time.</span> <span id="s742">It was a small boat.</span> <span id="s743">It was not made for that kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s744">NL: No, not made for the Atlantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">JL: Not for a January crossing.</span> <span id="s746">And I remember we landed in New York.</span> <span id="s747">I remember seeing the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s748">And we landed in New York, I guess it was in early February, 1941.</span> <span id="s749">And we stayed with various uncles.</span> <span id="s750">And I thought we were, it became clear we were not going to stay there.</span> <span id="s751">We were not allowed to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">NL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s753">JL: Because our quota number had not come up.</span> <span id="s754">And my father, being a law abiding citizen, decided he would go to the Philippines where my uncle had a business.</span> <span id="s755">He had business there for many years.</span> <span id="s756">And we stayed in the States for one month and I remember meeting my American relatives for the first time.</span> <span id="s757">I met my uncle Elijah and aunt Ruth, may they rest in peace.</span> <span id="s758">And my cousin Esther, who unfortunately got killed in an auto accident some time later.</span> <span id="s759">And two cousins, Leo and Ramón who I thought was just marvelous.</span> <span id="s760">They went to the Bronx High School of Science.</span> <span id="s761">They were very bright.</span> <span id="s762">And we lived there in the Amalgamated Clothing Workers apartment complex in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s763">It's still standing there, on [unclear] Avenue.</span> <span id="s764">Though I think it's changed.</span> <span id="s765">It was ethnically very Jewish at that time.</span> <span id="s766">And it was a wonderful place, this was, and a wonderful America it was.</span> <span id="s767">And everybody in New York is Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s768">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s769">JL: We went for spatzeirs [strolls] in the park and my uncle would meet various people and talk Yiddish to them, or Russian.</span> <span id="s770">And I figured, well we must have met everybody in New York at this point that were Spaniards, all over and everybody spoke Yiddish, so everybody must've been Jewish.</span> <span id="s771">And it didn't occur to me that they might not be.</span> <span id="s772">Anyway, we left and we booked passage, I guess it was at the end of March, was end of March, or beginning April, on a Norwegian steamer, the Ivarant, I-V-A-R-A-N-T.</span> <span id="s773">My parents, my two brothers, and I, and we sailed from New York through the Panama Canal, which was very exciting.</span> <span id="s774">And then up to San Diego and Los Angeles where we met another Lipetz who came down from Vancouver to San Francisco, he was a [unclear] cousin Joe, my father's cousin, Joseph Lipetz, who was in the salmon fishing business in Vancouver, British Columbia.</span> <span id="s775">And then we set sail from San Francisco for the Philippines in a Norwegian flag ship, which was not a passenger ship.</span> <span id="s776">It was one of those steamers.</span> <span id="s777">It has, you know, few cabins.</span> <span id="s778">And there were a few other passengers, I don't remember them, across the Pacific, with dire warning that, you know, we were fair game for the Japanese or Germans, no not Japanese, German submarines.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">NL: German submarines.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">JL: And it was the one thing I remember.</span> <span id="s781">Anyway we had a Pacific crossing.</span> <span id="s782">I remember not being sick, and my father explaining, you know, that this was called the Pacific Ocean and Pacific means calm, and you're not gonna get sick, and don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s783">And he was right.</span> <span id="s784">Whether it really was a calm crossing or whether he convinced me in other ways, yet but I remember the trip as being relatively uneventful, except for the one time--the captain had a swimming pool constructed on deck.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">NL: Mmmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">JL: He just put some crates together and he...</span></p> <p><span id="s787">NL: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">JL: He put some tarps in front of the water.</span> <span id="s789">He said, "You're all gonna learn how to swim, because if we get torpedoed, you need to know how to swim."</span> <span id="s790">And I wasn't about to learn how.</span> <span id="s791">I was scared to death.</span> <span id="s792">So the captain was a big man.</span> <span id="s793">I don't know how big but he was a big man.</span> <span id="s794">And he grabbed me, put a life belt, a life jacket around me and threw me into the water, and said, "You're going to learn how to swim."</span> <span id="s795">And I guess he was right, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s796">NL: You must have been...</span></p> <p><span id="s797">JL: I was terrified.</span> <span id="s798">I was terri-, I hated it.</span> <span id="s799">I remember hitting him with my little fists and he was laughing at me.</span> <span id="s800">He thought it was very funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NL: [chuckling] Oh gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">JL: I don't remember his name, but he was a very nice man.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">NL: You learned to swim?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">JL: I learned to swim.</span> <span id="s805">I learned to stay afloat.</span> <span id="s806">To this day I cannot dive into water.</span> <span id="s807">If I go in I go in on my own power.</span> <span id="s808">So we landed in Manila.</span> <span id="s809">I guess it was May or June of '41, and my father, we found an apartment after a little while and we stayed there and I started going to school.</span> <span id="s810">Where, my brothers and I went to a school and my youngest brother Eric came back.</span> <span id="s811">He said he couldn't understand the song we sang in the morning.</span> <span id="s812">So we sang it and we were singing, "Good Morning to You.</span> <span id="s813">Good Morning to You.</span> <span id="s814">We greet you with bright Chinese faces."</span> <span id="s815">["shiny" faces]</span></p> <p><span id="s816">NL: [laughs] Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">JL: [laughs] I remember struggling with English, that it was, I realized it was an impossible language.</span> <span id="s818">There was no way I would ever learn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">NL: And not Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">JL: I still feel that way.</span> <span id="s821">It was English.</span> <span id="s822">It had been an American colony long enough that English was the major language.</span> <span id="s823">And then my aunt and uncle left, and my mother was furious that they left us.</span> <span id="s824">Here we were in this horrible place.</span> <span id="s825">It was very hot.</span> <span id="s826">My mother had a very hard time.</span> <span id="s827">The tropics are difficult to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">NL: These were the people who [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s829">JL: Not as bad as Philadelphia in the summer, really not as bad.</span> <span id="s830">These were people who owned the...</span></p> <p><span id="s831">NL: Who owned business there?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">JL: Business there.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">NL: Where did they go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">JL: Back in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">NL: Ah hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">JL: But my uncle went back and forth, you know, once a year, twice a year, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s837">He was one of the first people to take the China Clipper across.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">NL: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">JL: It's when it took four days to fly across the Pacific.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">NL: A real pioneer.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">JL: A real pioneer.</span> <span id="s842">And, so this was at May '41, and in December '41 the Japanese declared war and very shortly thereafter we were under Japanese occupation.</span> <span id="s843">Manila was declared an open city.</span> <span id="s844">And there was no fighting.</span> <span id="s845">One day the Japanese were there, and that was that.</span> <span id="s846">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">NL: How did your life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">JL: Well, first of all there were soldiers in the streets with guns.</span> <span id="s849">They were very nice to children, but they were kind of brutal, to each other as well as to other people.</span> <span id="s850">I mean, in the Japanese army non-commissioned officers have to be saluted by privates and so forth.</span> <span id="s851">[unclear] didn't salute somebody else properly, you'd get beaten up.</span> <span id="s852">And we were not put into, we were [unclear] internment camp for a short while.</span> <span id="s853">We were released because we were Belgian subjects and technically not at war with Japan.</span> <span id="s854">But I remember we were released before my father.</span> <span id="s855">My father had to be, they kept him longer for some reason.</span> <span id="s856">My mother went to visit him.</span> <span id="s857">And when we would pass by, the Japanese sentries in various places in [unclear] concentration and when we passed by a sentry there was a certain protocol as to how deep you had to bow and for how long you had to maintain your bow while passing.</span> <span id="s858">And my mother would not bow deep enough or long enough or something and when the Japanese [unclear] he just slapped her across the face.</span> <span id="s859">And there were incidents like this.</span> <span id="s860">By and large since it was the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s861">The Japanese were not unfriendly.</span> <span id="s862">I can even remember that the Japanese commander or assistant, he was a bigshot.</span> <span id="s863">The Colonel, the Colonel Koduki, was instrumental in helping us get out of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s864">And my parents invited him to lunch or tea or something he was really [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s865">NL: How long were you in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">JL: Not very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">NL: A few weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">JL: Few weeks.</span> <span id="s869">And uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s870">NL: You were with mother...</span></p> <p><span id="s871">JL: And father, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s872">NL: In the same...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">JL: Place.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">NL: In place.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">JL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s876">But I remember that, some of that is very vague...</span></p> <p><span id="s877">NL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s878">But you don't remember any particularly cruel treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">JL: No, no I don't.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">NL: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s881">And you...</span></p> <p><span id="s882">JL: I do remember cruel treatment later.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">NL: Later.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">JL: Not at this, at this point, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">NL: And when you were released, you went back to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s886">JL: To the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">NL: Apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">JL: And so that kind of brutality is, was you saw, but it was not a brutality aimed at anybody.</span> <span id="s889">It was just their way of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">NL: Their code.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">JL: Their code of ethics.</span> <span id="s892">I remember there in the apartment house next door they caught a young Filipino young man stealing and they [unclear] and they tied him up to a telephone pole, and in public view without a trial beat him to death.</span> <span id="s893">I readily saw a person, I saw a person beaten till he was dead.</span> <span id="s894">And that was, that was their [unclear].</span> <span id="s895">He was caught red handed.</span> <span id="s896">There was no need for a trial, and the punishment for stealing through military uh, was death.</span> <span id="s897">And they beat him to death.</span> <span id="s898">That's a pretty horrible thing [unclear].</span> <span id="s899">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s900">NL: Did father work?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">JL: Father had a business with animals there.</span> <span id="s902">Exactly what he did or how he did it was very mysterious.</span> <span id="s903">He never would talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">NL: But he would manage to earn a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">JL: He managed to earn a living.</span> <span id="s906">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s907">And he would never tell us.</span> <span id="s908">Even afterwards.</span> <span id="s909">My brothers would ask him.</span> <span id="s910">He was always very vague about this, how he did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">NL: Some things are private.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">JL: Some things are private.</span> <span id="s913">And after the Japanese took over, yeah, after the Japanese took over I think, I started, or maybe just before, yeah before they took over I discovered that there was, or that my parents discovered there was a synagogue in Manila.</span> <span id="s914">And we were enrolled in Hebrew school and Sunday school and all the good things there.</span> <span id="s915">And I was shocked to find out that (a) they didn't speak, they didn't do things in Hebrew there because [unclear] Hebrew because they were all German Jews.</span> <span id="s916">And they were Ashkenaz, and I had learned Sephardic.</span> <span id="s917">And I couldn't understand what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s918">They couldn't pronounce their b'rachas18 properly.</span> <span id="s919">And they also, for some reason they never learned how to write Hebrew in lower case.</span> <span id="s920">All they could do there was do everything in capital letters.</span> <span id="s921">[unclear] I remember being shocked by that because by that time I'd had two years of Hebrew and it was very intensive, half the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">NL: Still very fresh for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">JL: So it was still very fresh for me.</span> <span id="s924">[unclear] a rabbi and it was very, it was almost 80-90% German Jews.</span> <span id="s925">And they were more German than they were Jews.</span> <span id="s926">I mean they kept telling me how wonderful Germany was and I would go with my friends and they would all talk German.</span> <span id="s927">And the rabbi would give sermons in German.</span> <span id="s928">How that stuck in their craw I don't know.</span> <span id="s929">But he was very German.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s931">NL: Tape two, side one, continuing our interview with Dr. Lipetz.</span> <span id="s932">So, you were meeting German Jews at the synagogue in Manila.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">JL: At the synagogue in Manila, and becoming quite active.</span> <span id="s934">I remember we went on a Sunday School picnic.</span> <span id="s935">I remember going to Shabbas services on a Friday night.</span> <span id="s936">I remember that the cantor's name, because we got to know him very well, was Joseph Cysner, C-Y-S-N-E-R.</span> <span id="s937">I wonder what happened to him.</span> <span id="s938">He was a young man.</span> <span id="s939">And then when the war broke out [unclear] and life came to a relatively, relatively quickly to some kind of a normal or, not a, normal's not the right word, a..</span> <span id="s940">.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">NL: Equilibrium.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">JL: Equilibrium of some sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">JL: And I remember still, I remember still going to synagogue and I can remember a number of incidents--I'll tell you two--one of which was, somebody was being followed.</span> <span id="s945">One of the members of the synagogue was being followed by the Japanese secret police for some reason.</span> <span id="s946">I don't know if they had reason to or not.</span> <span id="s947">I imagine they thought there was.</span> <span id="s948">And we were in this Friday evening services and we were in the synagogue, which was a Moorish style building.</span> <span id="s949">It looked like somebody's idea of what a synagogue must have looked like in ancient Israel.</span> <span id="s950">It was yellow.</span> <span id="s951">And we were in the sanctuary and this Japanese man comes in, and obviously, you know, he stood out pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s952">And he was very nice about it.</span> <span id="s953">He walked in and he saw everybody else was wearing a yarmulka or kippah and he went over and got one...</span></p> <p><span id="s954">NL: He put one on!</span></p> <p><span id="s955">JL: And he put one on and he sat unobtrusively in the back and got up and he sat down as the rest of us did.</span> <span id="s956">And he [unclear], the story was he was following somebody.</span> <span id="s957">Whether it was that or whether it was curiosity, I don't know.</span> <span id="s958">A lot of the Japanese expressed, the more educated ones, a lot of interest in what was going on, and who we were and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">NL: Did you pick up some Japanese?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">JL: Yes.</span> <span id="s961">Well, let me tell you about that.</span> <span id="s962">We were enrolled in school and the only school we could be enrolled in for whatever reason was a private school, which was run by the Christian brothers, the same people who run LaSalle College here.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">NL: Ah hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">JL: And it was called LaSalle.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">JL: [unclear] and we, the Japanese authorities decreed that we had to learn Japanese.</span> <span id="s967">So [speaking Japanese].</span> <span id="s968">I learned to read and write some Japanese, not a whole lot, but enough to get by.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">NL: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">JL: And we also had to learn Tagala, because it was the, which is the native language for, one of the languages in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s971">There are something like six thousand languages.</span> <span id="s972">There's a lot of islands.</span> <span id="s973">The Philippine archipelago has more islands in it than any other archipelago in the world [unclear].</span> <span id="s974">Anyway Tagala I never mastered except a few words which I will not repeat.</span> <span id="s975">But Japanese I got some hang of which I've forgotten most of.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">NL: Who were the other children in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">JL: Mostly Filipino.</span> <span id="s978">As a matter of fact, one of the people I went to school with was the late President Aquino.19 Her husband was a classmate of mine, and a few of the other names that you see most I remember were in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">NL: Were there any other European children?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">JL: A few of the German Jews were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">NL: German Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">JL: And we were, this is where I first really encountered, firsthand anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s983">I remember being beaten up on more than one occasion.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">NL: On the part of native Filipinos?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">JL: Native, but these were educated.</span> <span id="s986">But these people came from wealthy families.</span> <span id="s987">I mean this was a private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">NL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s989">JL: Yeah.</span> <span id="s990">Being being beaten up for having done something which I couldn't quite understand but it something with crucifying somebody named Jesus.</span> <span id="s991">And I didn't know what crucifixion was, and I certainly didn't know who Jesus was.</span> <span id="s992">But I had done it, and I don't remember ever having done it.</span> <span id="s993">And you know, why didn't I convert, and what was wrong with me.</span> <span id="s994">And I remember a lot of, I would hate to go to school.</span> <span id="s995">I was beaten up regularly...</span></p> <p><span id="s996">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">JL: For some, we were forced to take Cate-, to learn to study Catechism, or to sit in the class.</span> <span id="s998">We didn't have to study.</span> <span id="s999">We didn't, the Jewish students didn't have to learn the Catechism, but we had to sit in the class and be exposed to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">NL: Didn't the Japanese intervene...</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">NL: ...and want you to learn their religious philosophy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">JL: Well, but I will, but we had to learn, no, as far as religion was concerned, the Japanese were very tolerant or not interested, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">NL: This was a tuition institution.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">JL: It was an expensive school too.</span> <span id="s1006">It was one of the better private schools in, well the Christian brothers run a, always did run a very good educational sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1007">And my fa-, my parents put a high price on education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">NL: Your brothers went to the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">JL: And, my bro-, my young-, Leon went, Eric was too young.</span> <span id="s1010">And then I also met several times a week, because he lived nearby, with the cantor, Joseph Cysner, where I would study Hebrew and Chumash with him.</span> <span id="s1011">And it was clear the Chumash and I'll never forget, we even did a little bit of Rashi,20 because I was getting bored with Chumash, and he said, "O.K. Let me show you what comes next."</span> <span id="s1012">And I can even tell you what in Rashi we studied.</span> <span id="s1013">I remember that that distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">NL: My word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">JL: It was the passage in Genesis, in B'reshit, where the brothers decided they're gonna get rid of Joseph and they throw him in the well.</span> <span id="s1016">And in the Chumash it says that the well was empty and there was nothing in the well.</span> <span id="s1017">And Rashi asked the question, "Why is it written that the well is empty and there is nothing in it?"</span> <span id="s1018">If it's empty, obviously there was nothing in it.</span> <span id="s1019">And Rashi said, "This is to indicate that not only was there no water which you might expect in a well, but there were no poisonous animals, spiders or whatever in there that would disturb Joseph."</span> <span id="s1020">And I remember being struck by this.</span> <span id="s1021">God, this is incredible stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">NL: This was God's providential hand, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">JL: Yes, but also I thought this was wonderful, that you could not just study Chumash, but you could study Chumash about Chumash, and you could go on and build, I think this was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s1024">I was really turned on to a lot of that.</span> <span id="s1025">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">NL: Oh, that's interesting.</span> <span id="s1027">You were how, what, eleven or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">JL: I was about eleven, eleven, twelve.</span> <span id="s1029">But you add-, you mention the word intervention, did the Japanese ever intervene, well, this is one of the stories I guess which, you know, out of every horrible moment in history there are some moments of humor, even though it's black humor but it's humor.</span> <span id="s1030">We lived on a street in Manila for a while.</span> <span id="s1031">It's a very nice street, Ateli Mavin [phonetic], and my brother, who, my youngest brother Eric who at that time must have been going on five, six, had a scooter.</span> <span id="s1032">And this scooter was constructed out of a roller skate and two boards.</span> <span id="s1033">And he loved to skate up and down the street on this scooter.</span> <span id="s1034">And this scooter was a very noisy contraption.</span> <span id="s1035">But further down the street was a German family, but a German German family, and they used to fly the swastika.</span> <span id="s1036">They were a very pro-Nazi, there were a lot of Nazis there too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">JL: It was a wide German German colony.</span> <span id="s1039">And one day, one afternoon they, Eric was riding his scooter and making noise, and the Germans were trying to take their siesta, so they came out, and they knocked my brother off his scooter and took the scooter away.</span> <span id="s1040">Now my brother was in tears.</span> <span id="s1041">And he's walking down the street crying his little heart out.</span> <span id="s1042">And the apartment house next to ours had become a Japanese military billet.</span> <span id="s1043">And the Japanese soldiers were asking what was wrong.</span> <span id="s1044">Why was he crying?</span> <span id="s1045">They were very kind to children, very kind.</span> <span id="s1046">They had a real love for children.</span> <span id="s1047">I'll tell you another story about that too.</span> <span id="s1048">Anyway he, Eric somehow in a mixture of English and French and God knows what, told the soldiers what was going on.</span> <span id="s1049">And the soldiers got really annoyed.</span> <span id="s1050">So, it happened that one of the soldiers was a non-commissioned officer who called out his troops, four or five men, with rifles and fixed bayonets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">JL: They marched...</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">NL: [laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">JL: ...to this person's house, knocked on the door, and essentially said, "You have this kid's scooter?"</span> <span id="s1055">And the Germans tried all kinds of, "I'm a Nazi..." and [unclear] .</span> <span id="s1056">"Give the kid his scooter!"</span> <span id="s1057">So they gave Eric the scooter...</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">JL: And wait, this gets better, and then they go out and they stand in the street there with their guns with fixed bayonets, and these are big guns, big bayonets, and when you're a little kid they're even bigger, and they said to Eric, "Ride up and down on the street!"</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">NL: [laughing] Oh that's a choice story.</span> <span id="s1061">There was one very happy little boy in Manila.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">JL: Yes.</span> <span id="s1063">And the name of the, the name we still remember, the name of the Japanese non-commissioned officer was Corporal Moona.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">NL: How would you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">JL: I would guess it would be M-O-O-N-A.</span> <span id="s1066">He was Eric's friend.</span> <span id="s1067">And there was never any trouble from that quarter again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">NL: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1069">This, excuse me, I must ask this, did the German Germans know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">JL: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1071">But they tried very hard apparently to instigate the Japanese against the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">JL: And the Japanese would have none of it.</span> <span id="s1074">They had no use for the Germans either.</span> <span id="s1075">The Japanese just didn't like white people.</span> <span id="s1076">They didn't care what your religion was.</span> <span id="s1077">It was skin color that mattered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">NL: We understand that in Shanghai too the Germans tried to get them to introduce the yellow star and beyond that to the gassings and they, nothing like that ever happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">JL: It was unknown.</span> <span id="s1080">I did not ever detect any kind of anti-Semitism from them.</span> <span id="s1081">I mean, anti-white, yes.</span> <span id="s1082">Anti-European, but not anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1083">And there were, you never even thought it.</span> <span id="s1084">That's, oh let me tell you another story.</span> <span id="s1085">Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur, and I don't remember which, but it was one of the high holidays, 1942, maybe '43, no it was '42, uh, [begins weeping] This is gonna be a hard one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">NL: Do you want to stop for a moment [?]</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">JL: [unclear].</span> <span id="s1088">It was during service.</span> <span id="s1089">I mean the place was packed, as synagogues often are on high holidays, and we were all facing the bimah,21 of course, and this was the point where the Torah was taken out of the ark, and the cantor holds the Torah in his arms and he turns to face the congregation.</span> <span id="s1090">At this point I was facing the back wall.</span> <span id="s1091">And he had a very good voice, and his voice began to crack and we wondered what was going on.</span> <span id="s1092">And we turned around to look.</span> <span id="s1093">The Japanese had brought the civilian Jewish internees from Sanatomas [phonetic] camp.</span> <span id="s1094">Under armed guard brought them to the synagogue for services.</span> <span id="s1095">Here were these people, gaunt, hungry, their clothes were degenerate--conditions were not great in the camps--they were not terrible yet, but they were not great--to join us for a service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">NL: This is a really quite remarkable phenomenon.</span> <span id="s1097">To have released the prisoners who, that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">JL: We are talking about a large, fairly large number of people, you know, 50 or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">NL: These were, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">JL: Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">NL: Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">JL: British, Dutch...</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">NL: Prisoners of war, Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">JL: Not prisoners of war, they were civilian internees.</span> <span id="s1105">Not soldiers.</span> <span id="s1106">They were civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">NL: And on what basis were they interned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">JL: All, all...</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">NL: At war...</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">JL: All nationals of countries at war with Japan were interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">NL: At war with Japan.</span> <span id="s1112">Were you able to, were your parents able to socialize with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">JL: I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">NL: You don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">JL: I don't remember anything other than that incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">NL: Were there any children among them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">JL: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s1118">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">NL: But they looked emaciated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">JL: They looked in very sad shape.</span> <span id="s1121">Although at that time things weren't that bad there yet.</span> <span id="s1122">You need to remember that the Japanese at first did not treat civilians internees any differently than they did their own soldiers.</span> <span id="s1123">But they didn't treat their own soldiers that well.</span> <span id="s1124">You know, their standards of care and compassion were very different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">NL: But their treatment of prisoners of war was pretty ghastly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">JL: It was pretty ghastly, but again it's ghastly to our eyes.</span> <span id="s1127">In their eyes they were not really that much worse than the way they treated their own prisoners.</span> <span id="s1128">Their standards were very different.</span> <span id="s1129">There was a whole ethical Weltanschaung22 was different, or was.</span> <span id="s1130">I suspect right now it's not, the Japanese have come a long way in the last 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">NL: So these internees were allowed to stay for the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">JL: They were allowed to stay for the services.</span> <span id="s1133">And I thought that was a..</span> <span id="s1134">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">JL: When you asked, "Were they like the Germans?"</span> <span id="s1137">And there was a, there was a very large, you know, one of our neighbors in the apartment house was a German, he was a real, German, he was not a Nazi he was a Baron somebody or other, the only member of nobility I ever had the grace to meet.</span> <span id="s1138">He was very anti-Nazi we found out later.</span> <span id="s1139">You know, he was heartbroken, he was that, he was from one of these old German families and he thought Hitler was some punk upstart and what was he doing with German kultur and so forth.</span> <span id="s1140">He was a wonderful man.</span> <span id="s1141">Count Gronke, Kurt Gronke, G-R-O-N-K-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">NL: Haven't thought about him for a while [chuckles].</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">JL: He was a single man.</span> <span id="s1144">He was an older man.</span> <span id="s1145">He had a Great Dane, who I loved to, I could ride on his back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">JL: And he had air conditioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">NL: Air conditioning!</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">JL: And on occasion I would be invited even to stand in the air conditioning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">NL: My word, what a treat!</span> <span id="s1151">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">JL: He was also a philatelist, he was a stamp collector, and he found out I was a stamp collector.</span> <span id="s1153">He bought me a membership in the Philippine Stamp Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">NL: Wow.</span> <span id="s1155">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">JL: He knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1157">There was no question about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">JL: It was always "Good evening, Herr Gronke."</span> <span id="s1160">It was "Herr Gronke," it wasn't "Baron."</span> <span id="s1161">I found out later he was a baron.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">NL: What was he doing in the Philippines, I wonder?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">JL: In business.</span> <span id="s1164">He was in some kind of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">NL: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">JL: There were a lot of Europeans trading and Manila was a good place to trade with China, with Japan, with all the countries that people would travel back and forth.</span> <span id="s1167">I guess his company was headquartered in the Philippines.</span> <span id="s1168">He might have been with a firm like, you know, Siemens or s-, I don't know who he was with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">JL: Herr Gronke.</span> <span id="s1171">So, you know, he was really, I was not aware of the horror of the Germans and the things they had done until after World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">NL: Till after the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">JL: Till after the war was over.</span> <span id="s1174">And only one thing...</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">NL: Sure, sure, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">JL: One of the things I remember what really got me going was the book that [unclear], Blessed is the Match.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">NL: Oh, Marie Syrkin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">JL: Yes.</span> <span id="s1179">It was one of the first Holocaust...</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">NL: One of the very early books of Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">JL: ...books I read.</span> <span id="s1182">I remember.</span> <span id="s1183">It was 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">NL: ...resistance.</span> <span id="s1185">Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">JL: And, well, we can get to that later, [unclear] was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s1187">But in the Philippines, there was no, other than the Filipino Catholics, who were very anti-Semitic, and partly because, you know, the teachings of the Church at that time was that Jews did this terrible thing and I, I didn't know what I had done, but it must be pretty horrible to get beaten up regularly.</span> <span id="s1188">Although I had Christian friends, I had Catholic friends and my parents had Catholic friends, who were, some of them were very, very nice, very kind and very helpful people, you know, who really helped us out.</span> <span id="s1189">But there was this strong anti-Semitic thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">NL: How long did you stay at the school, Jacques?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">JL: We stayed in that school until the bombings began, and I guess the bombings began in '44 or '45 and then when Manila was being bombed on a regular interval, it became dangerous to travel, because...</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">NL: So you were taken out of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">JL: Taken out of school and stayed home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">NL: Were there any other experiences that you had in '43 that you would want to tell us about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">JL: Well, there were a couple of, there were two amusing incidents with the English language, one of which was when the, before the war, I was signed up to go to a school, English speaking school, and I was given some kind of an I.Q. test or something.</span> <span id="s1196">I remember coming home and saying to my mother that I thought I did something terrible on the test.</span> <span id="s1197">And she said, "What's wrong?"</span> <span id="s1198">And I said, "Well, I don't know, English is a funny language."</span> <span id="s1199">Anyway, it turns out that there was a question, "Can a duck ride a horse?"</span> <span id="s1200">Well, I did not know what a d-u-c-k was.</span> <span id="s1201">I had no idea what this was.</span> <span id="s1202">So I looked up the word, and I said, this must be the English way of spelling d-u-c, which is "duke" in French.</span> <span id="s1203">And of course, that's what dukes do.</span> <span id="s1204">They get on their horses and they ride around.</span> <span id="s1205">So I said yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">NL: [chuckling]</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">JL: So probably somewhere there is a record of me as being an absolute imbecile, because I think ducks ride horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">JL: I remember that one.</span> <span id="s1210">The other one was, uh, in Manila right after the war started, right, Manila is on the bay, Manila Bay, and around the bay there is a very beautiful drive, which was then called Julie Boulevard.</span> <span id="s1211">I don't know what it's called now.</span> <span id="s1212">And there was a little café they built in it, they called the Aristocrat.</span> <span id="s1213">And they served, it was great, and they had a juke box.</span> <span id="s1214">And the juke box had songs like, eh, "Hotapola" on the something, something, something or other, I don't remember them.</span> <span id="s1215">It was Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Sheen, these other great songs of the day, "Mares Eat Oats" and things like that.</span> <span id="s1216">And the Japanese Navy, of course, in Manila this was a natural harbor.</span> <span id="s1217">I was there walking and the Japanese, maybe he was an admiral [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">NL: Lots of braid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">JL: Lots of gold and so forth.</span> <span id="s1220">He said to me in English, "Do you want some ice cream?"</span> <span id="s1221">And I said, "Sure."</span> <span id="s1222">So he bought ice cream and he was telling me about his children in Japan.</span> <span id="s1223">And he kept saying, "Would you like to pray with me?"</span> <span id="s1224">He really meant "play."</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">NL: Oh, he couldn't pronounce...</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">JL: I thought he wanted to daven!</span> <span id="s1227">So I did not understand that.</span> <span id="s1228">Anyway, that was, my experiences at the beginning were, but at the end, uh, there are lots of other stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">NL: Was your apartment damaged during the bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">JL: Well, the first apartment we were in we were asked to leave by the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1231">And we moved two or three times.</span> <span id="s1232">Each time the Japanese would requisition housing we moved further and further away from the center of the city, which was, divine providence, because as you know, Manila was destroyed except for one or two small areas, and we happened to be in one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">JL: And one neighbor...</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">NL: There were lots of casualties?</span> <span id="s1236">Civilian casualties?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">JL: Well, I'LL tell you that story too.</span> <span id="s1238">We realized that the war was coming to, was winding down or winding up or whatever, that the Japanese had lost.</span> <span id="s1239">And it got to be kind of hairy.</span> <span id="s1240">The bombings were going on every day.</span> <span id="s1241">And we lived with two other families, non-Jewish, no, one was Jewish and one was not, in this very large house, which had been built by the Spaniards, which had walls about a yard thick, to keep the house cool.</span> <span id="s1242">The idea is that with a very thick wall, the house remains cool and it really worked.</span> <span id="s1243">And the house was subdivided into three apartments.</span> <span id="s1244">And the house next door was requisitioned by the Japanese and there was billeted troops there.</span> <span id="s1245">And we were, this time we were getting scared because what would these troops do to us?</span> <span id="s1246">And I had one encounter with a drunken Japanese soldier who had his hands around my throat, but he was just drunk.</span> <span id="s1247">He was not, he was just drunk.</span> <span id="s1248">Fortunately I could mutter enough Japanese and his friends, you know, come on, you know, leave the kid alone, but it was kind of scary, you see, he was a big guy.</span> <span id="s1249">I didn't know what drunk meant, really, I had never seen anybody drunk before, and this guy smelled kind of funny, and his Japanese wasn't very good either.</span> <span id="s1250">[laughs] He was slurring it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">NL: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">JL: But, then, and things had gotten very bad.</span> <span id="s1253">The Japanese troops no longer had rifles.</span> <span id="s1254">They had wooden guns.</span> <span id="s1255">They were drilling with wooden guns and that was very bad.</span> <span id="s1256">One night the, we heard lots of movement next door and we were quite concerned.</span> <span id="s1257">Trucks pulled up and they took the soldiers away and they were never seen again.</span> <span id="s1258">And soon after that the city fell.</span> <span id="s1259">And I remember, you know, we were wondering what was happening.</span> <span id="s1260">And we got, we got, we could not, all the radios had been confiscated by the Japanese and then returned, but fixed so you could only listen to their stations.</span> <span id="s1261">And I remember one night, my father, we were listening to radio Manila, which was the voice of the Japanese controlled government, and they were just playing music.</span> <span id="s1262">And we knew that, that, you know, MacArthur had landed in Leyte, and [unclear] leaflets had been dropped and things like that.</span> <span id="s1263">And one, my father gets a phone call, and this man identifies himself and he says, "Our friends are here.</span> <span id="s1264">I cannot tell you any more."</span> <span id="s1265">And of course we knew what this meant, and the next thing we knew, the radio just went off the air.</span> <span id="s1266">And we couldn't, there was still electricity, there was still water, so of course we immediately filled up everything we could with water.</span> <span id="s1267">Because the first thing to go would be water.</span> <span id="s1268">And my father, providentially, when the war broke out, you know, [unclear] he could get his hands on.</span> <span id="s1269">We had canned goods.</span> <span id="s1270">And, bless the American canning industry.</span> <span id="s1271">We had canned goods that had been three years old at the end of the war, when we bought them, I don't know how long they were in cans before that, but they were still...</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">NL: Still...</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">JL: They were still good.</span> <span id="s1274">Carnation milk was one of the things I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">NL: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">JL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">NL: How long were you in that state?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">JL: Well, about three days, two or three days, and then one day I was looking down the road and I see some friends of ours coming, looking absolutely bedraggled, you know, dirty, and their clothes were ripped and they looked as if they'd been dragged through the woods.</span> <span id="s1279">They had escaped from the fighting in Manila, and our home became a hostel...</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">JL: For almost two weeks, where people, oh, half the Jewish community came through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">NL: Stragglers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">JL: Straggling through, who had escaped with their lives, and telling all kinds of horrible things.</span> <span id="s1284">But the end was horrible.</span> <span id="s1285">It was, the city was fought over brick by brick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">JL: Although there was one story that came out of there.</span> <span id="s1288">I don't know if the story is true or not, but it's a good story yet.</span> <span id="s1289">The Germans, the Nazi Germans, took refuge in the German embassy.</span> <span id="s1290">And when things got too hot there they decided to go across the street to another building which seemed safe and they took out this huge German swastika flag and tried to cross the street with it and the Japanese just mowed them down.</span> <span id="s1291">They had no use for any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">NL: Mmm.</span> <span id="s1293">Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">JL: And then in '45 we were finally liberated, and I remember seeing the first [weeping] the story is [pauses] what kind of thing [unclear].</span> <span id="s1295">The first American soldier with a mezuzah around his neck.</span> <span id="s1296">They had given all the Jewish soldiers little kits.</span> <span id="s1297">I still have the prayer book from that kit which was given by the Jewish war board or [unclear].</span> <span id="s1298">Included in it was a mezuzah which they wore around their neck.</span> <span id="s1299">And I remember seeing the first Jewish soldier.</span> <span id="s1300">And shortly thereafter, it must have been shortly thereafter, because this happened in March, I think, was Pesach.</span> <span id="s1301">And there were two Jewish chaplains, rabbis, attached to the, it was the first cavalry division I guess, or whoever else was there, one of whom I believe his name was Rabbi Gordon.</span> <span id="s1302">I don't know his first name.</span> <span id="s1303">I don't know if he is the famous Rabbi Gordon who one reads about, or somebody else, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1304">I would love to find out who the rabbis were.</span> <span id="s1305">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">NL: I guess the chaplain service...</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">JL: Could, probably could tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">NL: Could tell you, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">JL: And they came to our home, and they visited all the Jews, and they brought us things and so forth, and that, that Passover, they had a Seder, on the race track in Manila.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">NL: On the race track.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">JL: The race track.</span> <span id="s1312">It was the largest auditorium.</span> <span id="s1313">It wasn't covered, but it was, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">NL: Open, large.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">JL: Open, for the American army, and all the Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">JL: ...civilians that they could muster.</span> <span id="s1318">And they sent jeeps out for us.</span> <span id="s1319">And gave us matzoh, and [weeping] had a Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">NL: Oh, what a momentous experience that must have been.</span> <span id="s1321">True liberation.</span> <span id="s1322">Um, did you hear anything at all about the Jews who were in Shanghai?</span> <span id="s1323">I mean, you lived so, Japanese or [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">JL: A lot of the Jews who were in Manila, the Germans had come through Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">NL: Had come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">JL: And so they had come through Nagasaki, in Japan too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">NL: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">JL: And, the ones who, a lot of them had come to Manila thinking it'd be safer than being in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s1329">It turned out, I don't think it made much, a whole lot of difference.</span> <span id="s1330">There was no one, I have not heard any horror stories.</span> <span id="s1331">I had, as I said, I had not heard any horrible anti-Semitic, uh, holocaust, uh, mass destruction and things like that till we came back in this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">NL: Do you think your parents knew what was happening in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">JL: I suspect they did.</span> <span id="s1334">Well, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">NL: They may not have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">JL: They may not have.</span> <span id="s1337">I mean, I knew, they knew that terrible things were happening.</span> <span id="s1338">How terri-, I don't think anybody knew how terrible they were until, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">NL: After liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">JL: Well, they knew before then.</span> <span id="s1341">When, when, uh, there was a lot of intelligence out before that.</span> <span id="s1342">I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">NL: Some people of course knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">JL: Right, but the most, you wouldn't accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">NL: It was so unthinkable.</span> <span id="s1346">So how long, then, did your family stay in Manila after...</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">JL: We stayed in Manila for about three, four months after liberation.</span> <span id="s1348">We sailed from Manila just before VE day.</span> <span id="s1349">I celebrated VE day on board a ship between Leyte and Samar [phonetic], two islands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">NL: You were on your way to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">JL: On my way to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">NL: Now, did father by then have a visa number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">JL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">JL: We came to this country and then we, by then we were more a little more politically astute at that time, and we kept getting one extension after another.</span> <span id="s1356">And finally in 19-, see we got back here, let's see the war was over in '45, right?</span> <span id="s1357">We got back in '45.</span> <span id="s1358">It took five years before we were accepted with a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">NL: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">JL: Permanent visa.</span> <span id="s1361">We had to leave the country, go to Canada, stay overnight, and come back.</span> <span id="s1362">So we were being...</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">NL: Technical sillinesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">JL: Technical silliness.</span> <span id="s1365">And having to come back, and then in 19-, this was in 1948 or Ô49 that happened, because I became a citizen the same year I graduated college, it was 1954.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">NL: So you went to college here in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">JL: Here in the States.</span> <span id="s1368">And, in '54 I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">NL: And did your folks hear from any of your relatives in Europe during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">JL: Well, we came back...</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">NL: Telling you...</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">JL: Did you see the play on "A Shayna Maidel"?</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">JL: Well, in there there was a scene which is absolutely so accurate and so heart rending, I just fell apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">NL: You tell me about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">JL: Uh, where the old, the father, meets somebody who'd just come back and they both pull out little notebooks and say, "Shlebovitz and Shlimowitz and this one, and that one," and the answer's always, "Dead.</span> <span id="s1377">Dead.</span> <span id="s1378">Dead.</span> <span id="s1379">Murdered."</span> <span id="s1380">And I remember you know, when we came back.</span> <span id="s1381">We had no idea where my father's parents were.</span> <span id="s1382">We knew they had been alive when we left Belgium, but that was five years ago.</span> <span id="s1383">And that, I remember the newspapers publishing lists every day of people who had been found in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1384">My father would spend hours reading through them, looking for names, and we never found one.</span> <span id="s1385">I suspect my grandparents were murdered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">NL: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">JL: I'm sure they were, [unclear].</span> <span id="s1388">And, you know, we heard stories about people whose relatives, not relatives, but friends, distant relatives who stayed behind and who survived and who didn't, and some of the family went back to Belgium and some even came back, back, back and forth and so forth and so on.</span> <span id="s1389">And then I began to get an understanding about the absolute horror of what had happened.</span> <span id="s1390">Now I had seen the horror of war.</span> <span id="s1391">But it wasn't personal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">NL: You weren't hurt...</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">JL: I was not...</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">NL: Personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">JL: I wasn't, well, we were, we had, I suffered from malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies and all this other wonderful stuff, but, it was never personal.</span> <span id="s1396">This was war.</span> <span id="s1397">This was what happens in war.</span> <span id="s1398">It's a terrible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">NL: And your family was intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">JL: Right.</span> <span id="s1401">But the idea that, you know, yes I'd been beaten...</span></p> <p><span
