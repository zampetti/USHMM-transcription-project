id="s4">A: I was born on March 7, 1907, in Opeln, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: In Upper Silesia?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: In Upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: What kind of city was, or is, Opeln?</span> <span id="s8">Was it a large one?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Opeln was a county seat and a city of about 40,000 people.</span> <span id="s10">A small one where everybody knew everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: You spent your early life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I spent my early life there because my father was the owner of a store that had been in the hands of the family for 100 years.</span> <span id="s13">It went on from generation to generation.</span> <span id="s14">My brothers were already partners in the store, when they became of age.</span> <span id="s15">Then we left, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: What was the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: It was leather and several supplies which have anything to do with either horses or shoes, leather soles, no ready made shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Luggage?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: No.</span> <span id="s20">Strictly shoe makers and several supplies.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Is this the center of a farming region, or is it the center of a manufacturing region?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: It is a farming region actually.</span> <span id="s23">There was not too much industry.</span> <span id="s24">In the Eastern part of Upper Silesia, there was mainly coal.</span> <span id="s25">Coal, you know, coal, iron, steel was the big industry, but in Opeln and around Opeln, it was rather farming.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Did he sell the saddle goods, the saddle material?</span> <span id="s27">Did he sell that to farmers mainly, or to gentlemen horsemen?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No!</span> <span id="s29">No!</span> <span id="s30">Mostly to farmers!</span> <span id="s31">They came in with those big bags, and that is when they stole, of course, slipped it in the bag, you know; but the soles were cut to order.</span> <span id="s32">The farmers came in and they knew the firm so well that when the Jewish holidays came around, nobody came to town because they knew that the Jewish business would be closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: What was your maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My maiden name was Orgler.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: And what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Alfred.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: And you say that he had inherited the business from his father?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: The business was in the family for 100 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Established by your grandfather, or great-grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Right!</span> <span id="s41">They established it and every time it was built up a little more, and the store was remodeled.</span> <span id="s42">My father used to remodel and loved to do that.</span> <span id="s43">I was born in the house where the store was!</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: You lived upstairs, in back of the store, in an apartment above?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: In an apartment.</span> <span id="s46">That was the way it was done at the time.</span> <span id="s47">We didn’t have hospitals to go to at the time.</span> <span id="s48">They had me there, and the twins there, and then when my little brother was born, we had moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What was your mother’s maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Hedwig Apt.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: And was she a native of Opeln also?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: No, she came from Dresden, in Saxony.</span> <span id="s53">She lost her parents at a very young age.</span> <span id="s54">There were three sisters, and they were raised by an aunt and uncle in Breslau.</span> <span id="s55">(Today this city is called Wroclaw, Poland, located at 51.00N,17.00E).</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: And you had brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I had three brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Two older and one younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Younger.</span> <span id="s60">I was the oldest.</span> <span id="s61">And the twins were three years younger than I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: What was their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Heinz and Walter.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: And the other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: The other one was eleven years younger than I was, and his name was Helmut.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: You said they went into the business with your father when they came of age?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: You know, they were groomed, it was like it was passed, you know, from generation to generation, a family enterprise.</span> <span id="s68">They went to school and they went to learn the trade, and then, when they were through with that, they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Did you work in the store yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s71">Because I met Hans when I was seventeen years old.</span> <span id="s72">We knew then that we would eventually get married.</span> <span id="s73">So, I finished school and then I went to trade school, and I came back into the business as a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Were your parents educated, well educated or did they receive the public school education?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: No, my father went to gymnasium and my mother finished what they called “Tochterschule.”</span> <span id="s76">That meant ten years of education with two languages.</span> <span id="s77">That is the background which I also had.</span> <span id="s78">(Tochterschule literally means school for daughters.)</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: And this school which you later went to, the technical school, was it to train as a secretary, or as an accountant?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: As a secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: What we call a business school?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: A business school, typing, shorthand, bookkeeping.</span> <span id="s83">I used this later on, when Hans first started out.</span> <span id="s84">I could use it so my way was paid to be in this school.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Would you say that you were born into an extremely religious home, moderately religious home?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: A liberal home!</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: A liberal home?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s89">I mean we belonged to the Synagogue.</span> <span id="s90">The store was closed on the holidays and we had religious education.</span> <span id="s91">My brothers were Bar Mitzvad.</span> <span id="s92">I would say not a very Orthodox family, but a religious one, very conscious of being Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Did you observe Kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: No.</span> <span id="s95">But, I was confirmed also.</span> <span id="s96">I mean, even that many years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Was that common at that time for women, girls, to be confirmed?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: At age sixteen, there were eight of us who were confirmed.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Did you go to the Synagogue on the Shabbat regularly, or on the holidays only?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: More, or less, only on the holidays.</span> <span id="s101">However, we kept all the holidays, not only Yom Kippur and the New Year.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Was German the principal language that you spoke in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s104">Although we needed a little bit of Polish because, you know, a lot of those farmers that came in spoke Polish and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Did your parents speak any other languages, besides the Polish and the German?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: My father went to the Gymnasium and had Latin and Greek.</span> <span id="s107">My mother had French and English.</span> <span id="s108">At one time, we had a French governess to teach us piano and more languages; and then, of course, in 1921, when upper Silesia was occupied by the British and the French, we had the practical application of what we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: So that, by the time you reached maturity, you could speak some English?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: I could speak some English and some French.</span> <span id="s111">I had seven years of French and four years of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: As well as the Polish which was needed in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: The Polish, we only picked up the words when they came in and wanted certain things so that we would know what they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Would you say that the clientele in your store was primarily Jewish, or non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Non-Jewish!</span> <span id="s116">There weren’t that m any Jews in the whole city, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: What would you say would be the population in the 1910’s and 1920’s?</span> <span id="s118">What was the Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I couldn’t tell you.</span> <span id="s120">I am sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you travel quite a bit as a young girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s123">I was very lucky because, you know, what you would call my parents here, was upper middle class.</span> <span id="s124">My parents were the lucky ones who always did travel and many, many times they took me along.</span> <span id="s125">I had been to Italy and Paris.</span> <span id="s126">I had really traveled by the time I settled down.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: Considerably inside Germany also, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Yes, there were no distances, you know.</span> <span id="s129">I had an uncle, my father had a brother, who was a lawyer in Wuppertal (located 51.16N,7.11E), which is in the Rhineland.</span> <span id="s130">I was there for three months at one time, when my parents felt that I should really get out of the house and really see a little more of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did you ever go East toward Warsaw and into Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: No.</span> <span id="s133">At that time, we went into what is now Poland, such as Katowice (50.16N,19.00E) and so forth.</span> <span id="s134">but, travel to Poland, or Warsaw, wasn’t that important because no one really cared.</span> <span id="s135">You traveled to Vienna, to Budapest, to the Adriatic Sea, to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s136">That is what you did, you know.</span> <span id="s137">But, no one ever traveled to Russia and to Poland.</span> <span id="s138">That became modern later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you have relatives scattered throughout Germany, or were they concentrated in Upper Silesia and Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, we had relatives.</span> <span id="s141">I had an uncle in Bremen, and I had relatives in Dresden, and in Berlin, and in Breslau, that is about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: You thought of yourself as among the privileged class?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s144">I believe that I did.</span> <span id="s145">I was very aware of the fact that we were settled, you know, we were assimilated.</span> <span id="s146">We had that business for that many generations.</span> <span id="s147">I have a family tree which goes back to 1648.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: In the area of Upper Silesia?</span> <span id="s149">Or elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: In Upper Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s152">Dr. Liebermann has shown me that.</span> <span id="s153">Who traced that?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: My father did.</span> <span id="s155">When they took the store away from him, he made that his occupation, because he felt that the next generation, hopefully, would be away from all this, and it would be nice to have.</span> <span id="s156">He put many, many hours into it.</span> <span id="s157">He did it, together with a Rabbi from Breslau, who really studied and went to all the places, took pictures of the gravestones, and they really worked hard on this.</span> <span id="s158">I am very grateful that I have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Going back into the XVIII Century and the XVII Century, do you know whether your family was urban and commercial, or rural and agricultural?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: No.</span> <span id="s161">Commercial.</span> <span id="s162">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Does the name indicate that there were musicians somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: No, there was a Rabbi in Langendorf, but no artists, except Hans’ cousin, who was related to Max Liebermann.</span> <span id="s165">He probably told you about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did your parents have much association with Gentiles?</span> <span id="s167">Of a social nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, that was not common in Germany.</span> <span id="s169">You had your Jewish friends and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: You went to a mixed school though?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s172">Oh, yes!</span> <span id="s173">But, I mean, you know, that coming out of school, I had my Jewish girlfriends.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You went to their homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: And I went to their homes.</span> <span id="s176">It wasn’t encouraged that you would get into the non-Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: I take it then that you would say that the Synagogue was not the center of your social life.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: It wasn’t this way in Germany!</span> <span id="s179">The Synagogue was only there for the holy days, for Shabbata, and to pray.</span> <span id="s180">The social life was around the Jewish friends you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: A question I did not ask Dr. Liebermann, let me ask you this question.</span> <span id="s182">Was it uncommon in this period, before WWI and during the war, to find - was it uncommon to find devoutly religious, highly pious German Jews?</span> <span id="s183">Was that an exception?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: They were concentrated around Breslau, Berlin, Frankfurt a/Main, you know, where they really felt that they had the religious surroundings they needed.</span> <span id="s185">However, we had four families in Leibitz who were very religious, so we had no organ in the Synagogue, and the Jewish community supported a Kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s186">It was not unheard of that this be the case, he had to live and he could only live if the Jewish community would support him.</span> <span id="s187">So, we all bought Kosher meat, all these years, whether you lived Kosher, or not.</span> <span id="s188">You did without an organ in the Synagogue because these people didn’t want an organ and that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: That was in Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: In Leibitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Was Opeln the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: No, Opeln was a very liberal community.</span> <span id="s193">We did not have anybody who objected to the organ, or wanted a Kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s194">So we had none.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: What kind of associations were your parents members of?</span> <span id="s196">Business?</span> <span id="s197">Was there a Chamber of Commerce, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Made up of Jews and Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: I suppose together, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Was your father more or less a passive member, or was he active?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: He was active in the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: Do you recall his ever holding office in that kind of organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: No, that was usually run mainly by paid people.</span> <span id="s205">The city government was staffed with paid employees; and, now for example, Sundays, the stores were closed.</span> <span id="s206">Nobody would even think of opening.</span> <span id="s207">You opened at 8:00 a.m. and you closed at 6:00 p.m. No one would keep it open five minutes longer.</span> <span id="s208">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: What about cultural associations?</span> <span id="s210">Singing clubs or amateur dramatics?</span> <span id="s211">Did your family participate in such?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: No, no, but, we had an Opera Association, even in that small city, which we supported.</span> <span id="s213">There was theater, there were concerts, but, that was supported by the government.</span> <span id="s214">So, you see, there were no associations with volunteers like here because you didn’t support them with money.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Did you attend the Opera and the concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: We did!</span> <span id="s217">We were very shocked when we came to America and found out that in Dayton only a few upper class people even knew an Opera because they went to Cincinnati.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was music very important to you while growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Did you take it rather casually?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: No.</span> <span id="s222">It was very important.</span> <span id="s223">We were all trained.</span> <span id="s224">I was trained to play the piano, but, of course, without talent I gave that up very soon.</span> <span id="s225">But, Opera became very important, and concerts, and we were always taken everywhere, where anything like this could be had.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Was your father politically active and involved in politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Member of a party?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Did he vote?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s232">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Financially, did he support candidates of one party or another, do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: I can’t remember, but, I don’t think this played such a big role in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Would you be willing to say if, if we deal with the if, if your father had joined a party, say in the period 1900 to 1920, which would have been his preference?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: What you call here Democratic!</span> <span id="s237">Very Liberal!</span> <span id="s238">My father was a very liberal man.</span> <span id="s239">I remember that for years and years, we had a Swiss newspaper because Switzerland was a neutral country in Europe, and they had the news from all over.</span> <span id="s240">The Berner Bund was the bible in the house, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: How would you describe your childhood?</span> <span id="s242">As extremely happy?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Without cares?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: Yes, without cares!</span> <span id="s246">Very sheltered!</span> <span id="s247">I was very sheltered!</span> <span id="s248">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s249">I had access to all the good things in life, even travel, and I can only say that I had a very happy childhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Are there any really outstanding events that stick sharply in your mind?</span> <span id="s251">That you remember in some detail, happy or sad, puzzling or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Very even kind of childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I was born seven years before WWI, and the only shocking, really shocking experience that I can remember, my grandfather was manufacturing bricks in the country, about fifteen miles from Opeln , and he had a wagon and two horses.</span> <span id="s255">When the war broke out, the two horses had to go to war, and the two of them were killed.</span> <span id="s256">This is something that we children never forgot, you know, horses become very, very affectionate.</span> <span id="s257">Now, when I was a girl, about four years old, I had a pony.</span> <span id="s258">One Sunday afternoon, when the cars started to be on the highways, the pony got wild and scared, and we all ended in the ditch.</span> <span id="s259">That was the end of the carriage and the pony.</span> <span id="s260">You know, in this country you would probably say that I was a very spoiled brat, because I had all the good things a little girl could have.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: During WWI, what were your memories?</span> <span id="s262">You would have been seven when it started?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Why, I remember that my mother worked for the Red Cross and all the soldiers who came through the city got coffee or cigarettes, newspapers, you know, whatever have you.</span> <span id="s264">My father had a little heart ailment so he was put into an office, where he worked part-time or full-time.</span> <span id="s265">I remember, I remember very distinctly, that we had so little to eat during that time, so when we went to school, the Quakers would supply a roll and a piece of chocolate for a break, about 11:00 a.m.</span> <span id="s266">We went to school from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., so at 11:00 a.m., at the break, the Quakers would supply a piece of chocolate.</span> <span id="s267">That was a big treat!</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Food was hard to come by, even for those who had the means to purchase it?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: It was hard, it was kind of scarce.</span> <span id="s270">You know maybe they got a piece of extra liver because it was all rationed.</span> <span id="s271">So they got a little piece of extra liver, and they bought a little butter, or some eggs.</span> <span id="s272">You know, the peasants wear those great big shirts, so they always had something that they slipped in, eggs, butter, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Chocolate?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A; Chocolate, no!</span> <span id="s275">But food from the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: But, there was not such a shortage of food that you became undernourished, was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Yes, more or less.</span> <span id="s278">We all lived from turnips, cabbage, and marmalade which was made of any food possible, and with whatever we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Was there any fighting, any battles which took place in your region?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No!</span> <span id="s281">No!</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Were you aware of such events as this, or were you too young to realize what was happening?</span> <span id="s283">Brest Litovsk and the Bolchevik revolution in 1917?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I don’t really remember because at seven or eight it goes by you.</span> <span id="s285">You go to school and it kind of passes over you.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: You don’t remember your parents discussing it in the evenings?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: That, I don’t remember anymore.</span> <span id="s288">I will tell you that I remember very little because I have had such a terrible experience when we left Germany by losing everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I almost used self-hypnosis in order to survive, and I have forgotten a lot of things which I should remember; but, I could only survive and exist if I would make a real, clean break.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: To blot the past out.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: So, I remember probably much less than other people, even people my age, because I didn’t want to be reminded.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: If I ask you any questions you don’t want to respond to, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s295">But, I say, you may find out that I remember a lot less than Hans, for instance, you know, but, this was purposely done because in order to survive that traumatic shock, I had to look into the future and I have to live for the present.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: When you were growing up, and as you describe living this rather sheltered life, were you aware of Anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Very little, because I was very well liked in school.</span> <span id="s298">I had contact with all the non-Jewish kids and the Jewish kids, whatever.</span> <span id="s299">You know, we played together.</span> <span id="s300">There was really very little which came to us.</span> <span id="s301">Either we were so sheltered that my parents were successful in keeping it away from us; but, I think that we were so assimilated.</span> <span id="s302">I give you an example, when Hans and I got married.</span> <span id="s303">We got married on a Sunday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., in the Synagogue, and there wasn’t an empty seat.</span> <span id="s304">All these people, who were customers in the store, wanted to see me as a bride.</span> <span id="s305">This gives you an idea, you know.</span> <span id="s306">The fact that the store could be closed on holidays and my father would go to the Synagogue with a top hat, that didn’t make any difference, they all said hello!</span> <span id="s307">Everybody did!</span> <span id="s308">We were very lucky, we were very, very well liked!</span> <span id="s309">And unknowingly, we probably had a lot of friends in the non-Jewish community.</span> <span id="s310">And there were quite a few, of course, who stood up and helped later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Would you say mainly Catholics, or mainly Protestants, or both?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Both.</span> <span id="s313">My father had, for instance, an accountant for many, many years, and when he left Germany he took all the papers.</span> <span id="s314">He had to really leave in a hurry because in WWII, Opeln and Breslau were really in the war.</span> <span id="s315">He took all the important papers along and, many years later, when the war was over, we could claim some restitution because he had those papers, and he was not a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: When did you become aware of what was happening in Germany?</span> <span id="s317">For example, the inflation of the 1920’s and the start of the rise?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: The inflation, I remember that one of my girlfriends married at the age of seventeen, I think, and married a fellow in Santiago in Chile.</span> <span id="s319">When she came for the first time, for $1.00 she could get a pair of shoes, while we didn’t have shoes!</span> <span id="s320">You know, we had wooden soles and, if it wouldn’t have been for our business, we would probably have had torn soles.</span> <span id="s321">That made a great impact, you know.</span> <span id="s322">The inflation was so terrible that for $1.00 you could buy a whole pair of shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: How easy was it for your family business to recover after the inflation?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Well, they did somehow, you know.</span> <span id="s325">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s326">I didn’t really suffer all that much, evidently, not all as much as you could expect.</span> <span id="s327">The Mark was stabilized and the customers were there and things were going in what we thought was the right direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Do you remember being hungry during the inflation, not having enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Things being too expensive to buy?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Somehow, my m other managed.</span> <span id="s332">You know, my mother would bake.</span> <span id="s333">I would say the peasants would bring flour, eggs, sugar.</span> <span id="s334">We never really went hungry, but, many times, you know, we didn’t have the right food.</span> <span id="s335">I know that my mother made noodles and we had potatoes.</span> <span id="s336">Many times we only had potatoes for supper, but we were not hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You were mentioning the baking by your mother.</span> <span id="s338">I didn’t ask you, were you trained to do cooking?</span> <span id="s339">Were you trained in the domestic arts, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I wasn’t really trained, but, I picked it up because we had to do so much.</span> <span id="s341">We canned the cherries - we had a big garden right with the house.</span> <span id="s342">We would have any kind of food from Spring on - strawberries, gooseberries, currants, and there was not a bit of food thrown away, or left.</span> <span id="s343">Because, that we learned.</span> <span id="s344">Therefore, when we came over here, it was a terrible shock to go out in a restaurant and see what was thrown out.</span> <span id="s345">Because, although we always did eat, we always were conscious of the fact that there were people who don’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: Did your mother work in the store too?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: You must have had a cook?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Market days, the whole family was put to work, because I think that there was a lot of stealing going on.</span> <span id="s350">You know, when people don’t have things!</span> <span id="s351">So, if we were only supervising, you know, sitting at the cash register and seeing to it that people paid.</span> <span id="s352">We had a cook, yes, but my mother was always the head of the household.</span> <span id="s353">She would work with the cook, and as I said, there wasn’t a morsel of anything thrown away.</span> <span id="s354">We kids were trained that whatever we have on the plate, we better eat!</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: I wish that I could get that implanted into my children today!</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: They don’t believe you.</span> <span id="s357">Do you think mine do it?</span> <span id="s358">It hurts me to see that.</span> <span id="s359">There are so many hungry people in the world, and we are throwing so much away.</span> <span id="s360">You know, I still keep to this old rule.</span> <span id="s361">Why, what we don’t eat I just don’t cook because I don’t feel that we have a right to throw it away.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: You met Dr. Liebermann in 1924?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I met him in 1924.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: What was the occasion?</span> <span id="s365">How did that come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I was invited to a tea at his student fraternity in Breslau.</span> <span id="s367">There was a Sunday dance, that is where I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Were you invited by Dr. Liebermann?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: No.</span> <span id="s370">I was invited by a girl friend.</span> <span id="s371">The girls were invited to meet the fraternity.</span> <span id="s372">This is how I met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: What is the distance between Opeln and Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Like between Cincinnati and Dayton.</span> <span id="s375">That year I was ready to go to the business school.</span> <span id="s376">I stayed with the Aunt of my mother’s where my mother had been raised.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: In Breslau?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: They had an extra room for me.</span> <span id="s379">When I went to school in Breslau, this is where I stayed.</span> <span id="s380">It was very convenient.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Did you begin to date rather consistently and frequently?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Yes, very, very fast.</span> <span id="s383">We met in November and I had the first date the 16th of December, so it really was quickly.</span> <span id="s384">Then, the next fall, I came to school in Breslau and then, of course, we could see each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: And then you married four years later?</span> <span id="s386">Is that right, 1928?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: We got married in 1928.</span> <span id="s388">I had about two years of school and then he did not want to get married until he had his own practice.</span> <span id="s389">So, I went back and worked for my father until we got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: In the decision to move to Leibitz where he established his practice, did you have any role to play in that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s392">I didn’t know anybody Leibitz or anything else, but we both made up our minds.</span> <span id="s393">We wanted to be in the middle so that we can visit my parents and his parents and would still be on our own.</span> <span id="s394">We had a big desire to be on our own, probably due to the fact that I was so very sheltered.</span> <span id="s395">I felt that the time had come when I had to be on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Do you recall that being very traumatic?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Did you have to struggle?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Did you get homesick to see your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: No.</span> <span id="s402">I didn’t, because my parents were fortunate to have a car.</span> <span id="s403">So they came to see us.</span> <span id="s404">In 1930, we bought a car and then we could go to his parents and to my parents.</span> <span id="s405">We were very happy to be on our own, and still we weren’t that detached, you know, because we could talk and see them.</span> <span id="s406">Our son was born in 1929 and that was the grandparents pride and joy.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Franz!</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Franz?</span> <span id="s410">Yes.</span> <span id="s411">Dr. Liebermann had told me that.</span> <span id="s412">I had forgotten.</span> <span id="s413">Did you like Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Yes, we found it a very pleasant place.</span> <span id="s415">Leibitz, at that time, did not have a Jewish ear, nose and throat man.</span> <span id="s416">The practice really came up much, much better than we ever dreamed it could, and would.</span> <span id="s417">So, we were really very fortunate, but that doesn’t mean that my parents didn’t still spoil me.</span> <span id="s418">They took me on trips, and we had help.</span> <span id="s419">Of course, I don’t know if Hans has touched on that, you know, keeping house in Germany at that time was much more of a chore than it is here.</span> <span id="s420">You had just an icebox and no freezer.</span> <span id="s421">You went to get the butter in one place, the vegetables in another, and the meat in another.</span> <span id="s422">The candies and the coffee someplace else again.</span> <span id="s423">Keeping house really involved almost going shopping every morning for two hours before you had everything you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Did you have much association with the wives of the other doctors?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes, I did!</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Was there a medical association or organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Was there a Women’s Auxiliary or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: No, because there were not enough.</span> <span id="s430">But, there was what they called Vaterlandischerfrauenverein (that means Society of Women from the Fatherland).</span> <span id="s431">They had meetings.</span> <span id="s432">Later on, of course, Hadassah came.</span> <span id="s433">Hadassah, I don’t know if you know what that is?</span> <span id="s434">Hadassah got very active by getting children ready to go to Israel when things were getting... (Israel at reference means Palestine).</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: This was after 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: In the 30’s, already.</span> <span id="s437">What they call Hachsharah.</span> <span id="s438">The kids were put in a camp for six weeks and Hadassah would see to it that they had their things ready by the time they were shipped off (to Israel).</span> <span id="s439">You know, we had to put name tags and buy jeans and shirts, whatever they needed to work in Israel on a farm.</span> <span id="s440">That, of course, brought us together, the Jewish women of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: The time is up.</span> <span id="s442">Well, no, I believe that I have about five more minutes left on this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Well, that is all right, whatever you decide.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: No, I would like to ask you in some details about these activities.</span> <span id="s445">So, you are talking about 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: 1930, we started.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: In 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: In 1930, there were a lot of children sent to, I mean they were trained to work on farms in Israel.</span> <span id="s449">At that time, they were mostly, I would say, underprivileged children.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: But, this was for a vacation or a holiday?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s452">This was to be permanently there.</span> <span id="s453">But, people who really felt that there was not much of a future in Germany, Israel, at that time, was being built up.</span> <span id="s454">There was a need for youngsters to come in and help.</span> <span id="s455">Hadassah took over and got those kids whatever they needed.</span> <span id="s456">Whenever they needed it we shipped them off, with everything we had for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Was it the central organization of Hadassah which would choose which children would go and arrange the papers and so forth?</span> <span id="s458">What should I say, the branch of Hadassah in Leibitz?</span> <span id="s459">What were you doing as a member of this branch?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, we were just getting the children ready.</span> <span id="s461">The whole thing was done out of Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Were the children from Leibitz and the region around Leibitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: The ones we got ready, yes.</span> <span id="s464">But, at that time they started children’s transports from all over.</span> <span id="s465">The children were picked and they were trained on farms in Germany.</span> <span id="s466">I think that it took about six weeks for the children to be trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did parents put up, I don’t know how to phrase it, did parents cooperate in getting their children to Israel, even in 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, in 1930, only children went whose parents really wanted them to go.</span> <span id="s469">Those kids were about 14 years old.</span> <span id="s470">At age 14, school was finished and instead of letting them learn anything in Europe, they felt the kids would be better off to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Now what would your group do?</span> <span id="s472">Raise money or make contributions?</span> <span id="s473">Provide the cloth and...?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Right, our membership and parties, or whatever we had.</span> <span id="s475">We would collect money and it would be done.</span> <span id="s476">I mean, there were certain regulations of what they had to have and that was bought for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Would you say that this occupied a great deal of your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Well, you could spend as much or as little time as you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You, yourself, did you get heavily involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I did get involved because I thought that if those kids go they should really have everything that is required.</span> <span id="s481">As I said, we fitted them and we knitted for them, and we got them to get out.</span> <span id="s482">But, it was not the pressure under which we operated later.</span> <span id="s483">You know, this was more or less a voluntary affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: But, the Hadassah women, they were called Witzoh, at that time.</span> <span id="s486">Women’s International Zionist Organization.</span> <span id="s487">These were mostly children from old Zionists, you know whose dream had been to live in Israel, sent their children to Israel.</span> <span id="s488">That is what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Would you characterize yourself as a Zionist in this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: No!</span> <span id="s491">I did not because Israel, at that time, was the land for the needy who did not have it.</span> <span id="s492">Like every charity, you supported this project in order to give people who don’t have what you have, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Was there any other kind of activity you engaged in besides Hadassah as far as organized work?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: No, that is really the only thing I worked for.</span> <span id="s495">Because the medical women’s, you know, the physician’s wives, got together and we worked for more or less good purposes; but, it wasn’t done, you know, community work in Europe really started in 1933, because when it became so obvious that the pressure was put on, then we really had to get busy and organize ourselves, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Can you say that in the period between 1928 and 1933, when you were working in these activities, that any sort of foundation was being laid that could be built on later, after 1933, or when the pressures began to come.</span> <span id="s497">Did you more or less have to go into different kinds of activities using different people to be involved, different approaches, or was it some sort of continuation?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Around 1933, when things got really bad, unfortunately, people became selfish, because everybody was trying to find out, is there another way?</span> <span id="s499">Will you go a certain way?</span> <span id="s500">Will you stay?</span> <span id="s501">Activities, except for leaving the country probably stood still, almost.</span> <span id="s502">You just couldn’t imagine that things would get that bad that you would really have to leave everything and leave the country.</span> <span id="s503">You just didn’t want to believe it!</span> <span id="s504">Today, you know I was talking to Hans the other day, and he said, “You know, if the same thing would happen today, would we do the same thing?”</span> <span id="s505">I said, “Yes, we would do the same thing our parents have done, because I would never want to be dependent on my children.”</span> <span id="s506">My parents stayed there and said, “Get settled, and when you are settled and you want us, then call us and we will come.”</span> <span id="s507">As I get older you know, I can see that very well, I would not want to be dependent on my children without having a dime.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: As Hitler’s activities became more known in 1929, 1930, 1931, did you begin to become concerned or did your concern really develop after Hitler’s rise to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: The concern started in 1933, when there was the boycott and when it really became bad.</span> <span id="s510">But, then it wasn’t a question of going to Israel anymore, it was question, where can you go?</span> <span id="s511">This is why Hans came over here and I went to Israel and spent a month there.</span> <span id="s512">Because you knew you wanted to go, since for your family’s sake you couldn’t stay.</span> <span id="s513">But, at the same time you wanted to go someplace where you would be able to build up.</span> <span id="s514">Don’t forget that we were ten years older than when we first started.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: We had lived in Leibitz for ten years before we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: After Hitler came to power in late January 1933, and the really strong anti-Semitism began, and the laws began to be passed...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: You know, at that time, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s519">Hans probably told you that, too, that Upper Silesia was protected and didn’t have all the laws applied to it.</span> <span id="s520">That is why we stayed, unfortunately, five whole years longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Did you, I did not ask him this question, let me ask it of you.</span> <span id="s522">Do you think this had the impact upon the Jews living in Upper Silesia, of making them think that they weren’t in as much danger, that they had more time, that these pressures weren’t as intense, that you didn’t have to make these terrible decisions quite so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: It was hoped that in five years the whole thing would be blown over and by the time the five years are over, the whole thing would be over and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Did you watch the TV program on the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: That I couldn’t take.</span> <span id="s526">You know, some of it we went through, some of it we have seen in pictures, and so forth, but this I couldn’t watch.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: The first segment of the series there was the mother, the wife of the doctor, who was very German.</span> <span id="s528">The doctor was Polish, but practicing in Germany, and the German wife was apparently from an upper middle-class background, very cultural, a good pianist, apparently they were fairly wealthy.</span> <span id="s529">The husband wanted to think in terms of emigrating, but she kept saying to him, “No, this is some madness which is going to blow over.”</span> <span id="s530">Was that common?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A; That is what I was just telling you.</span> <span id="s532">And, those five extra years gave us the false hope, that in five years it can go away.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q But, could you say, from thinking back and thinking in the terms of women and their attitudes and concerns, as opposed to men and their attitudes and concerns, from your acquaintances and the talk you engaged in, that men were more prone to want to leave and that women were more prone to say, “It is going to blow over.”</span> <span id="s534">This may not be a fair question.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: At this point you left for the sake of your family!</span> <span id="s536">You know, unfortunately, I lost two babies due to the excitement and so forth, but you planned to raise your family in a better climate and in a happier climate because by that time it was obvious that it wouldn’t be over in five years.</span> <span id="s537">But the five years gave us the false hope that it could be over, because Hitler was always talking about the 1,000 years, you know.</span> <span id="s538">And, if it would not have been for the war, who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: I am going to stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: This is the second interview with Mrs. Liebermann and we are in the living room of her home on Tuesday, October 17, 1978.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Now, Mrs. Liebermann, when we were talking last week, we were roughly in the period of 1935 and 1936.</span> <span id="s542">What I would particularly like to get at, if at all possible, are the small things, the things which you might not think very important, but which I think are very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: I would like to know about shopping.</span> <span id="s545">I would like to know about putting a menu together, getting three meals on the table when you weren’t welcomed in some stores, for example.</span> <span id="s546">I would like to know what you did for entertainment, what you did at home, how you entertained your child when, perhaps, it wasn’t safe for him to get out on the street.</span> <span id="s547">Those little kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: You want to know?</span> <span id="s549">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: If you can give me your own perspective and a woman’s point-of-view of running a household in this time of trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Right!</span> <span id="s552">I will tell you that I made a few notes here.</span> <span id="s553">Our real troubles started in 1936, when, in February, Hans’ mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage and the store of his parents had to be closed.</span> <span id="s554">The household had to be dissolved, because my father-in-law could not live there by himself.</span> <span id="s555">He was living right above the store.</span> <span id="s556">So the first problem we had in 1936 was to find an apartment for him in Leibitz and move him, and let him live there.</span> <span id="s557">The second thing that came up, about a couple of months, later was that Jews were only permitted to have personnel 45 years or older.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: In Jewish stores or do you mean in the households?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: In the households.</span> <span id="s560">Housemaids, sleep in help or so, in order to “keep the race clean” you know.</span> <span id="s561">So, the housekeeper he had, moved with him to Leibitz, and this lasted just about six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: She was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No.</span> <span id="s564">It lasted about six months and it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s565">She quit then and I could not get another one.</span> <span id="s566">So, quickly, we decided that my father-in-law would move in with us.</span> <span id="s567">It was a big decision, but it turned out very well because he was a very unusual person.</span> <span id="s568">He would never be there when we had company, unless we would call him, and he was a big help for me in doing some shopping.</span> <span id="s569">I gave him little chores because we had to buy the meat in one place and the vegetables in another one and the coffee and the candy in still another one.</span> <span id="s570">The household was no problem because Hans’ patients were very nice.</span> <span id="s571">Wherever I came, I had no problem; but, we knew the time had come where we had to make a really big decision and leave, because it got to the point where we could see that Hitler’s 1,000 years probably would not last 1,000 years, but they would last longer than we could.</span> <span id="s572">You could tell just by looking at it.</span> <span id="s573">So, in 1937, I joined my brother on a trip to Israel just to look around and see what has happened to the friends who had the same problems and left.</span> <span id="s574">Some of them lived outside of Upper Silesia so that the problem came closer.</span> <span id="s575">Well, what I found out, at that time, was that they had more physicians than they could take in.</span> <span id="s576">They were really too busy in their fields, our friends were planting orange trees or they were raising chickens, and I knew that Hans would not be good for it because he is so for medicine and medicine only.</span> <span id="s577">They had about 40 ear, nose and throat men in Tel Aviv at that time, and, from that point-of-view the trip was very discouraging, because we knew that Israel was out and that we had to see that we could get some connections here in this country.</span> <span id="s578">So, fortunately, my father had a cousin in New york.</span> <span id="s579">I guess Hans told you about that?</span> <span id="s580">He decided in January 1938 to go and see and come back with the Affidavit.</span> <span id="s581">Then we would take it from there.</span> <span id="s582">Well, things were happening in a very quick way.</span> <span id="s583">From someone who knew the Secretary of the Consul, we got the visa in a very short time.</span> <span id="s584">The big problem came up.</span> <span id="s585">Would i be able to stay by myself because I was in danger from the moment Hans left, because they figured if the man is leaving he is taking the money along and they really kept an eye on you 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s586">It was a very, very uncomfortable situation.</span> <span id="s587">They were burning books.</span> <span id="s588">Now the Gestapo could have come into the house and found one book from the many books we had, that was supposed to have been burned, and that would have been the end of me.</span> <span id="s589">So, I was really in a very, very sad situation because I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s590">But, we finally decided that Hans would leave and I would stay.</span> <span id="s591">Franz still went to school and really didn’t have any problems.</span> <span id="s592">We had an English teacher who kept giving him lessons and giving me lessons.</span> <span id="s593">As I said, patients were lovely.</span> <span id="s594">They were really trying to ease the situation as long as I was there.</span> <span id="s595">When Hans left, he left in June 1938.</span> <span id="s596">I had to decide what I would take along and what I would leave.</span> <span id="s597">I had to rebuy every piece that I owned.</span> <span id="s598">For instance, we had to buy our own furniture.</span> <span id="s599">I had to come back with the original bill and pay the government the same price before I was allowed to take it along.</span> <span id="s600">I had to rebuy every medical book, every instrument.</span> <span id="s601">We had saved some money, because Hans was working for ten years, and we could not take it along.</span> <span id="s602">The only money we needed was for my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s603">He had to enter into a nursing home in Breslau because we were on the go, on the move and I didn’t know how long I would stay, how long it would take, so we put him into a nursing home, a Jewish nursing home in Breslau.</span> <span id="s604">We had to pay so much for, let’s say, for five years, because they figured that within five years we would probably have a chance to have him join us.</span> <span id="s605">The rest of the money I had to spend for whatever I felt I wanted to take along.</span> <span id="s606">We did bring a lot of things which weren’t really necessities, but as long as the money lasted, we did decide to take them because there would always be a chance to sell it, anything and everything, even if we would lose money.</span> <span id="s607">You know, you take everything you have and figure hopefully that ultimately you would sell it.</span> <span id="s608">In August our little boy fell off the bicycle and I was in real trouble.</span> <span id="s609">The Chief Surgeon of the hospital would not set that arm, he broke his arm; the Chief Surgeon was a Catholic, he would not take care of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s610">I had to take him 30 miles into the Children’s Hospital of Beuthan where the Chief was nice enough to take care of me.</span> <span id="s611">I had to go there in order to have the bandage changed.</span> <span id="s612">We still had a car at that time and when it got real bad I got very nervous about the whole thing.</span> <span id="s613">Friends of ours volunteered either to go so far or to take him.</span> <span id="s614">He arrived here still with the arm hanging down, doing exercises.</span> <span id="s615">That was a very, very bad experience for me because when it happens to you, yourself, it isn’t so bad; but, when it happens to your children and they are not being taken care of, and a physician can say I am not taking care of the child, this surgeon was something.</span> <span id="s616">The Chief of Staff would not touch that child.</span> <span id="s617">That was really a blow.</span> <span id="s618">Of course, my parents gave me all the support I needed because they were only 50 miles away.</span> <span id="s619">They were pushing us, as much as they hated to see me pack and leave, but, they were pushing because it was the time when Chamberlain was preparing to come to Munich and no one knew what would happen.</span> <span id="s620">My father still got his Swiss newspaper and he saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s621">He said, “Hasten your move!</span> <span id="s622">I would rather you would go.”</span> <span id="s623">It wasn’t that easy because the German government had no intention to make it easy.</span> <span id="s624">I had to sell the car, and that went to one of Hans’ patients who was very decent.</span> <span id="s625">This patient came up on April 1st when they had the boycott and insisted that she wanted to be treated by Hans.</span> <span id="s626">She passed through the SS Guards.</span> <span id="s627">So, when I advertised the car she came up and I was glad to sell it to her.</span> <span id="s628">I had to sell a lot of our things because even in a big lift-van, you know, you can only get that much in and you only take the things which you either want to use or sell.</span> <span id="s629">The personal lives, at this time, about stopped.</span> <span id="s630">There was no entertainment.</span> <span id="s631">Everybody was very busy with making plans.</span> <span id="s632">Whoever could make plans would like to go and you have no idea how many times you had to go for everything.</span> <span id="s633">For every fork you take you have to go to the Gestapo, you have to get the bills, you have to pay them.</span> <span id="s634">They had to see whether they were really not more than what I said.</span> <span id="s635">It was really a very, very difficult time.</span> <span id="s636">Finally, I had no help anymore, because they would not come into a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s637">The housekeeper didn’t make it anymore because she lived elsewhere.</span> <span id="s638">I could stay in the apartment until about one week before we left, then friends across the street gave me a room and we stayed there and I packed.</span> <span id="s639">I ate with them and I lived with them.</span> <span id="s640">They were really very nice.</span> <span id="s641">Today their daughter is married to a surgeon in Kew Gardens.</span> <span id="s642">Every time we are in New York, or every year for the Holy Days, I hear from her.</span> <span id="s643">They were three girls, two of them are in England and one is here.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Now, can I back up and ask some questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: You know you can ask me the questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: About your son, Franz and his schooling.</span> <span id="s647">Was it a school run by the Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: No, he went to a public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Even up to the time you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yes, you see it was summertime, July and August are the vacation time.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: But through to the spring of that year.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: For the spring he was still in school, he was 8 years old, that means it was his 3rd year in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: So they had not yet expelled or denied Jewish children the right to attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: No, there were only very few left and then luckily we were in vacation time.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And after that, of course, we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You frequently hear stories from the school children about how the teachers, the Jewish school children, about how the teachers made these disparaging remarks.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Did Franz come home with these kind of stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: No, he was really not hurt by that.</span> <span id="s661">That was very lucky, because those things can do a lot of damage.</span> <span id="s662">I guess we were lucky that we came into the vacation time, because when it got real bad we were on the way out.</span> <span id="s663">And until 1938, as long as the treaty was there, they could not just discriminate against the Jewish children because the treaty specified a “normal way of life.”</span> <span id="s664">It was lucky that we got out before it got so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Was the Synagogue burned before you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span> <span id="s667">When I was all packed I went to my parent’s house for one week.</span> <span id="s668">I left Leibitz about the 1st of October.</span> <span id="s669">Then I stayed with my parents and while I was there - oh, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s670">Chamberlain was in Munich in between, and I got telegrams from Hans: “Come later” and I couldn’t.</span> <span id="s671">You know, I was stuck, so I sent him a telegram that I would leave Leibitz and stay with my parents.</span> <span id="s672">Which I did!</span> <span id="s673">And it was just the holiday (meaning Jewish Holy Day) season - I spent the holidays with them.</span> <span id="s674">They decided to take me to the boat in Bremen.</span> <span id="s675">We stopped in Breslau to say goodbye to my father-in-law.</span> <span id="s676">We went to Bremen.</span> <span id="s677">In the meantime the Jews were supposed to have a “J” in their passports.</span> <span id="s678">So, while I was on transit to Bremen.</span> <span id="s679">I had to stop in Berlin, go to the Gestapo and get a “J” in my passport before I could leave.</span> <span id="s680">I must say that the German customs people were lovely.</span> <span id="s681">When I was packing my belongings they would come into the house; they would sit and read the paper - they were, luckily, all patients of Hans.</span> <span id="s682">Would I have wanted to take anything, I could have done it easily, because they just looked the other way.</span> <span id="s683">But fortunately I didn’t take advantage of it.</span> <span id="s684">When I came on the ship every one of my suitcases was broken open for a double check.</span> <span id="s685">They were checking the customs people before they put the luggage in the cabin.</span> <span id="s686">There may have been people who smuggled things, but I was afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: That any slight infraction of the rules would have gotten you in a great deal of difficulties.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Would have gotten me in goal.</span> <span id="s689">When I came on the ship and found all my suitcases opened and things taken out I thanked G-d that I didn’t take anything that I had not the bill for.</span> <span id="s690">I came here with a great big suitcase full of nothing else but bills for every dress, for every piece of underwear, anything and everything we took along had to be documented.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Before you left and while you were preparing to leave did you go out on the street very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes, I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Did you consciously stay indoors?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No.</span> <span id="s695">You see, as long as that treaty lasted this was all right.</span> <span id="s696">Things really got bad after the “Kristalnacht,” the night of the “Broken Glass” when synagogues, stores, etc. were vandalized, Nov. 9 - 10, 1938.</span> <span id="s697">Before that you had a certain freedom.</span> <span id="s698">I mean, people knew me, the ones who wanted to say hello did and the ones who didn’t looked away; but you know we did not suffer personal harm, except the fear that the Gestapo could find something.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: After Dr. Liebermann left and while you were there by yourself did the Gestapo come, ever, to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: They came once, to check on something we wanted to take along, but I had the books and I had the papers and they only stayed a short time.</span> <span id="s701">But, knowing that they could come any minute and you were careful with everything you did.</span> <span id="s702">In particular Hans asked me not to do anything which could give us trouble; rather to leave things and to do just what they wanted you to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: No, had you and Dr. Liebermann made all of these decisions before you left - exactly what furniture, what pieces of furniture you wanted to sell, what you were going to bring?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: No, I had to do this with the movers, because we bought two lift-vans, a smaller one and a larger one.</span> <span id="s705">The smaller one was packed with nothing else but the office furniture and the instruments for anything, because we didn’t know whether we would unpack at the same time or whenever he would open the office.</span> <span id="s706">So the movers had to decide how much of all the things could go into the lift and what couldn’t.</span> <span id="s707">For instance we came here with a big piece of furniture for the dining room but the table, we couldn’t get in - so we said: you know, you can always get yourself a table - rather take something else instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Now, how did you go about selling your furniture?</span> <span id="s709">Did you advertise in the newspaper or how?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: I advertised in the newspaper!</span> <span id="s711">And I had it in the dining room all together and people took it away.</span> <span id="s712">You know, they don’t (hesitate) there, too, were some patients who grabbed it and some of them, who were nicer, said “could we have this?”</span> <span id="s713">I gave most of the stuff away, I mean.</span> <span id="s714">You know, funny as it may sound to you, but money at time was no object because you knew you couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s715">You could only spend money.</span> <span id="s716">Now, for instance, I was only allowed to leave the country on a German ship and, at the time when I was ready, they only had a 1st class cabin, so we came by 1st class because I didn’t dare to wait for another one - wait another 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s717">So, whatever was available, I paid it and I paid my passage on 1st class, and that was it.</span> <span id="s718">We left a lot of things over there but we made changes for instance, these 2 pieces here were in my parent’s house.</span> <span id="s719">We had a big library and I was always very much in love with that piece so my parents sent it to Liebitz and they took mine and we packed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: When you went to Israel, the year before, in 1937, you said that your brother went with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Now was he just along to keep you company and help you?</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: He was also looking around to see and you could, I guess Hans has told you, that if you went to Israel, if you had 10,000 pounds, at that time, you could get in there without taking an exam, to practice if there were patients.</span> <span id="s724">This is why there were so many physicians, the ones who were afraid to take an exam and start in a different country could go there, if they had the money.</span> <span id="s725">But, as I told you there were so many there that I knew that Hans could not practice we would have to live an entirely different life and I knew that he could not do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: What sort of prospect was your brother interested in?</span> <span id="s727">Leather?</span> <span id="s728">A leather store?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s730">You know what the situation was!</span> <span id="s731">Unfortunately there were complications in so far as the money is concerned, and they didn’t go.</span> <span id="s732">They didn’t go, and he was killed, later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Now, in disposing of the apartment, your home, did you sell that, or was that simply confiscated?</span> <span id="s734">Did you just off and leave it?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: That was just rented!</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: That was not mine!</span> <span id="s738">See we had 3 rooms for the office and 6 rooms for us.</span> <span id="s739">The whole 1st floor in a big downtown building.</span> <span id="s740">But we rented it.</span> <span id="s741">We had no responsibility.</span> <span id="s742">Once we got out, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: The family you stayed with, across the street for a week, while you were packing, were they Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s745">He was a lawyer a very well known layer, he had been in WWI, had received an Iron Cross decoration, and very German.</span> <span id="s746">So German, that unfortunately, he was killed because he refused to get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Note: Here there is a lengthy silent part in the tape.</span> <span id="s748">I tried to pick this up in two different tapes but both were silent at this point.</span> <span id="s749">That silence lasted to the end of the 1st of 2 tapes and I have no knowledge of what was lost and therefore could not be transcribed.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Could you give me any sort of information or shall I say the general exodus of the Jewish community from Leibitz.</span> <span id="s751">Where there was an awful lot of people trying to leave in this period.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Everybody at this point was trying, because things were bad.</span> <span id="s753">Chamberlain did not make it any better.</span> <span id="s754">You had the feeling that Hitler was building big roads and he would be stopped one of these days and only a war would get him out of this situation because there were ... You know you can keep people off the street and give them work in munition factories, building highways, having arms (probably meaning in the army) ... When we left the Germans were armed up to here, completely ready for a war and we knew more or less we knew that it would happen in our life time, because it had to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: When other people would leave, your close friends for example, would they just leave, would there be a gathering of friends to bid them farewell or were so many leaving that...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: When we left, you see we were very fortunate, we left about 3 weeks or 4 weeks before the “cristalnight” and then it really got to the point where everybody knew and where the exodus really started.</span> <span id="s757">When we were getting ready you did, I mean you did not like to live separated from your family but you weren’t under such pressure, if you followed the directions you had - if you did everything the way the Nazis wanted it you could do it at your own time.</span> <span id="s758">You know no one would have pushed me if I had left a couple of weeks later, it was my own feeling and my parents really couldn’t wait, you know, I was the only daughter.</span> <span id="s759">It was very hard for them, but they knew that the separation would be bad and, whatever would come, we would be able to help them and to help my brothers once we were settled.</span> <span id="s760">So they were also anxious to see us go at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: So you left from Bremen and arrived in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s763">We left on Columbus Day and we left with an American teacher, in the same compartment,.</span> <span id="s764">you know to go to the ship from Berlin to Bremen.</span> <span id="s765">She was telling Franz about Columbus Day.</span> <span id="s766">That was the first history lesson for American history.</span> <span id="s767">You know, she was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: How was your English, at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: It was not good but it was better than it had been because we had had a chance to concentrate.</span> <span id="s770">There was nothing else to do.</span> <span id="s771">I had had it in school, I had a pretty good background.</span> <span id="s772">We had a British teacher who was still there teaching.</span> <span id="s773">But real English I learned by the radio, I knew every soap opera.</span> <span id="s774">The radio was put on early in the morning and I had it going until late at night.</span> <span id="s775">This is how we really learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: I am going to ask you a question...</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: That may be a little difficult to answer.</span> <span id="s779">Before you left, I know that there was the general insecurity and the general anxiety - did you ever have a feeling of panic?</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: That is marvelous!</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: No, that I did not have because I guess my parents gave me a lot of support.</span> <span id="s783">If it would have been after the cristalnight it may have been, it would have been different because at that time the men were taken away and they were in camps - the whole situation changed, but I only had the big worry: “Would I get out in time and would I be united with Hans before anything would happen?</span> <span id="s784">”” No, fortunately, I had a lot of stamina to take all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Now, when you arrived in New York, Dr. Lliebermann met you and you then went on then to Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: We stayed two days in New York and then went on to Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q :Now can you tell me from your perspective about the readjustment in a strange land and to a strange language.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: It wasn’t too bad in Cleveland because we had a lovely one bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s789">The school was down the corner and Franz made a marvelous adjustment.</span> <span id="s790">He played football with the kids without knowing the game.</span> <span id="s791">When he went to school they put him into the 2nd grade and every 4 weeks or so they put him in a different grade, so, by the time we came to Dayton he had been in the 5th grade and he gained the whole school year.</span> <span id="s792">When we came to Dayton he had just been transferred into the 5th grade and here he went into the 5th grade.</span> <span id="s793">He graduated from High School when he was 17 so that was nice.</span> <span id="s794">There was a delicatessen store downstairs and the people were very nice in telling me where to go and shop.</span> <span id="s795">Money, we didn’t have!</span> <span id="s796">We came with $4.00 each.</span> <span id="s797">The only thing I remember I would knit little pants for little children and from the money we bought a leather jacket for Franz.</span> <span id="s798">At that time the leather jackets with little shirt collars were in fashion and that was the biggest dream of his life to have a leather jacket like this for his birthday in January.</span> <span id="s799">I went to the May Co. and I bought a leather jacket.</span> <span id="s800">Otherwise I had brought a lot of clothes over for him and some of them were right, some of them were wrong.</span> <span id="s801">So whatever was right he could wear, and what was wrong he would not.</span> <span id="s802">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Did you feel isolated in Cleveland or did you being to associate with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: No we did not at all because Hans was working very hard - and he was working in the living room and Franz and I would be in the bedroom until 11:00 and then we would take Franz from the bedroom back into the inner bed and let him sleep the rest of the night.</span> <span id="s805">He had an orange box for a night table you know, a suitcase on the other side.</span> <span id="s806">It was improvised but it was cheap.</span> <span id="s807">We paid very little for the apartment.</span> <span id="s808">We knew that we would have debts - and the less debts, the easier it would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: How long were you in Cleveland all together before you came to Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Not very long.</span> <span id="s811">I arrived in Cleveland about the 22nd of October and by the end of January we started to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Had all contact with Germany been cut off?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Were you able to write home?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Oh, yes, because only in September of 1939 when they invaded Poland were the communications cut off.</span> <span id="s816">Until then I had letters from my parents and I could write to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Were they censored?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: That I don’t know, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: There was nothing marked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Not in what they wrote, but in what I wrote probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: Now, in their letters to you did they comment very much on what was happening?</span> <span id="s822">For example did they comment on cristalnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: That we only knew from the papers.</span> <span id="s824">I mean that I knew that my brothers were in camp and my father ...</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Did that happen right after cristalnight?</span> <span id="s826">I mean your ...</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: The morning after cristalnight.</span> <span id="s828">All the men were taken into concentration camps and some of them were released.</span> <span id="s829">My father wasn’t there very long - my brothers were there much longer and then they had labour camps for them.</span> <span id="s830">The business of my father had to be sold immediately and was taken over by some big Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did your mother write to you about all this, or relate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Most of it we heard from people who came, or from newspaper, you know.</span> <span id="s833">From then on they didn’t write much - they wrote only postcards - they were well and they are hoping that we would be able to be adjusted and so didn’t find it too hard.</span> <span id="s834">There was actually very very little that they would say because I guess they felt that they were in prison with one leg anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: When the newly arrived Germans came to Cleveland, did you make any sort of special attempt to talk to newly arrived Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: No, I didn’t, but Hans had a friend in Cleveland, who had come here in 1933, and they kind of took us under their wings.</span> <span id="s837">They invited us for Sunday dinner and they took care of Franz and me, when Hans was in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s838">But we made no attempt to meet anyone because number 1, your thoughts were in Germany and you were trying to get around in this country and you were not very good company at this point.</span> <span id="s839">You learned the language.</span> <span id="s840">You know there were so many things that the social life just had to be put aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: You came to Dayton in January 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: That was different, you see Hans took his exam in December 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: And then went to Philadelphia - and we came to Dayton in January 1939.</span> <span id="s845">We were very lucky that we found somebody who gave us a few hints, you know, where to settle and what to do.</span> <span id="s846">Then things were different because number 1, we had to think of getting settled in the apartment, getting settled in the office and having a telephone, trying to establish a practice.</span> <span id="s847">For that, you know, you have to make contacts.</span> <span id="s848">We used to go to Friday night services, we contacted the Jewish Community Council.</span> <span id="s849">Not that we needed any help.</span> <span id="s850">They would have liked to help us with money and take us under their wings, which we did not want because we felt that once you start you have to start being on your own and try to break into the community.</span> <span id="s851">They did not like that very well.</span> <span id="s852">They would have liked to put all the refugees together and establish a club for them.</span> <span id="s853">They resented very much that Hans and I would not participate.</span> <span id="s854">Because we felt that we have to make our own contacts and, if you want to live in a small community you have to know the people and you have to try to live with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Were there very many refugees here in Dayton at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: There were 20 families, or so.</span> <span id="s857">It was stopped when the war in Europe started and Wright Field, all of a sudden had 10,000 workers imported from all over the country and the Jewish Community wasn’t able to find an apartment or even a room for them.</span> <span id="s858">So the New York office was asked not to send anymore refugees to Dayton.</span> <span id="s859">I mean there were a lot of people who didn’t arrive in New York and made contact when they didn’t know anybody or didn’t have any contacts.</span> <span id="s860">They were distributed to Jewish communities by the HIAS.</span> <span id="s861">I don’t know if you ever heard of them?</span> <span id="s862">(HIAS = Hebrew Immigrant Association).</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: I had not thought about this before but it strikes me that it would be very interesting to talk with people on the Community Council, there, in the late 30th and the early 40th who were working with the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Well, there aren’t many left.</span> <span id="s865">Fisher died, and Bob Fitterman, who was here during this time just retired and moved to Florida.</span> <span id="s866">There aren’t many left.</span> <span id="s867">They had bitter and not such good experiences with people who were sent.</span> <span id="s868">You know some of them did not like it here; they demanded more than the Jewish Community could offer.</span> <span id="s869">Human beings are human beings, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Dr. Liebermann had related to me in some detail the difficulties which he had with the medical society and getting started in his practice.</span> <span id="s871">Could you tell me, from your perspective during those months, when he was in a sense being locked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Well, it was very - you see I was helping him at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: You worked in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: I was in the office and I worked until 3:00 p.m. I went there in the morning, got the office cleaned up.</span> <span id="s875">At 3:00 p.m., when school was over I would come home and then Franz and I would do the shopping.</span> <span id="s876">He would do the shopping, I would do the laundry and we would do things together.</span> <span id="s877">We never left him alone, I was always with him after he came home from school so that at least he would have the feeling of being sheltered.</span> <span id="s878">We became very friendly with his teacher and she was always telling us - when he first came into her class she was very nice and she was very anxious to hear a little from him what was going on.</span> <span id="s879">She said that, no matter what she did, when she asked him “Where are you from?”</span> <span id="s880">he would say “from Cleveland.”</span> <span id="s881">She absolutely could not budge him.</span> <span id="s882">He wanted to...I guess he had seen enough - he wanted to be integrated and he did not even want to tell the kids that he wasn’t from here.</span> <span id="s883">He was very naive but I remember that there was an A&amp;P at the corner.</span> <span id="s884">I gave him a grocery list and I put pepper on the grocery list.</span> <span id="s885">He came back and he bought me a whole pound of pepper.</span> <span id="s886">I looked at him, and I could not believe it.</span> <span id="s887">I said, “You were supposed to bring a little shaker.”</span> <span id="s888">He said, “You know, I stood there and it is so much cheaper to buy a big bag so I thought you would need a big bag.”</span> <span id="s889">When the war started, and no one had pepper, everyone of my friends got pepper for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s890">That was the only way in which I could get rid of a pound of pepper.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: That is a nice story.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: It is a true one.</span> <span id="s893">You know, he was so conscious of saving, and when we were in Cleveland, on Friday night, we would take a walk and on (name of street I believe) they had one of those push carts the cinnamon apple.</span> <span id="s894">Hans would get a bite, I would get a bite, and Franz would get the rest of the apple.</span> <span id="s895">The apple was a nickel.</span> <span id="s896">That was his Friday night treat - to give him something special before Shabbat came.</span> <span id="s897">We would, when Hans was busy until 5 or 6 o’clock - Franz and I would, when we were through with our house chores, we would walk down to the office and pick him up.</span> <span id="s898">Then the three of us would walk back home and for that nickel I saved I would buy him a Coke.</span> <span id="s899">You know, you can tell that to kids today, even my grandchildren can believe that this is the way we started.</span> <span id="s900">I never forget that there was a family here where the boy went with him to Sunday school and they picked him up.</span> <span id="s901">And they asked him questions how he liked America.</span> <span id="s902">He said, “You know, in Germany, they looked at us because we had a car and here they looked at us because we are about the only ones walking.”</span> <span id="s903">You know these are the thoughts of a 9 year old who sees the changing from one country to another one.</span> <span id="s904">I remember that there is a program: “Man of the Street.”</span> <span id="s905">You know they used to be next to the Harris Building, in front of Loews Theatre.</span> <span id="s906">That was before your time.</span> <span id="s907">Can you remember Loews Theatre?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Yes, I know where it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: The “Man of the Street” got hold of him.</span> <span id="s910">That was during the time we were fighting with the Medical Society - he went on the air with the “Man of the Street” and gave him the story of our lives: how hard it is for his father to get located here and he came up to the office with a 6 pack of coca-cola as a reward - and I could have wrung his neck.</span> <span id="s911">The only time in my life!</span> <span id="s912">He was so proud of himself that he got 6 bottles of coca-cola for his story.</span> <span id="s913">Just a regular kid, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: He was selling newspapers for a pocket knife.</span> <span id="s916">Hans and I got stuck with the magazines - so that he could get his pocket knife.</span> <span id="s917">He was an only child.</span> <span id="s918">Unfortunately I lost one baby in 1933 and one in 1935 due to all the excitement and when I left Germany they told me that I would have to spend the entire time in bed - so we never had another child.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Were they miscarriages or stillbirths?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: The one was a miscarriage in the 3rd month or so and the other was in the 6th or so.</span> <span id="s921">You know the baby could probably even live, well at that time they said it was a miscarriage - the baby didn’t live.</span> <span id="s922">But, after the war I wanted to adopt a child from Europe, especially when we heard that my niece had been killed.</span> <span id="s923">I had a 3 year old niece.</span> <span id="s924">And the organizations in New York would not give us a child.</span> <span id="s925">They said “the children who had lived in the camps have seen so much that they are absolutely unfit to adjust to a normal household.”</span> <span id="s926">That was a big blow because I had made up my mind that I would like to adopt a child.</span> <span id="s927">But we couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: Did you have much association with the other MD’s in Dayton?</span> <span id="s929">In this period when Dr. Liebermann was trying to get established and not having much success.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: You know, the doctors really were very cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: And the wives were too?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I hardly knew them, you know.</span> <span id="s933">I worked for the PTA.</span> <span id="s934">We didn’t have a membership in the Medical Society so consequently I didn’t know the doctors’ wives.</span> <span id="s935">Even the Jewish doctors were so afraid of being with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: The competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: The competition because in the 30’s American doctors would take their exams and open a practice.</span> <span id="s938">They would go to Vienna for 3 or 4 months - and they would come back being specialized.</span> <span id="s939">When Hans came here with a specialty of 4 years training they didn’t like it and I guess he told you the story about the Medical Society.</span> <span id="s940">But we had 11 new patients the day after the story broke.</span> <span id="s941">They all said, if there is so much fuss about you, you must be good.</span> <span id="s942">There were a lot of Germans in the NCR; mechanics, and they all showed up.</span> <span id="s943">Within 24 hours we had a big, big practice of them because they said, “We know that they only go to Europe for a few weeks training.”</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: After that break came, after the story and the editorial in the newspaper and the practice was finally established - then what was your relationship with the auxiliary?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Very little, because Hans never went and neither did I. I mean that I worked with the auxiliary of Good Samaritan afterwards, after they gave him the break - but with the auxiliary of the Medical Society I had very little to do.</span> <span id="s946">You know one thing: they didn’t accept us - we actually never cared to be with them.</span> <span id="s947">Fortunately we didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s948">The contacts at Good Samaritan was a much healthier one because Hans had a friendly atmosphere to work with and the people who were there were nice; the sisters were lovely.</span> <span id="s949">I mean at that time, there were very many there, you know it is not like today when they only have 4 or 5.</span> <span id="s950">They really opened the doors.</span> <span id="s951">If it hadn’t been for the sisters at Good Samaritan and a few Catholic physicians we could have packed our bags and gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: How long did you continue to work in the office?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Well I worked a lot longer because when the war broke out in Germany and the Americans went into the war, the nurses were hard to get.</span> <span id="s954">We couldn’t get nurses and everybody was asked to pitch in and to do as much as possible to release the nurses for war duty.</span> <span id="s955">So I worked in the office until way after the war.</span> <span id="s956">At that time, then, of course, Hans had an established practice.</span> <span id="s957">He had a lot of trouble you know they wanted him to join the war, and he couldn’t, because he didn’t have the citizenship.</span> <span id="s958">When he had the citizenship Dayton wasn’t allowed to send any doctors out because there was such a shortage.</span> <span id="s959">So after that the practice was established and as soon as we could, we got a nurse, but I was definitely in the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: We have gone on for an hour now and I think that that is enough for today.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Well it depends what else you want to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s963">I think that I would like to come back next week, for one more session and that probably would be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: This is the 3rd interview with Mrs. Liebermann.</span> <span id="s966">We are in the living room of her home on Tuesday afternoon October 24, 1978.</span> <span id="s967">Mrs. Liebermann, what I would like to talk to you about this afternoon is the family you left behind in Germany.</span> <span id="s968">Your parents and your brothers and their families.</span> <span id="s969">You stated earlier, when we first started talking that you had 3 brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Right!</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: And that your mother and father were still alive when you left.</span> <span id="s972">Now had all 3 of your brothers married?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: No!</span> <span id="s974">Only one.</span> <span id="s975">One was married in 1935 - and in 1936 they had a little girl.</span> <span id="s976">They named her Vera, and our oldest granddaughter had the middle name “Vera.”</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Now you and Dr. Liebermann left in 1938.</span> <span id="s978">In July and October of 1938 and the plans were that when you got settled you would make arrangements for the rest of your family to come over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Now, as soon as you got settled in the U.S., did you immediately turn your attention to making these arrangements?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: I arrived in October and the cristalnight was on the 9th of November, and that changed everything, because at that time it became so urgent that regardless as to whether anybody would be settled or not we realized that they had to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: My brothers were in camp and they all had to see to it that they got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: You were in correspondence with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: Yes, at that time I was, because only when this country declared war on Germany were the communications interrupted.</span> <span id="s986">At that time we were trying to get them into Chile, to Shanghai, whatever would be open - Cuba.</span> <span id="s987">It was just to get them out!</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: I am very curious as to how you went about exploring the options which were open.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: They did.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: They did, you could do very little from here.</span> <span id="s992">The only thing we did, we promised them that, whatever they would do and whatever money they would have to have, without getting it from the German government, we would try to borrow it here, and help t hem out.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: Was it [ ]?</span> <span id="s994">I never heard anyone say this, so far but was it possible to telephone?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: We did, that is Doctor did.</span> <span id="s998">I was chicken, I just couldn’t do it, but he talked to them.</span> <span id="s999">My mother had a birthday on the 13th of November.</span> <span id="s1000">That was 4 days after the cristalnight.</span> <span id="s1001">We did talk to them, we did call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: And she told you at the time that all 3 of your brothers had been taken to a camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: We talked to them.</span> <span id="s1004">That we should please hurry up, and try to help them to get out.</span> <span id="s1005">They would let us know immediately if there was anyway open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: And your father was in a camp also?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: My father was only there overnight, because since they had my brothers they evidently decided that he would not have to be there.</span> <span id="s1008">(The Nazis, at that time, put an age limit on the Jewish males they imprisoned).</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: This statement that you just showed me that Dr. Liebermann, the affidavit which you just showed me, that Dr. Liebermann drew up, referred to a cousin of his in Cleveland, a man by the name of Herman Praeg?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Now, were you working closely with him?</span> <span id="s1012">Was he a close cousin?</span> <span id="s1013">Dr. Liebermann did not mention him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: No, that was actually, I don’t even remember, but at that time - after the cristalnight everybody was willing to be your relative and help you.</span> <span id="s1015">At that time they realized that they actually wouldn’t be made responsible.</span> <span id="s1016">But the quota was so small and they just couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1017">And they tried all these other countries.</span> <span id="s1018">We lost an awful lot of money: they had visas for Chile and they could never get there, so they said sorry.</span> <span id="s1019">My father-in-law was ready to go to Cuba and got sick like Hans probably told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: We tried to reclaim the money.</span> <span id="s1022">They said, “Sorry, the visa is still good - he could still come, that’s all.”</span> <span id="s1023">They all made money on the unfortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Yes, Yes.</span> <span id="s1025">What finally happened?</span> <span id="s1026">Your brothers were able to go on a ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: My brother got on a ship to Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: And your sister-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And my sister-in-law and the baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Now when was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: That was in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Early?</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: In August.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: In August 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: In August, and on the 1st of September Hitler marched into Poland and the ship was called back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: How far out had the ship gotten?</span> <span id="s1037">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Do you know the name of the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No.</span> <span id="s1041">I only know that they were sent back and then they were in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: I suppose they went back to Hamburg?</span> <span id="s1043">Bremen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: To Hamburg I think they left from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1045">And they were put into the camp.</span> <span id="s1046">I have no idea what happened.</span> <span id="s1047">My parents never heard from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: What ultimately happened to your parents?</span> <span id="s1049">Do you know that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: My parents had to move out of their apartment and shared the apartment they were assigned until, in 1942 I think, they were sent to Teresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1051">And as fate wanted, my father met his brother and sister there.</span> <span id="s1052">And in October 1944 they were all sent to the extermination camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Now, how did you find this out?</span> <span id="s1054">Was it much later that you found it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: After the war, see, in 1945 the war was over and I don’t know whether you heard of Rabbi Baeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Oh Leo Baeck?</span> <span id="s1057">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Leo Baeck married my parents in 1906.</span> <span id="s1059">He was Rabbi in Opeln at that time.</span> <span id="s1060">And when he got out, of course he remembered who was there and what happened.</span> <span id="s1061">And when he came to Cincinnati - Hans and I drove to Cincinnati in 1946 or 1947.</span> <span id="s1062">He told us that they were shipped out before the last winter in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1063">5000 at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: You had had no word until you saw Rabbi Baeck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: I had no word because nobody could remember exactly what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Had you reestablished any communications with Germany after the war was over in 1945?</span> <span id="s1067">Had you begun to try to write to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: I had a cousin in Germany who was married to a non-Jew and her mother also died.</span> <span id="s1069">They did everything they could to find out but there was very little left, very little.</span> <span id="s1070">The few people who got out could only tell the horrible story.</span> <span id="s1071">Some of them were sent to Switzerland, wherever relatives could call for them.</span> <span id="s1072">But we never heard of anybody anymore.</span> <span id="s1073">During the war though my father was able to correspond with a friend of ours in Switzerland and she sent chocolate and little packages which they most of the time of course did not get.</span> <span id="s1074">But she wrote to him, that we are fine, and so forth, and I got a bunch of cards with nothing in there except “we are well, and we trust and hope that someday we will be together.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Did you ever establish contact with friends in Leibitz or Opeln after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: There was nobody left.</span> <span id="s1077">There were no Jews left, at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: What about non-Jews?</span> <span id="s1079">Those who had been friends like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: We never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Had you ever been back to that area?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: We were only back to see my cousin in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1083">She moved from Breslau to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1084">She moved from Breslau to Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1085">And we see her in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1086">She is married, as I told you, to a non-Jew who gave up his position in order to save her and the two children they had.</span> <span id="s1087">He was in a factory as a regular worker.</span> <span id="s1088">He had been an officer in the Prussian army with one leg only.</span> <span id="s1089">He had lost one leg in the 1st WW.</span> <span id="s1090">He knew all the big shots: Goering, Goebbels.</span> <span id="s1091">They wouldn’t do one thing for him unless he would get a divorce and that he would not do.</span> <span id="s1092">So we figured if he stood by her, and paid that kind of price they deserve a little bit.</span> <span id="s1093">And whenever we were in Europe we visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: So Frankfurt is the only German city you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Right!</span> <span id="s1096">We always stay with them for a day or two and that ls all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Can you comment on any kind of feelings that you have when you get to Germany or get near Germany?</span> <span id="s1098">Do you feel anything?</span> <span id="s1099">Angry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: I don’t because we only go to my cousins house and stay there.</span> <span id="s1101">We have never been to a hotel.</span> <span id="s1102">No, that is not true!</span> <span id="s1103">Once we drove from Switzerland to Frankfurt and it got dark, and we stayed in Freudenstadt, which is a small resort.</span> <span id="s1104">We stayed in a very nice hotel and they told us that in the Kurgarten - you know what this is (the garden where the mineral waters can be taken) - there would be a concert, a Mozart concert that night.</span> <span id="s1105">We like music so we decided to go.</span> <span id="s1106">When we got there, it was right after the war, we saw all these Germans in those long leather coats - I could just picture them with the Swastika and I knew exactly - we left - we went to Baden-Baden, which is more international.</span> <span id="s1107">I just couldn’t take any of this.</span> <span id="s1108">That is the 1st time I decided that I can’t do it.</span> <span id="s1109">I had bitten my teeth together many times, but for pleasure and for spending my own money.</span> <span id="s1110">I just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1111">But when I go to Frankfurt, of course, I am very much at ease because I have no contact with the Germans and the cousin I have, has only friends who are in the same position - mixed marriages or Jews who came back because they can finish their life easier in Germany than they could in England, or wherever they lived.</span> <span id="s1112">You know, for instance, lawyers who never practiced in England and never got their foot in the door in England.</span> <span id="s1113">Most of them came back to Germany where they get the restitution money and they live there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: I am curious too about the details of how the restitution arrangements were made.</span> <span id="s1115">Could you comment on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s1117">Restitution arrangements were made on that a lawyer, or a judge - let’s say - who was a judge at the time, 33 or 34, and got out.</span> <span id="s1118">If he could declare that he would have stayed a judge in Germany he gets today the restitution of a retired super grade employee because all these months back and all these years back.</span> <span id="s1119">They get a very good hunk of the money.</span> <span id="s1120">You had to prove that you do not earn as much as you do in Germany and that kept us out.</span> <span id="s1121">Because, fortunately Hans always earned more than he did - or would earn in Germany.</span> <span id="s1122">So we never did get anything.</span> <span id="s1123">About 10 years ago - or 20 years ago - the accountant of my parents came up with some papers he had taken from the area of Opeln to the area of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1124">When the restitution came up he gave us the - he was on the restitution committee and we got some money for the houses and for the money which my parents had in the bank, which was very, very little because even in prison they had to pay an enormous amount for being there and for their board and room - and livelihood.</span> <span id="s1125">I mean it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1126">But quite a few people do get money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Yes, I have heard others say so but I never inquired.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: But, you had to prove.</span> <span id="s1129">Now we know a couple here who are old today also - I guess you have Mrs. Sander on your list - now he was employed in Germany and he was employed here also.</span> <span id="s1130">He never made a fortune but a decent livelihood, you know, they would get much more.</span> <span id="s1131">They did get money.</span> <span id="s1132">We were always very happy - we didn’t need it so it didn’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: But the restitution which you got, based upon property loss did that require a great deal of legal work and a lot of papers to be sent to Germany to be processed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Not too much, because the Germans are very correct.</span> <span id="s1135">They had every bit on the books.</span> <span id="s1136">They knew.</span> <span id="s1137">If you would try to cheat for one 5 penny piece, they would know it.</span> <span id="s1138">They were so correct, they had everything there but they give you, I think 10% to a thousand or so, I mean it didn’t amount to very much.</span> <span id="s1139">They made it so that it dwindles down to practically nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: I was also under the impression that Yad Vashem in Israel could do a great deal of tracing of people who had disappeared, or been executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: They did, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Did you ever contact Yad Vashem about the fate of your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: All you can do is give them the names and they add them to the book.</span> <span id="s1144">I mean they are not able to trace anybody who asks for information.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: I am sure that this had been very painful for you now.</span> <span id="s1146">I regret that I had to ask those questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: No!</span> <span id="s1148">No!</span> <span id="s1149">Just ask me.</span> <span id="s1150">Whatever I remember I will be glad to tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Is there anything now that you thought of, which I did not ask about that you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: No, I really don’t.</span> <span id="s1153">There really is very little to say because since we didn’t have anybody left we didn’t hear very much - you know.</span> <span id="s1154">Some people who were lucky enough that one member of the family was saved and could tell stories - but since everybody was wiped out and, as I told you before, it was such a traumatic experience for me that I have tried to wipe out the past and I remember probably much less than any other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Well, that is a natural reaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: But I had to do it in order to survive, in order to be a good wife and to be a good mother, because you learn very early in this country that people only like you when you smile.</span> <span id="s1157">They don’t want any complaints - they don’t want to hear any sad stories and you just go ahead and smile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Did you find that hard to adapt to that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Well, you know, Hans probably told you of the experience in the library in Cleveland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Where this doctor, all of a sudden, turned away and never talked to him again.</span> <span id="s1162">That was a very though lesson.</span> <span id="s1163">We learned it.</span> <span id="s1164">We all knew that unless you really get into the swing of things and forget that’s it.</span> <span id="s1165">I made a lot of friends and I became very active at that time.</span> <span id="s1166">I became very active in Hadassah, in Youth Aliyah, in Child Welfare, which at that time was collecting money to feed kids in Israel - a bowl of tomato soup and a sandwich for lunch.</span> <span id="s1167">I was chairman for many years.</span> <span id="s1168">And during the war we knitted sweaters for American soldiers hoping that maybe someday, somebody would meet them or see them.</span> <span id="s1169">I just had to make my own life all over again.</span> <span id="s1170">It wasn’t always easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1172">Sure.</span> <span id="s1173">Do you have your ... you were commenting on this earlier, before I turned the tape off... I would like you to say this to be recorded: Do you have, I don’t know how I am going to put this, any thoughts on how the Jews were not let into the U.S. when they needed a haven - and the way that so many people are allowed in today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: What!</span> <span id="s1175">You can’t call it feelings, I mean, I don’t think that even Congress or the real top notch people realized that it could go that far - and the Jews also didn’t realize it.</span> <span id="s1176">No, unfortunately, human beings are always human beings, unless it touches home you don’t realize things - they are too far removed.</span> <span id="s1177">They didn’t realize that this did happen and could happen - and I think that, when they finally did realize it, after the cristalnight, it was too late.</span> <span id="s1178">No one even suggested that this country ought to be opened for all the people who wanted to come.</span> <span id="s1179">They wouldn’t give any visas except to the people who had reached the number of the quota and then it was truly ridiculous how small that was at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: You recall what the quota was for Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: But it was not very large at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: It was not very large and they went exactly by the numbers.</span> <span id="s1184">But I really think that it was because they didn’t realize that this could happen, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Do you think that we learned a lesson and that perhaps our willingness to let in so many people now without the red tape of affidavits results from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I don’t know, maybe but the Jews were certainly let down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: That’s right!</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: The worst is really that ship of people who could not get into Cuba and were sent back.</span> <span id="s1189">That of course was the saddest thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1190">You know of course the Jews were always great admirers of Roosevelt’s and it is coming out now.</span> <span id="s1191">There were a lot of things we could have done and never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: And he never did.</span> <span id="s1193">Would you say that you are prone to associate with German Jews more than, in your social life and dinner parties?</span> <span id="s1194">Is there a feeling of clinging together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: No, that is not so.</span> <span id="s1196">I told you that there are very few people here, maybe about 30 families, but practically everybody feels he should be integrated into the American stream of life.</span> <span id="s1197">We didn’t want to have a club, we didn’t want to be separated, we did want to be Americanized early and as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s1198">We never had that problem because Hans and I were very lucky - we made many, many friends and we also had many good non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1199">You know he made his way into the community.</span> <span id="s1200">We have some very good doctor friends.</span> <span id="s1201">He had been on the board of the Jewish Community.</span> <span id="s1202">I have been a board member.</span> <span id="s1203">We have been chairmen of different projects.</span> <span id="s1204">We never, never had a feeling that we were more comfortable in the company with German families.</span> <span id="s1205">But there aren’t any, don’t misunderstand me - I don’t want to sound snobbish - but we always felt that people from different backgrounds - just because we are thrown together here we have to be their friends here.</span> <span id="s1206">Why in Germany they probably wouldn’t want to be friends with us either.</span> <span id="s1207">I mean, you pick out your friends in a certain circle and just because we all have the same faith didn’t mean that we couldn’t make any other friends but be together.</span> <span id="s1208">Though I must say that you have a lot of these situations in New York and in other big cities where they weren’t able to be integrated into the community and there for survival, because you need friends for life and you need to cling with somebody.</span> <span id="s1209">So in New York, all these clubs grew.</span> <span id="s1210">You have a club of Viennese Jews, and you have a club of German Jews and from here, from there, there you have that situation, but not in Dayton.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: This raises the question of something I had not really thought about before.</span> <span id="s1212">Do you think that it was easier to assimilate in a smaller city like Dayton than it was in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No it was easier in New York.</span> <span id="s1214">Because you would come to New York, and you would be picked up by your friends and relatives who were there.</span> <span id="s1215">They would tell you exactly what to do and how to do things and they introduced you - and you have already somebody.</span> <span id="s1216">You come to a city like Dayton - we were the first ones to arrive here, didn’t know a soul.</span> <span id="s1217">Our English was passable but surely wasn’t so that we could really speak it fluently.</span> <span id="s1218">We just had to do it.</span> <span id="s1219">In a small town it is harder to get started, but in the end it pays off because I know many people in New York who never even knew an American Jew, who never had any contact with them, except maybe at the HIAS or at the Jewish Congress office, when they needed help and so forth.</span> <span id="s1220">In a smaller city it was harder in the beginning but it was better afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Do you and Dr. Liebermann talk about the old days?</span> <span id="s1222">In the pre-1938 period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: No!</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Is that done consciously or is it just that it is now so far in the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: I think it is very natural, because we have a son who is married in New York where 3 grandchildren are grown up by now and the life of 1978 you know, the life we now live, people who aren’t as interested are bound to look more into the past.</span> <span id="s1226">You know you will find out during your interviews that many of these people live in the past because the past was their glory and here they are just living - living their lives out.</span> <span id="s1227">I think that it just depends on the livelihood you make, on the friends you have now and whether you feel that you are really in the community or whether you are still an outsider.</span> <span id="s1228">Then you think back what you had and how wonderful the times over there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">Q: What about your son?</span> <span id="s1230">Does he have much of a memory of the period?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s1232">He has memories of my parents, of course, very much because they invited him for a visit and he was allowed to help in the store which was always a big deal.</span> <span id="s1233">But he actually doesn’t remember too much because he didn’t remember any hardship.</span> <span id="s1234">You know he didn’t have any hardship because we were trying to make it as easy as possible for him and he was only nine years old when we left.</span> <span id="s1235">And until then, except for these months when I was alone with him, he didn’t have any personal conflict.</span> <span id="s1236">For him it is just a very sad memory that the kid has no family.</span> <span id="s1237">This is the only thing his home, you know the family is so small, his children have no family.</span> <span id="s1238">He enjoyed uncles and an aunt - you know, a child feels where he has security and gets spoiled.</span> <span id="s1239">You know uncles and aunts are found to spoil a kid, that he misses, I am sure, for his kids also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Do your grandchildren express much curiosity about the holocaust?</span> <span id="s1241">Do they ask you questions about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Very little!</span> <span id="s1243">You know I haven’t seen them since that picture.</span> <span id="s1244">I just wonder whether they all saw it.</span> <span id="s1245">Because, for some reason, they are afraid to know too much.</span> <span id="s1246">It is a very peculiar attitude, because this is the period that is painful for them probably - you know that the parents saw it.</span> <span id="s1247">You know that our daughter-in-law is from Vienna, she went through the same thing except that the persecution - you know that she also came over - and she came over just 2 weeks before we did.</span> <span id="s1248">I think what affects them only is the fact that the parents had a little harder time coming over - because they are already a generation which is more removed, and I really don’t know how far they go, or what they really think about the situation.</span> <span id="s1249">Now, when we had the fire - and we told them about the fire which was 10 or 12 years ago, the first thing they asked was, what happened to grandpa?</span> <span id="s1250">Because then comes the family and they are very proud of the family trees - they love old pictures.</span> <span id="s1251">We have pictures of my parents, pictures of Hans and me, but they haven’t talked very much to us about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: You may wonder why I am asking these kind of questions.</span> <span id="s1253">You may say to yourself, “It is really none of my business.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Yes, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: But, what I am trying to determine is ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: How does the young generation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Yes, especially the generation once or twice removed who had grandparents who were actually involved and who suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I will give you an answer which will shock you.</span> <span id="s1259">Out of the families here, there were three children who married Jewish partners - all the other ones married non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1260">Mrs. Sander has a Jewish son-in-law.</span> <span id="s1261">Mrs. Farnbacher has two non-Jewish daughters-in-law.</span> <span id="s1262">There was a family here by the name of Neuberger with two non-Jewish daughters-in-law.</span> <span id="s1263">A family by the name of Ochs, the son married a non-Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s1264">There is a family Sussman - Leonore Sussman has a Jewish husband, her cousin, Eva Goldsmith, who lives in Milwaukee now, has a Jewish husband.</span> <span id="s1265">Frank has a Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s1266">That is a very, very sad situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: You, in a sense, are attributing those marriages out of the faith to ...</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: They don’t want to have anything do do with it - they want to cut if off and they want to live in a non-Jewish world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: I never thought about that before.</span> <span id="s1270">I never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Very shocking, it is a very shocking experience, but it is right here in Dayton.</span> <span id="s1272">I told you the names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">Q: I never really thought about that connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: I always get very shocked but this follows the line.</span> <span id="s1275">I told you that my grandchildren now pay very little attention.</span> <span id="s1276">Now Joani has a husband who comes from Brooklyn and is Jewish and the other two are, as yet unmarried and I don’t know whether they will marry Jews.</span> <span id="s1277">I hope that they have enough stamina to get married to Jewish partners.</span> <span id="s1278">But the ones who aren’t I am sure are doing it to cut the cloth and have nothing to do with it and live in a non-Jewish world.</span> <span id="s1279">Now whether it will help!</span> <span id="s1280">I mean that Hitler has proven that he is going back to the grandmothers and all in order to make you really Jewish.</span> <span id="s1281">You know, once you are a Jewish mother you are actually Jewish, according to the Halakah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: Jewish Rabbinical Law, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1283">Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: But, and this is one question I can’t answer because I have never asked, I really should have guessed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Will you hesitate to talk to, would you be reticent in talking to your grandchildren about the hardships?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: When I see them, the next time, I will find out who listened to that program.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: I would like to know, yes I really would like to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: I will let you know, yes, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1289">I will see them not before May when Nancy graduates, but when I see Frank I will find out from him if he has heard any comments because now, since you brought it up it is interesting to me also.</span> <span id="s1290">But so far it has been a very quiet past, you know the bad olden days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: The bad fades into nothingness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: You know, it is amazing that they make so much money today and they are living in such luxury.</span> <span id="s1293">When I tell them that the three of us split an apple or that we walked downtown in order to save five cents for a coke - it does not go into today’s kids’ minds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: I don’t know how your kids are but my kids can’t grasp the situation.</span> <span id="s1296">And here is only one generation ahead of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: That is right.</span> <span id="s1298">And mine would be the same way, about the same kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: Even the quarter today isn’t what the nickel was at that time.</span> <span id="s1300">The luxuries they have today, we just didn’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Yes, I thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: If there is anything else I can answer, if you have any questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: There may be some follow-up questions after I sit down and listen to the tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Because if anything comes up that you want to know.</span> <span id="s1305">As you interview more and more people, you will probably get more connections and get more information.</span> <span id="s1306">But, unfortunately after we got here, we were almost cut off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: Yes, Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Even a postcard can not even have the truth in it.</span> <span id="s1309">It just says that everyone is all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Have you saved any postcards?</span> <span id="s1311">Do you have any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I have one or two which I kept here.</span> <span id="s1313">Maybe someday my son would want to have all these things, but they can’t even read German today.</span> <span id="s1314">You know the grandchildren don’t read German at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Yes!</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: And Frank and Maryanne know enough German, but I doubt that they will ever take the time to read anything like this in German.</span> <span id="s1317">The pictures will mean something!</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: They will mean something and that will give them the story.</span> <span id="s1320">I kept very few things.</span> <span id="s1321">I mean it is mostly papers and things that, if they want to read that they can go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Yes!</span> <span id="s1323">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: Well, you are very welcome.</span> <span id="s1325">If I can help you with anything else, I will be very glad.</span> <span id="s1326">I don’t know, but if it ever comes to this maybe this or that I can add these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: You see we wouldn’t be interested in taking your originals, if it comes to that we would make copies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A: Oh, look here, not all of that is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: Do you know that Charles Frydman, Renate’s husband, has a picture of his mother in the living room of his home?</span> <span id="s1330">It is the only thing that the got out with is that one picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Yes, it came out of the paper.</span> <span id="s1332">And I, you know, only have stuff that I thought would be interesting for our children and grandchildren to remember because, maybe as they grow up, and grow older it might mean something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: If it isn’t important to them today, someday it will be very important to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: It may get so.</span> <span id="s1335">You see this is the note we got from the Red Cross - this is a postcard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: This would have been your father-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Yes, right, that he is still in the old age home; you know Aldersheim means old age home.</span> <span id="s1338">Here is a postcard from Switzerland that my father wrote to this - but that is German, but it is a handwritten card that is why I kept it.</span> <span id="s1339">But, I don’t know, it is strange, you have really made me think now.</span> <span id="s1340">I have to find out what my grandchildren really think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: You know someday I would like to talk to third generation people.</span> <span id="s1342">Someday I would like to interview your son Frank, about his memories an what he thinks is important and should it be forgotten or will he try to remember and see to it that his children remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: When I see him the next time I really have to ask him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Does he come to visit here in Dayton very often?</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: He maybe will be here December 1st for just a short visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q: You know we are developing, I don’t know that I am quite capable of being the interviewer, but we do want to have a corollary program on the children of the survivors and that would be people like Renate Frydman and Charles Stein.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: You know, Renate Frydman wrote a fabulous article when Joani got her degree.</span> <span id="s1348">She was here, at Children’s Hospital, you know she worked with Hans for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s1349">Renate wrote an article for the Jewish Chronicle on it and she did a fantastic job.</span> <span id="s1350">it takes these kids to really apply themselves to show that they haven’t been able to kill everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: She is a good writer!</span> <span id="s1352">I like Renate very much.</span> <span id="s1353">She has been extremely helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: She is a very, very brilliant girl - and never saw a college, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1356">I just assumed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: She met Charlie when she was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1358">She never went to college, she got married to Charlie and that was that.</span> <span id="s1359">She had four kids.</span> <span id="s1360">You know she may have gone to U.D., or some place (for one course or other.)</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: But she never went away from Dayton.</span> <span id="s1363">Her parents gave her the money that they had set aside for college and she bought a house for that and started to have her own family.</span> <span id="s1364">She thought that it was more important to have a Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: That is very good.</span> <span id="s1366">Her husband fought with the partisans in Poland!</span> <span id="s1367">Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1369">Charlie is a nice man!</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: I wish you would talk to Charlie.</span> <span id="s1371">He does not want to participate.</span> <span id="s1372">He is the only one here, that I know of, who fought with the Polish partisans.</span> <span id="s1373">In all the research that has been done on the partisans, what their area of operations was, what size unit they fought in.</span> <span id="s1374">He does not want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1375">I don’t want to push him, I am regretful that he doesn’t want to but I understand.</span> <span id="s1376">We are not pushing anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: It is a very painful period, but on the other hand it probably should be kept for the next generation.</span> <span id="s1378">When more time will have gone, maybe they will realize.</span> <span id="s1379">Can I offer you a cup of coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: No, thank you, I must go on.</span> <span id="s1381">Thank you so much for showing me all that.</span> <span id="s1382">It is really very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Well, if there is anything we can do or if you think of anything I forgot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: When will you be back from California?</span> <span id="s1385">In two weeks?</span> <span id="s1386">In one week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: On the 14th of November.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: I am going to call on you now after you return.</span></p></body></html>
