id="s6">It was in Ukrainian, a small town.</span> <span id="s7">I really don’t remember too much.</span> <span id="s8">My mother died when I was four and I really don’t remember her, but she passed away when I was four.</span> <span id="s9">My father lived until ’38 - - 1938 and we had a uncle that was married to a Polish woman, a more, ah , aristocratic or something, you know.</span> <span id="s10">So there was, ah, let’s see, three brothers and three sisters; three brother from a first wife, three sisters from second wife.</span> <span id="s11">My father remarried when his first wife died and so then I was the youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s12">So, ah, my mother died too.</span> <span id="s13">Now, ah, as I remember, as growing up --- I must have been, ah, eight, even, eight when they gave me to, to that uncle as their daughter because they didn’t have any children.</span> <span id="s14">So, I was going to be, you know, go to school and have a family.</span> <span id="s15">Of course, my father was sick then, he didn’t die yet but he was sick so .</span> <span id="s16">.</span> <span id="s17">and the brothers were, I don’t want to use the wrong word, but, ah, beating all the time on, on us younger kids from the second marriage, you know.</span> <span id="s18">As a stepmother, they, they beat her actually to death.</span> <span id="s19">This way she died.</span> <span id="s20">That’s what my father after told me and my sister told me because I didn’t know, being so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You were four when your mother died?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Ah, it must have been, it must have been in, ah, ’30 –1930 – or something like that.</span> <span id="s25">My father died in, ah, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And you were about eight then?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I was, ah, I don’t know how old I was.</span> <span id="s28">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s29">I don’t even know how old I am today.</span> <span id="s30">I know that I’m going I know when I met my husband in Germany, ah, I had to be - - he had to make me, he was American officer.</span> <span id="s31">I had to be - - I had to be a little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Oh, so he made you older?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Because, the - - he made me older.</span> <span id="s34">So maybe I, I don’t know, but anyway, now I’m going back.</span> <span id="s35">Ah, I was being adopted, having it pretty good.</span> <span id="s36">I even started school for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s37">Then I got the mumps, or whatever, then so I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s38">Now comes 1939.</span> <span id="s39">The Germans coming in, over Czechoslovakia on – we were just on the border – Czechoslovakian border and living there.</span> <span id="s40">And so, ah, the home that I am now adopted, ah, is elegant home - -not what kind we lived in, you know, in the small town because we were poor.</span> <span id="s41">So, the Germans were – all came in, and as I say, I don’t know how old I was – a officer had attacked me and raped me.</span> <span id="s42">I must have been either ten or twelve or eleven.</span> <span id="s43">I really don’t know because I didn’t have a period yet – so then only I know that, that of us.</span> <span id="s44">Now, they tied my uncle and my aunt and he is raping me in front of them.</span> <span id="s45">Well, they can’t untie himself.</span> <span id="s46">When my father –my uncle – my father, who – I called him father already.</span> <span id="s47">He somehow, I don’t know, from anger or something, ah, untied himself and he came to the back with a knife.</span> <span id="s48">He didn’t kill him but he hurt him.</span> <span id="s49">Well, of course, then I am already raped, blood all over --- I don’t know what is, what is, you know, just unconscious – like unconscious – so they shot my father and my mother right there in front of me.</span> <span id="s50">And it took me some, some kind of barracks, that I was lying there, hurt, and I thought the whole gut went out of me – and just kicked around and, ah, I don’t know, ah – they were debating whether to kill me too because the officer is, of course, hurt.</span> <span id="s51">If I only could, could have killed him myself.</span> <span id="s52">So, ah, then of course, to Germany.</span> <span id="s53">So, on a, ah, quite a few young kids – but not as young as I was – quite a few seventeen, fifteen, eighteen – into the, ah, train --- into the -- like a cattle train – and we were going maybe five, seven days, I don’t know – stop here and there and no food, ah, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s54">But, ah, in it – in the train, straw and manure, and, ah, nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s55">But, ah, before I left there was only one way topping – that was stopping – when somebody would claim me and the brothers didn’t want to have nothing to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: How did they know were you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: The brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: You brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: They were living right around.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Oh, you all lived nearby?</span></p> <p><span

old home what was called Stulnitza.</span> <span id="s65">We went to Sanuck (?)</span> <span id="s66">, which is, ah, just, ah, maybe half an hour with the train or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">QL Oh, it was very close?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Very close, yeah.</span> <span id="s69">If they would come and claim me that they take this kid, and they protect me, and ah, you know, make it some kind of arrangement – those officers, with those German Nazis, that’s what they were – it would have probably worked because I would have been in a protect.</span> <span id="s70">But I’m - now, just kicked – they just kicked me.</span> <span id="s71">This one, all this then wanted me that a second and – I’m one of the youngest that is still alive now in Poland.</span> <span id="s72">He didn’t want me.</span> <span id="s73">Then nobody wanted me, I’m just a – just throw me like a cattle – so, we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What happened to your sisters?</span> <span id="s75">The couldn’t claim you either?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No, sisters were all, ah – one was married and, ah, everybody was – when the war started, everybody was just being moving – that direction – she had two kids and she had mother-in-law and they lived all together at the – marriage was arranged, you know.</span> <span id="s77">So is not so, ah, it wasn’t so easy for her to, to take me.</span> <span id="s78">The second one was never married.</span> <span id="s79">She just, she tried to be a singer or something.</span> <span id="s80">She was roaming around here and there and – all over, and it’s a – I could never, I actually never – good, had a good relationship of had a handhold with her, ah, protection or any ah, nothing, nothing.</span></p>

<p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">Between my middle sister and me there is a gap of, ah, eight years, because there was, there was supposedly another – a son, a son or something that died in birth or something like that.</span> <span id="s86">And, ah, then I was born.</span> <span id="s87">And I was supposedly as, as now, as my husband has on the paper --- I was born in 1925.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: How much time elapsed between the rape and being sent off on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Ehh, not much, matter of weeks.</span> <span id="s90">But I’m, I’m, I’m still sick, you know.</span> <span id="s91">I’m, ah, ah, I think in about, ah, time when we arrived to Germany I am, ah, being now expected, because they don’t know what, what to do with

that particular time, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s103">But at, right after, right after when the, ah, my parents are shot – well, the brothers didn’t care about my parents being shot because there is no relation to them – ah, is, is his, is their uncle alright, as my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s104">That’s, that’s – but they didn’t, you know, they didn’t care for them, ah, at

going to the doctors, you know, we’re going to be examined.</span> <span id="s173">What work we should we do in there?</span> <span id="s174">Who is suited for, for kind of work?</span> <span

They give you a dirty water, yeah.</span> <span id="s192">Ah, they did, I mean, a food, a – like the train had stopped in Krakow, I remember, that was Krakow – and somebody starts throwing a crust of bread and we, you know, grabbing for the crust of bread.</span> <span id="s193">Ah, some of us ha got it but it was stale and so, and anyway, you, you eat it.</span> <span id="s194">And, ah, and then one, ah, man came around and, ah, he had asked information of he can give everybody bread.</span> <span id="s195">One Polack, I guess.</span> <span id="s196">And, ah, they did give us some bread.</span> <span id="s197">So that’s what, but they had a, a filthy water like it rained – that’s, that’s what they scooped in the little barrels.</span> <span id="s198">Ah, and that’s what they give as your drink, from, ah, like in a cowboy thing – from one ladle, one ladle to another as … no washing.</span> <span id="s199">Ah, you go to the bathroom to one corner, ah, on the straw --- and, ah, you avoid to sleep in this, if is not enough room --- ah, you might as well forget it – you got to sleep there too.</span> <span id="s200">So, that’s --- you just, you just go, that’s all.</span> <span id="s201">There’s no, no out letting, no, no – none.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: And when they took you on the trucks to Regensburg, was it along trip or a short trip?</span></p> <p><span

id="s205">Some, I don’t know, I think the truck stopped somewhere or, or they, they unloaded us – no, they unloaded the truck.</span> <span id="s206">They unloaded in some kind of area that is, ah, also like a big hall or something.</span> <span id="s207">And we stayed in there – they just packed us in --- and the next morning, ah, we have to – I didn’t even know what a count, on a – get up on a count --- you know, on a counting.</span> <span id="s208">So, they loaded – you go – or, whatever at this point.</span> <span id="s209">Get up and just --- back on the trucks.</span> <span id="s210">There was, ah, there must have been about, ah, ten trucks coming from every direction.</span> <span id="s211">But, we stopped and that every truck stopped in that …</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: In a central warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s214">So, ah, then we arrived about, mmmm – no, it was later – because, ah, by the time they load us into the truck – it wasn’t far anymore.</span> <span id="s215">But, ah, as I heard from somebody that then they did not want us to be there, only because SS, a certain, a boss wasn’t there until nine or ten o’clock, something like that, so, ah, he had to count the trucks, count how many people, and, ah, report it to the, to the big cheese there.</span> <span id="s216">So then, you, we got, ah, shaved
