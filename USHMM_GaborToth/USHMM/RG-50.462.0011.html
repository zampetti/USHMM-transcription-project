id="s18">Q:Tell me a little bit about where and when you were born, and a little bit of in for mation about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A:I was born in Paris, France.</span> <span id="s20">And we came to the United States in 1948.</span> <span id="s21">I came with my father, my mother.</span> <span id="s22">I have a sister, who is five years older and stayed in France much longer, because she was married and, you know, having a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q:When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A:1931.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q:From 1931 until the war, what was your growing up experience like?</span> <span id="s26">You lived in a big city, in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A:I lived in Paris and the experience was really, you know, growing up in a normal way, but, when you were born in France, from parents, you know, born in Russia, you are not really French.</span> <span id="s28">And you always felt it.</span> <span id="s29">It's a really, a Catholic country, and you, you're not French.</span> <span id="s30">And this was confirmed, you know, in later years.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q:Your parents were born in Russia.</span> <span id="s32">When did they come to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A:Let's see, my mother was about 17, and my father was 21.</span> <span id="s34">They came from Belz, you know, the well-known Belz, in Russia.</span> <span id="s35">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q:Did they come together, or did they meet in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A:No, they came together; they got married, and in fact they were supposed to go to South America, and they got stranded in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s38">And the Jewish organization took compassion and sort of sent them off to Paris.</span> <span id="s39">And that's where they landed.</span> <span id="s40">You know, and it was a purely accidental that I was born in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q:So they were alone, then, without other members of their family in Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A:Right.</span> <span id="s43">But the Jews in Paris were very social.</span> <span id="s44">It was a time, well my parents came in the '20's, let's see, my sister was born in 1925.</span> <span id="s45">So I think they came around 1924.</span> <span id="s46">O.K.?</span> <span id="s47">But, to come back to having no family, the support system, from what I remember, was completely social.</span> <span id="s48">This was a time when the Jews turned to a kind of so ci al ism.</span> <span id="s49">They thought that socialism would be, would welcome Jews.</span> <span id="s50">And that was, it was, they would group into cultural and political groups.</span> <span id="s51">And I remember that my parents were part of that, and the Jewish community in Paris was really very supportive, you know, people individually.</span> <span id="s52">Actually it was very segregated, because the French did not really accept Jews that much.</span> <span id="s53">So that the friends were Jewish mostly, and the life was Jewish...</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q:In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A:It was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q:In what way was the life Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A:Well let's see.</span> <span id="s58">I remember being taken to the Jewish theater to see Maurice Schwartz, you know, and being, as a child, you know, being taken to their organi zatzia, you know, to watch plays and listen to poets and listen to speeches.</span> <span id="s59">And I even remember when there was the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s60">There was a young woman on stage, you know, to raise money for the Spanish Civil War.</span> <span id="s61">Her head was shaven.</span> <span id="s62">And she started to sing all these Spanish songs.</span> <span id="s63">And everybody was all worked up about it.</span> <span id="s64">And it was very Jewish with neighbors.</span> <span id="s65">The neighbors, you know, there were sprinkles of Jewish, but they were not, the Jews then, were not that religious.</span> <span id="s66">In my neigh bor hood, in the 20Õs, part of Paris which was a blue collar neighborhood, there was one Jewish family that went to synagogue and observed religiously, kosher and all that.</span> <span id="s67">Every body else was more or less not practicing, but the Jewish identity was there thor oughly.</span> <span id="s68">There was no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:So the ethnicity was there if not the religious practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A:Completely, yeah, completely.</span> <span id="s71">And my parents spoke Jewish in the house, and when people met they spoke Jewish [Yiddish].</span> <span id="s72">I was raised with it.</span> <span id="s73">I understand it fluently.</span> <span id="s74">I spoke mostly French, but now, later on I, you know, I start to speak Jewish all of a sudden.</span> <span id="s75">You know, I understood it.</span> <span id="s76">And this is really what saved me during the war years.</span> <span id="s77">As far as my identity was concerned, I knew exactly who I was.</span> <span id="s78">And since I was raised on stories by Sholem Aleichem, and, I was raised with, am I doing O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q:You're doing terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A:And I was raised, my mother had a voice like honey, you know, sweet like honey.</span> <span id="s81">And she, after a long day's work, her way of communicating with me was to tell me stories and to sing a lot of Jewish songs, folk songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q:What was the economic situation of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A:Well, it was a constant struggle.</span> <span id="s84">The younger my father was, the more ambitious he was, and little by little, you know, life is hard.</span> <span id="s85">And my parents had a beauty parlor.</span> <span id="s86">They both worked together.</span> <span id="s87">And before the crash I heard that my father started a beau ty parlor where later on it was a large post office.</span> <span id="s88">So he was really ambitious.</span> <span id="s89">Later, my husband said that my father could have done anything if he would have had the edu cation.</span> <span id="s90">He was extremely bright.</span> <span id="s91">My mother, up to this day, writes.</span> <span id="s92">She's a writer and she reads her stories.</span> <span id="s93">She's 76 years old, and she's a fantastic writer in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s94">And she goes from group to group and reads her stories.</span> <span id="s95">So that, yes, it was a constant struggle.</span> <span id="s96">I saw my parents work very hard and lose everything a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q:What was your school life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A:That's very interesting.</span> <span id="s99">This is where I felt, I still remember to this day my first lesson in geography, that, that I had to learn.</span> <span id="s100">I had to learn by heart, and it was that the horizon line is the line that separates the sky from the earth.</span> <span id="s101">And I went around jump ing on one foot, telling this line to all my neighbors, to my parents, with much pride.</span> <span id="s102">The school was a real source of satisfaction for me.</span> <span id="s103">It also saved me during the war.</span> <span id="s104">And, you knew, once you were in school, you knew that you were Jewish, that you were not French, and that your parents were _ trang_ s, strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q:How did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A:Well, all the children, you know, would talk about their church and their activities and their parents, and your name Pertofsky was not French.</span> <span id="s107">And people would keep asking you, "Where did your parents come from?"</span> <span id="s108">It was pointed out to you, and you really felt it.</span> <span id="s109">You really felt it, because you were in a mi-, complete minority.</span> <span id="s110">There were always one or two Jewish children at the most in a classroom.</span> <span id="s111">And I remember, I have to tell you that I was very proud to be Jewish, because we always excelled.</span> <span id="s112">We always excel led.</span> <span id="s113">I don't know for what reason, but we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q:Although you felt different, and you understood that that difference was because of your Jewishness, did you have anti-Semitic experiences in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A:Well, anti-Semitic experience, we would hear about anti-Semite, you know, anti-Semitism, but the blatant anti-Semitism started with, you know, with the occupied years.</span> <span id="s116">You know, the German occupation.</span> <span id="s117">That's when it came out, you know, really blatantly.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q:All right, let's start talking about that.</span> <span id="s119">At what point did you begin to understand that something was happening in Germany that was suspicious, detrimental, worri some?</span> <span id="s120">You were very young, but you seem to remember very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A:I was eight years old when the war started, and the first anti-Semitic exper ience was in school, when I had to wear the yellow star, which said Juif.</span> <span id="s122">And I had a few Jew ish friends, that the first day, we were supposed to go into school with the yellow star, which was required of Jews, did not go to school.</span> <span id="s123">They were afraid.</span> <span id="s124">And I decided that I would go in that day with my star, because I was very proud.</span> <span id="s125">I was a proud little child.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q:Let's back track a little to the beginning of the war, until we get to the occupa tion.</span> <span id="s127">And what were your experiences as a child, and as a Jew in Paris at that time?</span> <span id="s128">How did, what happened between the point of the rumblings and the wearing of the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A:Right, O.K.</span> <span id="s130">The first experience that something was going wrong was, we had a neighbor, Monsieur Sandieu.</span> <span id="s131">They, you know, this couple had one son, and they had a knitting factory.</span> <span id="s132">And they were comparatively to my parents quite well off, O.K.?</span> <span id="s133">And then one day he was called at the police station, and he never came back.</span> <span id="s134">And then it happened to a few people in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s135">And then we heard the rumors that the Ger mans were experimenting with gas trucks, or gas something in the woods.</span> <span id="s136">This was what I remember.</span> <span id="s137">And we suddenly understood that this is probably what happened to our neighbor, Monsieur Sandieu.</span> <span id="s138">That was the first thing we heard.</span> <span id="s139">Then, you want to know before, you know, like when it's just started?</span> <span id="s140">Then we had to register, which was a great problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q:Only the Jews had to register?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A:Only the Jews had to register, which was a great problem.</span> <span id="s143">Should you regis ter?</span> <span id="s144">Should you not register?</span> <span id="s145">And you had to register at the police station which was right around the corner from where we lived?</span> <span id="s146">We lived at one end of the block, the police station was at the other end of the block.</span> <span id="s147">And since you were law abiding, and you didn't know what the consequences would be, I mean, people had to, men, Frenchmen, had to register, you know, for forced labor in Germany.</span> <span id="s148">So it was another registration.</span> <span id="s149">Who could ever imagine?</span> <span id="s150">Who could ever imagine that this was the purpose!?</span> <span id="s151">You were law abiding, and you, you know, unfortunately people registered.</span> <span id="s152">That was the second bad thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q:What period of time are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A:The period of time to me I can't, you know, I can't really...</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q:Before, was this before or after the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A:No, that was after the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q:After the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A:Everything after the occupation.</span> <span id="s159">The Germans are the ones that experimented with gas chamber.</span> <span id="s160">It's not the French, although the French helped completely to take the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q:At this period of time, what were the relationships with Christian neighbors or Christian children in school?</span> <span id="s162">How did they react to the registration and the wearing of the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A:The reaction was just what people are.</span> <span id="s164">The ones that didn't like Jews couldn't have cared less, and thought, you know, "It's just another thing that the Germans are requesting."</span> <span id="s165">The ones that had human conscience had it then.</span> <span id="s166">It was just a problem, and it turned out that later the Jews that did not register were safe, if they could find a hiding place or if they could leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q:Is there a lesson in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A:There's a complete lesson, complete lesson.</span> <span id="s169">And it's very interesting but I can comment about GŸ nter Grass, the German author, who on the occasion of the commem ora tion, whatever you want to call it, you know, of Hitler coming into power, was asked to write a, you know, for one of the major newspapers in Germany.</span> <span id="s170">And he said that because of the German past, historical past, especially Germans have to learn to rebel and protest on an individual level.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q:Mmm.</span> <span id="s172">What was your life like as a child during that period of time of going to school, having registered, wearing the yellow star?</span> <span id="s173">What was your life like, and that of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A:Well, as I had mentioned, because there are some things that I remember vividly that were major.</span> <span id="s175">And, you have to bear with me [weeping].</span> <span id="s176">I cry today; I knew I would.</span> <span id="s177">There is no way that the sorrow and, you see, it's very vivid.</span> <span id="s178">And it, I have to cry, because I didn't cry then.</span> <span id="s179">I went to school that day with the yellow star.</span> <span id="s180">And there was a silence, the silence in the school yard where I used to run and play.</span> <span id="s181">You know, I was very active there?</span> <span id="s182">I was a happy child.</span> <span id="s183">And I walked into the yard, you know.</span> <span id="s184">And there was a silence that formed, that started, and a circle that was around me, with a space around me.</span> <span id="s185">And all the children were looking at me with the star.</span> <span id="s186">I was the only one that had the courage to go in there and say, "Yes, this is what I am.</span> <span id="s187">Look, I had a star.</span> <span id="s188">So what?"</span> <span id="s189">I was always stubborn about my rights.</span> <span id="s190">So I felt, "O.K. I have the star.</span> <span id="s191">So I have the star.</span> <span id="s192">I go in and I'm still the same person."</span> <span id="s193">And I was defiant.</span> <span id="s194">My defiance, which kept me going during the years, started.</span> <span id="s195">And then, the, the silence was interrupted by someone screaming out, "Sal Juif."</span> <span id="s196">Dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s197">And then there was what I, you know, I couldn't analyze anything but probably from children who understand probably a lot of embarrassment.</span> <span id="s198">And little by little, you know, the show was over, this, sort of, they were stunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q:You see that children...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A:And, and this, and they started to play again.</span> <span id="s201">Then I went to the director of the school, and I, to tell her about the incident.</span> <span id="s202">That I was not, you know, and anyway, what they had called me, that it was just Jewish.</span> <span id="s203">And she took me on her lap, and she cried.</span> <span id="s204">And she hugged me.</span> <span id="s205">And she said, "As far as I'm concerned, you are my little Sarah."</span> <span id="s206">This was my name, Sarah.</span> <span id="s207">"And, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s208">These are difficult times, but, continue to study well like you did.</span> <span id="s209">That's the most important thing.</span> <span id="s210">And don't pay attention."</span> <span id="s211">That was the first incident.</span> <span id="s212">And, you know, it was very [vexing?]</span> <span id="s213">to be, to stand there, and be called as a different kind of human being, but to be a human being.</span> <span id="s214">And little by little, things happened and got worse.</span> <span id="s215">My father's business was closed when they started to take Jews systematically.</span> <span id="s216">We thought that the people were going to work cam-, work places.</span> <span id="s217">We never imagined that they were going to their deaths.</span> <span id="s218">People don't want to face death anyway.</span> <span id="s219">Why would they believe that?</span> <span id="s220">Why would they believe such an enormous crime?</span> <span id="s221">And whoever says that Jews went like sheep, they have absolutely no understanding of the conditions.</span> <span id="s222">The Jews would be pick ed up during the night, when they were dazed by sleep.</span> <span id="s223">It was usually, you know, three, four o'clock in the morning, when the world was asleep, which they were anyway.</span> <span id="s224">And, they were surrounded by French police, and the Gestapo, with dogs and guns.</span> <span id="s225">And many times, you know, they didn't want to sep-, families didn't want to separate.</span> <span id="s226">Sometimes they, we saw the separations right there and then, with the busesÑwomen together, children together.</span> <span id="s227">I saw women handing out their babies through the window.</span> <span id="s228">And to say that Jews went like sheep, people just don't understand what a war is.</span> <span id="s229">They don't under stand the, you know, the brutality of war.</span> <span id="s230">I mean, you're just a, you know, a normal person going about in a normal life.</span> <span id="s231">And you don't understand these, the beast, you know, that it could be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q:What happened to your family after your father's business was closed down?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A:Well, what happened, when it, I remember when it was first, that my parents closed, you know, the Germans closed and they put a sealed wax on the doors.</span> <span id="s234">And they would check, if you please, if that sealed wax would be broken.</span> <span id="s235">When things started to be bad, my father joined the underground.</span> <span id="s236">He went in the country.</span> <span id="s237">He was working on farms in order to make a little bit of a living.</span> <span id="s238">And after a while he worked with the Jewish partisansÑFrench Jewish partisans, because they didn't want, the French, the French partisans did not want to go with the, to be with the French Jewish partisans.</span> <span id="s239">That's where he was.</span> <span id="s240">I was told he was working on the farm.</span> <span id="s241">I don't know.</span> <span id="s242">Once in a while, when I was home, which was not very often, you know, he would bring some food.</span> <span id="s243">My mother was taken in for three monthsÑwhen they really started to take JewsÑby neighbors.</span> <span id="s244">Like I said, the ones that had a conscience before, had it.</span> <span id="s245">You know, that's the way they were.</span> <span id="s246">They hid her.</span> <span id="s247">They just hide her in their house.</span> <span id="s248">My sister was older, and she was in a children's home for a while.</span> <span id="s249">I was sent off and on different places.</span> <span id="s250">And if you want to know, I'll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A:I was sent, first I was sent, there was a secret organizationsÑthe Jewish ScoutsÑwent underground, the French Jewish Boy Scouts [Eclaireurs IsraJlites de France].</span> <span id="s253">You know, Boy Scouts, the Jew ish.</span> <span id="s254">They went underground.</span> <span id="s255">And they had a network to save Jewish children and to place them in French farms.</span> <span id="s256">And I did child labor when I was ten years old or even younger.</span> <span id="s257">And it really started to get bad.</span> <span id="s258">And I remember that I met, I was sent with five, we were a group of five or six children.</span> <span id="s259">We didn't know where we were sent.</span> <span id="s260">My parents didn't know where we were sent.</span> <span id="s261">It turned out in Nor mandy.</span> <span id="s262">And when the train...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q:Who was responsible for the sending?</span> <span id="s264">The Jew-, the Scouts' organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A:Yes, Jewish Scouts.</span> <span id="s266">They went underground.</span> <span id="s267">We were sent anyway to work on farms and also to be hidden.</span> <span id="s268">We didn't know exactly where.</span> <span id="s269">But during that train trip, again, the train stopped, and the Gestapo was looking for someone.</span> <span id="s270">And we thought for sure, we didn't know, O.K., they are looking for us.</span> <span id="s271">And as they were looking fev er ish ly in that train, probably for some resistance, French resistance, you know, we thought they were looking for us, that that was the end.</span> <span id="s272">And that was the first time I blanked out.</span> <span id="s273">You know I really, I fell on my knees.</span> <span id="s274">I lost my body weight or whatever, when I, sort of fainted.</span> <span id="s275">You know.</span> <span id="s276">But there were other things that happened before that.</span> <span id="s277">The reason that we were all going in a different direction was that we, of course, noticed that they would take Jews systematically, the ones that were originally born in Russia, or the ones that were originally born in Poland.</span> <span id="s278">It was systematic.</span> <span id="s279">The last Jews that they took were the French Jews.</span> <span id="s280">And we were considered French Jews, my sister and I.</span> <span id="s281">We were born in France.</span> <span id="s282">And because of that, my parents, who were born in Russia, were not taken right away.</span> <span id="s283">But my parents noticed, you know, the pattern.</span> <span id="s284">And after my aunt, uncle, and cousin were taken, cousins were taken away, my father said, "You know you don't stay.</span> <span id="s285">You know, it's stupid to stay in your apartment.</span> <span id="s286">They'll come knocking on the door and take us.</span> <span id="s287">Let's run in different directions.</span> <span id="s288">If they catch us they'll catch us one at a time, but we're going to run.</span> <span id="s289">We're not going to sit."</span> <span id="s290">And that's why we were all separated off and on.</span> <span id="s291">And ap-, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s292">It saved us.</span> <span id="s293">We were just lucky, in the end, that we were not caught while we were running, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q:How did you find each other again?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A:Well, with me, it's like, when I was in Normandy, what happened, after a while, it was sort of a remote village.</span> <span id="s296">And after a while you had, you know, ration tickets and all that.</span> <span id="s297">And there was a stamp, Juif, on the ration card.</span> <span id="s298">And people would start to ask questions.</span> <span id="s299">So, one time when I was in the fields at work, when I came back, someone said that the gendarme, the police, came to ask questions about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q:And you were how old at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A:Ten.</span> <span id="s302">So that, right away I sent a letter to my mother, who was in Fra-, in Paris.</span> <span id="s303">And immediately there was like a phone call, you know, at the grocery store, that, you know, "Put Sarah back on the train right away."</span> <span id="s304">And that's it.</span> <span id="s305">So, I understand in this particular place that the Gestapo came to pick me up two weeks later.</span> <span id="s306">I was gone.</span> <span id="s307">But we were told that some of the children that were part of that trip with me were taken.</span> <span id="s308">So they would take us wherever they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q:Tell me about the changing of your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A:Well, I was very active.</span> <span id="s311">I used to, you know, my parents worked, so I would play in the street a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A:Since then I heard the term, "Street Rat".</span> <span id="s314">I wasn't exactly a rat, but I certainly, you know, lived in the streets.</span> <span id="s315">I loved, you know, playing, playing, playing.</span> <span id="s316">And my parents were working, so they always had to call me and look for me like for dinner and lunch, you know.</span> <span id="s317">And at one point, my parents had come home.</span> <span id="s318">That was at the beginning, you know, the German occupation and all that, and their store was still openÑit didn't take too long though to have it closed.</span> <span id="s319">And they said, "O.K.</span> <span id="s320">We can't call you 'Sarah' all the time.</span> <span id="s321">It's, you know, and, we're Jewish, so, which name do you want, Suzanne or Simone?"</span> <span id="s322">And I think with a, you know, I remember I didn't think and maybe they said Suzanne last or whatever the child picks up.</span> <span id="s323">I said, "All right, Suzanne," you know.</span> <span id="s324">And then they would call me "Suzanne" I didn't know who they were calling.</span> <span id="s325">And I didn't fix the situation.</span> <span id="s326">That's why my name was changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q:So that when they called you, if there was anyone listening, the name "Sarah" would not be heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q:Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A:And on one of those farms I was also, I went to a Convent school.</span> <span id="s331">That was an experience.</span> <span id="s332">That was one of the most painful experiences, among all the experiences, because I felt that I could not reveal my identity.</span> <span id="s333">And I felt like I was a liar.</span> <span id="s334">And apparent ly I wasn't a very good liar.</span> <span id="s335">And in order to continue, you know, being safe, I had to pretend not being Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q:So that going to the Catholic school was a subterfuge.</span> <span id="s337">The people in the school were not taking in Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q:I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A:So I really had to completely cover up.</span> <span id="s341">And I was absolutely terrified.</span> <span id="s342">At the beginning I was getting as much information as possible.</span> <span id="s343">And I didn't know the Catechism.</span> <span id="s344">And the first timeÑI had to go to confessionÑand the first time I went to con fession, it's sort of a tragic comedy.</span> <span id="s345">I was afraid when I would go into the confessional that I would behave in such a way that it would reveal that I was a phony, a phony Catholic.</span> <span id="s346">And I was reading the Catechism.</span> <span id="s347">I was trying to get information as much as possible.</span> <span id="s348">And then, I had a real problem.</span> <span id="s349">I had to tell my sins.</span> <span id="s350">And goodness know, I felt like I hadn't done anything.</span> <span id="s351">But my only thing was to hide I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s352">I was lying.</span> <span id="s353">That's a thing, to l-, it's sin to lie.</span> <span id="s354">But, yet it wasn't a sin, you know?</span> <span id="s355">So I was looking.</span> <span id="s356">It was, I don't know what I was doing, but I was looking for an answer.</span> <span id="s357">I was tormented by that.</span> <span id="s358">To go into the confessional, number one, not to say that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s359">Number two, to lie that I had sinned, because I wasn't a sinner!</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q:And you were about ten, eleven at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s362">And my parents had raised me with a lot of love, and they would never spank me or anything, you know.</span> <span id="s363">And I, I just, I don't think I lied.</span> <span id="s364">I didn't sin.</span> <span id="s365">I was a child.</span> <span id="s366">I didn't sin.</span> <span id="s367">So, lo and behold, at the end of the Catechism, they have a list of sins.</span> <span id="s368">And I think I read the list, I remember, with great speed, and I'm trying to find like a hungry soul, you know?</span> <span id="s369">And I became more and more interested, ahh, I would find something appropriate.</span> <span id="s370">And there was a very involved sin, something I had listened to a conversation against the Catholic religion.</span> <span id="s371">And to be silent was to take part, to take active part by being silent.</span> <span id="s372">How ironical.</span> <span id="s373">I thought, "Gees, you know the way things are now, if anyone, you know, that's- Tape 1 of 1, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A:Something against the Catholic religion, or, here I was listening to the Catholic religion, what it was all about.</span> <span id="s375">I certainly would be silent.</span> <span id="s376">So that's a good sin.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q:So that's the one you chose.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A:I did.</span> <span id="s379">I wouldn't lie, you know.</span> <span id="s380">At least, you know, I would be safe saying something sincere.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q:Was anyone instructing you among the Jewish Scouts at this time how to behave in all of these circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s383">Nothing.</span> <span id="s384">We were just sent out.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q:Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A:Where did we live?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q:Before you went to, you lived, did you live in the Convent school?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q:You lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A:Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q:How about when you worked on the farms?</span> <span id="s392">Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A:Well I lived on the farm, but you know it was like you were not accepted.</span> <span id="s394">At least where I was, I was not accepted.</span> <span id="s395">And a few times the conditions were like, you know, being a slave.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q:Were these private farms, and you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q:Sort of hired out to work there as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s400">Yes.</span> <span id="s401">I did child labor.</span> <span id="s402">I mean I worked hard?</span> <span id="s403">I worked in fields from like, you know, early morning, till the sun would go down.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q:So you lived on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q:Wherever you worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A:Also, I remember on one of the places, on Sunday you had to go to church, you know, and I had too many duties to do before I would go to church.</span> <span id="s408">And you wore these high shoes because it was muddy, you know, on the farms.</span> <span id="s409">When you went to church you were supposed to dress up, you know, and all that.</span> <span id="s410">I wasn't given the time to do that.</span> <span id="s411">So, you, I couldn't go.</span> <span id="s412">I wasn't, it would have been a shameful thing to go with muddy shoes.</span> <span id="s413">And here, from coming from a loving home where my parents didn't have much but always very conscious of cleanliness and, you know, dignity about yourself, I would slap on, one time I slapped on black polish on top of the mud.</span> <span id="s414">And I ran through the snow to the church, because I was late.</span> <span id="s415">And I was in the choral group at church, too, you know, cause I had a nice singing voice.</span> <span id="s416">And it was a day I'll never forget where it was the holy day.</span> <span id="s417">They were, about the virgin Mary.</span> <span id="s418">And as I walked in the priest was preaching about, you know, the virgin Mary being as white as the snow.</span> <span id="s419">And real quick I said, "Gees, it's not really white, the snow.</span> <span id="s420">I just stepped into it and I put black polish on the mud, you know, on the shoes.</span> <span id="s421">What's he talking about?"</span> <span id="s422">Then I would sit in church, and I would think, "I wonder what Pa-paw would think about that?</span> <span id="s423">I wonder what Ma-maw would think about that?"</span> <span id="s424">I always questioned, you know, some of the values of the Catholic church.</span> <span id="s425">It made a Jew, a real Jew out of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q:Were you on these, in these situations alone, or were there other hidden child ren with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A:No, I was all alone.</span> <span id="s428">There was no communication.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q:So that you had to become incorporated in some way into the life of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A:Well, this is where, you know, food was never warm to eat.</span> <span id="s431">It was like, you know, all the warmth and love, it was gone [weeping].</span> <span id="s432">You were a perfect stranger.</span> <span id="s433">And you had to be attuned to what was going on, to who you were dealing with.</span> <span id="s434">Early in life I learned that you had to listen, that you had to look where you were, who you were talking to.</span> <span id="s435">You had to be gracious no matter what the, you know, no matter what the hardships.</span> <span id="s436">You are not what you are.</span> <span id="s437">You had no right to be a human being.</span> <span id="s438">And I learned very early to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q:That's why you're here.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A:Yes, but, I learned later on in life, once in the States, once being free, you know, life is what it is.</span> <span id="s441">It's not always kind to you, even under the best conditions.</span> <span id="s442">And I had to learn not to survive the hardships of life any more.</span> <span id="s443">I wa-, life is not meant to survive, it's meant to live.</span> <span id="s444">And that's what I learned.</span> <span id="s445">But then, let me tell you, go back.</span> <span id="s446">Let me go back.</span> <span id="s447">Because the second time that I blanked out, was when we were already, you see, back and forth we would come back to Paris and go somewhere else.</span> <span id="s448">And then when the time came where you, there was no place to run, when everybody was scared, where everybody was poor and hungryÑthat's what happens during a warÑit's not something on television.</span> <span id="s449">It's very real.</span> <span id="s450">So, we made a secret entrance in the beauty parlor, which was boarded up.</span> <span id="s451">The secret entrance was under the stairs.</span> <span id="s452">The only persons that knew we were there was our concierge.</span> <span id="s453">You know, my parents lived in that apartment house, it was many, many years.</span> <span id="s454">And she took in a few pieces of furnitures.</span> <span id="s455">And my father made like a little house out of, advertisements, cardboard advertisements, inside.</span> <span id="s456">And we had a tiny little candle in there.</span> <span id="s457">And that's where we lived.</span> <span id="s458">We slept there.</span> <span id="s459">We did everything human beings, you know, who function, do there.</span> <span id="s460">My father got a job at a steel factory through the foreman.</span> <span id="s461">There was a very strong network of resistance in the steel factory, because it was German, of course.</span> <span id="s462">And he used to be a former client.</span> <span id="s463">I understand there were a few Jews in that steel factory, and every week the resistance, you know, workers that worked there would collect money for people like my father, just so we could subsist.</span> <span id="s464">My father would leave when it was dark, and he would come back when it was dark.</span> <span id="s465">And that's how we lived.</span> <span id="s466">And then he befriended an Algerian, who every month, ÒShaoush,Ó who was a lonely man.</span> <span id="s467">He was the only visitor we had besides the concierge and Shaoush.</span> <span id="s468">He would put his life at stake to change our ration cards each week.</span> <span id="s469">And somehow, just pure luck, they didn't ask what Shaoush was doing with those ration cards, strangely enough.</span> <span id="s470">And, when they started to take Romanian Jews, my uncle was of Romanian origin, because we were at one end of the block and the police station was at the other end, whenever they took Jews, we were the first ones to know it.</span> <span id="s471">We could hear the cries.</span> <span id="s472">We could see the buses.</span> <span id="s473">That's when, if I was there, or my sister was there, we would run from one hiding place to another, to let people know that they were taking Jews.</span> <span id="s474">And when they took Romanian Jews, I ran to, [weeping] we didn't know who they were taking, but I would alert my, you know, my family always, first.</span> <span id="s475">And they stayed in their apartment.</span> <span id="s476">They didn't hide like we did.</span> <span id="s477">So I would run there first to, and then people would leave their place of living and they would hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s478">Goodness knows where they would hide.</span> <span id="s479">And I got there too late.</span> <span id="s480">I was told [weeping] that they had been taken away a few minutes ago, and that's when I blanked out again.</span> <span id="s481">I didn't want to live when this would happen.</span> <span id="s482">Then, I ran back.</span> <span id="s483">It would take them a few hours, and I saw my aunt on a bus.</span> <span id="s484">She didn't see me.</span> <span id="s485">She was crying.</span> <span id="s486">My cousin was 19 years old.</span> <span id="s487">They separated them right there and then.</span> <span id="s488">Later on my cousin, who was, you know, n____; they had two sons.</span> <span id="s489">He was married.</span> <span id="s490">His, it was one of those young romances, you know, my cousin.</span> <span id="s491">He was married.</span> <span id="s492">He had a wife, not really, a common law wife when he was like 18.</span> <span id="s493">He fathered a child, you know?</span> <span id="s494">Goodness knows she had no idea the child, that she would go through that young woman.</span> <span id="s495">You know, she was not raised as a practicing Catholic.</span> <span id="s496">She suffered like a Jew.</span> <span id="s497">Now he was taken also eventually.</span> <span id="s498">During the three months we would hear they took the Jews to Drancy.</span> <span id="s499">They were like...big buildings maybe old factories.</span> <span id="s500">It was near Paris.</span> <span id="s501">And we heard that my cousin George was taken to Drancy.</span> <span id="s502">So we would try, just any sign of life, you know?</span> <span id="s503">And one Sunday we went to Drancy.</span> <span id="s504">It was just so incongruous, you know, all these Jews that were in danger would go on Sunday to see if they could see it, from a distance, they had walls and barbed wires.</span> <span id="s505">But, you know, to see a familiar face.</span> <span id="s506">You couldn't see.</span> <span id="s507">It was too far.</span> <span id="s508">And unfortunately, the Sunday that we went to see if we could see George, they painted all the windows blue, so we couldn't even see then.</span> <span id="s509">And the Gestapo was like watching, you know, all this.</span> <span id="s510">Once in a while we would hear that someone with a stick would write messages in the air, you know, and that the Gestapo got a hold of the person.</span> <span id="s511">Anyway, my cousin George came home from Drancy!</span> <span id="s512">He had the beginning of cholera.</span> <span id="s513">He came home after three months in Drancy!</span> <span id="s514">He was there!</span> <span id="s515">I guess, by some kind of fate, you know, he wasn't sent to a camp.</span> <span id="s516">And he was completely changed, completely changed.</span> <span id="s517">He came home like a skeleton.</span> <span id="s518">You couldn't recognize him, and he had the beginning of cholera.</span> <span id="s519">They had an epidemic of cholera.</span> <span id="s520">And little by little he volunteered once in a whileÑit's like, he was like a dead man, but aliveÑinforma tion.</span> <span id="s521">They ate a live, they killed a live dog, you know, to have fun, to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q:What happened at the end of the war?</span> <span id="s523">How did your family, how were they together?</span> <span id="s524">What were they able to resurrect of their lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A:We came back, and we lived in this store, like I told you, off and on.</span> <span id="s526">There was no place to run.</span> <span id="s527">There was no where to go.</span> <span id="s528">This, the story, you know, the life of Anna Frank, is a classic story.</span> <span id="s529">We hid, in the store.</span> <span id="s530">And then my father worked in that factory.</span> <span id="s531">My mother would knit, you know, gloves and things, and the concierge would sell them for her.</span> <span id="s532">And I would read.</span> <span id="s533">It saved me.</span> <span id="s534">You know, it saved me.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q:Where did you get books?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A:We had books.</span> <span id="s537">We just had books in the house.</span> <span id="s538">The apartment was upstairs.</span> <span id="s539">Once in a while my mother would run upstairs to make something hot, you know?</span> <span id="s540">And, I can't tell you, but I had, you know, my little story books.</span> <span id="s541">And then one morning we heard voices around four or five o'clock in the morning, right smack in front of the store.</span> <span id="s542">And, and it was the police.</span> <span id="s543">They were gathering together, because they, the French police, after helping to take the Jews, after helping the Gestapo, became glorified resistance.</span> <span id="s544">They joined the underground resistance to liberate, help them liberate Paris from the Germans.</span> <span id="s545">You know after they helped so well to take women, children, you know?</span> <span id="s546">I mean, they did, nobody quit their job.</span> <span id="s547">They were helpful.</span> <span id="s548">Let me tell you, one time I went by the police station at the beginning when the st-, when I was wearing the star.</span> <span id="s549">And one corner was not sown, you know, it was loose.</span> <span id="s550">And the policeman said, "Va dire a ta mere, il faut coudre _ a (Go tell your mother to sew it.)</span> <span id="s551">."</span> <span id="s552">That was just business.</span> <span id="s553">They helped.</span> <span id="s554">The French police helped.</span> <span id="s555">The French people helped.</span> <span id="s556">You know, they helped the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s557">They did a thorough, good job to help take the children.</span> <span id="s558">They did a good job.</span> <span id="s559">So anyway we heard these voices, and that the Americans, you know, had landed in Normandy, and that the end was near.</span> <span id="s560">We couldn't believe it!</span> <span id="s561">We, we were hiding together.</span> <span id="s562">We were waiting to be discovered.</span> <span id="s563">And by then my parents decided if we had any time left to live, we should be together.</span> <span id="s564">And that's it.</span> <span id="s565">That's why we were together, because we couldn't run any more.</span> <span id="s566">You know?</span> <span id="s567">And it had its after effect.</span> <span id="s568">I mean, we went back into the apartment.</span> <span id="s569">The first thing I did was to go outside and build barricades with everybody, to catch every German and collaborator as possibleÑto catch every guilty person.</span> <span id="s570">We just wanted to block them and catch them.</span> <span id="s571">That's all.</span> <span id="s572">And I saw the women that had collaborated, with their head shaven, you know?</span> <span id="s573">I also saw the resistance.</span> <span id="s574">They came, the Gesta po collaborator called the Gestapo headquarters, and they came with two tanks at the police station.</span> <span id="s575">By then we were watching upstairs in the apartment.</span> <span id="s576">They were too busy to take Jews is why they didn't take Jews any more.</span> <span id="s577">And we remember them yelling out, you know, "Come out."</span> <span id="s578">Supposedly there was a meeting of the police and the resistance.</span> <span id="s579">But there was a movie house across the street.</span> <span id="s580">That's where they had the meeting, not in the police station.</span> <span id="s581">And with the, you know, the, what do you call those...</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q:Megaphones.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A:Yes, "You come out, otherwise we blow up this police station."</span> <span id="s584">And then they turned around, they got the information that the meeting was taking place in the movie house across the street.</span> <span id="s585">And I remember five men came out with their hands up.</span> <span id="s586">And they had some of them had the FFI [Forces Fran_ aises de lÕInterieur], you know, tri-color, you know, resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q:Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A:No, no, it's when they searched them.</span> <span id="s589">I remember seeing one of these coming out of the pocket, because they wore them while they were trying to catch every German and blow up things.</span> <span id="s590">And they shot them.</span> <span id="s591">They shot them.</span> <span id="s592">All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q:Did you know immediately after the war that you wanted to leave France?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A:Well, after the war we were like stunned, you know?</span> <span id="s595">I think my father looked gaunt and old.</span> <span id="s596">We had orange crates, whatever.</span> <span id="s597">You know, we didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s598">And it was cold.</span> <span id="s599">We had no means to heat the apartment.</span> <span id="s600">And there was a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s601">And then I, and this towering American soldier came in.</span> <span id="s602">And he said, [weeping] "I'm your cousin."</span> <span id="s603">And we knew we had family that was alive in this country, and that's why we came.</span> <span id="s604">The first thing he did was to take his army jacket, put that on my sister, because she was like blue from cold.</span> <span id="s605">And we had loved ones again.</span> <span id="s606">And that's why we came.</span> <span id="s607">We waited two years.</span> <span id="s608">There was a quota.</span> <span id="s609">My father had two brothers and a sister here, and my mother had two brothers here.</span> <span id="s610">And we, we came here because there was family here.</span> <span id="s611">But, you know what?</span> <span id="s612">It was very strange.</span> <span id="s613">I never...you know, I was very happy to have the family but, out of loyalty, that's where it's a kind of illness to have survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s614">Out of love for my family that was taken, that their life was snapped away, you know?</span> <span id="s615">Out of love to their memory, I soon, I realized years later that I never could give my love to the family here.</span> <span id="s616">It was the same thing with friends.</span> <span id="s617">The friends that, my play matesÑMarguerite, Michelle, that were taken away, my little Jewish playmatesÑI could not make friends.</span> <span id="s618">I didn't want friends.</span> <span id="s619">Up to these days, I am very reluctant to make friends.</span> <span id="s620">It's an illness to have gone through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s621">And I really understand that, you know?</span> <span id="s622">It stays with you.</span> <span id="s623">There are flashes that come, every day.</span> <span id="s624">And I call them my prayers.</span> <span id="s625">I call them my prayers, because when you are busy surviving, and running, you didn't realize what, what was really happening.</span> <span id="s626">And you never mourned.</span> <span id="s627">You never really, like, any human being, you know, reflected.</span> <span id="s628">It's later that you did that.</span> <span id="s629">And I think, I swear to you, I think I'm a very wholesome person.</span> <span id="s630">You know I work, I have a pro fes sion in the arts that I, that is very consuming, that I really enjoy and I do very well.</span> <span id="s631">But, this side of me is another side.</span> <span id="s632">I am forever mourning.</span> <span id="s633">And you know, I don't know what that word means, forget for forgiving.</span> <span id="s634">What is that word?</span> <span id="s635">I don't want vengeance.</span> <span id="s636">I don't think so.</span> <span id="s637">I don't want vengeance, because if you live today, and you have that in your heart, it's too destructive.</span> <span id="s638">Vengeance is very destruc tive.</span> <span id="s639">But when someone like Klaus Barbie is caught, I'm glad they catch him.</span> <span id="s640">And I think that they should not be free.</span> <span id="s641">I don't believe in death sentence.</span> <span id="s642">I don't believe in anyone dying.</span> <span id="s643">And I couldn't care less by now if Klaus Barbie lives or dies.</span> <span id="s644">He did it already.</span> <span id="s645">It's not, if it could bring anybody back to life, you know?</span> <span id="s646">That would be, you know, O.K. Go ahead, do anything you want to him.</span> <span id="s647">It's not going to do anything.</span> <span id="s648">The only thing, it brings up is that this country, the United States, protected a war criminalÑused him, and disregarded his crimes.</span> <span id="s649">So that when they catch a war criminal, I am glad.</span> <span id="s650">I'm not glad, but I feel partly justice is continuing.</span> <span id="s651">And this has to be done.</span> <span id="s652">It has to continue, just throw them in a hole somewhere the rest of their life, because they took other people's lives.</span> <span id="s653">So, you know, you're marked.</span> <span id="s654">My children tell me, "Mother, you know, we read about being exorcised, you know, like taking, can't this be done for you?</span> <span id="s655">Can this be done for you?</span> <span id="s656">You're so wonderful, you're so full of life.</span> <span id="s657">You have such intelligence.</span> <span id="s658">You have such intellect.</span> <span id="s659">But this is the darkest side of you.</span> <span id="s660">We don't enjoy this in you.</span> <span id="s661">Could this be taken care of?"</span> <span id="s662">And I tell them it's not possible.</span> <span id="s663">First of all, the memory is a responsibility.</span> <span id="s664">Life is a responsibility.</span> <span id="s665">I have the duty to, to live fully and not waste my life.</span> <span id="s666">That's my life today.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Drancy was a camp in a large unfinished apartment building.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">FFI - one of the resistance groups which united with other French resistance groups to liberate Paris on August 26, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">USHMM Archives, RG-50.462*0024 page \* arabic22 From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive.</span></p></body></html>
