stayed at home.</span> <span id="s37">She looked after the children and her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s39">Extended family, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My grandparents on my mother’s side were alive.</span> <span id="s41">My grandparents on my father’s side, as far as I remember, were no longer alive when I

from my father’s side.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: How many siblings did he have?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: My father had a brother who had two children, and my -- my mother had a brother

Zallinger.</span> <span id="s54">Actually, an aunt also survived in Berlin.</span> <span id="s55">She was marri -- she was no -- not Jewish.</span> <span id="s56">She was married to my mother’s brother, and she survived because she wasn't Jewish.</span> <span id="s57">And her two daughters also survived in Berlin, first cousins.</span> <span id="s58">One of them lives in San Diego at the moment, the other passed away some time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: But the grandparents on your mother’s side, they were Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Yes, I would think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Did you have a close relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: They died when I was fairly young, sa -- maybe even before I went to school, so I remember very, very little of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: What language was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Any other languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Did you learn another language at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Oh yes, I went to a Jewish school in Berlin, and from day one we were taught two foreign languages, Hebrew and English, and in fact we were forbidden to speak a word of German during those lessons, was total immersion lesson.</span> <span id="s69">And after two or three years, I was fi -- reasonably fluent in both Hebrew and English.</span> <span id="s70">So that’s the time to teach children foreign languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you maintain those languages, Hebrew --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: To a certain extent.</span> <span id="s73">I mean, I can still understand simple Hebrew, and English of course, I -- I knew when I came here.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Tell me about your Jewish day school.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I went to a number of Jewish day schools in Berlin.</span> <span id="s76">The Jewish schools in Berlin were just fantastic, when I compare them with the day schools in so -- in -- non-Jewish day schools in Germany.</span> <span id="s77">As the war -- o-or as Hitler’s power progressed, more and more Jewish boys and girls who originally went to non-Jewish schools in Germany were expelled from those schools, and wer -- had to come to our school, they were a year or two behind us.</span> <span id="s78">The standard of education in the Jewish schools in Berlin was just fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What was the name of your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Oh, my first school was in the August Strasse, then I went to the Kaiser Strasse, then I went to the Gross Hamburger Strasse.</span> <span id="s81">Schools closed, or they bombed.</span> <span id="s82">So I went to three different schools in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: And your siblings attended the same school?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Were they close to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: Well, my sister was seven when -- she was born in ’35, so she didn’t go to school at all.</span> <span id="s87">She was four when the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Were they close to your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, oh yes, walking distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Your neighborhood, where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I lived in a neighborhood that wasn’t -- you wouldn’t call it ex -- exactly a Jewish neighborhood, but there were a sprinkling of Jews, but most of them, of course, were non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: So you [indecipherable] non-Jewish neighbors?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you have relationships with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Not really, I think ma -- almost all of my friends were Jewish, and I had no non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s96">And I doubt whether my parents had any non-Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s98">What were your hobbies as a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: I think I was just a good student.</span> <span id="s100">I -- I loved school.</span> <span id="s101">Holidays were something that I abhorred.</span> <span id="s102">And I don’t really have -- don’t recall any hobbies I had in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Did you belong to a youth movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Were there youth movements that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Oh yes, there was Maccabee, there was Ha-Koah, there were seven Zionist organizations.</span> <span id="s107">I don’t think I belonged to any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s109">What about your parents, were they involved [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: They were involved in the synagogue and I was -- and I sang as a boy in the choir of the biggest synagogue in Berlin, located in the Oranienburger Strasse.</span> <span id="s111">It’s a very famous synagogue with its golden dome, and I sang there as a choirboy.</span> <span id="s112">So I went to all the services.</span> <span id="s113">My parents didn’t go, only went to the services on the high holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: And you went every week?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yeah, because I was in the choir.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: How did you get involved in that?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I think they looked for choir boys, the -- the choir looked for boys who were interested in singing, who were reasonably musical in the Jewish schools, and I volunteered.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: So [indecipherable] Friday night and --</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Friday night, Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s120">We often sang at weddings, funerals occasionally.</span> <span id="s121">I have very fond memories of my activity as a choir boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s123">Did you play an instrument as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I played the recorder and the mouth organ, but very badly, both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Uh-huh, okay.</span> <span id="s126">What was the level of religion in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I don’t know how you would describe it.</span> <span id="s128">Probably similar to the liberals here, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s129">I thi --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: The celebration of festivals [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s132">Well, being in a Jewish school we celebrated Purim, Sukkot, Pesach, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s134">Your family, however, belonged to an Orthodox synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, my family also belonged to that synagogue in the Oranienburger Strasse which wasn’t exactly -- which wasn't Orthodox at all, nor was it Liberal.</span> <span id="s136">It’s probably, if you compare it to a synagogue in Melbourne, it’s probably like Charnwood Grove, or Toorak Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s138">What -- what can you remember about any anti-Semitic incidences?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: I remember a lot of them, I mean we were very often beaten up on walks on our way to school or from school by Hitler youth.</span> <span id="s140">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What -- what -- what -- we’re talking after 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: After 1933, between ’33 and ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Who’s we?</span> <span id="s144">A: Well, school kids, friends of mine, when we walked home from school, or when we walked to school, very often there were mobs of Hitler youth and they just beat us up, and nobody came to our rescue.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: How badly beaten?</span> <span id="s146">Can you give me some idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: I don’t think we had injuries, but they were painful.</span> <span id="s148">We ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you fight back?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Always that we were outnumbered at all times, and none of the bystanders came to our help.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How often did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Maybe once or twice a month.</span> <span id="s153">I mean, we looked out for them, and if we saw any Hitler youths in the neighborhood, tried to avoid them, but it wasn’t always possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: How were they identified as Hitler youth?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: Oh, they had the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How old would these boys have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Probably our age, maybe a little bit older, 10 - 11 - 12.</span> <span id="s158">They just did it for fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: When you say you were outnumbered, what sort of numbers were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well very often I walked to school with two friends, and very often there was a dozen of them.</span> <span id="s161">So we had very little hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Did you report them to anybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: We reported to that school, but the school couldn’t do much either.</span> <span id="s164">When it happened occa -- more frequently than at other times, our parents, or one of our parents walked with us to school, and that provided protection.</span> <span id="s165">They didn’t attack anybody who was accompanied by an adult.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Did it happen to girls as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s168">I don’t know the answer to that question.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s170">Did you see them often in the street, even if they weren’t involved in --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Oh [indecipherable] Hitler youth all the time.</span> <span id="s172">I mean, it was a government -- it was Hitler’s youth movement.</span> <span id="s173">They were proud to show their uniforms, so it was part of the day to day scenery in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: What did it mean to you at that age, as a young boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: The enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: So how did that make you feel about your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: I don’t know how to answer that question.</span> <span id="s178">I -- I felt terribly uncomfortable and fearful at times.</span> <span id="s179">It wasn’t a very pleasant experience to grow up in Berlin after Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: How did your parents deal with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: They were equally apprehensive, and to this day I will never know why my parents didn’t leave Germany.</span> <span id="s182">I mean, if I read the literature today of how Jews were treated in the immediate pre-Hitler period, and after Hitler came to power, it was relatively easy to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s183">Why my parents didn’t leave, I will never know, but they were not alone, I mean, there were possibly a hundred thousand Jews in-in -- in Germany, maybe even more, who stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s184">Many of them thought that Hitler would never attack the German Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Do you know people that left Germany at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Oh, many of them, I -- many of them here in Melbourne.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Friends of yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s189">Yes, if I ha -- the signals were so clear, right from 1933 when Hitler came to power, but there was go -- there were going to be enormous problems.</span> <span id="s190">And why my parents didn’t leave, I will never know.</span> <span id="s191">I mean, it wasn’t always easy, reading the literature now, to get permits to emigrate -- or to immigrate, rather.</span> <span id="s192">To emigrate was relatively easy in the early years of Hitler.</span> <span id="s193">But to get permits to America, to Australia, to some of the other countries, was relatively difficult.</span> <span id="s194">I think the only country that admitted Jews in unlimited numbers was Shanghai, and I think the Dominican Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: So the people that you knew that were leaving, where were they going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Some of them went to England, some of them went to France and were later caught in France during the war.</span> <span id="s197">Many of them went to America, my aunt emigrated to Chile.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: Either ’37 or ’38.</span> <span id="s200">My uncle emigrated to Shanghai, and survived the war in Shanghai, returned to Berlin at the end of the war and died there.</span> <span id="s201">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: Natural causes?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s204">So it was possible to leave Germany, but my parents, like so many others, obviously totally underestimated the consequences.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: What -- what comment can you make about your standard of living in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: We got progressively poorer.</span> <span id="s207">I think we were middle class when I was a child, and as the -- as the economical strains on Jews became increasingly difficult, I think our standard of living became lower.</span> <span id="s208">And of course, from ’39 on, all food was rationed, with a special ration card for Jews, and we got significantly less food than --</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: We’ll come to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: So what changes took place?</span> <span id="s212">You said you got progressively poorer.</span> <span id="s213">What -- what -- what do you remember changing --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: We moved to, I think lower class residences, lower class districts.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: With your household?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s217">Well, we didn’t live in a house, we always lived in apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was that your apartment, or rented?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: All rented, we rented, I think.</span> <span id="s220">I’m almost certain it was rented.</span> <span id="s221">And that was basically it.</span> <span id="s222">I-I know we became poorer, although parents normally don’t discuss their financial affairs with their teenagers, their -- with their 10 or 11 year olds.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: So [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: But don’t forget I was 11 when the -- when the war started, I was four when Hitler came to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So where did you move to?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: To the last residence that I’ve shown in that [indecipherable] in a district in Berlin called Weding, of all places.</span> <span id="s227">And we moved there, and that -- it was from there that I was deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: What happened with school?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Well, di -- the school was closed in 1939 at the outbreak of World War ІІ.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Until ’39, you were at school?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Wi -- were you aware of things changing in your education with Hitler’s rise to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s234">I think the education was -- was unchanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s236">What about on weekends, did you have the freedom to --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Oh yes, I mean, I was free in Berlin until ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: We had to wear the yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: From what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I think from 1941, either ’41 or ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s243">Let’s go back to the period before --</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: -- the war starts, before ’39 -- ’33 to ’39.</span> <span id="s246">What other changes took place, if you remember them?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I don’t think any.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Increased incidences in anti-Semitism, increased --</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well, as I told you, the -- the mob of the Hitler youth on our way to school and from school.</span> <span id="s250">Apart from that, no, not really.</span> <span id="s251">I mean, there were places where Jews couldn’t go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Like where?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Parks, primarily.</span> <span id="s254">Picture theaters and other venues, but primarily picture theaters and parks.</span> <span id="s255">There were even benches that -- where it was written, Jews are not allowed to sit here.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: And the picture theaters of that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: We’re just not allowed to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Do you remember how that affected you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I don’t think it bothered me a great deal, as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: Do you remember the effect it had on your parents?</span> <span id="s261">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s262">I’m sure they suffered, but they didn’t show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s264">What was the atmosphere like in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Really it’s too -- I think to a very large extent, unchanged.</span> <span id="s266">I di -- don’t think I remember any changes.</span> <span id="s267">My parents, I think, tried to shelter the children from everything bad.</span> <span id="s268">So they shielded us, I think from many things that they must have been aware of.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: Were you called names in the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh sure, dirty Jew, and that -- that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s271">I mean, that happened even when -- after we wore the star and we walked in the street, people out of the blue yelled at us, dirty Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: So what happened, as you remember it, before the war began, and as it began in 1939 September?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: What period?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: What -- what happened just before ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Well, I had -- I had a normal life, I went to school from 1934 to 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s277">What happened in ’39?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, in ’39 when the war broke out, the Jewish schools were closed, and I had to stay at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Do you remember the day you were told not to come to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: No.</span> <span id="s281">I think my parents just told me school is finished, school is closed.</span> <span id="s282">But I kept up my contact with my Jewish friends, and in fact, I was Bar Mitzvah in Berlin in 1941, two years after the outbreak of World War ІІ.</span> <span id="s283">So there was a Jewish life in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Where did you celebrate your Bar Mitzvah?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: In a synagogue called [indecipherable] in the Oranienburger Strasse [indecipherable] existed, was bombed by the allies and I had joined a choir in that particular synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: There were services in the synagogues in Berlin until ’43.</span> <span id="s288">Many synagogues were closed, but some were opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: You said your -- the synagogue that you belonged to was bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: Was that of any s -- did you see it --</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I didn’t see it, but -- but I didn’t see it while it was being bombed, because during the air raids, we were not allowed to go out.</span> <span id="s293">We had to go to -- either to air raid shelters, or stay where we were.</span> <span id="s294">But afterwards, in the next morning, I was told, I don’t know by whom, maybe -- maybe by my parents, maybe my friends, that synagogue has been bombed.</span> <span id="s295">And then I walked there -- it wasn’t a very long walk from home, and saw the damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: What was the damage?</span> <span id="s297">Was the whole building --</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Was -- was the -- was the -- it was still smoking, and there was very little left of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s299">[indecipherable] the synagogue where I was Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Was there a celebration after the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: I think it was a family reunion, and friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s303">Her -- tell me about the air raid.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Well, there were air raids almost from the beginning of ’39 from planes from England.</span> <span id="s305">There were sirens when -- if they approached Berlin.</span> <span id="s306">And then initially, I think in the early years of the war, we were compelled li -- just like the non-Jews, to go to air raid shelters.</span> <span id="s307">Subsequently, we were not allowed to go to air raid shelters any more, we stayed at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: How often?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: How often was there an air raid?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: How often the air raids?</span> <span id="s312">I don’t remember, they were very often, and they increased in frequency as the war progressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Do you remember the impact it had on you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: You became immune to it.</span> <span id="s315">I don’t think it had any special impact on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: If it did have an impact on them, they didn’t show it.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: They -- after an air raid, you would go out of the house the next morning and see --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: And look -- look at the damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: -- more devastation.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Look at the damage.</span> <span id="s322">See what houses in the neighborhood were attacked.</span> <span id="s323">That’s what we did the next day.</span> <span id="s324">Not all the air raids occurred during the night, some of them occurred during the day in -- in broad daylight.</span> <span id="s325">And they often lasted for an hour or two or three, and we went and observed the damage as soon as we were allowed to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were the streets full of people out looking to see what had happened?</span> <span id="s327">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: What were you doing on the day, every day, not going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: I stayed at home and visited friends, and read a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: What sort of things did you read?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: Everything I could lay my hands on.</span> <span id="s332">I borrowed books from the library, from the Jewish library.</span> <span id="s333">We had quite a -- rather extensive library at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: And that was [indecipherable] I did a lot of that.</span> <span id="s336">My parents from time to time, kept on teaching me arithmetic, geography, and a few other things that they thought I should know.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Up until what time was your father working in his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: When we were deported in 1943, only my mother, my sister and I were deported, my father was not at home.</span> <span id="s339">And I thought, in fact, that he had survived the war, because I didn’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s340">And immediately after the war, after liberation, I went back to Berlin in the hopes that he had survived underground, only to be informed then, in October ’44, six months before my liberation, he was discovered by the Gestapo, sent to Auschwitz, and he died there.</span> <span id="s341">So he certainly worked when we were deported.</span> <span id="s342">How much longer he worked there -- I presume he stopped work immediately and went underground, because when the Gestapo deported a family, they put a seal on the door.</span> <span id="s343">And when my father came home in the evening, he would have seen that seal, he would have known what happened, and I presume he went underground, but I’ll never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s345">What was the food situation up until the time of deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: Not very good.</span> <span id="s347">We got no butter, only margarine.</span> <span id="s348">Very little fruit, very little sugar, if any.</span> <span id="s349">No chocolate, no more goodies.</span> <span id="s350">And that was basically the rations.</span> <span id="s351">I mean germ -- ordinary Germans also had ration coupons, but the ration for Jews were significantly lower than for the ordinary population.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you feel hungry at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I don’t think I ever experienced hunger, no.</span> <span id="s354">No, my mother was a good cook, and one way or another she always managed t-to prepare good meals.</span> <span id="s355">We had some friends, I think they must have been non-Jewish, I didn’t really know them, friends of my parents, who occasionally supplemented our rations with a bit of butter and a bit of meat and some eggs.</span> <span id="s356">I mean, there was a large black market, and it’s quite possible that my parents bought some food on the black market.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: So your family life, until ’43, until the time of deportation was every evening you were all home together.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: And everybody went their own way during the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: What was your mother doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: She was at home, except that during the last month before deportation, probably late ’42 -- no, mid-’42, she went to work in a -- also for Siemens, oddly enough.</span> <span id="s363">I think it was forced labor, because there were so many people on the front that the German factories, they came to get any labor that they could.</span> <span id="s364">And I think she worked on the assembly line there.</span> <span id="s365">So she went to work every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Was that her choice, or she --</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Oh no, no, I’m sure it wasn’t her choice, I’m sure she was compel -- I’m sure it was forced labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s369">Were you aware about the deportations until --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: Yes, very much so because every time I went to s -- not deportation actually, not -- I was more aware of emigration.</span> <span id="s371">I was not aware of deportations at all.</span> <span id="s372">But every day I went to school, and there were one or two students not there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: This was bef -- this is earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yeah, this was before the war -- before the war, who had emigrated.</span> <span id="s375">But of deportations I was totally unaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What can you say about your neighbors, your German non-Jewish neighbors?</span> <span id="s377">A: I think they avoided us, is probably the best way to express it.</span> <span id="s378">None of them were sympathetic or anything.</span> <span id="s379">I think they just avoided us.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You don’t remember anybody offering you assistance, except --</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: -- for this food that you were given, you don’t know who gave it to you, the extra food.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: No, no I don’t think that we got any help from neighbors.</span> <span id="s384">But a -- I don’t know where the help came from, but I know that my parents did get help.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: What sort of help?</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Extra food.</span> <span id="s387">Butter, which we didn’t get.</span> <span id="s388">Meat, which we either didn’t get, or only in very small quantities.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So your father was in his business until the time that you were deported [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s391">I can’t imagine that he went back there after he became aware that we’d been deported.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s393">Did he have German people working for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Are you aware of anything about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: -- situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I know nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Not.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: You said he had a non-Jewish German lady partner?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Woman [indecipherable] yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Do you know anything about their friendship, or business connection, what happened to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: All I -- all I know is they were partners in business.</span> <span id="s405">That’s all I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You didn't know her personally, or her family?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Nothing to do with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: At least I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Did you have any hired help from any -- from a German [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And from what time did you start wearing the star?</span> <span id="s415">You did mention that earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I think it was either ’41 or ’42, I mean that -- that date is fairly well documented.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: It -- it became a decree, you had to go somewhere to pick it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Do you remember the day you went to pick it up?</span> <span id="s420">Do you remember the actual --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: My parents picked it up, I didn’t pick it up.</span> <span id="s422">And then they had to sew it on the left hand side on your jacket, or on the outer garment that you wore.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Did your mother sew it on for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Do you remember that?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Very vaguely.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: What did she sew it onto?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Onto a jumper, onto a shirt, onto a jacket, depending on the season.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: In your -- in your case, what was -- oh, I see, it changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Yes, sure, because they -- it had to be shown on whatever your outer garment was.</span> <span id="s431">So in summer it was just a shirt, in winter it was a jumper or -- or a jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Was that significant for you to wear that?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: I don’t know how to answer that question whether it was significant [indecipherable] but it was a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s434">I had to wear it and that was it.</span> <span id="s435">It didn’t cause particular trauma as far as I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: What other comments can you make about walking in the street, until the time that you were deported, up until ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: I don’t think I can add to anything I told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Did you see any other beatings?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Did you see Jewish businesses or shops closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: All I remember, 1938, the Kristallnacht --</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: -- when the -- ninth of November, from memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: The next day, or next days after that, I saw the windows of Jewish businesses smashed.</span> <span id="s446">Oh yes, that I remember vividly, the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: You saw it the day after?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: I saw it the day after, I wasn’t out when it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Who were you with when you saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: What did you see?</span> <span id="s452">A: I saw windows smashed, and graffiti, anti-Semitic graffiti.</span> <span id="s453">Don’t buy from Jews, Jewish pigs, Jews go to Palestine.</span> <span id="s454">That sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: You hadn’t heard of deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Had you heard of anything else that was happening, from a radio, or from newspaper, anything that was happening elsewhere, your --</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: I don’t think it was generally known, and if my parents knew or suspected anything, they certainly shielded us from it.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s462">Do you remember seeing changes in your father, the way he looked, the way he behaved?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s464">I knew they were apprehensive, but they shielded us to the extent that they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s466">And your relationship with your sisters during this time?</span> <span id="s467">A: It was very good, I loved my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: You said that your grandparents, your mother’s parents, died when you were small?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Were they buried in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A: Yes, in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: So, can you tell me what happened in 1943?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Well, the Gestapo came with a van and told my mother, my sister and me --</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Came to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Do you remember when they actually entered into your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: I think so, yeah, but very vaguely.</span> <span id="s478">They were just --</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Do you remember how many there were?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Two or three.</span> <span id="s481">Told us to go down, take some personal belongings with us.</span> <span id="s482">We went into a fel -- the back of a furniture van; there were already other Jewish people in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: People you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s485">And we were taken to an assembly camp in Berlin, which used to be a Jewish old people’s home.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: How far away from your home was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Oh, one or two kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s489">How long did you have to pack up what you wanted?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Maybe a half an hour, an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: They waited for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: What did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: My mother did all the packing, I didn’t pack anything.</span> <span id="s495">I don’t know what she took.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Did you have your own bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s499">Anything that you remember about --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: I think you were only allowed to take one item of luggage.</span> <span id="s501">So what my mother packed, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You don’t remember taking anything particular with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: So you and your mother and two sisters --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: One sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: One sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I only had one sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Only one sister -- got onto the truck, and your father was not home at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: He was at work?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: I don’t know where he was, I presume he was at work.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: And do you remember sitting in the back of the furniture truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s514">That was only a very short journey I took, perhaps 15 - 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s515">They picked up other people on the way to the assembly point.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: So how many people were in the back of the truck when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: Maybe a dozen.</span> <span id="s518">Maybe a dozen, maybe more.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Women and men --</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: -- and children?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: And what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Well, we were asked to disembark, and then a place called Grosse Hamburger Strasse, which was assembly point, which was before a Jewish old people’s home.</span> <span id="s525">And there were lots of people there, and we were assigned beds in the dormitory, and we stayed there, certainly for several weeks, if not for a couple of months, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s526">And more people came every day, and more people left every day.</span> <span id="s527">I guess my parents must have known what happened to those who left, but I didn’t.</span> <span id="s528">I really didn’t know what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s529">I had no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Do you remember what you did every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s532">We read books, we went to meals.</span> <span id="s533">We got -- we were fed well, talked.</span> <span id="s534">But nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: You had beds?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: And bathrooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: There were communal bathrooms and communal toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: You had no idea where your father was?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: What was your mother like at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: She, I think, also tried to shield her children from her apprehensions.</span> <span id="s543">We just did nothing all day.</span> <span id="s544">My mother still went to work from there during the day.</span> <span id="s545">She was allowed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: By foot?</span> <span id="s547">She walked or she --</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, by public transport because her place of work was many kilometers away.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: So she would have taken public transport.</span> <span id="s551">She came back in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Was she paid for her work?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I presume so, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Who was in charge of you during the ti -- this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: The SS or the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s556">The whole thing was run by the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: How were you treated?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Reasonably well.</span> <span id="s559">I mean, we didn’t go out, we were not allowed out.</span> <span id="s560">Nobody beat us up.</span> <span id="s561">We were -- we just did very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: So you were there for a couple of weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No, no, no, at least for a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Couple of months.</span> <span id="s565">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Then another furniture van came, took us to a railway station, and from there we had to go into a wagon where there were lots of other people, and then we were deported to Auschwitz, actually to one of the camps, that they called hausenlager, auxiliary camps near Auschwitz, called Buna, B-u-n-a.</span> <span id="s567">But the -- the -- the trip was awful, and one of the most traumatic experiences of all the war, because we were -- we were so many people, it was just like a suburban train at peak hour, was standing room only.</span> <span id="s568">There were people there of all ages, from old people to children as young as we were and even younger.</span> <span id="s569">We were perched in there, it was dreadful.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: How long was that journey?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: I think 36 to 48 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: And you had to stand all the time?</span> <span id="s573">A: Stayed in there, and we were allowed out once or twice to empty our bowels and bladders, but not everybody could wait, so could you imagine the stench in those wagons, and during the trip?</span> <span id="s574">It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Did you have something to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Something to drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: People die on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s583">Elderly, mostly the elderly.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: What were they -- what did they -- what did anybody do with their bodies when they died?</span> <span id="s585">A: It was standing room only.</span> <span id="s586">You know, it was perhaps like -- I don’t know if you have ever seen the subways in Japan where they have pushers to push people in.</span> <span id="s587">That’s what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: So what happened when someone died?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Wherever he is -- I think they were probably put in a corner somewhere.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, not many died, perhaps three, or four, or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Were they taken off at one of the stops?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: If -- if it occurred before a stop, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: And when you stopped, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: There were lavatories there.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And you were well guarded by the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Oh yes, it’s machine guns and dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: Did anybody try to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: So you arrived in -- in -- did you s -- how did you know you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I -- I found out later.</span> <span id="s601">I didn’t know where I was when we -- when we disembarked.</span> <span id="s602">But I found out fairly soon afterwards where I was.</span> <span id="s603">When we arrived, we were asked to leave the wagons.</span> <span id="s604">There was an SS man on a podium and they said women and children to the left, and men to the right.</span> <span id="s605">And I instinctively held onto my mother and joined her and my sister to women -- to the left where the women and the children were.</span> <span id="s606">And then my mother pushed me to the men.</span> <span id="s607">So I think she really gave birth to be twice.</span> <span id="s608">Once in ’28, once in ’43.</span> <span id="s609">My sister and my mother went straight to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: How do you know that?</span> <span id="s611">A: I was told by the other prisoners of what happened to the women and children.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: When did you know there were gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Within days of -- I mean, I -- we were the last of the prisoners to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s614">Don’t forget, it was ’43, so the tide of the war had already turned against Germany, and it didn’t take very long for fellow prisoners to tell us where we were, and I asked what [indecipherable] where’s my mother, where’s my sister.</span> <span id="s615">They very quickly told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Was there a good-bye to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: No.</span> <span id="s618">She just pushed me to the men, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Did you turn around to look?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And your sister was with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: My sister was with my mother, and she was seven years old.</span> <span id="s623">Eight or seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So you were now with the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: And where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: We went to where we shaved our heads.</span> <span id="s628">We were told to get rid of all our clothing, they tattooed numbers on our lower left arm.</span> <span id="s629">And then we were assigned to barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Can I see your number?</span> <span id="s631">A: Yes, you can if you want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Could you read it out, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: 107294.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: You have something under the number, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: That dis -- dis -- that came later, that wasn’t the original -- that wasn’t originally put there, but it designated Jews.</span> <span id="s636">The triangle.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: When was that put there?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Subsequently, but I don’t know exactly when.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: And what did the triangle mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: That we were Jewish, because there were many Jew -- non-Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s641">Criminals, Communists, homosexuals.</span> <span id="s642">So the triangle subsequent -- signified that we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: Do you remember that -- the incident of being tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah, ve-very vividly.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Can you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: It was quite painful.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Who did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: I don’t know whether it was a fellow prisoner or that was an SS man.</span> <span id="s649">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: You remember the pain of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes, it was painful.</span> <span id="s652">I mean, I think tattoos are painful, particularly when they are inflicted without consideration for the person who is being tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: How long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Oh, a minute or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Do you remember what it felt like for you to see a number on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: There were so many new impressions, oc-occurring almost every day, every minute.</span> <span id="s657">It was difficult to dwell on any particular event.</span> <span id="s658">I remember so many events occurring, one after the other, it was difficult to dwell on one particular event.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Your barracks were -- were they in -- in Buna, or in --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: In Buna.</span> <span id="s661">First of all in Buna, where I worked for about two months, just carrying cement bags and iron rods and so on.</span> <span id="s662">And then I --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Was it for construction purposes?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Yes, for construction, because I -- they built a -- a huge factory, a German industrial complex called egay Farben.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: What was that for?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: They produced Buna there, Buna is -- is a gas, or a plastic, and that’s where the name came from.</span> <span id="s667">And egay Farben was at that time, the biggest German chemical complex.</span> <span id="s668">But I -- I stayed, luckily, only two or three months there.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: So the factory being built with -- near the camp where you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Yeah, tha -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: -- and so you walked every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: What were the barracks like in Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: They were barracks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: All men?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Yes, only men.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Can you describe what you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: I don’t think there is a word in the English language that adequately expresses what it was like.</span> <span id="s679">You can use words like horrible and terrible, traumatic.</span> <span id="s680">But you can talk about the weather that it was horrible or terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I don’t think there is -- is a word that -- an adjective in the English language that really adequately described those -- describes what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: You were sleeping on bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Was there something to cover the wooden base?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: There was straw.</span> <span id="s687">Straw.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: How many men to a bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: I think five, from memory.</span> <span id="s690">There were three tiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Were you next to the same men every night?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: I presume so, although I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: You didn’t have any particular bond with these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s695">Not really.</span> <span id="s696">We were so traumatized.</span> <span id="s697">We weren't normal, really.</span> <span id="s698">We fought for our life every day because when we came home from work, and we marched back into Buna, there was an -- an SS men standing there, and he decided whether you were fit to live another day, or whether you were so weak that they sent you to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: That process happened daily?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Daily.</span> <span id="s701">Daily after --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: At the end of the day after work?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Were you lined up?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: You weren’t lined up, you marched in columns of five.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Into your barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Into the camp itself, and then we walked to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: So at what point did he select people?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: As we entered the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: And how were -- how were they selected?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: There was an SS man and -- an SS man standing on a podium, and we marched slowly past him.</span> <span id="s712">It was his decision, life or death.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: What were his words, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: He didn’t say anything, he just signified left or right, left or right.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: To every person, got a direction left or right?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, not every person, only those who -- who had to move to -- to the left.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: That was daily?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s719">Daily after work.</span> <span id="s720">But I was only in Buna for three months.</span> <span id="s721">After three months I was sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: We’ll come to Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: -- in a moment.</span> <span id="s725">In the -- in the barracks there were SS guarding you all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: No, the SS were outside the barracks.</span> <span id="s727">The person responsible inside the barracks was a kapo.</span> <span id="s728">It was very often a non-Jewish [indecipherable] a criminal.</span> <span id="s729">In many cases there were -- some of them were worse than the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Do you remember the kapo -- the kapo that you -- in Buna?</span> <span id="s731">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: By and large, I have, either deliberately or instinctively tried to put all of that behind me, and that was my way of coping with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s734">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s735">So what work were you doing in the factory, carrying cement --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Carrying cement and carrying iron rods and steel.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: How many hours a day were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Probably 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Was the work difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Very difficult for a 14 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Were you a fit 14 year old?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: I must have been.</span> <span id="s743">I must have been, I mean, we were carrying 50 kilo cement bags over fairly long distances.</span> <span id="s744">How I was able to do --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: On your back?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Yes, on our back.</span> <span id="s747">How I was able to do that I really do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Were you closely supervised while you were working?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah, sure.</span> <span id="s750">Particularly when you think that we were really underfed for many years.</span> <span id="s751">I mean, we didn’t start being malnourished when we arrived in the camps.</span> <span id="s752">We already suffered from shortage of healthy food from 1939, and now we’re talking 1943.</span> <span id="s753">I must have been very fit, and lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Do you ever remember getting into trouble for not working hard enough?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: You did what you were supposed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: And the SS were guarding you and supervising you?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah, all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: When did you get fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Mid-day.</span> <span id="s762">We got a bowl of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: At work?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And what was the soup?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Depends where you were in the queue.</span> <span id="s767">If you were unfortunate, you got very thin, watery soup.</span> <span id="s768">If you were lucky you were near the bottom of the container, and you had a little bit more cabbage, a little bit more potato, bit more solid food.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Do you remember what it was like going back into the barracks and going to sleep at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: We were exhausted.</span> <span id="s771">Went -- went to bed, and slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: And how were you woken up in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: First of all the light was switched on, I think at six o’clock in the morning, and there was a lot of noise, people yelling, get up, get up.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: Did you have striped uniforms?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: And that’s what you wore all the time?</span> <span id="s777">What about the personal hygiene in Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: We were -- the Germans insisted that we were kept clean because they were worried about an outbreak of disease.</span> <span id="s779">So we were regularly deloused, and watched for fleas and lice.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: What was involved in delousing?</span> <span id="s781">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: I think it was just a question of spraying us with something.</span> <span id="s783">Probably something like Lysol or something.</span> <span id="s784">Some chemical.</span> <span id="s785">They were worried about the health of the Germans in the camp, the SS and so on, not the prisoners.</span> <span id="s786">But there was very little personal hygiene, I mean, there were no toothbrushes, there was no toothpaste, there was no toilet paper.</span> <span id="s787">None of the basic things were there.</span> <span id="s788">Brush our teeth for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: What month was it that you were in Buna?</span> <span id="s790">What was the season?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: What can you say about the weather, the cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Horribly cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: Did you have shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: What sort of shoes?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Terribly heavy shoes that didn’t fit, but it didn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Were they shoes or clogs?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: Boots, boots really.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: They didn’t fit?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Well, not really, I mean, not what you expect from shoes today.</span> <span id="s802">But they were all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: How did you deal with the cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Like everybody else.</span> <span id="s805">[indecipherable] it was just cold, and that was it</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Okay, so you were there for, you said, a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: And what was the reason for being sent to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: I guess because I was young -- I was one of the younger ones, and then I spoke German.</span> <span id="s810">And in Auschwitz, I was sent to a Maurerschule, a bricklayer’s school.</span> <span id="s811">They wanted to train us as bricklayers to build more factories and build more barracks.</span> <span id="s812">And that was an activity that was a lot easier than carrying cement bags and carrying rods, so I became a bricklayer in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Had -- did you walk from Buna to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s815">Tell you the truth I don’t remember, but I would imagine that we were taken in the truck.</span> <span id="s816">But I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Were you aware of a -- of difference before you arrived?</span> <span id="s818">Were you aware of a difference between Buna and Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No.</span> <span id="s820">I had heard of Auschwitz, and I knew that Auschwitz was close by, but that was all I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: When did you know that your mother and sister had been sent to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Fellow prisoners told me what happened to the women and the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: In -- when you were in Buna you found out?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah, within days of arriving, if not on the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: So you knew when you were arriving to Auschwitz that it was an extermination camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Oh yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: What -- do you remember when you arrived in Auschwitz what it looked like?</span> <span id="s828">Was it different to Buna?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Well, to -- we were already prisoners, so we -- we had already been tattooed, our heads had already been shaved, we already wear -- wore prisoners clothing.</span> <span id="s830">So it was just being transferred from one camp to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Did they look different?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Much bigger.</span> <span id="s833">Auschwitz was much bigger than Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Did you have contact with other prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Only those with whom I worked, or who were in the same barracks as I. And I came across a number of boys who were at school with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Were you able to recognize them?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: How did it feel having them --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: We talked to each other.</span> <span id="s840">I’m still in touch with some of them today.</span> <span id="s841">Two live in Israel [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s842">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s843">A: The one in Israel is David Zeltz, and Stefan Cohen.</span> <span id="s844">They went to school with me in Berlin, and we met in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Same age, same class?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s847">More or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Did it provide you with any comfort?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: It was nice to know somebody whom you had known before.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s853">So where were you trained to become a bricklayer?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Where?</span> <span id="s856">On the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Yes, on the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Who trained you?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Bricklayers, trained bricklayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: What nationality were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: German, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: All prisoners --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: -- that had been doing this work.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s866">Peo -- trained bricklayers who were 10 years older than we were.</span> <span id="s867">So, professional bricklayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: So where in Auschwitz were you doing this?</span> <span id="s869">Where were the barracks being built?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: In the main -- in the main camp of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: And how many hours a day were you working?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Same 10 hours a day, six days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Sunday was not a day of work?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Sunday was not a day of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: And what was Sunday?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Just talked, rested.</span> <span id="s877">Tried to find out from other prisoners what happened in the rest of the world, because we didn't know how long we would last, how long Hitler would last, what would happen in the end.</span> <span id="s878">Because by ’43, particularly the second half of ’43, there were more and more rumors that the tide of the war had turned against Hitler, and thus it was only a question of time before the war, before Hitler would be beaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: It was just a question would Hitler survive us, or would we survive Hitler?</span> <span id="s881">But we talked about that, we t -- sometimes talked about the past, the good old times, when we were at home, and we had plenty of things to eat.</span> <span id="s882">And what we would do with ourselves if we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Were you hung -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Were you hungry in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Sure, I was hungry all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: How did you deal with your hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: There was no way of dealing with it except experiencing it, and that was -- nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s888">If you’re hungry you probably get yourself something to eat, couldn’t get anything there.</span> <span id="s889">You trade food occasionally because we were given a ration of tobacco, which was called [indecipherable], was a horrible -- anyway, since I didn't smoke, I traded it with smokers for an extra piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you ration that piece of bread, or you ate it?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: I tried and ate it as I could because if I kept it for the next -- until the next morning, maybe it would be stolen overnight.</span> <span id="s892">We had some very skillful thieves in the camp.</span> <span id="s893">So was always good to eat it and not keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: There was no way of getting extra food from somewhere, other than that?</span> <span id="s895">You didn't know anybody that worked in a kitchen that might have had access?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No.</span> <span id="s897">I know that some prisoners did know people who were in the kitchen, I -- I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s899">Did you feel that it was lucky to get this bricklaying job, for any reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Well it was certainly a lot better than Buna.</span> <span id="s901">Buna was awful.</span> <span id="s902">This was a lot easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: The work was harder?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Much harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: The living conditions were the same as in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Bigger?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: No, it was -- well, the camp was bigger, but the barracks and the working hours, and the -- and all that, were just like in Buna.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Was there any heating, any fire to get warm?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: So nighttime was cold, going to be cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s913">But di -- you fell asleep, you were exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Do you remember the people that you shared a bunk with in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: I don’t remember any of them personally.</span> <span id="s916">The worst part of it is if you had to get up in the middle of the night to relieve your bladder, then you became aware of how cold it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s918">You had to go out of the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, you had to stay in the barrack, except that when the container was full, you had to go out and empty it.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: The container?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Of urine, where everybody emptied their bladder.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: And was that the only bathroom facility?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: There was no place to wash your face, wash clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Oh, not -- not to wash clothes, but ye -- yet there were facilities to wash your face, your hands, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Outside of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: -- barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Did you have a blanket at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: A woolen blanket?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: It was either woolen or synthetic, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: One blanket for all --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: -- five people.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s938">No, one blanket for each.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Did you have a pillow?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Straw on the wooden --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: How many people would have been sleeping your barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: I would imagine a hundred, maybe 200.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s946">And once again, kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Do you have any memories of the kapos, how they treated you?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: They were not very nice, but I tried to have as little as possible to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Why do you say they were not nice?</span> <span id="s951">You must have seen something.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: They screamed at people, they hit people.</span> <span id="s953">I wanted to avoid them as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And it was easy to avoid them?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: I guess so.</span> <span id="s956">I mean, I successfully avoided them just about all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: And what about the SS that was supervising the work?</span> <span id="s958">Did you avoid them also?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: You didn’t get into [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I tried not to attract attention.</span> <span id="s962">It was the worst thing you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s964">Did you see other people attracting attention?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Some people collapsed, some people didn’t work fast enough.</span> <span id="s966">I tried to be as unobtrusive as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Did you form any friendships?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Friendship’s probably too strong an expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Connection.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Just people you discuss things with.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: People -- well, sure, people -- the boys that I went to school with.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Do you think you were able to show emotion?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I don’t remember, to tell you the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: So you weren't ever beaten in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: I was hit occasionally, but not really -- not, not often.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: What were you hit with?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: A wooden -- I think a rifle butt.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Do you remember why you were hit?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: I don’t know why I hit, but I still have marks of it today.</span> <span id="s981">I’m totally deaf on my right ear as a result of being hit over the head.</span> <span id="s982">It was the only memory of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: And was that instant?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: The deafness?</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: When did you lose your hearing?</span> <span id="s986">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: The deafness I think was instant.</span> <span id="s988">Luckily I’ve got good hearing on the left ear, so that you didn’t notice that I’m half deaf.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s990">And was there appelle in ausch --</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: Every morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Oh, that was a ro -- a roll call, and we had to go out and the SS counted to make sure that nobody had died, stayed in the barracks, or fled, which was very rare.</span> <span id="s994">But some people died overnight, and the numbers had to match.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: How long did the appelle take?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Sometimes only 15 minutes, sometimes was a -- was a discrepancy, it could take an hour or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: And where was that held?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: Outside the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: Every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Every morning, every evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Were you counted again when you returned from work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Also in a -- in appelle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And so what -- what evolved if there -- if there was somebody that had died overnight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: Then they went to the barracks to see if there was somebody in the barracks who co-couldn’t or wouldn’t come to the appelle.</span> <span id="s1007">Th-They -- the appelle did not end until the discrepancy was discovered, whether it took half an hour, or an hour, two.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Who conducted it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: The SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: So the role of the kapo was inside the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Inside the barracks and occasionally also at work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: Are you aware of anybody that tried to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: I wasn’t aware, but I knew that some people escaped, and some of them were caught, and they were publicly hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: From Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: In front of everybody.</span> <span id="s1016">And all of us had to look --</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: -- and observe -- we had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: When -- where it was public, where was it held, the hanging?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Probably at the place where they look -- where the appelle was held.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: Did -- you said you saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: How many people were hung that you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Sometimes as many as six or eight, I think, sometimes one or two.</span> <span id="s1025">And the SS watched that you didn’t close your eyes.</span> <span id="s1026">But somehow one develops a talent to look past it, look -- to have your eyes open in the direction but not to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Were they people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No, not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: During the day working, did you talk to people?</span> <span id="s1030">A: Whilst -- whilst -- we had our lunch, we talked to people.</span> <span id="s1031">And also, if you work with others, you can talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: I mean, there were -- I wasn’t the only bricklayer, there were many of us.</span> <span id="s1034">And sure, you cou -- you could talk to the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Are you aware of any resistance of any kind --</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: -- in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: No, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Had you heard of resistance outside of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: No.</span> <span id="s1041">I was too young.</span> <span id="s1042">I wasn’t a man then, I was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: It’s a -- it’s an unusual question, but what comment can you make about the SS in that circumstance in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: Some of the SS were German, some were Austrians, some were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s1045">The worst were the Ukrainians, the second worst were the Austrians, and if you can use the word best, were the Germans.</span> <span id="s1046">If you were surrounded by German SS, you had a fairly good chance to get back to work -- back to the camp in the evening.</span> <span id="s1047">If the SS in charge of you were either Ukrainian or Croatian or Austrian, the chances were greatly diminished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Did you encounter Ukrainian SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: At Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1052">I mean, the SS -- was a different SS very often, from one day to the next.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1054">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: But you could tell very quickly where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: Not only by their accents, but they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: By -- by the -- by their accent, by their treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Are you able to clarify why they -- why their treatment was worse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: I think the -- I think the Austrians are more anti-Semitic than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1060">I think the Croatians -- I mean, if they joined the SS, maybe they wanted to prove something, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1061">But every day you had a German SS, it was good news.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1063">The language that you used in Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: -- only German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: All the time, just German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: All the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Did you think that every day could be your last day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Yeah, every day.</span> <span id="s1071">Every day.</span> <span id="s1072">At least when I was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1073">In Bobrick the situation was totally different.</span> <span id="s1074">But I also had some lucky breaks.</span> <span id="s1075">One day in the morning at the appelle, the SS in charge of the appelle asked, is there anybody who can speak fluent German and Hebrew?</span> <span id="s1076">I could not for the life of me understand why the SS would ask that question, but at that time I spoke reasonably fluent Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1077">And so I put my arm up, and also one or two of my colleagues from -- who were at school with me, also put their arm up.</span> <span id="s1078">The others went to work and we were kept there, and we found out why they wanted us.</span> <span id="s1079">It was the time that the Jews from Saloniki in Greece arrived in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1080">And those -- the Jews from Saloniki only spoke Greek and Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1081">They needed to be interviewed, they needed interpreters.</span> <span id="s1082">What their name was, when they were born, what traits, what professions they had.</span> <span id="s1083">So they needed somebody who could ask them in Hebrew and translate it into German.</span> <span id="s1084">So I had a soft job for -- for simply a month or six weeks.</span> <span id="s1085">That was one lucky break I had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Where was that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: In Auschwitz, in an office, inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Was the food different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: To tell you the truth, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1090">It was definitely not worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Were you working long hours, or shorter hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Sometimes we di -- we just sat to arrive -- to await the arrival of a transport.</span> <span id="s1093">We had a chair.</span> <span id="s1094">There were no chairs in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1095">So that was one of the lucky breaks I had in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1096">The lucky break.</span> <span id="s1097">And then the other lucky break was when I left Auschwitz and came to Bobrick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: I’ll ask you that in a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: The people that arrived from Saloniki and Greece, did you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: Did they inform you about anything that -- that you hadn’t known before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: No, but it -- what it enabled us to do is to save some lives, because we knew that if somebody was asked the question, what was his profession, that he said I’m a violinist, or I’m a teacher, he would probably be sent to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1104">Somebody was a carpenter, or a locksmith, or a bricklayer, or a welder, they were safe.</span> <span id="s1105">So very often, a lot of the Saloniki Jews told us that they’re a teacher or a violinist, we translated it as a welder, or as a bricklayer, or as a laborer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: With their knowledge or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Not with their knowledge, and not with the SS knowledge.</span> <span id="s1108">Because they didn't understand the Germans and the Germans didn’t understand Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Do you ever remember communicating to them in Hebrew --</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: -- and telling them something that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: No, I didn't tell them anything, I just asked them what their name was, how old they were, where they were born, when and what their profession was.</span> <span id="s1113">So my knowledge of Hebrew, you could almost argue, saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Was this towards the end of your stay in -- in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: No, it was more or less at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: So after a whole month there were Jews being brought into Auschwitz from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: -- Saloniki and Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1120">Well, Saloniki is a city in Greece, and th-there was a large Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1121">So we were all rounded up and all brought together within days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: Would you be aware of numbers, how many were brought in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I was just sorry that it ended, and I go back to become a bricklayer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: So you were in Auschwitz altogether for about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Which -- did you ever have any contact with women in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: No, none at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Were you aware of any behavior of the SS outside of the camps at night?</span> <span id="s1129">Any brothels in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: There were brothels in Auschwitz, and I believe that some prisoners, kapos, were also allowed to go to the brothels from time to time.</span> <span id="s1131">But at my age, I wasn't interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Did you know where they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: Yeah, I -- I saw them from outside.</span> <span id="s1134">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: But you never fol --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: -- I didn’t e -- to tell you the truth I didn’t even know what a brothel was, I was so naïve and so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Did you see a factory being built until its finishing stages?</span> <span id="s1138">The completion of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No, because the brickwork was finished long before the -- the interior was done.</span> <span id="s1140">We basically built the shells.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: How many shells were you involved in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Two, three, four, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1144">Were you aware of the gas chambers in location?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: I was aware of their existence, and I was -- I knew where they were, but only from being told by others.</span> <span id="s1146">I personally did not see any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: You didn’t see chimneys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Could you smell anything from the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1151">The gas chamber is mainly in a place called Birkenau, and I was never in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: So after you were in Auschwitz, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Then there was another roll call, and they were asking for young men who could speak German and who could re -- who could read technical drawings.</span> <span id="s1154">Again, I didn't know why, but I put my hand up.</span> <span id="s1155">And -- because we had done geometry at school.</span> <span id="s1156">And by -- when the others, I think, went to work, we were taken to a place called Bobrick, which was a very small camp, maybe 150 - 200 people, not very far from Auschwitz, but run by civilians [indecipherable] Siemens.</span> <span id="s1157">And the treatment was significantly better than in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: The food was better.</span> <span id="s1160">They wanted to make toolmakers of us, because that happened in ’44, when a lot of people thought the war was nearly at an end, the allied invasion had already taken place, and the wa -- they needed to train toolmakers, and all the toolmakers were on the front.</span> <span id="s1161">So we were trained as toolmakers.</span> <span id="s1162">We weren't beaten, food was better, the accommodation was better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: The quantity of food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: The quantities were better.</span> <span id="s1165">I think the quality of the food was better.</span> <span id="s1166">Nobody was beaten, nobody was threatened.</span> <span id="s1167">They want to teach us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Civilians from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: From Siemens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: From Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1172">They were going to make toolmakers of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Were they -- so they

<p><span id="s1180">Q: They were free men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: -- they were running the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: And they were free men that lived nearby --</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: -- tha -- that was their job?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1186">And they were friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: So Bobrick was my salvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: You didn’t feel anti-Semitism from these people?</span> <span id="s1190">A: Look, everybo -- every German was anti-Semitic, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: That’s how you felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: So you stayed in Bobrick, you lived there as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: And where did you train to make the tools?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: In the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: How big was the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: It was a huge hall, a very large hall.</span> <span id="s1199">How big it was?</span> <span id="s1200">Maybe 50, a hundred meters long, maybe 20 meters wide.</span> <span id="s1201">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: And what sort of tools were you responsible for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Well, we were supposed to be -- to be trained as toolmakers, and toolmakers manufacture a variety of tools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: What sort of tools?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: Tools to manufacture ammunition, tools to manufacture plumbing equipment, tools to make all sorts of metal objects.</span> <span id="s1206">So we got lessons in geometry.</span> <span id="s1207">We were given tools, rasps, files, drills.</span> <span id="s1208">We were given pieces of metal to drill out triangles, rectangles and so on.</span> <span id="s1209">That’s what it -- that -- that didn’t train us enough that we were [indecipherable] toolmaker.</span> <span id="s1210">An apprenticeship as a toolmaker is many years, and I think I was in Bobrick probably for a period of eight or nine months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Who else volunteered with you from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Some -- some of the young -- you needed to speak German, that was one of the pre-requisites, because the teachers only spoke German.</span> <span id="s1213">So that was one pre-requisite.</span> <span id="s1214">And you needed to have a -- an elementary or rudimentary knowledge of geometry, triangles, squares.</span> <span id="s1215">That’s al -- I had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: So how many of you from Auschwitz came over to Bobrick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Probably 15 or 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Your friends from school, did they come too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Yes, and others, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: How were you transported from Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Like on the back of a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Do you remember leaving Auschwitz and how that felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: I didn't know it was coming.</span> <span id="s1224">I was apprehensive.</span> <span id="s1225">But after a day or two in -- in Bobrick, was a great relief.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So why did you volunteer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: For the same reason that I volunteered when I was asked whether I speak Hebrew and German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: What do you think prompted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Maybe the hope for betterment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: The accommodation at Bobrick, was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Was better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Better?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: First of all, there were not so many of us, I mean, it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s1236">There were 10 or 20 in one barrack.</span> <span id="s1237">It was a lot better than a hundred or 200.</span> <span id="s1238">And the hygienic facilities were better.</span> <span id="s1239">There were toilets -- at Auschwitz there were no toilets, just empty land.</span> <span id="s1240">And altogether it was significantly better.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: The SS was still supervising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Yeah, but they had very little to do with us.</span> <span id="s1243">We were basically, mostly in contact with the civilian Germans.</span> <span id="s1244">The SS were there to -- I guess to stop people from fleeing, absconding.</span> <span id="s1245">But they were on the outside, they didn’t take much interest in us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Did anybody try to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: Did it seem that it was possible to escape from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: I don’t know, I never discussed escape with anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: You were there for six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: I was there til the January ’45 -- til the 18th of January, ’45, I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: Then we marched for some 50 kilometers to Gliwice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: All of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: You were all asked --</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Yeah, to -- to leave for Gliwice.</span> <span id="s1258">We walked for 50 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Do you -- do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Well, because -- we were told because the Russians were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So the SS rounded you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Was this during the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1265">So we walked.</span> <span id="s1266">On the way we met lots of columns of other prisoners from Auschwitz, and we walked 50 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: And in what period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: I asked -- I asked some of my friends how long it took.</span> <span id="s1269">I think it took 24 hours, maybe a bit more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Did you stop at any stage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1272">Yeah, we stopped occasionally, but by and large we walked.</span> <span id="s1273">50 kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Was that traumatic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Yes, very, because people collapsed left, right and center, and those who collapsed were shot in the head by the SS there and then.</span> <span id="s1276">So, the great incentive to march on, when you saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: How many people [indecipherable] and others, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: -- on the side of the road?</span> <span id="s1280">You saw people shot in the head?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Oh yes, many.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: How did that affect you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Very traumatic, but we kept marching on, hoping that the march would end.</span> <span id="s1284">We didn’t really know where we’re heading for, and how long it would last.</span> <span id="s1285">Just kept walking and walking and walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Did you assist anybody that was having difficulty?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Not really, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Did you have anything to eat or drink?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: We took food with us from bub -- from Bobrick, we were given food to take with us, and it sustained us til we got to Gliwice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: And what -- what was at Gliwice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: In Gliwice we slept in the snow in January, for -- we stayed, I think for a day or two, and then we were taken in open wagons to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q: Who did you see at Gliwice, who was already there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">A: Lots of people from Auschwitz, lots of people I guess from other camps, I don’t know, and those from Bobrick.</span> <span id="s1294">There were many thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Doing what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: Waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: Sitting around?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: And [indecipherable] open?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: In January?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A:

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: In the open?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Was there snow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yes, quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1311">We slept in the snow.</span> <span id="s1312">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Were there only older people in Gliwice, do you remember seeing younger people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Well, there were younger people, people my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Any younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Possibly, possibly.</span> <span id="s1317">I mean, not much younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: But there were thousands of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: -- in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: How is it closed off?</span> <span id="s1323">Was there a big fence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: To tell you the truth, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: It was just an open area.</span> <span id="s1327">Maybe there was a fence, maybe there was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">Q: Anything significant that you saw there that you can tell us?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1330">We were totally exhausted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: And your impression was just a -- a mass of people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: -- sitting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: -- and waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Wa -- waiting for?</span></p> <p><span

didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1343">We had no idea what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s1344">And then the trains arrived, and we were taken in open trains and -- through Czechoslovakia to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Do you remember how long the journey took?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: Probably a day, maybe a day and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Were you still alongside your friends from school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: I don’t know whether anybody was in my particular wagon.</span> <span id="s1349">I don’t recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: Once again, is this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Oh yes, it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: All the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: -- all the time, but not in the wagons.</span> <span id="s1354">In the wagons went [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: So you arrived in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: In January, ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: When did you know that it was Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: I think I saw a sign, concentration camp Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: So what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: We disembarked and we were -- went again to a barracks, and in my case I basically did nothing, no work or anything until three months later when we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: So for three months --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: Just it -- we had to do no -- we had to -- we -- on o -- on occasions we were sent by a truck to Wymar.</span> <span id="s1363">Buchenwald is on top of a mountain, and Wymar’s at the bottom of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1364">We were taken to Wymar to clean the streets, particularly after the city was bombed.</span> <span id="s1365">But that was just about all the work we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: How often did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Not very often.</span> <span id="s1368">Maybe once a week, twice a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Were you fed in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Yeah, same kind of diet as in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: How -- can you compare it to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: Compare it to Auschwitz -- well, we didn’t work, so that was one advantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Wh-When you tra -- on your way to Buchenwald, you traveled through Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Did you have any contact with --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: It was one of the very pleasant experiences because for one reason or another, the opened wagons stopped in Prague under a bridge and some Czechs threw food parcels into the open wagons.</span> <span id="s1377">And the SS who saw that, chased them away and wanted to stop them from doing it, so the SS chased them from left to right, they came back on the other side and kept putting -- throwing food parcels and food into the open wagons.</span> <span id="s1378">I’ll never forget that.</span> <span id="s1379">Ordinary, civilian Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: How long did -- so the train stopped under a bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Under a bridge, maybe for an hour or two and I don’t know why it stopped there, just happened to stop there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: So Buchenwald, what was the atmosphere in Buchenwald compared to the other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Well, we knew that the end of the war wasn’t too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: We were told by fellow prisoners who had access to information that I didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1386">And we were told, just last a little bit longer and you will be alright.</span> <span id="s1387">So we tried to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Do you remember your frame of mind in those last three months, knowing that it was coming to an end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Optimism and hope --</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: How di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: -- and hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: You did live with hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Did you feel that it was going to be the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: What was your physical condition like at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Very bad.</span> <span id="s1398">Very ba -- I do -- it was okay, and after I left Bobrick, because Bobrick was an easier camp, but after Bobrick and [indecipherable] my health, I think, deteriorated significantly.</span> <span id="s1399">And at the end of the war, when the liberation came, I was in a very bad state.</span> <span id="s1400">And I had typhus, but I survived it.</span> <span id="s1401">I overcame it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Had you been sick before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Only once in Buna.</span> <span id="s1404">I had a high temperature.</span> <span id="s1405">I was sent by the SS to have an ice cold shower.</span> <span id="s1406">I was told either you get cured, or you die.</span> <span id="s1407">I got cured.</span> <span id="s1408">That was the only time I got sick in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Did you have -- ever have sores, sprained muscles, or calluses, or grazes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Yeah, but you took those, they were part of day to day life, and you didn’t even bother with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: So, can you describe the liberation in Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Well, I was in a -- physically in a very bad state, and all I knew was I saw suddenly American soldiers in the camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Suddenly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: From nowhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: From nowhere and they told us you are free now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Where were you when you saw the American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Somewhere in the camp, we were walking around.</span> <span id="s1419">And I was lucky --</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: And he was on foot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1422">On foot and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: One soldier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1425">There were tanks with Americans, trucks with American soldiers, soldiers on foot.</span> <span id="s1426">And I was very lucky, I could communicate with them, I spoke some English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: What could they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: You are free now.</span> <span id="s1429">Hitler is finished.</span> <span id="s1430">The war, for you, is over.</span> <span id="s1431">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: How did that feel for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1434">And they took us, shortly after they arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: What -- wh-what did you do immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: They asked if we were hungry.</span> <span id="s1437">It’s a silly question.</span> <span id="s1438">So they took us to some of their PX depots outside Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1439">That’s where the -- the American soldiers were fed.</span> <span id="s1440">And, you pick what you like.</span> <span id="s1441">So I, like many of us, we ate butter by the spoonful, and washed it down with sweetened, condensed milk.</span> <span id="s1442">That’s when I got really sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Why did you choose that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: My body obviously needed it.</span> <span id="s1445">I need fat, I needed sugar.</span> <span id="s1446">That’s when I really got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">Q: After one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: Shortly after I ate that.</span> <span id="s1449">What it did to my stomachs and my intestines, I never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">Q: Where were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: In Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: You stayed in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Stayed in the camp until after the war was over, because we were liberated one month before the war was over, and then shortly after that I went to Berlin because I had hope that my father had survived.</span> <span id="s1454">Didn’t take me long to find out that he hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1455">Then I went back to Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s1456">I didn’t really know what to do, I had no relative.</span> <span id="s1457">I was 16 going on 17, I was -- I didn’t know what to do with myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: What -- who looked after you when you had ty -- typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: A hospital there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: In Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: You were in hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: For how

by an American doctor, by a Russian doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: And they had medical supplies for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: What sort of medication were you offered?</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: I don’t remember, I was so weak.</span> <span id="s1472">And then, in June --</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So you left the hospital and went back to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: No, the hospital was in the camp, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Yes, you went back to where you -- to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: To buch -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: And you stayed there until --</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: Until I heard there was a notification from the Swiss Red Cross that anybody under 18 wants to go to Switzerland should raise their hands, I did.</span> <span id="s1479">And in ju --</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Why did you want to go to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I had always dreamt of Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: From -- how did you know about Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: From the time I was at school, I was taught, and also in the camps on Sundays when we talked, that people who had money in Switzerland were able to escape.</span> <span id="s1484">So I thought Switzerland was a paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Were you given other options?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: No.</span> <span id="s1487">I could have stayed in the camp, I could have gone into a displace -- displaced person’s camp, but I didn’t need any other options, that was the one I really wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">Q: You chose independently, you didn’t check to see --</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">A: Oh, many of my friends also chose the same thing, all the Buchenwalder picked the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Picked the

<p><span id="s1494">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: What was your first impression of Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1497">Ever been to Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1498">It’s a paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: What about the feeling of -- of not living in fear, frightened for your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Didn’t take very long to get accustomed to it.</span> <span id="s1501">Came very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: What did liberation mean to you at that time, if you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: I don’t know if I can express the feeling of relief, it’s probably the best expression I can find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: And the acknowledgement that you had no family, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: When I thi -- when I was liberated, no, I thought my father had survived.</span> <span id="s1506">It was only later on that I found out that he hadn’t.</span> <span id="s1507">And then I remembered that I had an aunt in Chile, and subsequently I found, long afterwards, that I had another aunt in Germany, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: How did you find out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: That’s quite a story.</span> <span id="s1510">You interested in hearing that story?</span> <span id="s1511">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: [indecipherable] Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Yeah, I -- in ’49, I got married in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: We’re not up to ’49, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: No, but that’s how I found out, in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Okay, we’ll -- we’ll come to that.</span> <span id="s1517">We’ll take a short break.</span> <span id="s1518">Let’s go back to the time that you arrived in Switzerland in June of ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">Q: The way the wor -- one thing I haven’t asked you, if you don’t mind me going back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: -- [indecipherable] get here.</span> <span id="s1523">I just want to ask you, when you were in the camps, the difference between the cold months and the warm months.</span> <span id="s1524">How did that impact on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: The clothing that we got was identical for summer and winter, and we were very cold.</span> <span id="s1526">People had frostbite.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Some people after the war had to have toes amputated.</span> <span id="s1529">Somehow I managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: The warm weather?</span> <span id="s1531">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: It was never that warm that it was uncomfortable, the cold was much more of a problem than the -- than the warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Did you appreciate the warm weather when [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: Sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: It made a difference to your well being?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: General well being.</span> <span id="s1537">Also, the days were longer, and we preferred the summer to the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: I understand your hunger, what about thirst?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: Hunger was more of a problem than thirst.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Alright, let’s go back now to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: -- [indecipherable] 1945, June [indecipherable] that you arrived, you said it was like paradise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: And you felt free.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: We were sent to a place called Rheinfelden where we were medically examined from head to toe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: What sort of place is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Rheinfelden was a Swiss army camp, I think, not far from Bazen, where -- that’s where we arrived in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1548">We were medically examined by Swiss doctors and Swiss nurses.</span> <span id="s1549">And we very -- we were assessed.</span> <span id="s1550">Some people had to go to a sanatorium, some people got a clean bill of health, which included me.</span> <span id="s1551">So then we were sent to a rehabilitation to recover, because we were all underweight, and we had ru -- all of us had one problem or another.</span> <span id="s1552">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Where was the sanatorium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: Well, I wasn’t in the sanatorium, the sanatorium was in Davos mostly, and in Montada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: I’m sorry, for rehabilitation.</span> <span id="s1556">that you went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: Yeah, I went to a place called Zugerberg near the city of Zug.</span> <span id="s1558">I stayed there for awhile and then it became a question of what now?</span> <span id="s1559">Do you want to emigrate, do you want to learn something?</span> <span id="s1560">Can you -- have you got relatives for you -- outside Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1561">They made it quite cl --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: And -- and who was coordinating this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Oh, the Swiss Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: What language did they speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: German, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: And how did they treat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Very well.</span> <span id="s1568">Very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: So they were ordinary Swiss civilians, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: Oh yes, civilians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Civilians working for the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: Any Jews that you encountered that were working for the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: No, but we had plenty of contact with Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s1575">They came to visit us, they wanted to know if we needed anything, if we wanted extra clothing, extra food.</span> <span id="s1576">They were extremely generous to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: How did that feel for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">A: Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Which organizations do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: The Zionist organizations, the ultra-Orthodox organizations.</span> <span id="s1581">Every spectrum of Judaism was represented.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Did you use anything that they were offering you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Clothing.</span> <span id="s1584">Food we had plenty of, this was provided, there was plenty of food.</span> <span id="s1585">They gave us shirts, jumpers, shoes, money, chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: Did you need money at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: We -- we had nothing.</span> <span id="s1588">I mean, when we arrived in Switzerland we didn't have one cent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: So how much money did they give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1591">Not -- not a lot, but enough to go into the cities and do some shopping.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">A: And ice cream.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Piece of chocolate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: So who are you living with here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: This was an or -- a home, run by the Red Cross in Switzerland, with a Jewish woman running it.</span> <span id="s1598">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah, Madame Gratz, G-r-a -- G-r-a-t -- t-zet.</span> <span id="s1601">She was in charge of us.</span> <span id="s1602">There was also i -- non-Jewish Swiss woman who headed the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1603">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: And how -- how did you respond to them, were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: They were wonderful to us, and in all the five years that I’ve been in Switzerland, I did not encounter any unpleasantness of any kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: How old was the Jewish lady that was running the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Oh, she would have been in her 40’s, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1609">With her family --</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">A: She was our house mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: With her family there too, or she had a separate place?</span> <span id="s1612">A: She had two chil -- she had two children --</span></p> <p><span

and one of them I’m still in touch with.</span> <span id="s1617">He’s a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, teaching European history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: What is his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: Micah Gratz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: And hi -- was he a son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1622">He was a little boy then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: He was the son of this lady.</span> <span id="s1624">And what made you keep in touch with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: I am involved in a number of Israeli activities here, and one day when I visited the Hebrew University, I had heard that he was there, and I met him there.</span> <span id="s1626">His mother died [indecipherable] then, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: Had he remembered the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: He said he remembered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: And how did she come to run this home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: I guess she was engage -- employed by the Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Do you know where she had been during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: In Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Protected?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1636">So who else was in this house with you?</span> <span id="s1637">How many of you were there, and -- and where were you all from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Most of them were Polish Jews.</span> <span id="s1639">I mean, the number of German Jews in the camp was very, very small compared to the number of Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: And I think in our whole group in Switzerland, there were probably only half a dozen German Jews.</span> <span id="s1642">The rest were Polish and Hungarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Were you able to communicate with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: I learned Yiddish in the camp, I even learned a bit of Polish in the camp.</span> <span id="s1645">Oh yeah, there was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: You’re calling it a camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: No, I had learned Polish in the ca --</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Oh, you had in camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: -- in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: And well, there was no problem communicating.</span> <span id="s1652">And I had learned Yiddish in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1654">So how many people were in this home in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: Maybe a hundred, maybe 150, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">Q: In one home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1658">In the -- in the villa, in a huge villa in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: And you ate meals in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: Maybe there -- maybe there can’t have been a hundred, there must have been fewer, maybe 50 - 60.</span> <span id="s1661">Some boys who live in Melbourne were there.</span> <span id="s1662">I mean, a fellow who works here for you, Jake Cheskue, he was there with me.</span> <span id="s1663">Maybe his memory is better than mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: And what was your reason for being here?</span> <span id="s1665">You wanted to stay in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Yes, I never wanted to leave Switzerland ever.</span> <span id="s1667">[indecipherable] be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: What were you doing at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Well then we were -- we got career counseling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: By who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: By somebody appointed by the Red Cross, or the [indecipherable] and we were examined for IQ, and for what we knew and so on.</span> <span id="s1672">And I think I did reasonably well.</span> <span id="s1673">I was told that if I h-had private tuition for two years, I would be able to enter university at age 18.</span> <span id="s1674">And when that fact became known, the Swiss said, there’s no way.</span> <span id="s1675">You can’t stay here for two years to -- to learn and then another six years for university.</span> <span id="s1676">This is a transit situation for you.</span> <span id="s1677">We give you two alternatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Who -- who gave this to you, this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">A: The Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: The Swiss government wouldn’t allow you to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: No, I think [indecipherable] it was the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1682">So you have two alternatives.</span> <span id="s1683">Either you can learn to become a carpenter, or you can learn to become a dental technician, or you leave.</span> <span id="s1684">So I chose to become a dental technician.</span> <span id="s1685">And so for two years I had an apprenticeship as a dental technician, and as soon as that was over -- they asked, what are you go -- what are you doing about leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: Who’s they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: The Swiss foreign police.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: How did you have contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Oh, in Switzerland if you change residence and all that -- I brought some documents along with me.</span> <span id="s1690">Every time you changed address you had to have police -- we did, not the Swiss, but we had to have police permission, and we had to register.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: So for two years you were learning an apprenticeship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">Q: Where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">A: In Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: Living where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: My address in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: What -- what -- what were the conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: In a private residence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: You rented a room?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: I rented a room, furnished room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: Part of a family home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: [indecipherable] family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: Part of a family a part --</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">Q: A Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: -- a Swiss non -- no, a Swiss non-Jewish family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">Q: What was their attitude towards you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: They were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Did they know your background?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1711">That -- the Swiss Jewish community provided us with money, on -- with a monthly allowance, so we could buy clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Did you have a social life with other Jewish people in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1714">With non-Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">Q: With other -- with other Jewish people in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: Oh yes, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Where -- where was that centered?</span> <span id="s1718">Where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: In Geneva, there was a Jewish center there that one time or other, I was president of the Jewish youth movement in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: What was the idea of the Jewish youth movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Just for each other to -- to talk, to discuss the future, to meet other -- to meet girls.</span> <span id="s1722">Don’t forget we were teenagers, and we were interested in girls in those days.</span> <span id="s1723">Basically that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1725">And so how -- can you just give a description of what y-your state of mind was at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: Well, I was apprehensive after I finished my apprenticeship that I would be asked to leave.</span> <span id="s1727">And then, by co --</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: But you were happy in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Oh, very, very.</span> <span id="s1730">As I said, I never wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s1731">I was quite happy to spend the rest of my life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: And did you choose to mix mainly non-Jewish -- with Jewish people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1734">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: How did you relate to non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: I had no problem with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: No -- no problem whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">Q: What about efforts to contact family members from Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Well then I made contact with my aunt in Chile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">Q: How did you make that contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">A: I happened to know -- remember her address that I wrote to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">Q: You remembered it from when she left, from when you were a little boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: Right from when I -- from when I lived as a child in Berlin, I remembered her address and I wrote to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">A: And she was very kind to me.</span> <span id="s1749">She sent me money and clothing, all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s1750">And I wanted to emigrate to Chile if I ever had to leave Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">A: And I started to learn Spanish in preparation for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: In Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: Yeah, for emigrating to Chile, but in the -- I couldn’t get a visa from Chile, permanent residence, so that was out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: How did you deal with that, was that disappointing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: It was disappointing mixed with a sense of relief, at least I don’t have to leave Switzerland for Chile.</span> <span id="s1757">So then alternate choices became available, Israel, Australia.</span> <span id="s1758">And hopefully I could pur -- persuade whoever had to be persuaded to let me stay there.</span> <span id="s1759">But I was unsuccessful.</span> <span id="s1760">Today I am grateful for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1762">Are you aware of anybody that managed to stay in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1764">I am still in touch with some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: And how -- how were they able to stay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1767">Some of them had better connections than I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">Q: Like what sort of connection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">A: I don’t know, I think it then was a question of having the right connections, and having perhaps more perseverance than I did.</span> <span id="s1770">Trying harder than I did.</span> <span id="s1771">But, I mean not many, maybe half a dozen at the most.</span> <span id="s1772">One of the boys with whom I was in the camp went to Israel, became very successful in Israel, and then acquired skills that several years later were in short supply, and Switzerland -- was able to get back to Switzerland to get a working permit, and today is a Swiss citizen of immense wealth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: What was his line?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: He originate -- he trained in Switzerland as watchmaker.</span> <span id="s1775">When I trained as a dental technician, he trained as a watchmaker, and as watches became electronic, there was no future really for watchmakers, because all you had to do is change a battery.</span> <span id="s1776">So he went to Israel and started a watchmaker’s school for ORT.</span> <span id="s1777">And as there were fewer and fewer enrollments, for the same reason, that watches became electronic, he learned something else, I think either to repair typewriters or to repair something, I’m not quite sure.</span> <span id="s1778">O-Optical instruments.</span> <span id="s1779">He’s a very clever boy.</span> <span id="s1780">Boy, he’s my age.</span> <span id="s1781">And that skill was in short supply in Switzerland, that’s why he applied to the Swiss government for permission to go back to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1782">And he got a job in Switzerland, then established his own manufacturing industry there.</span> <span id="s1783">I saw him just three months ago in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: For the purpose of the interview, can you explain what ORT is.</span> <span id="s1785">You said he set up a school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: He set up a school for watchmakers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Don’t you know who ORT is?</span> <span id="s1789">ORT is a Jewish organization to train tradesmen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: And they wanted to establish a school for watchmakers in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1792">And he was a Swiss watchmaker, Swiss watchmaker Jewish, so he started it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1794">So ORT was established after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: No, no, no, ORT goes back long before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: It started in Russia, I think.</span> <span id="s1798">It’s a huge Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s1799">Even today it’s big.</span> <span id="s1800">It stands for, I think, organisation pour la reconstruction de travail.</span> <span id="s1801">That’s what the initials ORT stand for.</span> <span id="s1802">I subsequently worked for ORT in Geneva but we’ll do that on Thursday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1804">[indecipherable] take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: Enough for today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: This is a continuation of Gert Silver’s oral testimony at the Melbourne Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s1808">Could you continue by telling us about your working life as a dental technician?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Well, I actually only worked as a dental technician for a period of three months.</span> <span id="s1810">It so happened that when the night course was completed, the person, a Mr. Schubert who ran the course, left Geneva to return to France.</span> <span id="s1811">And as they didn’t have an immediate replacement for him, they appointed me to run the course for the next generation of intakes, on a temporary basis.</span> <span id="s1812">So I worked there for three months, and then a replacement was found.</span> <span id="s1813">After that, by sheer coincidence, I found a position in a Swiss export/import firm, owned by a Geneva -- a Jewish man called smi -- Michael Smeedof, and he wanted me because I spoke Spanish.</span> <span id="s1814">The reason why I spoke Spanish, I had to learn Spanish in Switzerland because I had originally intended to emigrate to Chile.</span> <span id="s1815">And he needed somebody who could speak Spanish, and because he couldn’t find anybody else, he got a working permit for me, which wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s1816">And I enjoyed that position thoroughly.</span> <span id="s1817">It really opened my eyes, and I saw there was more to life than fixing people’s false teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: What sort of business was it, what was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: It was an export/import business, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: What was their product?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: -- in textiles mainly.</span> <span id="s1822">They exported raw cotton to Spain, had it printed in Spain and then sent it to -- sold it to clothing manufacturers all over the world.</span> <span id="s1823">And I worked there for a number of months until they found a replacement for me, and then my working permit expired, and the Swiss police were again pressurizing me to leave Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1824">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: In what form were they pressurizing you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Oh, I just got telephone calls and letters, what -- how are my preparations going to leave Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1827">It was a soft pressure.</span> <span id="s1828">And then I found a job at the Israeli consulate in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1829">And at the consulate they were able to get a working perm -- a temporary working permit for me.</span> <span id="s1830">And I worked there, I think probably for six or eight months.</span> <span id="s1831">Then my working permit expired, and they found a Swiss replacement for me.</span> <span id="s1832">That Swiss replacement was a young woman from Bern [indecipherable], and I had to train her before I left the position.</span> <span id="s1833">We got on so much -- so well with each other, that we ended up getting married in October ’49, and she’s still my wife today after 56 years.</span> <span id="s1834">I then left Geneva --</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">Q: You married in Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">A: Ye-Yeah, not -- not straight away.</span> <span id="s1837">I then left Switzerland for Marseilles, because the consulate found me a position at the -- at the consulate in Marseilles from where many of the emigrants embarked for Israel.</span> <span id="s1838">I worked there maybe six, maybe nine months, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1839">Then I returned to Geneva, and in ’49 we got married in Geneva.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">Q: Can you give us some details about your wedding ceremony and celebration?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">A: It was a -- it was a ceremony held in the Grande Synagogue de Geneva, a big synagogue in Geneva.</span> <span id="s1842">It was very emotional.</span> <span id="s1843">Many of my friends were there.</span> <span id="s1844">I had no family, but very many family members of my wife, who had come from Bern.</span> <span id="s1845">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: Where was your wife during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: Beg your pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Where was your wife during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: Oh, she is Swiss, she was born in Switzerland, and she -- she stayed in Switzerland all her life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: And she’s a Swiss citizen.</span> <span id="s1852">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Can you explain what you meant by it was very emotional?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Oh, I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1855">I think [indecipherable] and it was probably just a -- a normal, pleasant ceremony by the [indecipherable] de Geneva, a man named Saffron, who passed away only a few years ago.</span> <span id="s1856">And after that, something eventful happened.</span> <span id="s1857">The brother of an uncle of mine had survived as a Jew in Berlin, and he invited my wife and me to spend our honeymoon in Berlin.</span> <span id="s1858">So we traveled t-to Berlin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: When did you make contact with the man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">A: Long before ’49, I found him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: How did you find him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: How did I find him, well I had found my aunt in Chile, and her first husband had survived the war in Shanghai, and returned to Berlin after the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1863">And my aunt told my uncle in Berlin who I was and where I was.</span> <span id="s1864">So we made contact with each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: He -- who contacted who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1869">So anyway, we spent our honeymoon in Berlin, and I walked around with my wife for hours, showing her where I was born, where I went to school, where the synagogue was where I sang as a -- and also one day we went for a walk and I showed her where an aunt of mine had her hairdressing salon before the war.</span> <span id="s1870">And as we stood there, two German women came and asked us is there anything we’re looking for.</span> <span id="s1871">So I told her, yes, before the war, my aunt had a hairdressing salon here.</span> <span id="s1872">And they said, she’s living on the second floor.</span> <span id="s1873">That was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1874">So we walked up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: What -- what -- what was her name?</span> <span id="s1876">A: Paula Hakker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: And how was she your aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: She was married to my mother’s brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1880">Did you have much to do with her before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Yes, yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: You had memories of her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: What sort of memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: Oh, I -- I don’t know, just re -- just as children.</span> <span id="s1886">We play -- we played with -- I played with her two daughters, my cousins.</span> <span id="s1887">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: I-I’d like it if you could just relate as much detail about that meeting with these two German women outside the hairdresser.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Well, they basically -- as I’ve told you, they asked me whether I was looking for anything, and I told her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Were they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: They were bystanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: They were bystanders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: They were bystanders.</span> <span id="s1894">So I went up there, and there, lo and behold, was my aunt with one of my cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: One of her children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1897">She had two daughters, two -- and they were -- both daughters were my first cousins.</span> <span id="s1898">One daughter was there with my aunt, the other dau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: What -- what -- and her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: The name of my cousin?</span> <span id="s1901">Vera.</span> <span id="s1902">Vera Hakker.</span> <span id="s1903">And the other, her sister, Vera’s sister Edna was at that time in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1904">The reason why they, my aunt and my cousins had survived was because my aunt wasn’t Jewish.</span> <span id="s1905">Her husband, my mother’s brother was Jewish, and he had perished during the war, but she had survived, and so did her two daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: She stayed there the whole --</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: -- during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: So suddenly I had two first cousins.</span> <span id="s1910">Vera has passed away in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1911">Edna lives in San Diego in California.</span> <span id="s1912">She’s a year older than I.</span> <span id="s1913">So suddenly I had left --</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">Q: What -- what was the reunion like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">A: Oh, we cried.</span> <span id="s1916">And Vera had a son, so I suddenly had a second cousin as well.</span> <span id="s1917">And after awhile we went back, the honeymoon was over for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: How long did you spend then, in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: A week, I think.</span> <span id="s1920">Then I went back to Geneva, and I brought my cousin Vera to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1921">She then got married in Switzerland, to a man called [indecipherable] Templehoff, and came to live in Switzerland with her young son.</span> <span id="s1922">And that son, my second cousin became Swiss, did all the schooling in Switzerland, became a very high ranking officer in the Swiss army, and lives there, has two children, who are my third cousins.</span> <span id="s1923">And between his two children, I think they have five children, so I have fir -- second, third and fourth cousins in Switzerland today, from nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: You’re in contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: All the time.</span> <span id="s1926">I visit them regularly, we are in contact by email, by telephone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1928">What sort of contact did you maintain with your aunt who stayed in Germany after you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: My aunt didn’t stay in Germany all that much longer.</span> <span id="s1930">Her daughter Edna in Sweden, emigrated with her husband to the United States, and my aunt followed her shortly after.</span> <span id="s1931">She’s passed away a long time ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1933">Over the years did you go and see them, or did they come to see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Nobody came t -- oh, my cousin came to see me here in Australia on a number of occasions, but I have been to Switzerland numerous times, and I always visit them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: At that time in Germany, with this stroke of good luck, did it encourage you to make out -- any other attempts at finding other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: Well, I did, but I -- I found out very quickly from the Jewish community there that they’d all perished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1938">What had your aunt told you, if anything, about her perspective of the war years in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">A: I’m not sure that we talked much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1941">Was it uncomfortable --</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: No, I-I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: -- because she wasn’t Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: -- we just talked -- no, no, no, no, not at all.</span> <span id="s1945">I don’t know, we may -- if we did I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1946">I mean, don’t forget, this happened in ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">Q: What had happened to her husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">A: He was deported.</span> <span id="s1949">He was deported, but the uncle of the brother of the uncle where -- who invited us to have our honeymoon in Berlin, he was married also to a non-Jewish German woman, and he survived.</span> <span id="s1950">And I don’t know whether the name Rosenstrasse means anything to you.</span> <span id="s1951">The last Jews to be deported from Berlin were those married to non-Jewish women.</span> <span id="s1952">And they were all one day rounded up and put into a building that was located in the Rosenstrasse, and the -- their German wives arri -- assembled in front of the headquarters of that establishment and protested day and night, day and night, to release their husband.</span> <span id="s1953">And in the event -- in the end, the Gestapo gave -- g-gave in and released them all.</span> <span id="s1954">And a film has been made of that, I don’t know if you’ve seen the film.</span> <span id="s1955">And my aunt was one of those women in the Rosenstrasse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Have you discussed that with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: N-No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1958">No.</span> <span id="s1959">She just told me about it, maybe I did discuss it with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: At that time, when you were in Germany she told you about it, when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: My uncle told me, and she did.</span> <span id="s1964">But it was only in recent years, maybe two or three years, that a German film producer produced a -- it wasn’t a documentary, it was a film.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: About what the non-Jewish wives did to get their husband released.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: What sort of numbers were involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: I think several hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: If you like I’ll lend you the movie, I -- it was also shown in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: I have seen it.</span> <span id="s1972">But for the purpose of this interview, is there anything else that -- significant that you remember your aunt telling you about her efforts --</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: No, not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: -- at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: Not -- not that I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Then we went back to Geneva after the honeymoon and we found a position in the ORT Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">Q: Just one more question about Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: What was it like for you revisiting Germany, your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: I -- I -- I -- to tell you the truth, I don’t remember what it was like.</span> <span id="s1982">It was certainly not a pleasant experience.</span> <span id="s1983">I’ve been back to Germany many, many times after the war, mostly on business, and partly to visit my uncle until he passed away.</span> <span id="s1984">I don’t -- I feel terribly uncomfortable in Germany to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">A: Because of what happened to my family and to me.</span> <span id="s1987">I mean, I get a pension from the German government, and every year I have to go to the German consulate here to make sure -- because I’m under certificate of life, that I’m still alive, and I dread that experience.</span> <span id="s1988">I get it over with as fast as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">Q: When you say you’re not comfortable there, is it the local population that makes you uncomfortable, or the memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: Already when I see the soldiers at immigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: I can’t get out of Germany fast enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: What was it like seeing your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: That was -- didn’t exist any more when I got there, it was bombed.</span> <span id="s1995">So you could argue that if Hitler hadn’t sent me to a concentration camp, I would probably have been -- I would probably have died during the allied air raid bombardment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1997">And your aunt’s hairdresser looked the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s1998">A: We didn’t go in it, she didn’t own it any more at that time, it was somebody else.</span> <span id="s1999">But that building survived the war intact, and it looked as a va -- as I remembered it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Any other significant landmarks that you remember that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: That were intact?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: Okay, so after a week you went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: We went back to Geneva, we found a position at the ORT Institute in a place called Arni near Geneva.</span> <span id="s2008">They needed a married couple, one of whom was to re -- run the administration, which I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: And one to look after the well-being of the students and other tasks, which my wife did.</span> <span id="s2011">And we worked there for about a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Had your wife received an education?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: Oh yes, my wife had a normal education --</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: -- in Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: She was a law clerk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2019">So where were you living in Geneva?</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">A: At the institute in a place called Arni.</span> <span id="s2021">It was an institute by ORT to train teachers, not to train students, but to tra -- to train teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: So there was accommodation for the employees?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: Accommodation in the institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: As well as for the student?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: And then one day --</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: And anything significant that you can tell us about the work that you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: No, not really, not really.</span> <span id="s2030">It was uneventful, except for one event which eventually led us to come to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Just before we get there, sorry, where were the students from?</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">A: From all over, from France, from Belgium, from Bulgaria, from Holland.</span> <span id="s2033">From many, many European nations.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: People that had survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yeah, young tradesmen who learned to be teachers to take up positions in various ORT schools throughout the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: They didn’t teach tradesmen [indecipherable] the people who got there were already tradesmen, to a very large extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: So what age were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: 18 - 20 - 22.</span> <span id="s2040">Se -- many of them were older than my wife and me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2042">Had you discussed any of their experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">A: I’m sure we did, but I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">Q: Okay, so you were starting to tell me about some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Then one day we were told that some prominent visitors from Australia would arrive to have a look at the institute.</span> <span id="s2046">It happened to be Leo Fink, Mina Fink, and their daughter Yvonne, who was a young girl then.</span> <span id="s2047">And we got on very well with each other, and they suggested, why don’t you come to Australia, seeing that you can’t stay in Switzerland forever?</span> <span id="s2048">And the idea appealed to us, and we decided there and then to apply for a landing permit to emigrate to Australia.</span> <span id="s2049">We got it finally, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: After how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">A: A matter of months.</span> <span id="s2052">We had to go through health checks and all sorts of things.</span> <span id="s2053">And we left Europe from Italy in October ’49, and arrived in Melbourne on Cup day.</span> <span id="s2054">[indecipherable] 1950 -- in October 1950 we left, and we arrived in Melbourne on the first Tuesday in November, on Melbourne Cup day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: The other people on the boat with you -- it was an Italian ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: It was a -- it was a Greek ship, which left from Genoa, the Sirenia, and it was full of refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">Q: Did you make friends on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Some friends of ours from Switzerland were on the same boat, mainly because we were -- spent time with each other, we didn’t make many friends.</span> <span id="s2059">Acquaintances perhaps, not friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">Q: All refugees --</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: -- emigrating to Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s2064">Before I left, I visited a man named Jack Salmonovitz in Geneva, whom I had met during my stay there.</span> <span id="s2065">He was probably at that time the wealthiest Jew in the whole of Switzerland, and the owner of a very large multi-national firm, with offices among -- in just about every port in the world including Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2066">I visited him and told him that I was going to Australia, to Melbourne, and if he had a position there for me, I’d be very interested perhaps to join his firm.</span> <span id="s2067">So he gave me a letter of introduction to the Melbourne office, and I was engaged on the spot there and then.</span> <span id="s2068">So I had a job within days of arriving here.</span> <span id="s2069">And I worked there from 1950 to 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: What was the name of the company?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: The -- the English name was called General Superintendents Company.</span> <span id="s2072">The French name -- and it was a firm from Geneva, was called, Societe Generale de [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2073">It’s a huge firm, nobody knows about it.</span> <span id="s2074">I’m sure you haven’t heard about it, or you.</span> <span id="s2075">It has a monopoly probably bigger than Bill Gates with Microsoft today.</span> <span id="s2076">There are very, very few competitors in the field in which they operate.</span> <span id="s2077">And it was a fascinating eight years that I spent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: Wha -- what exactly is their field?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: That takes some time to explain.</span> <span id="s2080">When overseas buyers, for instance, buy a cargo of wheat, or a cargo or iron ore, or a cargo of [indecipherable] from Australia, they pay for it the minute the ship leaves the Australian port, without knowing really, whether the iron ore or the coal or the wheat correspond exactly to the specifications that they had contracted to buy.</span> <span id="s2081">They needed somebody on the spot -- the buyer needed somebody on the spot here in Melbourne to confirm that.</span> <span id="s2082">To sample the cargo, analyze it and advise the buyer, in those days telegraphically, what the business with [indecipherable] whether the cargo complied with the specifications.</span> <span id="s2083">And only then did the overseas buyer pay by telegraphic transfer.</span> <span id="s2084">And that firm did that for -- throughout the world, and is today still one of the largest firms in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2085">Their shares are probably 10 times as much as the biggest banks in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2086">The firm is now quoted on the stock exchange, and then the Salmonovitz family probably have only a small stake in it.</span> <span id="s2087">But it grew into a huge firm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2089">Who had started that business?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Mr. Jack Salmonovitz as a young man when he worked at the port of Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2093">That was -- it’s a legend, I don’t -- I’m not even sure if it’s true, there’s so many anecdotes going around about that man.</span> <span id="s2094">But the anecdote that I heard was that he was working as a port laborer in Antwerp, and he saw flour being loaded at one end of the ship, and being unloaded half an hour later at the other.</span> <span id="s2095">So he got to the shipper of the flour and says, are you happy with what’s happening?</span> <span id="s2096">He says -- the fellow apparently told him, I don’t know what’s happening, but I lose half my cargo every time.</span> <span id="s2097">That gave him the idea of starting an inspection company.</span> <span id="s2098">Now, that’s a legend, I don’t know if it’s true.</span> <span id="s2099">There are many anecdotes about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: But he was a wonderful man, died in his 80’s, and a wonderful family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: So he wrote a letter for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: He ge -- sent a letter of introduction to me, to the Melbourne office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: And who did you see in the Melbourne office?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: The s -- the boss.</span> <span id="s2106">Fellow by the name of Falby, F-a-l-b-y.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q: An Australian man?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A: An Englishman, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: And he engaged me, because a lot of the international correspondence was conducted in German, and in French, and th -- they only had Australian employees, none of whom spoke a foreign language.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: So they needed me.</span> <span id="s2113">And I worked there for eight years, and rose to the position of manager, in the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: In the same company?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: In the same company [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2116">I was really very happy there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Where were you living when you first arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A: In a rented room in Oakley.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q: A room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: In somebody’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: Somebody Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: No.</span> <span id="s2125">A friend of mine who arrived here in Australia before me from Geneva, had rented that room for me.</span> <span id="s2126">But we didn’t stay there very long, only a matter of weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: Who greeted you at the port when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: A number of officers from the Jewish welfare society and a couple of friends from Geneva who had arrived here before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: And they took me to the place in Oakley.</span> <span id="s2131">So after eight years at that firm --</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Did you own a car?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: I -- I didn’t own a car when I arrived, but I was given a company car in 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: And in ’58, I was headhunted by one of the clients of that firm, a Jewish export/import firm by the name of Heine Brothers.</span> <span id="s2136">It was owned by a man called Walter Heine who hailed from Leipzig, who came to Australia on the Donera, and he start -- as soon as possible after the war, he started that export/import firm.</span> <span id="s2137">We had long before become close friends, and I was in -- initially very reluctant to join him because I enjoyed the position I had with General Superintendents, but in the end I succumbed, he was a very persuasive man.</span> <span id="s2138">I earned a lot more there than I earned for the Swiss firm.</span> <span id="s2139">And I joined him, and I’ve been there ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: Still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: I still have a peripheral involvement with the firm, although not on a day to day basis.</span> <span id="s2142">He passed away in 1978 at -- and his widow and his two sons recommended that I become the chief executive officer until his two sons, who were teenagers at that time, or very young, were old enough to run the firm.</span> <span id="s2143">And so I became chief executive, chairman and chief executive in 1978, and I progressively retired from the mid-80’s, first of all relinquishing the position of chief executive [indecipherable] executive chairman and I gradually retired from there.</span> <span id="s2144">I still have an association with them, but only marginal.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">A: But the two men who know [indecipherable] -- well, the firm in its original state doesn’t exist any more, it became a Merchant Bank, which it was eventually taken over by a Dutch bank that operates in Australia, ING, [indecipherable] the world’s eighth largest bank, I think.</span> <span id="s2147">We were listed on the stock exchange in the end, and we were taken over.</span> <span id="s2148">That was it.</span> <span id="s2149">So the two Heine brothers, the two young men -- well, they’re not young any more, one of them is already a grandfather, they pursue their own interests now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: What can you say about the local Australian population, in the years [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: I must say I feel extremely comfortable here.</span> <span id="s2152">I have, in the course of my career at Heine Brothers met people in the highest places, from the governor general and prime minister, down, and met Australians at all levels throughout my business, and I do not think I’ve had one unpleasant experience in all those years.</span> <span id="s2153">So I’m very grateful that the Swiss insisted that I leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: In retrospect.</span> <span id="s2156">Now, I’m a Swiss citizen.</span> <span id="s2157">I could, if I wanted to, go back and live there, but I wouldn’t dream of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2159">So looking back you have no regrets coming to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s2161">And nor has my wife, who is a native of Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2162">We’re both very happy here, and we’re happy with the choice we made.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Do you think that your effects, the effects of the war, the experiences that you endured, do you think that that has had an effect on you as a parent bringing up children in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: I’m not sure that I can answer that question.</span> <span id="s2165">I belong to that category of Holocaust survivors who do not talk to their children about it, for a number of reasons, first of all, I think this was my way of coping with it, not talking about it.</span> <span id="s2166">And secondly, it’s really, I think impossible for anybody to fully comprehend what happened there, and I didn’t want to burden them with the trauma, I wanted them to have as normal an upbringing a-as possible, without being neurotic about what happened in the past.</span> <span id="s2167">Perhaps I’ve done the right thing, perhaps I’ve done the wrong thing, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2168">I mean, my children know all about it, they’ve seen the sp -- the tape that I -- came from the Spielberg interview, so it’s not that they don’t know about it, but we don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: How do you think the events shaped you as a person?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: I’ve heard that question [indecipherable] very difficult to answer I don’t know what -- what sort of a person I would have been, had I had a normal upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: I really don’t know how to answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2174">Is there a message that you would like to leave to your children and to future generations?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Be alert.</span> <span id="s2176">I think anti-Semitism is rising throughout the world.</span> <span id="s2177">We are probably today no longer target number one, Muslims have taken over that spot.</span> <span id="s2178">But you never know what’s around the corner.</span> <span id="s2179">I’m a great supporter -- perhaps a one -- the one thing that shaped my attitude is that I am a great supporter of Israel.</span> <span id="s2180">I -- not only have I done business with Israel, but I’ve also been chairman and treasurer of the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce.</span> <span id="s2181">And I still -- and I was a board member for many years -- and I still visit them at least once a week, and I have a very intense involvement with their activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Do you visit Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A: Many times.</span> <span id="s2184">I was there just three or four months ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2186">For business or for pleasure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: For -- for pleasure, but wasn’t actually pleasure.</span> <span id="s2188">My wife’s brother lived in Israel since 1948 and he became very ill, so we went to visit him, before -- before it was too late for him, or for that matter for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">Q: Did you take your children to Israel when they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: Yes, my children, I’ve taken my children to Israel, and I think they enjoyed their visits very much, and I think they were very profoundly impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2192">Have your children been to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: With you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: No, no, on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: Do you know what their impressions were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: I think [indecipherable] looked at Germany as a non-Jewish Australian would, without being burdened by what happened to their father.</span> <span id="s2198">I think, but I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2199">I didn’t ask them, they didn’t tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q: Did you give your children a Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A: Only to the extent that they went to non-Jewish schools, but I took them every Sunday morning to Sunday school at the temple in Abber Road.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2203">Can we just take a short break?</span> <span id="s2204">Can you tell us about your Jewish identity in Australia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: Well, I’ve always been involved in Jewish organizations ever since I arrived in Australia, and I have only had two positions in Australia, and both were for Jewish firms.</span> <span id="s2206">The Geneva firm was Jewish owned, and Heine Brothers was Jewish owned.</span> <span id="s2207">I’ve never in my whole life worked for a non-Jewish firm, although the clients of the firm were overwhelmingly non-Jewish, and I got on extremely well with every one of them.</span> <span id="s2208">So I feel consciously very, very Jewish, but I have no problem in dealing with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">Q: Did you mix socially with both?</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">A: Most of our social contacts of most of our friends today are Jewish, but we have a small number of non-Jewish friends with whom we are very, very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2212">What about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: My children -- my son is a doctor, and he lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne, he has a clinic there that employs six doctors and he is very, very happy to live in a small place of 8000 inhabitants with one traffic light.</span> <span id="s2214">He wouldn’t want to live in Melbourne any more.</span> <span id="s2215">My daughter is a nurse.</span> <span id="s2216">She has four children.</span> <span id="s2217">She also loves living in small places.</span> <span id="s2218">She lives in Victor Harbor in south Australia.</span> <span id="s2219">Again as a -- a place with a population of 8000 people.</span> <span id="s2220">She has four children, one of whom is 26, she works as a food technologist at Nestlé.</span> <span id="s2221">Number two is a paramedic in Adelaide.</span> <span id="s2222">Number three is in his final year of studies of agriculture at Adelaide University.</span> <span id="s2223">The youngest, a girl, Emily is in her final year at school.</span> <span id="s2224">My son has three children, and they’re all at universities in Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2225">Two at Melbourne University, and one at Monash University.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Do you have a lot of contact with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Well, with the [indecipherable] their own lives, but we see them regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: What about the i -- the Jewish identity of your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: My children know that they are Jewish, they know all about Jewish customs, they’ve been involved in Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s2230">My son in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2231">My daughter was very involved, my son was Bar Mitzvah, my daughter was Bat Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s2232">But they have both married out.</span> <span id="s2233">I think their children know relatively little about Judaism.</span> <span id="s2234">That’s something I’m not particularly proud of, but I’ve learned to live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: Did they have Bar Mitzvahs, the boys?</span> <span id="s2236">Your grandsons?</span> <span id="s2237">A: No, none of them, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2239">So you say you’re not -- you’re not proud of it, it’s -- you’ve learned to live with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Is it something that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: Th-There was nothing else I could do about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2244">Did they grow up mixing with Jewish chil -- socializing with Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: No, they -- they went to a -- non-Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s2246">My son went to Trinity College in his final years, and my daughter went to [indecipherable] secondary school.</span> <span id="s2247">And whilst many of their friends were Jewish, they also had many non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s2248">[indecipherable] since they were at university, somehow, I don’t know, Judaism drifted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A: They found non-Jewish partners, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2252">And is your wife of the same opinion as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: Yes, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2254">Q: So at this stage in your life, do you still participate in the celebration of festivals, Jewish festivals?</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: Synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2258">We had a Seder, celebrate Hanukah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: We go, not every year, to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2261">We’re still members of the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2262">We don’t go very often, but o-on occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: And your children and grandchildren participate in the Passover Seder?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: When they are in Melbourne, yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: Otherwise, who do you spend it with?</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: With friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: With friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2270">I’d like to ask you, is there -- is there a message that you would like to leave?</span> <span id="s2271">I asked you before, but is there anything that -- that you’ve thought of subsequently, to your grandchildren and to future generations, based on your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: Well, I don’t talk to them about my experiences.</span> <span id="s2273">I tell them very often something that my father hammered into me when I was a young child.</span> <span id="s2274">He said never mind the 10 commandments, just live after the 11th commandment.</span> <span id="s2275">I asked him what the 11th commandment, never do unto others what you don’t want others to do unto you.</span> <span id="s2276">If you follow that, all the other 10 commandments are included in that.</span> <span id="s2277">That I’ve been telling them ad nauseum since they were very little.</span> <span id="s2278">And I think they live by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">A: And I think it’s very important to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: You’ve commented several times about the loss of family, and your desire to continue and to have your own family.</span> <span id="s2282">Are there any particular messages you would like to give them about family values?</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">A: Not really, I mean I got married at 21 and many people today ask me how come you got married at -- at that young age.</span> <span id="s2284">And remember, I had nobody at that time.</span> <span id="s2285">My father, my mother, my brother, my sister, they’re all dead, and I was intent on starting a new generation, a new family.</span> <span id="s2286">And I’m very glad I married when I was 21.</span> <span id="s2287">I’m very glad we had our children when we were very young, so that we have now lived to see our children in -- into middle age.</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2289">Do you do anything to commemorate lost family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: We put the outside candles, and that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: For your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: -- and siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: Yeah, well, not for -- not for -- and actually not for my parents, for my wife’s parents because their date of death was known, they died in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2295">But I don’t know when -- when my parents died, and there’s no cemetery for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2297">So there’s no time during the year when you would light a candle for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">A: No, but I think of them all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2300">What are the messages that you remember from your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: I think my parents gave me a very good, Jewish education.</span> <span id="s2302">I think they instilled values in me that I try and installed in my own children, and I have nothing but fond memories of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2304">Thank you.</span> <span id="s2305">Can you tell us about this photo?</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: That photo was sent to me by my aunt, who had survived the war in Chile, and she told me that’s my father and me, when I was very, very young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">Q: Could you have a guess at how old you might have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: Maybe two years, three maybe.</span> <span id="s2309">No more than that.</span> <span id="s2310">That is a picture of my mother and my sister.</span> <span id="s2311">So that would have been taken, assuming that my sister there was one year old, she was born in ’35, so that photo would have been taken in 1936, 70 years ago.</span> <span id="s2312">Amazing that it survived.</span> <span id="s2313">We are worried about the longevity of tapes.</span> <span id="s2314">That is an article that appeared in a Swiss newspaper, on the day, or after the day of our arrival in Switzerland on the 23rd of June, 1945.</span> <span id="s2315">We arrived from Buchenwald and the article, in the German language, describes basically how we came there, why we came there, and basically a little bit of background that we had all spent time in a concentration camp, and that we came to Switzerland for recuperation.</span> <span id="s2316">This is a photo taken by a press photographer in Switzerland on our arrival before we disembarked from the train, also on the 23rd of June, 1945.</span> <span id="s2317">And this is wa -- this was also taken on our arrival in Switzerland, and I am almost certain that I am the person who has his hat out of the window on that photo.</span> <span id="s2318">Another photo taken on the 23rd of June, 1945, this is probably, at least as far as I’m concerned the most precious one, because three of the boys who are on that photo, except the one on the extreme left, came to Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2319">The two on the right, Jack [indecipherable] and Montek Akerfelt have regrettably passed away in recent times, and Joe Baker is still very much alive, and a very prosperous businessman in Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2320">Another photo taken on the same -- on the occasion of our arrival.</span> <span id="s2321">The only person I recognize on that photo is Moneek Freidman who is the boy on the extreme left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2323">One here, one here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: Ah, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: Again a photo taken by the press photographer.</span> <span id="s2327">Regrettably, neither I nor any of the persons whom I have consulted, know the name of that person.</span> <span id="s2328">That’s my wife, Rifka, and we’ve been married now for 57 years, and hopefully it’ll last.</span> <span id="s2329">This is my daughter Ruth, her son Anthony, her daughter Emily, her son Adam, and her son Daniel.</span> <span id="s2330">These are the three children of my son.</span> <span id="s2331">This is Elizabeth, this is Jeremy, this is Rachel.</span> <span id="s2332">All of them students at Melbourne University at the moment.</span> <span id="s2333">This is a document confirming my status as a refugee.</span> <span id="s2334">This is a diploma confirming that I have successfully completed my apprenticeship as a dental technician in Geneva.</span> <span id="s2335">This is a do -- my -- the first document issued to me after the war in 1946.</span> <span id="s2336">This was issued by the Swiss government.</span> <span id="s2337">Until then, I had no documentation whatsoever that I existed, or who I was.</span> <span id="s2338">This is a passport photo of me, taken in 1946, 60 years ago.</span> <span id="s2339">You can tell the difference.</span> <span id="s2340">This is a travel document, issued to me by the Swiss government in 1947.</span> <span id="s2341">I needed it because it was the first time I left Switzerland for Berlin to visit my uncle.</span> <span id="s2342">This photo is of my son Denny.</span> <span id="s2343">He lives in Castlemaine, about 150 kilometers north of Melbourne.</span> <span id="s2344">He’s a medical practitioner by profession, but a very dedicated and enthusiastic musician, and at the moment he is the director of the Melbourne Mandolin orchestra.</span> <span id="s2345">You asked me earlier whether I recollect the interview by Professor Boder.</span> <span id="s2346">That interview took place, I believe in August 1946, approximately 14 months after my arrival in Switzerland from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2347">During that period, and in the month after that, we were interviewed almost on a weekly basis, by the Swiss government, the Swiss Red Cross, Swiss newspapers, Swiss radio stations, Jewish organizations in Switzerland, America, Canada, Australia and South America.</span> <span id="s2348">We averaged, as I said, about one interview a week and I really do not recollect that particular interview.</span></p> <p><span
