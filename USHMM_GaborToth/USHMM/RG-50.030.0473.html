town south of Lwów, and he started his schooling in [indecipherable] but decided to leave it and went to regular public school.</span> <span id="s30">And then he went to an educational seminary to become a teacher and then he became inspector of schools, and then he went into business and moved to Lwów.</span> <span id="s31">And my mother’s -- her maiden name w-was Philip, and she was from Lwów, and her mother was from Kraków.</span> <span id="s32">And my parents married, my father was already a little older, I think, and he was like nine years older than my mother, and -- and they had two children, my sister Janina, or Janine as you would say in English, and myself.</span> <span id="s33">My sister was born in 1923, I was born in 1925.</span> <span id="s34">There was only like a year and a half difference between us, so we were very close.</span> <span id="s35">And we were a very close family.</span> <span id="s36">My father worked in an office downstairs in the same house where we lived, and actually my mother worked with him, and we had help, domestic help in the apartment.</span> <span id="s37">And we were a close family mostly, with my mother’s sisters, my aunts and uncles.</span> <span id="s38">And I had a very warm and nice childhood.</span> <span id="s39">I grew up very secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: Tell me what did your father do?</span> <span id="s41">What sort of business was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: He was representing a number of large companies in the region like Lever Brothers and some companies from Holland.</span> <span id="s43">And it was mostly products that didn’t require refrigeration, was like starch and -- and soap powders, things like this.</span> <span id="s44">And so a -- and he was in business of selling to retailers, so that actually he was quite -- we weren’t overly rich, but we were very well-to-so.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: So when -- when you were born, he was already fairly successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: He was fairly successful, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s48">So you -- you grew up in a fairly privileged environment, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Right, right, and my mother’s family, one of my uncles was a very prominent physician and another uncle was a banker and --</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: -- and had his own bank.</span> <span id="s52">And he was the one who arranged the marriage betwe -- my father had been his client -- between my mother my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: He got them acquainted.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Tell me about the per -- your relationship to your father and your relationship to your mother.</span> <span id="s56">Were you closer to one than to the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I may have been a little bit closer to my mother, and my father may have been a little closer to my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: But actually we were all pretty close because we were all in the same house.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: House, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you ever work with your father?</span> <span id="s63">Did you ever --</span></p> <p><span

student as a child, and -- and because my sister was a year and a half older than myself, I f-followed her very closely and I went to school early, because once she went to school, I wanted to go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: So I was always the youngest in my class.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: And I also had private tutoring in German and private tutoring in mathematics because I was particularly interested in mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Were you also close with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: I was very close with my sister.</span> <span id="s77">We actually shared a room for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And was she good to you as an older sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: Ah, sh -- well, we were a little jealous of each other sometimes, but she was good to me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: And what were you jealous about?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Because she was a year older, so she was doing things a little bit ahead of me, but -- but we became even closer when we became refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Because then the family got really close.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you ever do things alone with your father or alone with your mother, going for walks, or going to -- I don’t know if there were cultural things in the city, or to a museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Mostly I was doing things with my sister with the people who were taking care of us.</span> <span id="s88">But we s -- seldom -- my father was very serious, he was seldom playful with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: He was seldom playful?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s92">And your mother was more so?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: My mother a little more so, but she also was very busy working and looking after things in the house, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s95">So did you -- did you have a lot of help in the house?</span> <span id="s96">Did you ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: We had somebody who cooked, and somebody who cleaned.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: And then as babies we had -- once we had a fräulein, a German lady, and once we had a mademoiselle, a French mademoiselle, so -- who took us for walks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So did you learn both languages?</span> <span id="s101">How many languages?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I -- I learned Fr-French and German.</span> <span id="s103">Of course, we spoke Polish at home, and -- and then during the war I learned a little Hebrew and Italian because I was in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: So when I met my wife I told her I knew five languages, and she was impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And did she test you on that?</span> <span id="s107">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Tested my French and she’s pretty good at French herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Were you in an environment where Polish Jews and Polish Christians were mixing, that you yourself were within a very integrated kind of setting, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s111">Socially, a-and family-wise, the family was Jewish and most of our close friends were Jewish, but -- but we were an assimilated family and we were in quite an integrated environment and I went to a school where majority of the kids were not Jewish and -- both in the elementary school and in the high school.</span> <span id="s112">I went to public high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: I went to a private elementary school because I was too young to go to the public high school, and the private school took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: And was this a comfortable environment?</span> <span id="s116">When you say that you were assimilated as Jews, did this also mean that you celebrated Jewish holidays and went to the synagogue, or you didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: We definitely -- my parents belonged to what was called the temple, which is the -- was the largest synagogue in the city, and it was called Progressive Judaism, which is similar to American Conservative Judaism.</span> <span id="s120">And -- and my father had a seat, you had to buy seats and my father had a seat downstairs and my mother had a seat on the balcony, in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Where the women sat.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s123">And I sat with my dad, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Q: And your sister sat upstairs, or with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Yes, upstairs, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Upstairs.</span> <span id="s127">So did you go during the holidays, or did you go every Shabbat, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: No, no, we went just during holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yeah, right.</span> <span id="s131">My parents were not very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: But they definitely were Jewish, but not extremely religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Not -- right.</span> <span id="s135">So I could -- should I assume that you were not kosher in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: We were not kosher.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s138">Or anywhere, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: And how was it for you to be in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: We ate matzoh on Passover --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: -- but sometimes I had ham on the matzoh.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: On the -- [laughs].</span> <span id="s147">Did you experience anti-Semitism as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: As I was growing up there was anti-Semitism growing in Poland, beginning around 1934, and it was particularly evident at universities, and -- because Jewish students were not -- were told to sit in back benches and were not allowed sometimes to -- to even attempt classes [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s149">And -- and some of the -- interestingly enough, the university students were what was called open index.</span> <span id="s150">N -- N.D. stands for National Democracy which is -- was the sort of right wing party, which was very anti-Semitic, and they sometimes would make -- not pogroms in the sense that somebody was completely bludgeoned to death, but they would beat up J-Jews in the street occasionally.</span> <span id="s151">And I learned to avoid big gangs of students, and -- and sometimes there were just stupid people who were anti-Semitic, but most of the people in the city were very well integrated because the -- the city itself had been under Austrian occupation and had a lot of Jew -- 30 percent of the residents were Jews, and -- and in addition Polish Catholics, there were Greek Orthodox, and there were Ukrainians and there were Armenians, so it was kind of cosmopolitan [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s153">And your close friends?</span> <span id="s154">You had Jewish friends, and Polish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: I had Jewish friends and Polish friends, but in terms of going to homes of kids, I was closest to the Jewish boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: And did you notice that that was because there was a kind of division, or you think it was just happenstance?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Mostly because sometimes -- it was partly because there was a little division, yeah.</span> <span id="s158">But I was very friendly with many of non-Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: -- people.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Let -- let me go back a little bit.</span> <span id="s162">Were you interested in mathematics as a very tiny kid?</span> <span id="s163">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: I was very interested in mathematics, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Wa -- were -- was this coming from your parents, I mean is there some way to trace it, or it just -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, it’s just a natural interest.</span> <span id="s167">Some kids are interested in music.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I was never very musical.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I liked just playing chess and doing mathematics.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s173">Were there any other subject matters that were of interest to you, or was this your real passion [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: This --</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Mm?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: -- this was the real passion.</span> <span id="s177">I was somewhat interested in history.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did you go to the movies as a kid?</span> <span

chosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: I felt chosen.</span> <span id="s297">I felt I was somehow inspired and privileged.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Did you ever tell anybody about this when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I told my parents, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s301">And -- and did they respond in a way that was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Did they encourage you?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: -- they were a little surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: They were surprised.</span> <span id="s308">Do you think that -- in 1939 you were 14?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Right, when the war comes.</span> <span id="s311">Is there any expectation that there’s going to be a war?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Yes, there was expectation --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: So you expected --</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: -- there was tension in the air because Germany had post ultimatums demanding that Poland give up the corridor between East Prussia and Germany, and -- and they were threatening, and -- and of course, before that was the invasion of Austria by the Germans, so there was a lot of tension.</span> <span id="s315">People expected war.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And how did that affect you and the household?</span> <span id="s317">Was there talk of what you would do if there was a war, or was that not yet --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: It was not yet -- there was talk before the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: -- that I might have to go to study at a foreign university because Polish universities were becoming dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: But we had not talked about leaving Poland before the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: And were you -- you may not know what your parents were aware of, but were you in some sense by this time aware of what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Oh, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: And in Austria --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: -- with respect to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: You were.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: We were -- definitely were, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: So did this make war that much more frightening to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: -- it definitely made war more frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: We knew Germans had bad intentions towards Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: Towards Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s339">And a lot of Germans were -- a lot of Jews were either deported by the Germans into Poland, or were escaping Germany to come to Poland, so that it was common knowledge that things in Germany were just terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: And were people coming to your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Not anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Not anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: That we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: So, on September first, 1939, when the war broke out and bombs start falling, this must have been, even though you expected it, still a shock because the experience was --</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: It was still a shock, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: It was just before the school year started and we were still at home expecting to start school, and suddenly the bombs started falling, and -- and there was -- radios were very primitive in those days, they had crystal radios and you had to sort of tune them up with whiskers.</span> <span id="s350">And we listened.</span> <span id="s351">I used to take a radio to -- to bed to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And do you remember the first time you heard a bomb?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Sure I do, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Can you explain what that was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Well, the -- the bombs number -- they -- they explode and they make a lot of noise, and they, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Were you sleeping, or was this during the day?</span> <span id="s357">Do you re --</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Well, we had si -- to -- w-we had blackouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: We had to cover the windows, and we taped windows with s-stripes, sort of criss-cross --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: -- so that the glass wouldn’t fall and hurt people, so -- and we knew -- it was both at night and in the daytime, yes.</span> <span id="s363">And actually, people stood watch in the neighborhood, on the streets, you know, there were sort of like citizen patrols and it was clearly war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s365">And was there an expectation that the Polish army could actually fight well against the Germans, or wasn’t that sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Well, at -- at first there was, but it soon became clear that the army was losing ground, and -- and my father remembered from the first World War that when a si -- [indecipherable] that sort of advance into central Poland was crossed, that that would mean that the Germans could advance without stopping, and -- and that’s when they started talking about leaving.</span> <span id="s367">And first we talked about just my father and I leaving because men were supposed to be in more danger than women, but then they -- my parents conferred and decided that we all should go.</span> <span id="s368">And there was discussion whether we should go east or south, and my parents weren’t that keen on going towards Russia, so we decided to go south.</span> <span id="s369">And we had a car and -- but our car was requisitioned, because the military were requisitioning all the cars.</span> <span id="s370">And my uncle had a car, and his car was sort of requisitioned, but he was friendly with the provincial governor in Lwów, and he got the pass to keep the car to take the trip south, but to return it later.</span> <span id="s371">So my mother, my aunt conferred and they decided we could go with them.</span> <span id="s372">So my aunt and uncle left some suitcases and took us instead.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Le-Let me ask you a little bit before.</span> <span id="s374">Do you remember the discussions about whether to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes, I d -- remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: You do?</span> <span id="s377">You were sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: I was sitting there because there was the big question whether we were all going, or whether --</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Or just the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: -- just the two of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: And if it was the two of you, was there talk of your going on a bicycle?</span> <span id="s382">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: That was definitely a talk of going on a bicycle because we didn’t have a car, and my father wasn’t so good on the bicycle and I wasn’t so good either, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s385">Now, it seems to me unusual that people would decide so quickly to leave.</span> <span id="s386">A lot of people didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: During first of all the war, my -- independently, my father and my mother’s family went to Vienna to leave the city because it was dangerous to stay in the city, and Vienna was in Austria, so -- so they were used to the notion that --</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: -- if war came, it’s sometimes important to leave [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s392">It was very dramatic to leave, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: We’re going to have to stop for a moment --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: -- to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Julian, you -- you ended by saying that it’s very dramatic -- it was a very dramatic time.</span> <span id="s399">Would -- could you describe what you -- what happened, and how you packed?</span> <span id="s400">If you packed very much, and what you packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Well, it was very dramatic thinking about leaving, and we had number of conferences, and we were ask by my aunt and uncle, since there was very little room in the car for -- there were four of us and my aunt and uncle, that’s six people, and we had a driver because neither my father nor my uncle could drive.</span> <span id="s402">And so it’s seven people, and so we were asked to take, basically knapsacks, and -- back then, it was, and my mother packed a small suitcase and my father packed a small suitcase.</span> <span id="s403">And my sister, very fortunately took pictures, album of pictures, so that was very lucky, and we enjoyed that afterwards.</span> <span id="s404">Years later, it was nice to look back and have the photos.</span> <span id="s405">But we were -- it wasn’t yet full winter, so it was just September, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: -- we didn’t have to pack very heavy clothes up.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: You also had a dog, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: We had a little dog, and it was very tough for us to leave the dog, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: What was the dog’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: It was Gigi.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Gigi?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Which is like a bell ringing in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: And what sort of a -- what sort of a dog was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: It was a -- don’t -- don’t know the English word for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: What was the Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: In Polish it’s called yarmnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Was it a big dog, little dog?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: No, it’s a little dog, and it was very brown and I’m -- I ju -- the name just -- English word --</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: -- slipped out from my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And who -- did you give the dog to somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Well, we left somebody in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: To take care of the dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: To -- well, no, the -- the lady who lived in with us --</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: -- was taking care of the dog.</span> <span id="s430">And then we had janitor downstairs, which -- I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: It’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: What -- what was the hardest part of leaving for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Not knowing what will become of us and where we were going.</span> <span id="s435">That was the hardest.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Were you frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Well, we were frightened, partly that we might get into German hands and partly what will become of us when we are away from home.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s439">Well, let me ask you, it’s going to sound like a bit of a strange question.</span> <span id="s440">Your uncle has a car, you have a ca -- your father has a car, but neither of them drove.</span> <span id="s441">Was this typical of people who had a bit of money?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Yes, it wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: That they have a car with -- without knowing how to drive?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Right, it was typical if you had a car, you could afford the driver, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Did your father want to learn how to drive or he didn't care?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: He wasn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: He wasn’t interested.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: -- interested, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s450">It’s so odd given how in America we’re so car conscious that the notion of having a car without being able to drive is odd, isn’t it.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So this must have been a pretty big car if you had seven people sitting.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Right, it was a Buick --</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: -- with folding seats, so the two kids sit then -- sat in the folding seats, and my aunt -- my mother and my father sat in the back, and my uncle sat in front with the driver.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: So these were two -- like two little folding seats in the back?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s459">Facing --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Facing the adults who were in the rear, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: No, they weren't facing the adults.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: They weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: I think they -- they folded --</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Frontwise?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Frontwise, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s468">So, you leave your house.</span> <span id="s469">Did your -- did -- your father must have taken money with him, or something that he could use as --</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Right, my father took with him all the cash he could get his hands on, and he also had four bars of gold, and he was -- and he put them in a little suitcase and carried them with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s472">So he took Polish zlotys?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s474">But most of the money was Polish z-zlotys, I think.</span> <span id="s475">He may have had a little bit of dollars, or something --</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: -- but not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: So how long a trip was this?</span> <span id="s479">You’re heading south to Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: Well, we didn’t know yet we were going to Romania.</span> <span id="s483">We partly were leaving to get out of the city because it was being bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: But on the roads we saw a lot of people who were displaced and moving and going different places, and occasionally there were German so called stuka bombers who -- which were dropping -- strafing people on the roads.</span> <span id="s486">And we would get out and get in the ditch and then get up.</span> <span id="s487">And sometimes along the road Polish soldiers would stop us and want the car.</span> <span id="s488">And my f -- uncle would flash the papers he had, that he was allowed to have the car.</span> <span id="s489">So we finally made our way to a little town which was south, close to the Romanian border, and my parents must have thought already about going to Romania, but I wasn’t quite --</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: You weren’t quite aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: -- quite aware of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s493">So you were actually leaving and the Germans have yet to occupy.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So you were really ahead of ever -- most people were not doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Right.</span> <span id="s497">And we stopped along the way in my father’s hometown, Rohatyn to say good-bye, so to speak, to his relatives, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Do you think he tried to convince his relatives --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: -- they should leave too?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: No, because we had no way to help them with transportation and they -- I don’t think they discussed leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And do you remember people saying to you, why are you leaving?</span> <span id="s505">I mean, this is -- the people thought this would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: -- a kind of madness on your part.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: -- at that time, there were a lot of people who already had left western Poland, and for example, in our city, in Lwów, my mother’s family had escaped from Kraków, which is more south central Poland, so people were all used to the notion that some people are leaving and going, and roads were full of people.</span> <span id="s509">And people were moving all over the place.</span> <span id="s510">And it was clear that the Germans were going to occupy all of Poland, yes.</span> <span id="s511">But in the end they didn’t because they had the agreement with the Russians, which was at first a secret agreement, it was not known.</span> <span id="s512">So, when we got to [indecipherable] which is a town close to the border, we suddenly realized that the Polish government was evacuating.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: And you saw them evacuating.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: We saw them.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s517">And actually, we saw -- they were like buses which were -- had Polish gold on them, and the bank of Poland was evacuating the gold.</span> <span id="s518">And we saw foreign embassies evacuating, and -- and we saw the provincial governor with a horn, giving the orders or directions regulating the traffic and -- and saying now ministry of foreign affairs, and there would be a bunch of limousines going and there was a bridge and they would go across that bridge to Romania.</span> <span id="s519">So we saw the whole Polish government evacuating.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: And you had to wait, of course, until the whole Polish government --</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: Right.</span> <span id="s522">And we weren’t sure we would be allowed to cross, because there were still both Polish border guards and Romanian border guards.</span> <span id="s523">And we didn’t have a Romanian passport.</span> <span id="s524">But on the 17th of September, the news came on the radio that the Russians had marched in, and many people thought that they were coming to help Poland, and -- attack Hitler, because nobody knew that Stalin and Hitler had a pact.</span> <span id="s525">And -- and there was a lot of discussion whether we should go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: And my father thought that we should not go back and come back after we see the situation is quiet, peaceful and friendly.</span> <span id="s528">So we -- we decided to cross and -- and we basically -- my father had to bribe a Romanian guard to let us cross, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Did you agree with that?</span> <span id="s530">Did you remember thinking about it?</span> <span id="s531">Did you agree with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: -- or you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: -- I want to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: You want to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Go home, yeah.</span> <span id="s537">I was not that smart, and my -- I -- I think it was a wonderful decision my parents made, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: Clearly saved your life, probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: No question about it, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Mm --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: So you do cross into Romania, but your -- the car, the person who was driving your car --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: -- left you a bit earlier than you expected, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Right.</span> <span id="s548">No, he left because he want to go back to his family and that was the deal with him before he drove us, that he would be able to go back and he was supposed to take the car back to the provincial governor, who wanted it, and so my uncle and aunt had passports, and had visas, so they were able to cross earlier, and we crossed later.</span> <span id="s549">And I had also a cousin, their son, who had his own car, and he drove his car with his girlfriend, and he had a passport and a visa, so he was able to cross earlier one.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: So they had a visa to go -- get into Romania?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: So clearly, all the while, they knew that this was going to be where they --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: They must have --</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: They must have known, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: -- been better prepared, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: So, did your parents --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: But we didn't have a visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s559">But you got into Romania, then did you have to get yourself a visa in order to --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: Then we had to register ourselves to stay in Romania, but there were a lot of Polish refugees, and some of them were being put in camps.</span> <span id="s561">But n-not all.</span> <span id="s562">Mostly the military that -- that crossed, were put in camps, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Put in the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: But we first went to what’s in Polish called [indecipherable] and [indecipherable] I think, in Romania, and we stayed there for a couple nights, and then we went to Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: And by then you had a -- I mean, you registered, so you were oka -- you were see --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: I think we registered really in Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Because we were afraid on the train that we might get stopped, but we weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Were you welcomed in some way in Romania, that it was -- was it difficult when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, it was very difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: -- because we didn't have that much money and -- and at first we weren’t official, and -- but then in Bucharest somehow, they were registering Polish refugees and -- and of course Polish government had brought the gold with them, so they must have paid something to the Romanians to allow the Poles who escaped to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span> <span id="s574">And where did you stay in Bucharest?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Well, at first we stayed in a hotel.</span> <span id="s576">It was called Hotel Victoria then it was too expensive.</span> <span id="s577">Then we moved to another hotel, called well, I don’t remember the name exactly, but we lived in one room in the hotel, and we had a hot plate and cooked our meals secretly because you were not supposed to use the hot plate in the hotel room.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: So this is an extremely different situation than what your whole life had been.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: So were there problems between all of you, or were -- were -- did you all remain very calm and -- cause here you are all in one room now.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s584">Well, ah -- there were no problems between us, my mother, my father, my sister and I, but my mother my aunt had a problem, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: And what was that about?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: I’m not sure, but somehow they --</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Now that they were in the same room with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: No, they were in a different --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: They were in another --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: -- hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: They stayed in the first hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s594">So -- but you don’t know what the problem was between your mother and her?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s597">And whose side -- whose -- whose side of the family was the uncle and aunt on, your mother’s side, or your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: My mother and the aunt were sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: My aunt ma -- was my mother’s oldest sister, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: -- she was kind of a little bossy and -- to my mother, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Uh-huh, because she was an older sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: She was quite a bit older, yeah.</span> <span id="s607">There were four sisters, and she was the oldest, and my mother was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s609">Well, one can imagine the difficulties.</span> <span id="s610">Now, did you expect to stay in Romania, or was there always --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No, no, we started immediately -- my parents started going, and my father in particular, to different consulates, looking for a visa to go either to France or to the United States or -- and -- and of course you had to take a train through Italy to get to France, if you didn’t want to go through Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: So it -- and Italy was already allied with Germany, so it was quite complicated.</span> <span id="s614">And I started attending school in Bucharest, first French school, because I didn’t know Romanian, of course.</span> <span id="s615">And in the French school I traded mathematics for French, so -- with other kids, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: So that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: -- I was managing.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, in doing homework.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: But then -- but then a Polish school was formed in Romania, and actually the Polish government registered all the refugees, and may have paid even a small stipend to the refugees so that -- and also the Romanians who were willing to exchange Polish zlotys for Romanian currency at the -- at the beginning, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: So I started going to Polish school, and all the kids in the school, most of them were children of Polish government officials.</span> <span id="s624">And they -- they were the ones who escaped, evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s626">And the person who was principal of the school was the wife of the head of the Polish bank, I gather, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Well, one of the Polish banks.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Not the main Polish bank, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s631">And what was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: Her name was Barrish -- bani -- Mrs. Barrish bani -- Barishowa in Polish, Helena Barishowa.</span> <span id="s633">And -- and she was a very wonderful lady, and made children all feel good.</span> <span id="s634">So I t -- I transferred from the French school to --</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: French school to the Polish --</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: -- the Polish school, yes, Polish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Now did that make you feel a bit more comfortable, because you were with people who came from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Right, and people who were in the same situation, pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Now, are you still one of the few Jews in this group?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: I was one of the few Jews in that school, yes.</span> <span id="s643">There were a few, I wasn’t the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: There were a few, right.</span> <span id="s645">And did this make any difference?</span> <span id="s646">I mean, did -- did --</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: We were all very good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s653">And was everybody interested in getting out of Romania, as far as you could tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Everybody was interest in getting out of Romania, particularly because Romania was itself about to be taken over by the Germans and the king of Romania was basically deposed by the Germans, eventually.</span> <span id="s655">So -- and the Romanians said something was [speaks foreign language here] which is -- was kind of like an Iron Guard, I think, in English, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: You mean the Iron Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: The Iron Cross was it?</span> <span id="s659">Or the Iron Guard [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Iron Guard, and they were very anti-Semitic, so that was a bit of a problem, but it wasn’t very -- it didn’t affect my life too much, except we knew we had to get out of Romania.</span> <span id="s661">So my parents succeeded in getting a visa to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: They couldn’t get a visa --</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Which was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: It was difficult.</span> <span id="s665">They couldn’t get one to the United States, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: No.</span> <span id="s667">My uncle and aunt left for the United States, they got a visa because their son had a visa to the United States.</span> <span id="s668">He was supposed to go to the world -- world exhibition, oh what do you call it?</span> <span id="s669">World --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Now I’m forgetting what the name [indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s671">The World Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: World Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s675">To the World Fair in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Which was in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: And he -- and they an-and their son went and then the son helped them.</span> <span id="s680">They didn’t come to the United States right away, they went to France, and then from France to Portugal, and from Portugal to Cuba.</span> <span id="s681">And then from Cuba they came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: So -- but they left for France, and we left for Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: For Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: Right.</span> <span id="s686">And my father -- we were lucky because that gold that my father had qualified us for what was called a capitalist visa.</span> <span id="s687">In other words, we had enough capital to enter, because Palestine immigration was very limited, and you couldn’t really enter Palestine as an ordinary refugee.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: But you could qualify if you had enough money.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: If you had a certain amount of money, it’s the same nowadays in Canada, if you have enough money you can become a resident of Canada, so a lot of people from Hong Kong --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: -- establish bank accounts and then return to Hong Kong.</span> <span id="s692">Well, this was a similar situation and we were lucky we got --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Do you have any idea how much money it was that your father could afford?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: You don’t have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: And it was only the money that he had with him, and especially the gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Yeah, it was the gold.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: It was all he had, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s702">So you have -- well, tell me something, was it difficult to leave Romania because you’ve now been there from March until September, yes?</span> <span id="s703">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Right.</span> <span id="s705">It was -- it was difficult, we didn’t know what to expect at else --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: -- elsewhere.</span> <span id="s708">But we went by boat from Constanza, which is a -- a harbor in Romania, t -- and actually it was kind of a dream trip because we stopped in Istanbul and in Athens, and I got to see sort of beautiful sights of the world, and then we arrived in Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Well tell me a little bit about the trip.</span> <span id="s710">Who’s -- who is on the boat?</span> <span id="s711">A bunch of refugees like you, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Some refugees, and some people we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s714">Is this a -- a r -- a regular --</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: It was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: A cruise -- not a cruise boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Not a --</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: But a regular boat, was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: A regular boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: -- passenger boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yes, a passenger boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: And what class did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Oh, the lowest class.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: The lowest class, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: Now, had you -- had you bought clothes in Romania, because you came with so little, so did you now have more?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes, we -- we had a little bit more clothes --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: -- yes, we have a few more suitcases, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Than you had before?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: When you stopped in Istanbul and Athens, was it for a few days, did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: No, just for the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Just for the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Yeah, but it was very meaningful and something --</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: -- I remember s -- d-doing sightseeing, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: And what did you see in Istanbul, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I saw the big mosque, and -- and I saw the -- you know, the -- we saw the waters [indecipherable] you know, the city is very beautiful city, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s741">And the same with Athens, you walked around and you --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: In Athens I saw Acropolis, and -- and I just was impressed to see Athens, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s744">So you arrived in March of 1940 to Palestine in Haifa.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: In Haifa, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Do you remember what that was like?</span> <span id="s747">Do you remember that arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Well, I remember, and we were -- we stayed in the place that was on the hill, so we had a beautiful view of the harbor and Haifa is a rather attractive city, and -- and it was a good climate, it was warm, and we felt safe and comfortable with the British controlled territory.</span> <span id="s749">The British were allies of -- of -- I mean, they were fighting the Germans, so that was a different world for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s751">Did you happen to have family in Palestine or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yes, my father’s cousin -- brother -- brother, and his two daughters -- actually, three daughters had emigrated to Palestine before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: So that two of them lived on a kibbutz, and one of them lived in Tel Aviv, so we saw them, they were not very affluent, and they were some distance from Haifa, but we saw them and we enjoyed having the family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So had you intended to go to Tel Aviv?</span> <span id="s756">Did you stay in Haifa for very long, or was that just first few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: For -- maybe for a couple of months, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: And then we moved to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: And were you taught some Hebrew in -- during these couple of months?</span> <span id="s763">Was there a kind of school or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: No, not -- not -- no, no special education in Hebrew and no school til we got to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: And when we got to Tel Aviv, I first started taking courses in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Because we thought of going either to United States or to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: To England.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: And -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: We’re going to have to stop the tape [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Yeah, I -- that’s what I was wondering, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Julian, you s -- you went to a Polish high school again when you got to Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Right.</span> <span id="s779">I didn’t go to a Polish high school right away, first I took a course in English.</span> <span id="s780">Polish high school --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: -- didn’t get established til later, because Polish refugees in Romania were evacuated from Romania to Palestine by the British, but we left, of course, on a visa being Jewish, we left on the visa to Palestine.</span> <span id="s783">And -- and when I first arrived there was no school, so I start taking course for what was called English matriculation.</span> <span id="s784">It was University of London matriculation.</span> <span id="s785">And you can matriculate when you are 16 years old, and -- and I was then ma -- 1940 I was 15.</span> <span id="s786">So I started preparing for the matriculation.</span> <span id="s787">And I was taking these courses and then we learned about the Polish high school being formed, because the refugees arrived, and some of them were our friends from Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: So I went to the Polish school, but I was still studying English to finish the matriculation.</span> <span id="s790">So, when I was 16, I matriculated, which was also equivalent to admission to University of London.</span> <span id="s791">In other words, I could later, when the war ended, become qualified to go -- go to University of London because I had matriculated.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: So were you fluent in English by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: I was -- my mother actually knew a little English and she bought a book and started teaching me English and I wasn’t -- I knew no English when we arrived in Romania, but I started learning a little English from my mother.</span> <span id="s794">And then when I came to Palestine I took the courses and I also went -- there was something called British council and -- and they were giving lessons in English in Jaffa.</span> <span id="s795">I used to go to Jaffa, take lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: And I became not so fluent, but pretty good, you know, good enough to take the exams.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s799">Now, where were you living in Tel Aviv?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: In Tel Aviv we lived at 40 Dizingof Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: At first we lived another place, and then we moved, and actually we moved ourselves with -- my father rented a little cart and we loaded the cart and I pulled it along with my father and we moved to Dizingof Street, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: And did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And we had the little apartment there.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: And how many rooms, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Two room -- two rooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Two rooms?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s809">Two -- three rooms maybe, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: And what was -- did your father start working at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: He was trying to do some business, but mostly my mother started sewing, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: -- wa -- became a seamstress, basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: [indecipherable] try and make money this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: So your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: And then later she started giving sewing lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s819">So your life transforms, not only are you going from country to country, from place to place, but everything about your life turns upside down in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: So does this teach you something?</span> <span id="s822">Does this change your character in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: It made me be very adjustable, and not really pay much attention to amenities and -- and -- and -- and sort of made me view people all equally, not be very concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: And I always felt that I will get educated, I -- I sort of felt the inner drive to get a good education.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Did you lose your idea that you were going to be a prophet?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yes, oh yeah, by then I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: And does your sister go to the Polish high school as well as you?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes, definitely, my sister went to Polish high school, but she did not take the English courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: She didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: She was more interested in French, and she went to Polish high school.</span> <span id="s832">She was a year ahead of me, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: So did you now see your future in what was then Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: No, I always thought that I would go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: And did your parents think that, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: I think they did.</span> <span id="s839">They didn’t feel completely comfortable.</span> <span id="s840">They didn’t know Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: And my father grew up speaking Yiddish actually, and he knew Yiddish.</span> <span id="s843">He always laughed that my mother didn’t speak very good Yiddish.</span> <span id="s844">I mean, we all understood a little bit of Yiddish --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: -- but my father knew it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: But -- but Hebrew was a little different and -- and my father was at that time thinking more of the future for the children than for himself, and he thought the kids would be better off in America, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: Do you -- can you give me some idea of how old your parents were at this time?</span> <span id="s850">Is your father in his 50’s maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: My father.</span> <span id="s852">I -- I’m not very good at ages.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: My father was 40 or so when I was born, maybe 40 --</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: Okay, so he’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: -- 42 maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So he’s in his mid to late 50’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Late fifties --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s862">And your mother is nine years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Yeah, or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s865">Now, are you learning Hebrew, is your sister learning Hebrew?</span> <span id="s866">Is --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Well, my sister was not particularly interested in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: And I am -- learned a little bit, but I had no formal lessons, so I learned just by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s871">So what was it like living there in Tel Aviv then?</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Ah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: What do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Tel Aviv was, of course, next to Haifa.</span> <span id="s875">Haifa was Arab, and Tel Aviv was Jewish, and there were a lot of people from different parts of the world speaking different languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: In Tel Aviv, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: In Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s878">And Hebrew was not yet such an official language, you know, so the younger people all spoke it, but the older people spoke usually the European languages they had come with.</span> <span id="s879">So -- and it was very hot in the summer, that’s one problem with living in Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s881">It’s very humid, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: And -- and -- and the climate -- I mean, it doesn’t get so cold, but it -- but it gets very hot, yeah.</span> <span id="s883">And I never really liked the sun so much, so that was one of the problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Did you go swimming in the sea?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Yes, I did, yes.</span> <span id="s886">Went swimming in the sea --</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: -- went swimming in pools.</span> <span id="s889">And we -- in the Polish high school we sometimes went in groups as friends to the beach.</span> <span id="s890">And we -- but you know, the war was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: -- and we were getting terrible news from Poland already by then, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: And are you getting news of the killings, or are you getting news of both?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: We were getting news of the killings, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Uh-huh, you were.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s897">Because some people were escaping from Romania, sometimes letters were coming, and we were beginning to get bad news.</span> <span id="s898">And -- and in the Polish high school, m-many of the colleagues in my class had already -- were already soldiers in uniform who were on leave to finish school.</span> <span id="s899">So we were all thinking of going back to war to fight Hitler at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s901">And what was it like politically in -- in Palestine at this time?</span> <span id="s902">Were you aware of the kinds of --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Well, politically I was very aware of Jewish effort to make Palestine into a Jewish state, and actually I had some more distant relatives, and one of them was in Haganah, which is -- was the Jewish underground [indecipherable] organization, and he tried to recruit me, and I went to a secret meeting, and -- but I decided I really didn’t want to fight the British, I wanted to fight the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">Q: And did you have a sense that there ought to be a Jewish state, or this was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Oh yes, I definitely --</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: -- had a sense that there ought to be a Jewish state, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: I think all Jews had that.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: But at -- at this very young age, you did not want to stay there and fight the British in order to get a Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Right.</span> <span id="s912">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s914">So what --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Well my -- my priority was to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s916">I was -- I was more interested in ending the war in Europe, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: You’re studying at -- in the high school, but you’ve already attended some high school, so what class do you start in when you’re in Tel Aviv?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: And is high school four years the way it is here?</span> <span id="s920">It’s not.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: Well, in Polish -- in the Polish system just before the war and even now, it is six years of elementary school, and then four years of high school, and two years of something called lycee -- Lyceum or Lyceum in Polish, and -- but the -- th-the six years altogether were sort of called high school because it was one unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: And in Poland they were separate, but here they were one.</span> <span id="s924">Some in Poland were together, but some were separate.</span> <span id="s925">But I basically was in the last two years of high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: [indecipherable] Palestine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: So did you start in 1940 or 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: And mind you, I didn't lose a single year of education, of school.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: Re -- during the war, because my parents were sending me to school, and in Romania --</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: In Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: -- and in Tel Aviv, so that when I was 16 I got the British matriculation, when I was 17, I got the Polish m-matriculation.</span> <span id="s934">So I had sort of two high schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s936">So you graduated from this high school, when is that, in ’43?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: In ’42, actually, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Two, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: And -- and I didn -- had the choice of either going to a university in Palestine, and Polytechnic at Haifa, or -- or -- or -- or joining the Palestinian brigade, or joining the Polish army.</span> <span id="s940">Now the military -- there was no conscription because the Poles had no right to conscript anybody in Palestine, and -- and the British were not constrict -- conscripting Jews to go into the brigade, that was all voluntary, and I decided to go along with all my friends to the Polish army, and my parents weren’t completely happy but respected my choice, but they asked me to wait til I was 18, so I waited a few months and I joined the army in ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did they try to dissuade you from doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: Not completely, they just wanted me to wait a few months til I was a little older.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Now, from what I understand from the history, it’s very unusual at that time for Jews who were living in Palestine to join Anders army rather than the Jewish brigade or the British, or to leave altogether and join Haganah [indecipherable] one of the other groups --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: -- fighting the British.</span> <span id="s946">So you are an unusual Jewish person, doing this at this time, no?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Well, actually, all my Jewish colleagues in the Polish high school, we had maybe one-third of the students were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: All of -- just about all of them joined the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s952">And -- and some of the Jews who came with General Anders from the Soviet Union, stayed in Palestine --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: -- partly because they had had enough and they wanted to settle after being deported to Russia.</span> <span id="s955">But some of us thought it was important for Jews to -- to fight, you know, and -- and to compensate for those who stayed behind, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: -- most -- most of my Jewish colleagues went to the arm -- to the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: But did you consider going into the Jewish brigade that th-the rit -- British government was forming with --</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I considered it, yes, because I had a Polish friend --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Who did.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: -- who was the son of my mother’s close friend, who did, but I decided against it.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: And what -- do you remember the reasoning that you used to decide one way rather than another?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: I sort of didn’t identify at that time, completely my future with Palestine, completely.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: And with the Jew -- with whatever the Jewish interest was particularly.</span> <span id="s965">So you felt both Jewish and Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: And so you wanted to be able to express --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: And I was interested in -- in s -- we thought that we might still return to Poland at that point, you know, who -- who -- who knows?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s970">So you actually thought it was possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">A: We thought it might be possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: To return to Poland with the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: No, no, n --</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Or as a -- as a civilian?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: -- no, possibly to live there, although United States was more likely.</span> <span id="s976">But my father still had the key from the house, that he --</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: -- treasured, and he thought someday he was going back.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s980">Now, were your parents also okay with your going into Anders army as opposed to with the Jewish brigade, or were they also not quite so identified?</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: They were okay with my --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: With that.</span> <span id="s983">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: -- with that, yes they -- they -- most of their friends were Polish Jewish refugees, or Polish refugees living in Palestine.</span> <span id="s985">There was a large group of Polish refugees in Palestine.</span> <span id="s986">Many people don’t know it --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: -- but the British evacuated the Poles from Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Through Cyprus to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: You’re a young person at this time, who wants to go to school, who may have given up your dreams about being a prophet, but you clearly had ideas about a real future, but now you’re going to go into an army where you could very well get killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">A: Right, but I never thought of getting killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: You thought you would be protected, somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: Right, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: So, how do you go into this army?</span> <span id="s998">Do you go to an office and you sign up?</span> <span id="s999">What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: Well, you go to the Polish consulate and you say you want to volunteer for the army, and -- and they say well, thank you, and we will call upon you and you will have a medical examination --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: -- and we’ll enlist you.</span> <span id="s1003">And then a few months later, they did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: And was -- was there an issue because you were Jewish, or they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: No, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: No issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: No issue.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: So did you wait a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: Well, I waited til they called me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Til they called you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And then you got called, and then you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: And then ’43, I wa -- early in ’43 I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: -- in February or so, I was called, and I first received the training as a recruit and that was -- my training was in Egypt on the northern side of Suez Canal on the -- in Kasasim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Which is close to the Suez Canal, but on -- not on the Egyptian side, but on the Palestinian side.</span> <span id="s1018">And I trained in tanks and it was quite difficult because when an officer moved his hand, you had to climb into the tank and he moved his hand again you had to climb out and I was bruised all over from the metal, climbing in and out.</span> <span id="s1019">But -- and you know, he closed the flap over your head, and you’re in a pretty closed environment and -- and I learned to drive a tank, I always say, before I learned to drive a car.</span> <span id="s1020">And tank you drive by pulling with your hands.</span> <span id="s1021">If you want turn left, you br-brake on the left and the tank rotates left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: And [indecipherable] you want to turn to the right, you brake with your right hand and tank moves the other way, so -- and -- and we also had gun, and when the gun was firing it made a lot of noise over -- we were right there.</span> <span id="s1024">So I then had an opportunity to go to officer’s school, and I was very happy to leave the tanks, and go to the artillery officer’s school.</span> <span id="s1025">And I became what’s known in Polish as officer cadet, or [speaks Polish] in Polish.</span> <span id="s1026">When you graduate you -- you get qualified to become an officer, but you have to get promoted through different ranks, and -- and I was assigned to light anti-aircraft artillery, which was fifth regiment, or -- which was part of the Fifth Infantry division.</span> <span id="s1027">And I was assigned to go to Italy, because Polish army right then had participated -- was entering the Italian campaign.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Mm-hm, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: And I was -- after I had, by the way, toured Cairo and seen the Sphinx and the pyramids, I ended up going to Port Said and -- and we took a boat to go to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Wait, let me stop you for a moment.</span> <span id="s1031">You said a while back that you were not very athletic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So I’m wondering how all of this training was, that you were training in the tank, not only did you get black and blue, but how difficult was this for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Well, I wasn’t very athletic with bicycles or with running, but I was -- I did play soccer a little bit --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: -- and I wasn’t that bad.</span> <span id="s1037">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: But nevertheless, it was very different from what you were used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: That kind of training, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Right, right, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And it wasn’t intellectual, it was -- it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: -- very physical, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: Very physical in the -- and -- and -- but there was -- it wasn’t -- it wasn’t a problem really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: It wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: And when you went to officer’s school, what does that mean, officer’s training?</span> <span id="s1051">Cause you were a kid, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1053">Well, I was -- but at same time I was a good student, so I wasn’t so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1055">Actually you’re not a kid, you were 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Eight -- 18, yeah.</span> <span id="s1057">And some of the others had more experience.</span> <span id="s1058">I was one of the youngest that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: -- that in -- one of the youngest in the army, and one of the youngest in the officer’s school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: And most of the boys that you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: But I was used to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: You -- you were used to that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: To being young, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1066">But now, were many of the boys in your unit, if there was a particular unit that you were with, had they had experience fighting?</span> <span id="s1067">Or had some training before and you were unusual in that as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: Well, most of the other soldiers and officers had been in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: All they had experience was being in Russian forced labor camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: -- in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: So they were actually also very sort of used to not -- not being at home for several years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: And -- and I w -- I was -- I was one of the few -- I mean, in Palestine not that many Poles joined the army in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: You know?</span> <span id="s1079">Never mind Jews even, Poles, there were very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Yes, Poles, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: So that most of them were veterans and most of them were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Most of the Polish soldiers at that point were older than we who c-came from the Palestinian detachment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: And how did -- uh-huh -- and how did they treat you?</span> <span id="s1085">Were they nice?</span> <span id="s1086">Were they okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: They were nice.</span> <span id="s1088">I-I was treated like everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: And -- and we then took the ship to go from Port Said to taran -- Taranto --</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: -- which is at the foot of Italy.</span> <span id="s1093">And being light anti-aircraft artillery, I was assigned to be in the anti-aircraft artillery or the [indecipherable] so, because the Germans were strafing allied ships that were going through the Mediterranean, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: -- so was four hours on and four hours off, was our routine on the ship -- aboard ship.</span> <span id="s1096">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Did you shoot down any planes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Not at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Later, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: But not at that point, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: And how many of you would be manning a -- the guns [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: It typically would be three or four of us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Uh-uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Because the guns had one person cranking up vertically, one person cranking up the gun horizontally, so that’s two people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: -- in the seats, and one person loading the gun, and one person passing the ammunitions, there was at least four.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: And what was your job usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Well, I usually was cranking and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: -- aiming, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: So you would aim?</span> <span id="s1116">That’s how you would do it, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: So the people who were cranking were actually aiming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: Aiming, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1121">Was that tough, on the boat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: It was tough, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: But -- but we didn't want the airplanes to shoot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: To shoot you, right.</span> <span id="s1126">Were you able to -- to communicate with your parents, were you able to write home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Yes, I was able to write letters to my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1129">And were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: But I -- we were asked -- one reason I later didn’t keep a diary in Italy is we were asked not to describe where we are and what we were doing, so -- because of military --</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: -- sort of secrecy, so -- which I regret to a certain extent [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Did you keep a diary when you were training?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: No, you didn’t do that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: No.</span> <span id="s1137">I did write notes after we left Poland and some of my memories were refreshed by these notes very much, yeah, how we left Lwów and how we got to -- yeah, to Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Romania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: -- yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: -- yes, I did write that up very early on, but the military service I wasn’t writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: All right, I think we’ll have to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Julian, I wanted -- before we go -- we get really into Italy and what happened there, I want to ask you a couple of questions about Palestine.</span> <span id="s1146">One is, you were in the boy scouts, am I right?</span> <span id="s1147">Your sister was in the girl scouts, or some kind of scouting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Right, she --</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Can you explain what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Also in -- in Poland, too, a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Well, we had -- we had excursions with our friends and we would dress in khaki little uniforms, and go out and -- and stay in tents and -- and practice shooting and practice I don’t know, running and doing things together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Shooting?</span> <span id="s1154">Now, isn’t that unusual for scouts to be doing, or is this something in Europe that happens as well as -- or was this unusual in Israel?</span> <span id="s1155">I mean in Palestine, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Mm, it was, I think in Poland too, there was -- people liked markmanships, and I got to enjoy --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: You liked that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: -- sh -- trying to hit the bulls-eye, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Did your sister do that as well?</span> <span id="s1160">Did the girls do that as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: Girls also had auxiliary girl’s training, but I don’t think they were shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Now, was there a relationship between the scouting groups and becoming part of the military?</span> <span id="s1163">Was there a relationship in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: N-No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: There wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: There was not.</span> <span id="s1167">I mean, it just was natural that one might prepare one for the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: But separate organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1171">And how often would you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: You know, I don’t remember, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: -- no, but mostly I remember the trips we took as kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: And would they -- these trips would be for a few days at a time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Yes, exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">Q: -- I gather, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Overnight, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Now, tell me about your relationships with the other students.</span> <span id="s1182">I gather you were all quite close with each other, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">We were -- we -- some of us have been together in Bucharest already and we were pleased to rediscover each other in Tel Aviv.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: And some of us just met in Tel Aviv, but we were all very good friends.</span> <span id="s1187">We had the s-sense that we were all very lucky to be -- it was like a -- an oasis of peaceful living while our relatives were in Europe, or in the middle of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: And we used to go swimming together, and we -- we all became very good friends, whether we were Jewish or Catholic or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: And -- and some of our mothers and fathers would almost adopt the kids who didn’t have mothers or fathers, or who particularly didn’t have fathers, because the father might have already been in the army or might have been in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: So it was -- it was like an extended family, and we were all away from our normal surroundings, so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1195">Was this true of other national groups, that -- that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: I don’t know of any other national groups.</span> <span id="s1197">There was -- I don’t know that there were other large national groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1199">As much as Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: This Polish group was quite unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: But now Palestine was not altogether peaceful either, at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: It was reasonably peaceful.</span> <span id="s1203">There were, you know, there were bombings in a hotel --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: -- I remember, but in general, it was fairly orderly.</span> <span id="s1206">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Were you ever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: -- good police organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1210">I know you were approached by -- with your cousin in the Haganah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Did anybody for the -- from the Irgun try to enlist you in what they were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">A: And Irgun started quite a bit later.</span> <span id="s1216">There were rumors that Irgun was being helped with weapons from the Polish army because a lot of the -- a lot of the leaders of Irgun had come with Anders --</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: -- you know, like Menachem Begin, and -- and there’s actually -- somebody wrote a play called Begin and Anders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Or Anders and Begin, which --</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: -- which discusses the relationship.</span> <span id="s1223">Begin said always that he left on a leave of absence and the Polish army never pursued to get him back, so he w -- as opposed to being a straight deserter, he was actually -- just left on a extended leave of absence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1225">Did you ever meet any of the boys who had left the army?</span> <span id="s1226">The Jewish boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: You never met them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: So you never got an opportunity to talk to them as to why they made that decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: No, but I knew some people who made this decision, and it was mostly because they had been through so much turmoil that when they got to Palestine they just thought it was time to end all this wandering around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1233">So let’s go to Italy.</span> <span id="s1234">You land in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: In Taranto, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: In February of 1944, I gather.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1241">And you’re in a light anti-aircraft artillery unit, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: And you’re heading north?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1245">And light anti-aircraft unit, although it was a division --</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: -- different batteries were assigned to different infantry units, so we were basically in support of infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: W -- we were not like heavy artillery which sits back and shoots, we were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: So you’re marching along with infantry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: -- with infantry, right, and each -- each battery sort of separately, so we were seldom together as a whole regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: And we -- and the guns were attached to a small truck, and were being pulled by truck, so my next skill was I learned to drive a truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So you -- so you went from the tank to the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: I went from the tank to the truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: And what was the regiment that this unit was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: This was Fifth Division.</span> <span id="s1258">Had symbol which was a bison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: And it was called Fifth Krisova divisi -- Krisova meaning the edge of Poland, and it’s the eastern edge of Poland, it’s called Kresse, and the division was in honor of the eastern edge of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: So this is part of the second Polish army, the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: Oh, the second Polish division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">Q: Division.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1265">Well, there were actually -- I’m sorry, second Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1268">And the second Polish army had the Fifth division and Third division -- Third division and Fifth division.</span> <span id="s1269">There were not too many divisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: There weren’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: There were two or three divisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: And we had British uniforms, but Polish insignia.</span> <span id="s1274">On our -- our arms here it said Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: And we had a bison for the division and we had a symbol of the British Eighth Army, which happened to be a cross.</span> <span id="s1277">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: And you wore a beret as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: And we wore beret, and -- and it was a regular khaki beret, not a black beret like I had in the tanks.</span> <span id="s1280">And on the beret it was a Polish eagle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: With no British sign.</span> <span id="s1282">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1285">So you’re traveling north and you’re going to come into one of the biggest battles over there.</span> <span id="s1286">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: Right, we first fought along the Adriatic on the east coast of Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: And then, when we got some way, half way --</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: To Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: -- Italy, we were asked to go west and to cross over to the western side.</span> <span id="s1292">And I think it started somewhere at Forli is the name of the town.</span> <span id="s1293">And I remember going through a town called Predappio where Mussolini was born and I was very impressed.</span> <span id="s1294">And actually, before I left Palestine, I went to a lecture once by a former high commissioner of Palestine and he was talking about his military experience in World War I and he was saying one thing he did was because in the army you have a lot of time, he said, I read books, you know, and I was so inspired.</span> <span id="s1295">He said he picked three most important books and he read them, so I picked the same three books, I think, which was -- one was the Bible, the other one was Macaulay’s “History of England”, and the third one was the history of the Roman empire.</span> <span id="s1296">And I kept reading them, and also learning Italian as we traveled through Italy.</span> <span id="s1297">So that then we crossed west, and we went to the area -- Montecassino area and mon --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Tell me something, y -- y -- go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s1299">You have a lot of time to read?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: Well, in the army you have lot of time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Yeah?</span> <span id="s1302">Cause you’re waiting a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: You’re waiting a lot, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Did other boys read as much as you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Not as much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: -- you were very unusual, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: I was maybe more unusual in that respect.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: And the other boys learned a little bit of Italian, sort of conver -- conversational Italian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: But I was more really doing systematic self study.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: So then we got to Montecassino, and the situation was that -- and Montecassino is located between Naples and Rome, and this was about the time when the British -- the United States army, U.S. army had landed in Anzio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: And the bri -- American troops were surrounded and stopped there and couldn’t break out.</span> <span id="s1316">And the critical position was the -- the mountain with the monastery on top, Montecassino mountain.</span> <span id="s1317">And there were three or four assaults by the British and the French and the Australians and none of them succeeded, and then the Polish troops were called to -- to take their turn at taking the mountain.</span> <span id="s1318">And our commander, General Anders issued an order of the day in which he said to -- the battle for Montecassino is the battle for freedom of Poland.</span> <span id="s1319">And Polish soldiers took it to heart and fought very hard, and after a few -- and by the way, at Montecassino, we were -- my unit was made into infantry because the guns couldn’t be pulled up the mountain.</span> <span id="s1320">And we were all crawling, rock by rock up the mountain and the -- it was -- there was also a lot of bombardment because the British were -- and Americans were dropping bombs on the monastery, which was considered an observation point for German artillery.</span> <span id="s1321">And the Germans were in bunkers all along the mountains, so i-it was a very difficult situation.</span> <span id="s1322">It was in May of 1944, and then in the end, Polish troops took the monastery at the top of the mountain and mounted the flag, Polish flag and the British flag at the top of the monastery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: And -- and what was your -- your role?</span> <span id="s1324">You were holding what ?</span> <span id="s1325">What kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: I was actually doing some mortar shooting.</span> <span id="s1327">The mortar we could carry up the mountain, but also with my rifle climbing and making my way up the hill.</span> <span id="s1328">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: This was not your first battle, or was this a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q: -- [indecipherable] battle that was this rough for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">A: This was the roughest battle, because -- in part because I was not at my gun, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: -- on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: On your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Then who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: And we had to carry the ammunition up the mountain, up the slopes, because cars couldn’t get up there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: No trucks, no cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Now I -- as I understand it, there was a first push and it didn’t work, and -- and Anders had to re -- decide what to do now, what sort of a strategy to use to go up the mountain [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Yes, well I was not part of the strategy, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: -- there were several assaults, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: -- in the end the troops went around, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: Did you get to the top?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: I got to the top, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Did many of your buddies get killed, or get hurt in this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: Several of my friends got killed, yes.</span> <span id="s1353">The casualties were very heavy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Were very high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: And to this date there is a Polish cemetery at the foot of Montecassino that has many graves.</span> <span id="s1356">And some of them were wounded.</span> <span id="s1357">I was very lucky to come through.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: You were -- you weren’t even wounded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">A: No, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: That’s very lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: -- very lucky, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: How did it affect you to be in a battle with so many casualties?</span> <span id="s1363">Was this extremely difficult for you emotionally afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A: Well, it was very difficult emotionally while it was going on, but afterwards I felt very lucky to have -- have come through unscathed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: And I was very proud also, of having participated in what was a pretty critical battle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1368">And when you think about Anders saying we’re fighting for the freedom of Poland, was that what you were fighting for, or were you fighting for [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Well, I was mostly fighting for the freedom of my relatives and fellow Jews, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: Mm-hm, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A: -- but they were in Poland, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: And at that time we didn’t know yet that eastern Poland had been basically given away by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: But by this -- by this time it’s clear to you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: By the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: -- that millions of Jews have been killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Right, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Right, we -- we knew that already, and -- and I remember at the same time coming across a body of a German and reading a letter he had written to his relatives, or his relatives had written to him, and I could see that they had human problems too, you know, being away from their families, but -- but -- but we knew Jews were being killed in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: -- brutal way in gas chambers and so on.</span> <span id="s1384">And we -- when we finished the battle, we were given a break, a little rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: And where did you go?</span> <span id="s1386">Or did you just stay where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, we stayed in the area.</span> <span id="s1388">I remember once on the mountain, coming across some Moroccan troops which were fren -- part of the French army, and we couldn’t communicate with them too well, so we were just as -- we were scared of them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1389">The worst thing was walking at night, and you know, in different forests or empty areas and when you stood guard that was pretty difficult situation because sometimes you could be -- Germans could be attacking, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: But that wasn’t at Montecassino, that was elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1392">We were -- we were also getting leaflets from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1393">They were dropping leaflets telling us, why are you fighting us, you should -- the Russians are killing Poles in -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s1394">And my friends had all been in Russia, so they all were very aware that the Russians were very bad people.</span> <span id="s1395">So -- that had -- had them deported, and had them in forced labor, but they wanted to fight the Germans, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: I don’t know of anybody who deserted.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1399">So how long was this break after this battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: It was a short break and we were then sent to the east coast of Italy back again and we fought at -- I fought at -- and the Polish army at Ancona, Bologna, at Loreto, and then at Bologna.</span> <span id="s1401">And there is a Polish cemetery in Loreto, and there are Jewish graves there, as there are at Montecassino.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Who -- who dug graves at Montecassino?</span> <span id="s1403">Did you boys do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: I didn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q: Did the army do it [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: I think the army must have done it, yes.</span> <span id="s1409">Must have been the army, but they were probably not the front line troops, but the sort of service units.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Sort of divisional support units.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: So you’re in a number of other battles along the way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1414">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Does it ever -- does it ever get easier before each battle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: No, it wasn’t as difficult as at casino, but it was difficult, for example at one point, we had to retreat and that was very unpleasant.</span> <span id="s1417">But -- but we -- the British and the Americans were interested in keeping the Italian front active to distract the German troops and extend their supply lines so as to make the landing in France easier, and to make the invasion of France easier.</span> <span id="s1418">So we weren’t pushed to advance very rapidly, we were going rather slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Did you ever come across camps that the Italians had set up, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Not camps -- with Jews?</span> <span id="s1421">Or camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Th-They had all sorts of people in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1424">No, no.</span> <span id="s1425">We saw some Italians who were si -- fighting on our side.</span> <span id="s1426">There were some Italians fighting on our side, but I didn't come across Italian camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And were the Italians that you met happy about your being there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: It was mixed.</span> <span id="s1429">Most people were afraid of soldiers and soldiers do sometimes take food and wine away from where they -- in the countryside, wherever people tried to -- supplies are difficult during the wars, so sometimes the farmers kept storing things for themselves --</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: -- and sometimes soldiers would take it, and sometimes soldiers would kill chickens.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: So people were nervous [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: So that the Italian -- but the Italians in general were friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: They were not -- there -- there -- it was not hostile territory.</span> <span id="s1436">And they -- most of them didn’t like the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Even though some of them were Fascist, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: But it was a different kind, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: And I remember in Ancona going to the synagogue for high holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: And the army had a rabbi, and occasionally we had services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1446">Interesting.</span> <span id="s1447">So in May of 1945, the war is over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: The war was over ra -- around that time.</span> <span id="s1449">We were approximately at the level Bologna and the war ended and we were very happy.</span> <span id="s1450">It ended, but there was a question what will become of us, because most of my colleagues like myself were from the eastern part of Poland, which by now we knew was going to become part of Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1451">And I -- all the soldiers were given a declaration from England that -- from Britain -- from the British which said that we are encouraged to return to Poland and that they had the commitment that we would be safe when we came back to Poland, or since we had fought on the British side, if we didn’t choose to go back to Poland, we could go to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1452">And -- and most of the soldiers went to Great Britain, and -- but some who had families returned to Poland.</span> <span id="s1453">You know, some had left their children and wives at home.</span> <span id="s1454">And I knew I wasn’t going back to Poland, so -- which was now in Soviet Union, so I had no problem decide -- to become repatriated back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And I was hoping to come to America, and -- but what was very nice is that when the war ended, you know, Anders said, since Poland has lost so many members of its intellectuals, professionals, that he wanted the young military to be educated, and we were offered an opportunity to attend Italian universities.</span> <span id="s1457">And -- and I opted to go to the Polytechnic in Turin, Italy.</span> <span id="s1458">A-And some others who want to study medicine went to Bologna, some others went to Rome, some went to Milan.</span> <span id="s1459">So there were all these Polish young officer cadets, and young officers, who had matriculation and were ready to study and suddenly going to Italian universities and -- and in the -- in Turin there was a sort of dormitory for the Polish soldiers and -- who were studying, and I was in that dormitory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: And you were still in uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">A: I was in uniform some of the time.</span> <span id="s1462">I didn’t have so many civilian clothes, but we could be in civilian clothes at that point.</span> <span id="s1463">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Let me -- let me stop you for a moment if I may.</span> <span id="s1465">When the war is over, are you folks guarding Germans?</span> <span id="s1466">[indecipherable] prisoners of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Oh -- ah -- oh, what happened was, since I knew -- yes, we saw German prisoners of war, and -- and si -- w-we were either guarding them or seeing them being guarded by the British.</span> <span id="s1468">But I am also la -- was assigned to a camp where the British were sorting out people they had liberated.</span> <span id="s1469">Since I spoke English, I was used as a Polish translator for those who were from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1471">Let’s continue that on the next tape, we’re going to have to stop this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: Julian, explain what you were doing in this transit camp, for the British.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: Yes, I was assigned as an interpreter to a camp where there were a lot of people who had been liberated and were from all different countries.</span> <span id="s1477">Europe was -- Germans had taken people from different countries for forced labor.</span> <span id="s1478">From France, from Turkey, from Poland, and from Holland.</span> <span id="s1479">And when the war ended, somehow we were -- this camp was close to the Austrian border, and a lot of people were brought in, including some who had been in Mauthausen as prisoners of -- as prisoners in the German camp.</span> <span id="s1480">And some had not been in camps, but had been in forced labor in different factories or doing different jobs.</span> <span id="s1481">And it was a sea of humanity, and -- and they were out in open areas, so some of them just warming themselves up by fire.</span> <span id="s1482">And -- and w -- and some of them were from Russia and from Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1483">And the British wanted to send all these people home.</span> <span id="s1484">And there were trains and the job in the camp was sorting people, finding out who they -- where they were from.</span> <span id="s1485">And some of them didn’t want to go back, in particular the Russians.</span> <span id="s1486">Some of them were White Russians, who had collaborated with Germans, or who were afraid that they would be accused of having collaborated with German.</span> <span id="s1487">So it was quite a messy scene and some of them were basically forced onto the trains and -- and also I saw Serbs being take -- Serbs were taken prisoners because they had fought together with the Germans, and they were being shipped back to Serbia.</span> <span id="s1488">And -- some Serbs, anyway.</span> <span id="s1489">And -- and -- and there were Polish people, which is why they needed Polish interpreter.</span> <span id="s1490">And they were trying to figure out who was who and where they should go and where they belonged.</span> <span id="s1491">And some desperately wanted to go home, and some were afraid to go home.</span> <span id="s1492">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: And your job was what?</span> <span id="s1494">To --</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: To --</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: -- question them [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: -- to question them and get information where they were from, and -- and how they got there.</span> <span id="s1498">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: What was the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: -- to verify their stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1502">Were some people more difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: It was a British operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">A: I was just assigned as an interpreter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: It was not a Polish army operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Now, I -- as I understand it, you met some people who came from Mauthausen, the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Right, I met --</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Was -- that must have been a very difficult story to hear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: It was a very difficult situation to see these people because they were like skeletons and they were basically supporting each other, and barely able to move and walk, and -- and -- and they were still in the striped prisoner gear, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Now is this the first time that you had met -- met anyone, as opposed to just hearing the stories --</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">Q: -- who had been through some of the most difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: First time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">A: It was the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: And what did that do to you?</span> <span id="s1519">Anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Well, it moved me very much, and it certainly made me realize what people had been going through during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1522">And were you in favor of what the British were trying to do, or did you think this was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: Well, I was in favor of people being sent home, but I think there could have been a little more humanity to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: And they didn’t have the amenities.</span> <span id="s1526">Some of them -- some of them were -- they were being packed -- sometimes when I see the movie like “Shoah”, and I see how the Germans packed people, it wasn’t that bad, but it was -- some of it was forced packing of people onto trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1528">And how long were you doing this?</span> <span id="s1529">A month, two months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: Probably like a couple of months, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1532">And was it after that that you were given the opportunity to go to Turin and go to the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Yes, it was after that, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Did you happen to know that Primo Levi, was he anybody that was known, wh-who came back to Turin, who lived there for the rest of his life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Not at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Did you like going to the university there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Well, I liked very much, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: It was a relief and a reprieve after service in the military and then we again all got along very well, and -- and we were like a close group together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Eventually I moved out of the dormitory to a private apartment with another Polish colleague.</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: With whom I’m still in touch, you know, lives in Florida, he’s a Catholic, but he calls me up very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: Now tell me something, because people may not know, was there a lot of destruction in Italy, because it seems -- it could seem surprising that a university would be open --</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: Well, in Turin there was very little destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Very little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Almost no destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Turin, Genoa, Milan, were not really destructed too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1555">And your Italian was good enough to go to the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">A: Yes, my Italian --</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: By then, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: -- was quite good, yes.</span> <span id="s1559">And I took a sort of engineering course, yeah.</span> <span id="s1560">First year of engineering it was called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">Q: So, are you, throughout this period, are you able in some way to communicate with your parents?</span> <span id="s1562">Are you a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: -- and your sister, you’re able to write?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: I was able to write and send letters, and once I was even given a leave of absence during the war to go back to Palestine and visit my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: By boat, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1570">And with a few other Polish friends --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: -- who had relatives in Tel Aviv, or some --</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: So that must have been a very nice thing for you to [indecipherable] to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: It was a nice interlude, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: And did you then, when you met your parents and your sister, discuss what you would do?</span> <span id="s1576">Cause it was clear that the allies were going to win by this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">Q: I mean, it probably was clear even before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1580">And we at that time started corresponding with my aunt who was then in New York, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Now this is the same aunt, this is the sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: The same aunt, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: The [indecipherable] right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1585">And we were trying to get a visa to come to the United States, and -- and actually, at one point I -- my aunt [indecipherable] was in her second marriage.</span> <span id="s1586">In her first marriage, her married name was Ulam, and her nephew, son of her husband’s dead -- the husband died, she was a widow before she remarried.</span> <span id="s1587">And he was in the United States, his name was Stan Ulam.</span> <span id="s1588">He was -- later became known for inventing the hydrogen bomb.</span> <span id="s1589">But he was at University Southern California and he was a mathematician, an outstanding, world famous mathematician.</span> <span id="s1590">And he also then went to New Mexico, or to -- to Los Alamos to participate in the development of the bomb.</span> <span id="s1591">And he was well connected, and he got me an admission to the University of Southern California.</span> <span id="s1592">So I went to the consulate in Genoa to see the American consul to pick up the visa, and the consul asked me, do you want to stay in the United States?</span> <span id="s1593">And I said, of course.</span> <span id="s1594">And it was absolutely the wrong answer, because the moment I said that, I couldn’t get the student visa, because student visa is only for temporary stay as a student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: So the consul said, you have to apply for regular immigration visa.</span> <span id="s1597">And Polish quota was very tight because at those ti -- in those days, each country had a quota, and since a lot of people from Poland were displaced, the Polish quota was very difficult to -- to get the immigration visa, and it was like a three year wait.</span> <span id="s1598">So I didn’t get the immigration visa til after I got to London.</span> <span id="s1599">So my trip to Genoa was wasted, but my aunt finally send me the -- the papers to -- affidavit to -- to apply for the visa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: Now, are your -- your parents and sister trying to get to the United States at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: My parents and sister -- well, my sister went to study in Beirut, Lebanon, because she didn’t want to study in English or in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1602">S -- and she was interested in French, and in Beirut she first went to the English university, but transferred then to the French university, she studied medicine.</span> <span id="s1603">And so my sister was already in Beirut, not with my parents, and I was in the army.</span> <span id="s1604">And the British then offered to evacuate Poles from Palestine.</span> <span id="s1605">Just before they were going to leave Palestine, they evacuated Poles who wanted to leave, to Great Britain.</span> <span id="s1606">And my parents communicate with my sister and she came and together they left from Palestine to -- to go to England, yeah.</span> <span id="s1607">And I was already in England at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Oh, so you got there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: I got there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: And so you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: The British didn’t want to keep Polish soldiers in Italy too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: And actually, the better student you were, the longer you could stay.</span> <span id="s1614">So I stayed quite long in Italy to complete my first year of engineering, and then I had to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1616">Now, was there any thought on your parent’s part to stay in Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: No, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1619">And you had no interest to go --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: To return back, no.</span> <span id="s1621">I was interest to start a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: And when I got to England, the British wanted to have better control over Polish soldiers in England so they put -- so they incorporated us into something called Polish resettlement corps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">A: Polish resettlement corps was a British unit for Polish soldiers.</span> <span id="s1626">It was not to fight, it was just to control them.</span> <span id="s1627">And then, people who were in Polish resettlement corps could either get leave of absence to go to study, or they had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1628">In Britain at that time there was compulsory labor actually, yo-you had to work, so you had to report to the employment office, and they would assign you a job if you couldn’t find one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: And a lot of Poles ended up in coal mines, and -- because [indecipherable] Britain, so -- but I was one of those lucky ones who were given a -- an -- an -- an opportunity to go to London and study, and I started in something called Polish University College, which doesn’t exist any more, but was preparing Polish former soldiers to take degr -- amer -- British degrees.</span> <span id="s1631">And at that time University of London had a program which was called external program, so that you didn’t have to attend the university, you could just take exams as an external student.</span> <span id="s1632">And I couldn’t get into any British university, they were all fully booked, so I went to this Polish University College, and I start preparing for what’s called part one of the Bachelor’s degree for the University of London external examination.</span> <span id="s1633">And then -- and I took that examination and when I passed I transferred to Worcester Polytechnic, which was sort of a college, but again the exams were external University of London exams, and I was preparing for part two, and I was going through it pretty quickly so that by 1949, when I was 24, I was ready to take the Bachelor’s degree exam, but then my visa arrived from the United States, and the American consul would not renew it.</span> <span id="s1634">I wanted to wait til June, it was March, and he said he couldn’t renew the visa, I would have to go to back of the line.</span> <span id="s1635">So I went to the university office, and I asked them whether I could go and take the external examination in Canada, which was at that time a British -- part of British empire.</span> <span id="s1636">And the -- well, I said even maybe should come back to London because be it’d be cheaper than taking a whole year of study.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: And they said, well what we will do, we will send you the examination papers to New York.</span> <span id="s1639">So I did my Bachelor’s degree --</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: In New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: -- in New York.</span> <span id="s1642">I was at Columbia University under the supervision of somebody the British designated to supervise I was not cheating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: Did your parent and sister go before you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: My parents, sister left for United States before me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: And they -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Because they had no reason to stay --</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: To stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: -- behind, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: But when your parents were in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">A: Actually my sister went from England back to Beirut to pass her final examination to become a physician, and then she came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">Q: And then she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s1652">The period of time that your parents were in England, were you living together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: When we were living in England we were not living together, no.</span> <span id="s1654">I lived in Kent, near Worcester Polytechnic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1656">And was your father working [indecipherable] and your mother?</span> <span id="s1657">What was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: My father was doing some kind of menial work and my mother was sewing and earning money by sewing, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1660">So the period of time when you were in Palestine, while you were in the army, fighting, was she mainly supporting the family by her sewing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: She was supporting and I think they were getting a stipend from the Polish government.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Like all the refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1665">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: That’s most likely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1668">So did everybody land in New York?</span> <span id="s1669">Is that where you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">A: Well, my parents landed in New York and my sister, and they moved into an apartment and my father got different jobs selling newspapers in a kiosk and making deliveries and my mother kept sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">Q: Sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">A: She ended up becoming an expert at sewing ties and it was piecework, so she worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1673">And I arrived in New York, and the first few months I prepared for my final exam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: And then I looked for a job and I couldn’t find any because when -- for good -- there was a shortage of good jobs.</span> <span id="s1676">I didn’t know whether I had yet received my Bachelor’s degree, because the papers went through Britain by boat and the results were not in.</span> <span id="s1677">And -- and my sister worked as an intern in a hospital, but she wasn’t making much money either, and -- and when I -- it was a menial job they thought I was too well educated, they didn't want to give me a menial job.</span> <span id="s1678">So in the meanwhile, when I was in London I had applied for college in America, not knowing I was going to get the degree from London, and a fre -- friend suggested that I apply to MIT and I got admitted, but I didn’t have money to go and some kind person in New York -- the Jewish family service send me to somebody and he lend me some money and I went then to MIT.</span> <span id="s1679">And when I arrived at MIT, I was told that since I didn’t have yet my Bachelor’s degree, because in September it wasn’t yet known whether I had passed in June or not, believe it or not and they said it depended how well I passed before they could admit me to graduate school.</span> <span id="s1680">A -- th -- and I didn’t want to become an undergraduate because I thought I’d passed, so they made me a special student.</span> <span id="s1681">And there was a bit of a disaster because special student can’t get the scholarship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: So -- and there is an organization in Boston called -- at that time there was an organization in Boston on Mount Auburn Street where they were helping Jewish immigrants and they gave me a loan and I also got a job at -- part-time job at MIT, so I finished for a few months as special student, then my matriculation results -- my Bachelor’s degree results arrived and they admitted me to graduate school, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1685">And then you got your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: And then I became an assistant [indecipherable] the scholarship, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: And what degree did you get from MIT?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: I got a Master’s degree in electrical engineering, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1690">And then you went to Harvard for Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1691">?</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Then I went to work for Lincoln Laboratory, which was located in those days at MIT.</span> <span id="s1693">And I got admitted at Harvard for a Ph.D., and I was commuting -- working -- I was both working at Lincoln Laboratory, going to Harvard, it was slightly illegal because you’re not supposed to be a full-time employee when you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: A student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: -- when you’re a full-time student.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: So I used to pick my classes early in the morning or on Saturdays, or -- or at lunch hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: But -- and then I got the scholarship from Harvard, and I transferred there -- went full-time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: And what happened to your sister?</span> <span id="s1701">She got a degree in medicine, but certainly she couldn’t just use it in the United States, she would have to take another exam, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Ah, right, she, I believe, did take another exam.</span> <span id="s1703">But my sister then -- my sister had been in love with somebody in Beirut who was her instructor, actually, he was professor of medicine and he came to New York, and they got married, and she went back to Beirut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: She went back to Beirut?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s1707">And she remained there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: And she remained there, and was -- I -- when we got married we went to visit her and then when the fighting broke out in Lebanon she came for a short time to New York and then she went back, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1710">Is she still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: I was thinking about your parents and in a way, while your life changed drastically, or you have to go through a number of changes, all of this happened when you were very young and in a formative state, whereas your parents lost everything --</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: -- that they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: And they were never able to recoup that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: That’s right, yes.</span> <span id="s1722">It was very difficult for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: For them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1725">Particularly for my father, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">Q: Because he never acquired the status that he had [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: Right, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1728">But they never complained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: No.</span> <span id="s1731">They felt very lucky that their lives were saved --</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">A: -- and their children went to school and were alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1735">Do you think of yourself as a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: I th-think of myself more as a refugee than as a survivor.</span> <span id="s1737">I can’t compare myself to people who were in camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">A: I was very lucky, yes, being able to reconstruct my life and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">A: -- to come unscathed from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">Q: Is there anything that you’d like to talk about that we haven’t spoken about at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">A: I -- I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: You think it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: Yeah, pretty good story of my life, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much for your agreeing to tell us your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: It’s been really quite fascinating, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: And we’ll shut the camera off and then do your photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: Julian, tell -- tell me a little bit about what you did once you got your degrees from Harvard and MIT.</span> <span id="s1755">What work did you do all these years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: I was mostly in -- I became a specialist in communication theory and signal processing and I first worked on development of radar and then on development of visual communications or radio communications in particular.</span> <span id="s1757">And I first worked at Lincoln Laboratory, and then I worked at RCA and then I started my own company.</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">Q: How -- how did you happen to narrow the field?</span> <span id="s1759">I -- I’m assuming this is -- is part of the field of electrical engineering, am I right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A: Correct, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">Q: And if that’s the case, how do you -- how did you narrow it down to these particular aspects?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">A: I looked for the most mathematical part of electrical engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: And that turned out to be signal processing and what’s called statistical communication theory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1766">But this led you also to work a great deal with the military, I gather?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: Right, I worked quite a bit military research and development and with NASA.</span> <span id="s1768">And very proud I contributed to the first landing on the moon because I assisted in the selection of radars for them, and testing them for -- for the landing on the moon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1770">So were -- were you there when -- when the lift-off happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: No, I was not there, I watched it on televisions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: On television like the rest of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: And I was very excited.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">Q: I bet you were.</span> <span id="s1777">And you worked for how long?</span> <span id="s1778">When did you retire?</span> <span id="s1779">Just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: I retired formerly in 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: But I continue still consulting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1785">And I occasionally write something and I just recently wrote a chapter for encyclopedial telecommunications.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1787">When -- when you look back on your life, do you see that your experiences had an important influence on how you lived your life after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Definitely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: An-And how would you characterize that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: Well, first of all, having served in the military and having had ups and downs in my own life, I learned that money is very valuable, but that you really -- well, it’s more important that you feel good and do the right thing.</span> <span id="s1791">And -- and I learned to respect people in every walk of life.</span> <span id="s1792">And -- and sometimes I found different people helped me in different situations and some of them were not my buddies, and -- and also I learned to not give up easily and to have faith that I can get out of a situation, and if it was difficult for example, in business, I learned to persist and -- and try to find a way to solve problems.</span> <span id="s1793">And I kind of got -- I get very challenged to -- when I’m in adversity, to deal with it.</span> <span id="s1794">And I think I’ve taught my children that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">Q: And how do you relate that to the -- do you think -- well, I don’t know how -- whether you can even answer this question.</span> <span id="s1796">Had you not escaped, had your not -- not -- your parents shown you that there are other ways to handle things, it might have been easier to become depressed, or -- or not have such a hopeful outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Well, I actually am determined not to become depressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: And my mother at one point became depressed and I felt s-so miserable about it, and saw her so miserable that I decided --</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: That you wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s1801">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: I will not let myself become depressed, under any circumstances.</span> <span id="s1803">And I -- I -- I kind of sometimes welcomed the challenge.</span> <span id="s1804">I -- I don’t regard it as adversity, I regard it as something to overcome, when there is a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: And I understand that you are very involved in Polish Jewish relations and involved with those Poles with -- who were not Jewish necessarily, who went though similar experiences to you.</span> <span id="s1806">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s1808">I -- I -- I feel that the people who went through it, we really had all very good relations.</span> <span id="s1809">Now, this was not true of survivors, some of whom are very bitter that some their friends denounced them.</span> <span id="s1810">And on the other hand there are people who survived who were saved by Poles.</span> <span id="s1811">It was almost impossible to survive without some assistance from somebody.</span> <span id="s1812">But I’m interested in seeing Polish Jewish relations become normal, and -- and this is impossible unless you participate and try to do it, y-you can’t just say I won’t have anything to do with these people and hope that relations can become normalized.</span> <span id="s1813">And I believe it’s important that people get along no matter what nationality they are, and what ethnic group they are and what religion they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">Q: And do you see improvements in the relationship of Polish Jews and Polish Gentiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">A: I see improvements particularly among educated people and we are amazed when we sometimes go to Poland, in recent years we have gone to Poland almost every year, that there are some people who become very interested in -- in Jewish history and contribution of Jews.</span> <span id="s1816">Jews who are 10 percent of Poland.</span> <span id="s1817">And I think some of it has been the German propaganda that sort of separated Jews into umensch, which means, not a man, inhumans basically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: And -- and also Soviet propaganda which was against Palestine, and against Zionism, and -- and some of this is the Soviet and German inf -- a-and, you know, the Germans have become democratic country now, and -- and Communism is dead and some of it is disappearing in Poland, but there is still, particularly among people who are deprived, who look to be either better than somebody, or to be mean to somebody and compensate for their depravation, no matter whether the person is guilty of their depravation or not.</span> <span id="s1820">And some of these people are still sort of anti-Semitic --</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: -- but the more intelligent people are not, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1823">And so I am active in -- in -- both in trying to document Polish Jewish history and in Polish Jewish relations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">Q: Relations.</span> <span id="s1825">And tell me when you met your wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: I met my wife around -- I’m not very good at dates, but I think it was around 1958.</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1828">A: And -- and I was already working and my wife was still a student and she -- and I met her at a party, and at first she wasn’t interested in me, but then one day I arranged to meet her finally, and she asked me some questions about my past and she became interested and -- and then our romance was partly my telling her the story of my life and then it turn out her father had been from Poland himself, and he came here just before the World War I, and she was listening to what I had to say and gradually our friendship grew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: And when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: We got married in 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">Q: Oh good, you remembered that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">A: It’s a -- that’s one easy -- because it ends in zero, that’s an --</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: That’s an -- it’s an easy date [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: -- easy date, yes.</span> <span id="s1835">And it was really, I think a very fortunate experience for me, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: And you have three children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: We had three children, two girls and one son and our daughters are 38 and 35 now and our son is 33.</span> <span id="s1838">And we have done a lot of family traveling, yeah.</span> <span id="s1839">We went to Poland and actually to Ukraine with the children, so -- in 1989, when the Iron Curtain dropped.</span> <span id="s1840">I had been afraid to go to Poland before I retired because I was working in defense industry, but then after I retired and Gorbachev came to power or something, we decided to go and visit Lwów.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: And you went as a family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: And we went as a family to show them.</span> <span id="s1843">Actually, my -- I didn’t want to go at first, but my wife insisted, so we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1845">And you have eight grandchildren?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: We have eight gran-grandchildren, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Well, I think what I’d like us to do, we’ll stop the camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">Q: And I thank you, and we’re going to look at some photographs --</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: -- so that people can see part of your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: -- in photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: So we going to change seats?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">Q: And who is this gentleman here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">A: This is my grandfather, his name was Joachim Philip.</span> <span id="s1858">And actually in the birth certificate he is listed as Chaim Carmen Philip.</span> <span id="s1859">And he is a very dapper gentleman in a bowler hat and with nice gold chain and a cane in his hand and stiff, white collar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: And this is your mother’s father?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: My mother’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: He was in real estate business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: And who is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: This is a family photo of Joseph Bussgang, and Stefania Bussgang, my father and mother with myself, Julian and with my mother and my sister Janina, or Janine.</span> <span id="s1866">And my father was very proud because he had gone on a trip to Amsterdam and bought those matching outfits for my sister and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: And who is this good looking lad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: This is myself, Julian Bussgang as a young boy, and I am with a -- in a sailor kind of uniform, which was a school uniform in the school I attended during my elementary school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q: And about how old do you think you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A: I think -- I wrote it in the back.</span> <span id="s1871">I think I tried to reconstruct it.</span> <span id="s1872">I-I-It’s on the back of the picture.</span> <span id="s1873">I think I am --</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: Eight.</span> <span id="s1875">That’s what it says.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: -- I think I’m eight, yeah.</span> <span id="s1877">Eight or nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: This is a photograph of my mother who is in mourning, that’s why she’s dressed in black with a veil.</span> <span id="s1880">And her mother had passed away.</span> <span id="s1881">And it’s myself, Julian and my sister Janine in Krynice, which is a Polish sort of resort spa where there is -- famous for its good mineral water, and we are holding glasses with glass straws to drink this special water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: And this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: This is my father, Joseph Bussgang, also in Krynice, walking al -- along the street, which is kind of like a park and he carries an umbrella and has a rain cap on and he has got breeches on.</span> <span id="s1884">This is his informal sports outfit.</span> <span id="s1885">And he came to visit us because my mother and we used to go on vacation and my father would come and visit us for a few days and go back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: And this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: This is my mother, Stefania Bussgang, and it’s a photograph that she took for a passport, I think, and it may have been taken just before we went to Palestine,
