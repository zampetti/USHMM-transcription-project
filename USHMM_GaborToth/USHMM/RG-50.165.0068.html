come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">HL: In 1949, I was on the quota – American Joint Distribution quota, in Kenosha, the Jewish community sponsored me.</span> <span id="s14">After the war I went to Bergen-Belsen, there was a D.P. camp there and that’s where I met my wife.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in Riga,</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Latvia in 1923.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">WH: You were in Berlin until ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">HL: Yes, my mother died before we were deported of natural causes.</span> <span id="s19">I was an only child.</span> <span id="s20">In 1942 my father and I were sent back to Latvia to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s21">We were constructing the barracks for the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s22">My father died of starvation in another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">WH: How do you go on?</span> <span id="s24">Is the will to survive so strong?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">HL: Oh, definitely!</span> <span id="s26">You don’t know what people can do to survive, what people can eat to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">WH: If they have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">HL: Yeh.</span> <span id="s29">I’ve seen people eat other people – cannibalism.</span> <span id="s30">Cannibalism.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">WH: You saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">HL: I saw it.</span> <span id="s33">I never – I was going to try it, but I couldn’t, never could (inaudible).</span></p> <p><span id="s34">WH: Never could bring yourself to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">HL: No.</span> <span id="s36">But I seen it.</span> <span id="s37">I seen friends of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">WH: How long had you been without food?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">HL: Well, you always had some food, you weren’t completely out of food, you had potato peelings cooked in water, you stole sugar beets, raw potatoes.</span> <span id="s40">You always had something to nibble on, but no nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">WH: Does something like that affect your eating habits even today?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">HL: Oh, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">WH: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">HL: For sure.</span> <span id="s45">In what way?</span> <span id="s46">I’m very particular in knowing what I’m eating.</span> <span id="s47">And if something smells, I won’t eat it, I won’t touch it.</span> <span id="s48">If I haven’t tried it, I won’t touch it.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">WH: How long were you there working in this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">HL: About a year, year and a half.</span> <span id="s51">We went to many camps…then to Stuttgart for about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s52">That’s where we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: When you saw cannibalism, where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">HL: I was in Salispilse/Salapils (sp?)</span> <span id="s55">where I seen it.</span> <span id="s56">I seen it in Stutthof.</span> <span id="s57">I seen it in Berkgraff and there was another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: To what do you owe the fact that you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">HL: I was young, I was strong.</span> <span id="s60">I can show you pictures when I came out how I looked…and the urge of survival is there.</span> <span id="s61">And I made myself busy.</span> <span id="s62">I mean, I wasn’t just laying there and you know, waste away.</span> <span id="s63">Doing things, walking around.</span> <span id="s64">Talking to people.</span> <span id="s65">And able to work too, if you were able to.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">WH: You lived in Germany until ’49?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">HL: Yeh.</span> <span id="s68">I never thought I’m going to come to America.</span> <span id="s69">I was signed up to go to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: Your desire to go to Israel, where did that come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">HL: I was alone.</span> <span id="s72">I didn’t know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s73">Again, I still was young.</span> <span id="s74">I had no place to go.</span> <span id="s75">And talking to people in the camps and to the Israelis who came and all that, it sounded good to me.</span> <span id="s76">And I signed up to go.</span> <span id="s77">Then I met my wife, and she changed my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: Have you visited Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">HL: No, never been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: Have you had the desire to go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">HL: The older I get, the desire gets more and more…We’ll take a trip one of these days.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">WH: What has stopped you until now?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">HL: No particular reason.</span> <span id="s84">I made a life here.</span> <span id="s85">Sure we take vacations, but I never had a desire to go and visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">WH: And now you feel the desire.</span> <span id="s87">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">HL: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s89">I have no explanation.</span> <span id="s90">I always say before I die I want to go and see Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: So it was a group affidavit when you came?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HL: Yeh, I think we were the last one on Ellis Island, December of ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">WH: You left from Hamburg?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">HL: Yes, the S.S. Blancheford.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">WH: When you came to New York, what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">HL: We came here…there were tables lined up, and we had to register again, and again, and again.</span> <span id="s97">And naturally, the question is, ‘Where we gonna go?</span> <span id="s98">Where we gonna wind up?’</span> <span id="s99">In New York, or (inaudible).</span> <span id="s100">Nobody knew where Kenosha was.</span> <span id="s101">As a matter of fact, they weren’t even pronouncing it right…it was a big mix-up there…they gave us a $100.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: What were your impressions of New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">HL: I was scared!</span> <span id="s104">I mean, the buildings and everything else, my English wasn’t so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: Then they told you that you’re going to Kenosha, you didn’t know it, it could have been anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">HL: No.</span> <span id="s107">That’s right.</span> <span id="s108">As a matter of fact we went on the train to Kenosha and the conductor said that’s the right train, it’s going to Kenosha.</span> <span id="s109">Now, we had a hundred dollar bill.</span> <span id="s110">Everybody’s buying sandwiches, buying a pillow and I want a pillow, too.</span> <span id="s111">I want a sandwich, too.</span> <span id="s112">And we had a heck of a time changing the money for it.</span> <span id="s113">But finally we did it…what a ride!</span> <span id="s114">We didn’t know where we were going!</span> <span id="s115">It was a bumpy ride, it was a terrible ride.</span> <span id="s116">I mean, we were happy to go, finally after I don’t know how many weeks now, we didn’t have a home, we didn’t have anything, we were living out of suitcases, we had a great big wooden box sent before we left and we don’t know if that’s gonna come on there, and who knows?</span> <span id="s117">A different country and then – we were kind of scared.</span> <span id="s118">We were two little scared people, you know.</span> <span id="s119">And we came here, it was Christmas Eve…they met us (Jewish Agency)…and rented us a one-room apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">WH: So what was your first impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">HL: Oh, vey!</span> <span id="s122">There again, thanks to my wife, I mean, she got along fine.</span> <span id="s123">The language, and she was a secretary, and she could type and she could do this, I mean she talked English…so naturally – everybody wants to see us.</span> <span id="s124">I mean, you know, we came there 12, 1, 2 o’clock in the morning before we got into our little apartment there.</span> <span id="s125">And at 7, 8 o’clock they were knocking on the door.</span> <span id="s126">They want to meet the Lindemans from Germany, from the concentration camp, you know, and everybody brought a little dish and this and that.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">WH: You mean they came over with…</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HL: Yah!</span> <span id="s129">They had cakes and they had fruit and they had soups they brought us.</span> <span id="s130">And you know, it’s very nice, but I didn’t want to be set on display and be, you know.</span> <span id="s131">And after that, they kind of dropped us.</span> <span id="s132">I mean, I think they came once.</span> <span id="s133">And then, maybe we got 2, 3 friends out of the whole shebang who came on there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">WH: Were you the first?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">HL: I was the first one, yah, that’s probably why…</span></p> <p><span id="s136">WH: What did they ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">HL: Stupid questions…and they were talking over my head.</span> <span id="s138">I didn’t understand them.</span> <span id="s139">They were talking business already, and I wasn’t even here yet.</span> <span id="s140">I don’t have a trade.</span> <span id="s141">I never had a trade.</span> <span id="s142">I was a young boy when I got into it, and a young man when I got out of.</span> <span id="s143">Never went to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">WH: Didn’t you feel, in some way when you look back, and you think about all the effects of the Holocaust, isn’t there a sense of having felt cheated?</span> <span id="s145">In a sense that during the years, the war years, when you could have been going to school…and you start off here in a tremendous disadvantage.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HL: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s147">Well, like I say, I came up here with a hundred dollars in my pocket.</span> <span id="s148">Now the suit and everything I had naturally weren’t stylish …the only thing the Jewish Welfare did for us, they took us into a Jewish shoe store, and we both could pick out a pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s149">We went to a Jewish clothing store, and I could pick out a shirt, a tie, and a suit.</span> <span id="s150">And that was it.</span> <span id="s151">I mean, I didn’t expect anything.</span> <span id="s152">I came here to make a life.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">So, one of those haberdasheries there, the clothing store, he offered me the job washing windows and cleaning and that.</span> <span id="s154">So, “I’m going to make a window trimmer out of you.”</span> <span id="s155">What did I know about a window trimmer at that time?</span> <span id="s156">So, I worked there for three, four weeks.</span> <span id="s157">My wife right away got a job as a secretary.</span> <span id="s158">Very nice.</span> <span id="s159">Anyway, there was another clothing store, and I think he gave me 15 or 20 cents more an hour so I went with him, and then about a month or two, there was a fellow, he said, “What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s160">You are wasting your time.</span> <span id="s161">We have Simmons Company here, right on the lake, and they are hiring people.</span> <span id="s162">You can get three, four dollars an hour.</span> <span id="s163">Why don’t you apply for the job.</span> <span id="s164">At least you make some money.”</span> <span id="s165">Alright.</span> <span id="s166">I applied for the job, and I got a job.</span> <span id="s167">So now I was making $4 an hour.</span> <span id="s168">But the $4 an hour wasn’t enough because six months later my son was born.</span> <span id="s169">I didn’t have the money to pay the doctor bill.</span> <span id="s170">I didn’t have the money to pay the hospital bill.</span> <span id="s171">No insurance, of course.</span> <span id="s172">So I got another job, in another factory earning in the morning shift, and in the afternoon, here in Kenosha.</span> <span id="s173">And every week I made the rounds, I paid $5.00 for the doctor, and $5 for the hospital, and for the rent and for this and for the groceries, you know…and then we moved to a larger apartment.</span> <span id="s174">Then I thought that two full-time jobs are kind of too much.</span> <span id="s175">Didn’t see my family, I didn’t see my son any more, so there was an ad in the paper, somebody’s looking for a driver for an office furniture and equipment company.</span> <span id="s176">And I applied for the job.</span> <span id="s177">I go to the job and so I only drove the truck in the morning and worked at night at the Simmons factory.</span> <span id="s178">And he (the man he drove for) had an ad in the paper looking for a salesman.</span> <span id="s179">I applied, and he said, “I like your spunk, I’ll give you a try.”</span> <span id="s180">He give me that time a hundred dollars a week to start with, and it worked out.</span> <span id="s181">I became sales manager of the company.</span> <span id="s182">We had 20 salesmen and I worked there for 35 years, and my wife worked with me all those years, and I became 65 and I quit.</span> <span id="s183">I retired.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">WH: The war and everything that happened, do you think about it a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">HL: At the beginning, just about every day.</span> <span id="s186">As you get older, it kind of goes on the wayside.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">WH: You don’t dream about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">HL: Used to.</span> <span id="s189">Not anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: Your wife, do you talk to her about it sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">HL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">WH: You don’t discuss it?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">HL: Not anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">WH: How would you characterize your attitude towards the whole thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">HL: Thanks G-d, it’s over!</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WH: You belong to the Temple here.</span> <span id="s197">They have commemorations?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">HL: Yes.</span> <span id="s199">I do go and I say the Kaddish.</span> <span id="s200">And, you know, naturally it comes right back to me.</span> <span id="s201">No question about it.</span> <span id="s202">I don’t want to speak about it.</span> <span id="s203">If somebody—I never bring up the subject.</span> <span id="s204">But if somebody brings up the subject, I do it, but, it pains me.</span> <span id="s205">I, I don’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s206">I mean, I live with this now for forty some years, and I never, I never bring it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH: Now that you’re retired, what do you do in your spare time?</span> <span id="s208">Take care of your yard?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">HL: Yah, and we took some trips.</span> <span id="s210">We like Las Vegas.</span> <span id="s211">We go there at least twice a year.</span> <span id="s212">We travel, a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">WH: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">HL: That’s it, a son.</span> <span id="s215">He’s (not married) 39 years old…and in this community.</span> <span id="s216">I wish he marries a Jewish girl, but he’s running around with Gentile girls.</span> <span id="s217">There is nobody here.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">WH: If he married a Gentile girl, how would you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">HL: Very upset, but there’s nothing I could do about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">WH: Do you have a feeling like you’d like to see your own family line go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">HL: Right, I’d like to see my name go on.</span> <span id="s222">I’d like to have a grandchild and whatever.</span> <span id="s223">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">WH: You have no other relatives?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">HL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">WH: Does your wife have any relatives here?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">HL: Nobody.</span> <span id="s228">We got her mother over here but she died of cancer.</span> <span id="s229">No, we both have nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">WH: Ho do you deal with that?</span> <span id="s231">It must be very, very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">HL: It’s lonely at times, yes, very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">WH: Of your close friends, are all of them Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">HL: No, a few Gentiles.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">WH: What is the Jewish community here like?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">HL: It’s falling apart.</span> <span id="s237">We are less and less people…there’s not future in Kenosha.</span> <span id="s238">Kenosha is a dying city.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">WH: …(Holocaust) Do you think that what happened there could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">HL: I always think, it can happen any place, not just in America.</span> <span id="s241">I think it could happen here.</span> <span id="s242">People disagree with me violently on that, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">WH: Was there anything in your view, that could have been done to prevent Nazism from coming to power?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">HL: No.</span> <span id="s245">Well, being more or less brought up in German, I probably think like a German does.</span> <span id="s246">Hitler’s idea was okay, when he first started off, because Germany was on the verge of collapse.</span> <span id="s247">Communism, and they had so many different parties there.</span> <span id="s248">No jobs, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s249">He promised everybody a job, and everybody got a job.</span> <span id="s250">He built highways and byways, and then he started fooling around with all the boys (inaudible?</span> <span id="s251">Goys?)</span> <span id="s252">there, and that was the biggest mistake he made, when he start with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s253">That was his downfall.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">WH: You mean, ultimately that was his downfall.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">HL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">WH: You think if he hadn’t done that, he would have won the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">HL: I doubt it.</span> <span id="s258">I doubt it.</span> <span id="s259">It didn’t endear him with the rest of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">WH: How do you explain…that it was Germany…that these people…</span></p> <p><span id="s261">HL: But Germany?</span> <span id="s262">Intelligent people…the hate was implanted to the younger generations, and the other generations, again, it was…I cannot explain it, but such a hatred, came from your own neighbor, your good neighbors, and they turned you in.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WH: Do you detect it in their attitudes here, in this country, Polish-Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">HL: Well, we right now, every time.</span> <span id="s265">I have my doubts.</span> <span id="s266">Down the road there’s a neighbor, he’s from Latvia, he’s about my age, so already my age, he couldn’t have been –he was just a little kid when all that happened, but his father must have been there.</span> <span id="s267">That preys on my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">I, same with the Germans, I mean, if somebody comes from Germany, and I met him at the store, or outside in the business world.</span> <span id="s269">It always was in my mind.</span> <span id="s270">Always figured out the age, what could he have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">WH: Do you think that your life would have turned out differently had you gone where your friends went, to Chicago, for example, to a bigger city.</span> <span id="s272">Are you sorry you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">HL: No, I’m not sorry.</span> <span id="s274">Not sorry at all.</span> <span id="s275">No.</span> <span id="s276">I got used to it, living in a small city.</span> <span id="s277">I don’t like the hustle and bustle and the traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">WH: Do you think that you found a measure of peace here?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">HL: Yes, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">WH: Do you sometimes think that like this whole world, or when this happened, that it was like another, it didn’t happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">HL: Yah!</span> <span id="s282">Oh, how could, yeh, definitely, yes!</span> <span id="s283">I mean, it’s out of the blue sky.</span> <span id="s284">Everything happened so fast!</span> <span id="s285">Out of the clear, blue sky.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">WH: When a film comes on about the Holocaust, do you watch it?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">HL: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s288">I did watch it.</span> <span id="s289">Then we stay up and talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">WH: Somebody made a statement to me, a survivor…I don’t want you to be shocked, I don’t want you to be offended, but I would say to you, from my experience in the camps, and he included himself in this category, that those of us who survived, are not necessarily the best, not necessarily the nicest, not necessarily the most loyal.</span> <span id="s291">When you survived in the camps, you did what you had to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">HL: That’s right, yah, but that doesn’t mean you’re not the best.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">WH: Is this an unfair characterization?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">HL: There was a group, I bet each concentration camp had it, and each ghetto had it, where there were leaders.</span> <span id="s295">They used to call them ‘kapos.’</span> <span id="s296">And, they were ruthless.</span> <span id="s297">I mean, sometimes, you had to watch them more than – because they took on where the S.S. stopped.</span> <span id="s298">But we got rid of a lot of those kapos after the war.</span> <span id="s299">Not myself, but I know it happened.</span> <span id="s300">Hey, I was just a little kid.</span> <span id="s301">I was this small.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">WH: You were 19.</span></p> <p><span
