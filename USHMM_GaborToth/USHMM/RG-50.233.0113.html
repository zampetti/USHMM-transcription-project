id="s157">Q: When I saw my brother, sometimes he comes home he brings some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Money.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Because back home if you made for a customer something, you take this coat or suit or something to the customer’s home in a big box.</span> <span id="s160">Then he went before Shabbos, Friday, then he got a tip.</span> <span id="s161">He goes later, nobody gives him money any more.</span> <span id="s162">But he brought some tips so I liked that.</span> <span id="s163">So I said to myself, I’m going to be a tailor.</span> <span id="s164">Again also.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: That’s when you decided?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: That’s when you decided.</span> <span id="s168">So you stopped going to school and then you apprenticed?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s170">I went -- my father and mother -- they didn’t go with me to an apprentice like with my brother.</span> <span id="s171">I went by myself always.</span> <span id="s172">I always was by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Did your parents have other plans for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Did they have other plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: So they were happy that you two were going to --?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Before, I helped a little bit so when my father manufactured shoes, I helped a little bit home, to help my father.</span> <span id="s179">Then I went by myself to an apprentice, to a ladies’ tailor.</span> <span id="s180">And I went to this ladies’ tailor, you know an apprentice, you have to clean the floor, you have to go shopping with them.</span> <span id="s181">When they have a kid, you have to raise the kid.</span> <span id="s182">It wasn’t so easy.</span> <span id="s183">So I would stay for a while and then I said it’s not for me.</span> <span id="s184">I cannot learn too much because I have to do other housework.</span> <span id="s185">So I looked for somebody else.</span> <span id="s186">I looked for somebody else and I did find Yanka Fishman, a ladies’ tailor.</span> <span id="s187">This was my in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Future father-in-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">So I went to him and I was asking if he needs somebody.</span> <span id="s191">He said yes and I stayed there for a while and I got to know this Hameecha, you know what --?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s193">______.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: He was a ___</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: A cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: Yeah, to the

supported two sisters in Radom.</span> <span id="s210">Hameecha’s mother and my mother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Future mother-in-law.</span> <span id="s212">Because you were still young at this time?</span> <span id="s213">When did you start working for the Fishmans?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: For Fishman?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I think I was already nine years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Nine years old.</span> <span id="s218">You liked it better there?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I liked it better but the point was -- Yanka Fishman got the daughter, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s221">You liked this daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Pretty?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Pretty?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: First of all, she went to school at the time.</span> <span id="s227">We start talking -- the only thing was -- not in my in-law’s home but downstairs, Hameecha’s mother, she got that place, an apartment.</span> <span id="s228">She got also

comes down to the tanta.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: The aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Aunt, yeah.</span> <span id="s233">And we met over there.</span> <span id="s234">Knowing or not knowing.</span> <span id="s235">We start loving each other.</span> <span id="s236">Now we didn’t know at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: You’re still young.</span> <span id="s238">She liked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s240">I liked her and she liked--- But it wasn’t known at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: So we played around like kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I was staying for I don’t know how many years.</span> <span id="s245">Three or four years by this Fishman.</span> <span id="s246">You have to put this together.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Sure, oh sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Then I did find out and we got --sometimes we got a date with mine -- the girl, my wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Your future wife, whose name was Hannah, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Hannah Taube.</span> <span id="s251">We called her Taube.</span> <span id="s252">In Polish they call the Tola.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Tola, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: So sometimes we meet downstairs without knowing

friend and we met…She came down there, we talked, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s258">So later on I said to myself, Yanka Fishman got a son.</span> <span id="s259">He worked for his father.</span> <span id="s260">Hameecha, you know, my friend, the cousin, the uncle, he worked there too and I’m a stranger there.</span> <span id="s261">I didn’t learn too much.</span> <span id="s262">I didn’t learn too much so one day I went to Yanka Fishman and I said, Mr. Fishman, I cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s263">He said, why?</span> <span id="s264">I said because I don’t learn too much.</span> <span id="s265">The son and you, Hameecha there and I’m the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: So I said I have to go look for something better.</span> <span id="s268">He admires this what I said.</span> <span id="s269">He liked it.</span> <span id="s270">He said okay.</span> <span id="s271">So I went -- at the time I knew already a little bit -- I went to another tailor by the name of Itzrek Schneider.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Good name to be a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span

important what I’m telling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Sure, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: But mine in-law’s sister, downstairs, Hameecha’s mother, she got Hameecha and she

id="s1998">A: Over there we got special to make dresses for the German women, wholesale dresses.</span> <span id="s1999">We worked on the dresses.</span> <span id="s2000">When I was working in the shop, somebody came in and he said Yitzrek your schragen is here.</span> <span id="s2001">I said what?</span> <span id="s2002">You know what a schragen means?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">Q: Your

heard a voice.</span> <span id="s2008">She starts screaming Itzrek, it’s me, Dinka.</span> <span id="s2009">Dinka’s her name.</span> <span id="s2010">I looked at her.</span> <span id="s2011">I didn’t recognize her.</span> <span id="s2012">She looked so terrible, without hair, with a thing on the head, a cover.</span> <span id="s2013">She looked terrible.</span> <span id="s2014">I said to her don’t worry.</span> <span id="s2015">I’m going to try to give her a place where to stay in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2016">I tried when we make the dresses.</span> <span id="s2017">I tried to give her a dress.</span> <span id="s2018">I tried to see that she should have something to eat.</span> <span id="s2019">I cannot go home to the barracks yet.</span> <span id="s2020">So when the day was finished, I met her.</span> <span id="s2021">We talked and she told me what happened.</span> <span id="s2022">The kid, she -- first of all, she told me -- my brother got typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Eli?</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">A: Yeah, in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s2025">She managed when she went out to work, she managed to bring him a piece of bread sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: So she was at Plaszow too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: She had been at Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Yeah, with the

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">Q: Everybody, and then --?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">A: Went down and she can only get to my brother to replace a toilet, you know.</span> <span id="s2035">She can throw over to him some -- she organized some bread.</span> <span id="s2036">The kid was hiding in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2037">Not a peep.</span> <span id="s2038">That’s what she told me.</span> <span id="s2039">One day, they took away from the place where she worked and they transferred her to me, to my camp.</span> <span id="s2040">She comes in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Alone, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Alone.</span> <span id="s2043">Without the kid.</span> <span id="s2044">She said, I don’t know what happened to the kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Where was the kid when she left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: In Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: But with --?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: In the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: In the barrack with no one taking care of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: No.</span> <span id="s2051">They saw the kid, they killed him.</span> <span id="s2052">What else?</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Eli was still sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Eli was still alive when she left.</span> <span id="s2055">But after the war, I did find out that he starved to death in Plaszow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: You don’t know when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: No.</span> <span id="s2058">So now I’m on the Skolna, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Yes, with your sister-in-law and your friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Yeah, we’re all together.</span> <span id="s2061">Then the same thing happened.</span> <span id="s2062">A transport arrived from Buzim.</span> <span id="s2063">You heard of Buzim?</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: When the transport arrived from Buzim, everything changed.</span> <span id="s2066">With them came a lot of kapos.</span> <span id="s2067">Not only Jewish kapos, other nationalities, kapos.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Polish, Ukrainian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2070">Because they liquidated Majdanek.</span> <span id="s2071">They were sent here to our place.</span> <span id="s2072">When the Buzim arrived, start stealing.</span> <span id="s2073">The Buzim, they were our people but ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: Thieves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: I don’t know if they were thieves, they were butchers and all kind of people.</span> <span id="s2076">Listen to this; I was sleeping one night on top of the barrack and I had a hand is crawling under mine -- like pillow.</span> <span id="s2077">Of course, you know, if you’re hiding what you have under pillow, some money or something.</span> <span id="s2078">On the Plaszow from the suit was hanging on the ceiling.</span> <span id="s2079">I got sewed in there diamond.</span> <span id="s2080">The rest was in the shop.</span> <span id="s2081">So when I heard the hand is crawling in and I was thinking what to do.</span> <span id="s2082">I was thinking I’m going to get up first and catch him.</span> <span id="s2083">I got up first and I start screaming and I caught an undershirt.</span> <span id="s2084">He was pulling away a black undershirt.</span> <span id="s2085">I have the piece from the undershirt in my hand and he’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: You didn’t know who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: No.</span> <span id="s2088">I did find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q: From Buzim?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2091">I start screaming and everybody on the lower beds, everybody catch each other.</span> <span id="s2092">He was coming out from the barrack already.</span> <span id="s2093">We was still looking for him.</span> <span id="s2094">I have the place from the shirt.</span> <span id="s2095">If you go around, where there’s an empty bed, maybe he run out from the barrack or something, but no empty bed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q: How did you find out who he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A: So in the morning, I reported to -- the diamond from the Plaszow is gone, not hanging any more on top.</span> <span id="s2098">Was on the floor.</span> <span id="s2099">So next day I went to Friedman, _____ to Fishman, and they went to the Buzim barrack looking for somebody missing a piece of the shirt which was stupid.</span> <span id="s2100">When we went in the barrack looking for the guy who was stealing, somebody came in and he said, that the kapos arrived, so forget about it.</span> <span id="s2101">They’re going to liquidate us.</span> <span id="s2102">That was not true.</span> <span id="s2103">The kapos was still there.</span> <span id="s2104">I didn’t know who took it.</span> <span id="s2105">We still were there.</span> <span id="s2106">Then one day, they’re going to liquidate the Skolna.</span> <span id="s2107">No more Jews in Radom.</span> <span id="s2108">So one day everybody has to go marching.</span> <span id="s2109">We went marching.</span> <span id="s2110">There was no trains, we marched by foot.</span> <span id="s2111">We didn’t know where we going.</span> <span id="s2112">We marched by day.</span> <span id="s2113">At night they let us go in a tent (?)</span> <span id="s2114">to lay down, to sleep.</span> <span id="s2115">Some people, they couldn’t walk any more.</span> <span id="s2116">If they know what happen, they would walk.</span> <span id="s2117">A car -- not a car -- a horse and a wagon went in the back, goes with us, went with us.</span> <span id="s2118">The SS said who cannot walk any more is tired, should go on the wagon.</span> <span id="s2119">Near me was Mr. G_____, a little bit older than me and Mrs. Zucker.</span> <span id="s2120">Her husband got killed on the sch______ when I told you was a fire, sabotage.</span> <span id="s2121">They killed her husband and other people.</span> <span id="s2122">They went on the wagon.</span> <span id="s2123">When the wagon was full, the wagon disappeared.</span> <span id="s2124">Then he came back, empty.</span> <span id="s2125">Some other people, next time, they still went on the wagon.</span> <span id="s2126">But later on, we saw something is not kosher.</span> <span id="s2127">The second time, the wagon disappeared.</span> <span id="s2128">The third time, nobody went on the wagon any more.</span> <span id="s2129">Because we was sleeping on the field and then one day they said water arrived to give us, to drink water.</span> <span id="s2130">It was so a mess that they start shooting.</span> <span id="s2131">They shoot the people in the lakes.</span> <span id="s2132">A lot of people.</span> <span id="s2133">Then when they have to march again, yeah, they marched with bullets in the legs.</span> <span id="s2134">They didn’t go on the wagon any more.</span> <span id="s2135">But the last night, they were sleeping on the field before we went into Tomaszow- ________.</span> <span id="s2136">It was a family -- what was the name -- Sinna I think.</span> <span id="s2137">Was a mother, a daughter, and two sons.</span> <span id="s2138">Sinnas.</span> <span id="s2139">When we were sleeping on the field, they took off the corn already from the field.</span> <span id="s2140">You know, was – the ground was soaked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: Wet?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: They digged.</span> <span id="s2143">They start digging.</span> <span id="s2144">They digged a hole in the ground.</span> <span id="s2145">They were prepared for it.</span> <span id="s2146">They digged a hole in the ground and the two Sinnas, the two brothers when they saw that it’s going to be light already, we have to march again, they got in there and the daughter, the sister and this wife, they covered up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">Q: So two brothers buried themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Yeah, they covered them up with dirt.</span> <span id="s2149">They covered them up with dirt and they got paper to put on the face and they got from bottles, the neck, the neck from the bottles to give them in the mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: To breathe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: To breathe.</span> <span id="s2152">When daylight arrived and we have to go, they were sitting on this grave.</span> <span id="s2153">On top of them.</span> <span id="s2154">Because it was dogs also, they were sitting.</span> <span id="s2155">Then when the SS were screaming, roust going, going.</span> <span id="s2156">So they were the last ones to leave.</span> <span id="s2157">Nobody should step on the grave, you know, nothing.</span> <span id="s2158">And they left.</span> <span id="s2159">Two brothers were there.</span> <span id="s2160">They survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: They survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: But you didn’t know that until ___?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: No, till after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: But as far as you could tell, they were left in the field alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: Oh yeah, they were alone.</span> <span id="s2167">Covered up and nobody saw them and nothing.</span> <span id="s2168">They survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: These are friends of yours from Radom?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: Yeah, they are Radomen, yeah.</span> <span id="s2171">The Sinnas, I knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">Q: Now the people that had gotten on the wagons before -- they never came back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Did you ever find out what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Yeah, we did find out later.</span> <span id="s2176">They took them to the woods and they killed them.</span> <span id="s2177">They come back empty again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Do you know anyone who buried them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: I know who did.</span> <span id="s2180">He was the S --.</span> <span id="s2181">He was in the revea, the hospitals.</span> <span id="s2182">He got a Polish name.</span> <span

there.</span> <span id="s2187">So we start working again till we arrive in Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s2188">We arrive in Tomaszow.</span> <span id="s2189">They let us in, in a good factory.</span> <span id="s2190">They made goods for, you know --.</span> <span id="s2191">Tomaszow was well known to make materials.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q: Textiles?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A:

id="s2754">I didn’t give in.</span> <span id="s2755">Then when I worked, I went home in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2756">I picked up my shirt here all red.</span> <span id="s2757">My belly was all red, spots, red spots.</span> <span id="s2758">I knew it’s typhus.</span> <span id="s2759">I still went to work because if I go into the barrack, I’m dead.</span> <span id="s2760">But it took a while, I couldn’t work any more.</span> <span id="s2761">They carried me in their arm so I have to go in.</span> <span id="s2762">So I went into Moishe Goldberg’s barrack.</span> <span id="s2763">Moishe

God.</span> <span id="s2776">I went in and the guy was laying in bed still.</span> <span id="s2777">Was still alive.</span> <span id="s2778">This guy has diarrhea.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">Q: Right in the bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">A: In the bed, yeah.</span> <span id="s2781">He was still alive.</span> <span id="s2782">They pulled him out by the legs.</span> <span id="s2783">Like I see it now.</span> <span id="s2784">You know what they did with me?</span> <span id="s2785">They throw me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">Q: Right in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: In the mess.</span> <span id="s2788">I say to myself, that’s it.</span> <span id="s2789">If I would drop dead, I wouldn’t mind but I always was conscious of to be clean.</span> <span id="s2790">Here I lay in a mess, somebody else’s mess.</span> <span id="s2791">Not on top, on the bottom.</span> <span id="s2792">Then I start looking for help.</span> <span id="s2793">Moishe Goldberg cannot talk.</span> <span id="s2794">He got a _______.</span> <span id="s2795">He took care of the room.</span> <span id="s2796">Was also a Radoman, Friedman.</span> <span id="s2797">I didn’t know him too good.</span> <span id="s2798">Later I got to be a friend of his.</span> <span id="s2799">I start calling.</span> <span id="s2800">Friedman, if you can give me a sack with straw, you know, and take this away.</span> <span id="s2801">He didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s2802">I said, ______ was his name.</span> <span id="s2803">Also ______ Friedom, like the policeman.</span> <span id="s2804">I have some dollars, I give you some dollars.</span> <span id="s2805">He felt, he said okay.</span> <span id="s2806">I’m going to put on you -- mattress.</span> <span id="s2807">Mattress huh -- straw on top.</span> <span id="s2808">I said, this would be fine.</span> <span id="s2809">I paid him.</span> <span id="s2810">Money can buy everything.</span> <span id="s2811">Then I was laying and the crisis arrived.</span> <span id="s2812">I was laying again in water, top.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">Q: Somebody’s ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">A: From myself, no.</span> <span id="s2815">This water comes from myself.</span> <span id="s2816">When you have the crisis, you start perspiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2817">Q: The fever’s high?</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">A: Yeah, high and then you perspire.</span> <span id="s2819">When you survive this perspiring, you’re okay.</span> <span id="s2820">One day I lay again in water from myself.</span> <span id="s2821">I felt the crisis went over and I’m still alive.</span> <span id="s2822">After that typhus, you need to eat.</span> <span id="s2823">Let’s say when they give you my whole Frigidaire with another grocery store, not enough.</span> <span id="s2824">I don’t know where it goes but you can eat so much, it’s unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">Q: Where are you going to get the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s2826">A: I called to Laza Malamit -- message.</span> <span id="s2827">They cannot come in here.</span> <span id="s2828">They can send me a piece of bread or something like this.</span> <span id="s2829">They did, they did.</span> <span id="s2830">Then they did find somebody by the name of Firdik.</span> <span id="s2831">He went outside the walls.</span> <span id="s2832">He brought in always food.</span> <span id="s2833">I said to -- let him bring me marmalade if it possible and an onion.</span> <span id="s2834">Because you get scurvy, you know what means scurvot?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: Scurvy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: Scurvot means you don’t have the vitamins or lemon or --.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: Yeah, scurvy.</span> <span id="s2838">Your gums get -- your teeth fall out.</span> <span id="s2839">Scurvy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: A lot of people died of this.</span> <span id="s2841">I said I need a -- he can bring me.</span> <span id="s2842">I give him a ten dollar bill if he can bring me marmalade, onion and a bread.</span> <span id="s2843">He did.</span> <span id="s2844">So the jar of marmalade was under the pillow.</span> <span id="s2845">Lice, a lot, who cares.</span> <span id="s2846">You eat the lice.</span> <span id="s2847">I put in my hand always in the jar and licked it the marmalade.</span> <span id="s2848">I got the onion to eat.</span> <span id="s2849">No, I got the bread because the bread I have to hold with me.</span> <span id="s2850">I’m laying like this, still hungry.</span> <span id="s2851">In the same barrack, across the street, he was a Swiss or other nation, he got Red Cross packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: He’s not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">A: No, not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2854">When I looked at him, the way he was eating the package -- chocolate and all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s2855">Oh, I cannot go down from bed.</span> <span id="s2856">Maybe I would steal from him, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2857">Then I was thinking to myself.</span> <span id="s2858">Why he can get a package from the Red Cross and I couldn’t get it.</span> <span id="s2859">Unless he -- you know the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2861">You’re asking the question now.</span> <span id="s2862">Could you ask the question then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">A: No.</span> <span id="s2864">To whom am I going to ask a question?</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">A: And you couldn’t talk to him?</span> <span id="s2866">You couldn’t buy anything from him?</span> <span id="s2867">You were too far away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2869">Then I said to myself.</span> <span id="s2870">After the war, if I’m going to survive, no Red Cross for me.</span> <span id="s2871">I’m going to hate them always and I’m not going to donate a penny to the Red Cross any more.</span> <span id="s2872">The Jewish donating money to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s2873">I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s2874">If they can give a package to him, why not to me?</span> <span id="s2875">Nobody would know.</span> <span id="s2876">So I’m laying here hungry, don’t know what’s going on outside.</span> <span id="s2877">All of a sudden, some people, Meyer Pasternak, a lot of people, they run into the barrack, to my barrack!</span> <span id="s2878">They not allowed to go in.</span> <span id="s2879">It’s dangerous.</span> <span id="s2880">They’re hiding.</span> <span id="s2881">They’re hiding in this barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: Underneath the beds, on the ceiling.</span> <span id="s2884">You can open -- go under the roof.</span> <span id="s2885">Because they liquidate Vaihingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: So they’re afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: They took the people from Vaihingen to Dachau.</span> <span id="s2888">Laza Malamit went, Moishe Krol went, Meyer Pasternak, he’s in Florida.</span> <span id="s2889">He’s a smart cookie, he didn’t go.</span> <span id="s2890">He was hiding.</span> <span id="s2891">Then the SS did find out.</span> <span id="s2892">They came with guns and they shoot in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2893">I don’t know how many people got killed or what.</span> <span id="s2894">I was laying covered up on my place.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">Q: So they shot right there in front of you?</span> <span id="s2896">You could see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">A: Yeah, in the barrack.</span> <span id="s2898">In the ceiling, underneath, everywhere.</span> <span id="s2899">Because they knew they were hiding.</span> <span id="s2900">But still a lot of people were hiding.</span> <span id="s2901">Next day, in the morning, just next day, people come in and they brought me white bread.</span> <span id="s2902">White bread, all kind of things!</span> <span id="s2903">I said what happened?</span> <span id="s2904">The French army passed.</span> <span id="s2905">He said, we are liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Q: Do you remember the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">A: Yeah, the day was the fifth of April.</span> <span id="s2908">I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">Q: In Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">A: In Vaihingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: But some of your friends had gone to Dacha?</span></p> <p><span id="s2912">A: Yeah, Dacha.</span> <span id="s2913">They suffered a lot.</span> <span id="s2914">Some dropped dead and some survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">Q: Now a name you didn’t just mention now was Moishe Rafilovich.</span> <span id="s2916">What happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">A: He died in Vaihingen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">Q: In Vaihingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">A: I was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: He got typhus too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: No, he died of lungs.</span> <span id="s2922">When I came out and then I did find out -- Moishe Rafilovish died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: Disease in Vaihingen?</span> <span id="s2924">Was it near the end?</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">A: Near the end, yes.</span> <span id="s2926">He told me -- it was a special -- was F _____ and _______.</span> <span id="s2927">They took the dead people in the back.</span> <span id="s2928">Over there was an open pit, they throw him in.</span> <span id="s2929">He told me he took Rafilovich out there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Do you remember when that was?</span> <span id="s2931">Was it in March?</span> <span id="s2932">Was it just before you got liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">A: A short time I was liberated before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Just before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">Q: And you didn’t see him in sick barrack?</span> <span id="s2937">When you were in the sick barrack he was already --?</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">A: No, I didn’t see him any more.</span> <span id="s2939">Because I was with typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Q: But I mean he had the lung disease.</span> <span id="s2941">They didn’t put him in the sick bay?</span> <span id="s2942">Moishe, they didn’t put Moishe in the sick barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">A: In the sick barrack, no.</span> <span id="s2944">He died in the regular barrack.</span> <span id="s2945">This barrack was only for contaminated people, typhus.</span> <span id="s2946">So when I got this bread and they told me we are liberated, I said to myself, I’m not going to lay in bed.</span> <span id="s2947">I start crawling from bed down out to the field.</span> <span id="s2948">The wire was cut already, the people cut the wire and I was crawling on the field where the trucks passed, the French army.</span> <span id="s2949">They saw me, they stopped the truck and they came down and they brought me a lot of stuff, packages and chocolate and bread and everything.</span> <span id="s2950">I’m laying here with all the stuff, I cannot carry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: And you smelled?</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: But somebody helped me to take in to the barrack.</span> <span id="s2953">I went into the barrack and I said why am I sitting in this barrack already?</span> <span id="s2954">I went out in the camp.</span> <span id="s2955">It took maybe another hour, we still didn’t get out.</span> <span id="s2956">We are afraid to get out.</span> <span id="s2957">The French army came in.</span> <span id="s2958">The French army came in and they start putting DDT on everybody.</span> <span id="s2959">The army never bathed because they were afraid to go in.</span> <span id="s2960">They put the powder over you, all over the place.</span> <span id="s2961">The French people start looking around and they went in the back and they saw how many people laying in this ditch with the striped suits, a lot.</span> <span id="s2962">They think hundreds and hundreds.</span> <span id="s2963">Then they called the mayor from Vaihingen, the mayor or somebody and the people come over.</span> <span id="s2964">They should look what they did.</span> <span id="s2965">One French soldier, a Jewish, I think he was Jewish, he gives me a gun.</span> <span id="s2966">When he gives me a gun, I kill him (?)</span> <span id="s2967">The people who come to work.</span> <span id="s2968">They brought people to work, to bury the people.</span> <span id="s2969">I never got a gun in my hand I says and I cannot kill nobody.</span> <span id="s2970">He looks at me stupid.</span> <span id="s2971">So we were staying in this barrack and they caught the SS.</span> <span id="s2972">Hechay, the two guys in the kitchen plus Machine and Bill.</span> <span id="s2973">There what they did, their job, they cooked.</span> <span id="s2974">They worked with the people with the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2975">They were the top Jewish people cooking.</span> <span id="s2976">They went home, we were staying on that field to count us.</span> <span id="s2977">They went through you, like this, and hit here in the testicles.</span> <span id="s2978">A lot of people they were no men any more.</span> <span id="s2979">What they went through, they hate you all the time.</span> <span id="s2980">Even you were hiding, holding like this, they caught them.</span> <span id="s2981">They caught almost all the SS except Miller the ______.</span> <span id="s2982">One was there, a Wehrmacht, the _______, we called him.</span> <span id="s2983">He worked also with them but he was not doing too much damage.</span> <span
