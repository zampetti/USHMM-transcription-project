a few background questions --</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: -- because the museum evidently does not have the full names of your brother, your sister and your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s21">Well, my father’s name is Osser, it’s O-s-s-e-r, Beker, B-e-k-e-r, that’s my maiden name.</span> <span id="s22">And my mother’s is -- her maiden name was Friedman, Mina, M-i-n-a.</span> <span id="s23">And -- And my brother is Abe, A-b-e, Beker, B-e-k-e-r.</span> <span id="s24">And my sister, at that time her -- Rachel and her married name now is Levitin, L-e-v-t-i-t -- t-i-n, Levitin.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s26">And there was also a question about do you know when or how your father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: My father died in 1938.</span> <span id="s28">They found him on the street dead.</span> <span id="s29">We didn’t know, when they brought him back to the little town where we were in Yasfenna -- he died in Kalnus -- whether it was robbery or -- we -- I really don’t know, or a heart attack, I have no knowledge.</span> <span id="s30">But I know that he was -- he died in ‘38, before the Russians came into Lithuania.</span> <span id="s31">And that’s how my mother moved to Kalnus, to the big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s33">Just a few more background questions.</span> <span id="s34">You had mentioned in the interview that you were still kind of haunted and thinking about Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Yes, and I wonder if -- well, there was a question about how did you spend your days there?</span> <span id="s39">Did you work, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: In Stutthof concentration camp, we mostly stood and in the beginning, we stood in appelle and then -- when we first arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: In a --</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: In appelle, just waiting to be taken, either to the gas chamber or to be killed or to crematorium or any -- that, and we worked.</span> <span id="s43">The following -- I think a month later, after we were there, we were -- we worked in a small -- there was a small factory and they were making big bolts for the German army.</span> <span id="s44">I don’t know what they were doing for the German army or Polish, or -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s45">And we worked there, just loading and there would come off the conveyor belt and we would put it in -- into boxes and take it.</span> <span id="s46">Then, after awhile we worked in the fields, there were fields that -- picking vegetables like cabbage and that, bringing it in for the -- into the camp.</span> <span id="s47">And -- And that’s what we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: And when you say we, you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: My mother and my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And at night, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: And the -- the rest of the people, I mean some people just would take sweaters apart, the wool from the sweaters apart.</span> <span id="s52">There were groups of people sitting there.</span> <span id="s53">It came apparent that the -- the money that they made or what they -- they were knitting scarfs.</span> <span id="s54">So, they would send them to the German army and -- and th -- but th-the labor was done by the people who, they were there and that’s from this goods that they took away from us when we arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: And was there any sort of ways that at -- at night, after work was done and you were with your mother and your sister, how would you spend your time then?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: We were so exhausted and so hungry that when we would be in the barracks, we -- we could not walk around in the barracks just at our will, we had to get into the bunk bed and stay there, when we came in at night.</span> <span id="s57">During the day, we weren’t allowed to be in the barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Okay, and I also wanted to ask you then to jump to Mrs. Unstrom?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: U-Unstrom, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Mm-hm, and her family.</span> <span id="s61">When you were with that particular family, I know it was -- were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: That was not in Stutthof, that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: I’m -- I’m moving now --</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: -- these are just background --</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: -- follow up questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So we will be moving --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Mm--hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Were you paid in any way for your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s73">We were -- she knew we were kriggskafangener, which was refugees that were under the -- you know, they didn’t know we were Jewish and we worked as slave labor, you know.</span> <span id="s74">And -- And we worked there and it -- she was just horrible -- just horrible.</span> <span id="s75">Had 11 children.</span> <span id="s76">And every night was a ritual, whatever was leftover from her children, she would tie our hands behind our back, so we would amuse her children, eating on our knees.</span> <span id="s77">And if we did -- if they didn’t laugh enough or amuse them enough -- was a ritual for her -- she would beat us.</span> <span id="s78">And on Sunday, would take us to church, which -- she had one dress, we would put on that dress, I -- and go with her to church.</span> <span id="s79">And I just went back there, the first time -- I was back there now twice, which in the last six years, and the first time I was back, I couldn’t believe I found the place.</span> <span id="s80">They changed it a little bit, they made -- you know, but this was the place where we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: In what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: It’s called Misucheva.</span> <span id="s83">It’s 80 kilometers from Danzig.</span> <span id="s84">It’s near Stutthof.</span> <span id="s85">And I -- I found the place and it was just -- just incredible to g -- relive to s -- wi-with the place.</span> <span id="s86">And with her, wh-when they -- in -- was in 1945, he ha -- it was around March, we -- they were evacuating all the people from the area and we sailed with her and we were told -- she told us -- this is the story that she said, that if -- we didn’t want to go with her, but if we didn’t that they would let out the sewers, they’re letting the sewers out and flooding the whole area, which is near Gdansk, which is a large port.</span> <span id="s87">And so we left and we went to Denmark with her.</span> <span id="s88">And as soon as we went into the harbor, we were torpedoed, the boat torpedoed.</span> <span id="s89">And we were -- I don’t know how long I was in the -- in the -- in the sea.</span> <span id="s90">You know, it’s the North Sea there, Atlantic.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How old were you at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: At that time, I was fiftee -- no, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s93">And so she w -- from then, we lost her.</span> <span id="s94">We didn’t know -- she enda -- she survived the dr -- she wasn’t drowned and we were in the water, I have no idea how long.</span> <span id="s95">I was so numb that when they picked me up, they wrapped me in blankets, I was -- my sister and me, we held up on a plank.</span> <span id="s96">To this day, I don’t swim -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: You were torpedoed and then you -- so you were in the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: In the water.</span> <span id="s99">The boat sank that we started out from Danzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: And the -- then, from there, they took us with a small boat, all the G-Germans -- this was, you know, now it’s Poland, but at that time it was Germany and they took us to the -- to Denmark.</span> <span id="s102">And when we arrived in Denmark, they put us in -- in a gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Was it the Germans who took you?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah, the Germans.</span> <span id="s105">But they didn’t know we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s106">They were -- took us with Mrs. Unstrom, but they picked up all the people and they took us to Denmark.</span> <span id="s107">They put us in a big auditorium.</span> <span id="s108">and we could go out now, for the first time.</span> <span id="s109">We could go out and -- as long as we came back by dusk.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Was this like a -- a school?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: It was a school and it was -- the place was called -- the little town was called Svininga, in Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And did you then -- you were then separated from Mrs. Unstrom?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: We were separated from Mrs. Unstrom, but we found out that she survived and five of her kids drowned.</span> <span id="s114">And it was very interesting, there was a trial in Denmark, because we -- well, I don’t know, do you want me to talk about that?</span> <span id="s115">Well, when we came to -- to Denmark, on May fifth, 1945, I’ll never forget the day we were liberated, the war was over, yeah.</span> <span id="s116">Actually, the very end of March, it was like maybe the 30th of March, so -- so I was only maybe five weeks later.</span> <span id="s117">Five weeks later, du-during that five weeks, before liberation, we didn’t do anything, we were just -- could go on the street.</span> <span id="s118">We could -- had to stay in the little town.</span> <span id="s119">We could walk around and as long as we came back by dusk.</span> <span id="s120">And we were all in this big auditorium and I remember one day we were walking, my sister and I and there was a woman working in the fields and we asked her, “Are there any Jews here?”</span> <span id="s121">And she said, “When you Germans --” she thought we were Germans -- “When you Germans are going to be in concentration camps, the Jews will come back from Sweden.”</span> <span id="s122">And we were afraid to start asking her more -- for more information because we thought, at that time, that we were the only two Jews, that we were going to survive.</span> <span id="s123">And that was very important to us, because before we got to Mrs. Unstrom, we -- we -- when we first escaped -- you probably have that on the tape, no?</span> <span id="s124">When we first escaped, the -- what happened is they took us out of Stutthof.</span> <span id="s125">And that was the end of December or the very beginning of January and in that -- that I can say that is because the Christmas trees were still in the people’s homes.</span> <span id="s126">So we knew it was around that time.</span> <span id="s127">We didn’t know exactly the dates and so forth.</span> <span id="s128">And as soon as we wa -- we walk a whole day -- my sister was so sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s129">By then, already, my mother was taken into the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s130">I was with her inside the gas chamber and that, you have that, I’m sure, on the tape.</span> <span id="s131">And I had absolutely -- I could hardly walk, but I really had such a strong sense that I wanted to survive, because I felt someone has to tell what happened.</span> <span id="s132">Because the mo-most difficult part of it was that we all thought none of us will come out alive and there will be no one to talk about, no one to tell anything, nobody will know.</span> <span id="s133">And we all vowed ourselves that we will tell -- whoever survives will remember and we will tell and that’s why I was back a couple of times to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s134">It just -- I feel that everybody there was my family, and that I have to go -- as painful as it is, I have to go out to tell.</span> <span id="s135">So we -- my sister -- I was dragging her and she keeps saying, “I can’t go on.”</span> <span id="s136">She was -- she had typhus.</span> <span id="s137">Just right then, she had gotten typhus.</span> <span id="s138">And I kept saying, “We will live, we will live.”</span> <span id="s139">And I kept egging on and all of a sudden, the sky opened up and the bombs started to fall and everybody started to run, everybody started to run.</span> <span id="s140">And I had no energy.</span> <span id="s141">I just fell into a ditch with an -- there was another woman, Luba, who was helping me.</span> <span id="s142">She was holding me up.</span> <span id="s143">I don’t know who was holding who, we were all three.</span> <span id="s144">And we saw a house and we walked across the house and we knocked on the door.</span> <span id="s145">And the woman opened up the door and as if she knew we were coming and we were wearing the striped dress with the clogs and [indecipherable] the wind was howling, it was a big storm.</span> <span id="s146">And she quickly tore off, and we were now standing naked in front of her -- tore off our clothes and gave us clothing and told to the Russiansaw who was working there, he was a prisoner of war, that we are -- to taken us to the Umschlagplatz to be killed.</span> <span id="s147">And that’s where they took all the people, to the Umschlagplatz to be killed.</span> <span id="s148">And they gave us some food and oh, I was so sick from just having the first -- you know, real food.</span> <span id="s149">And we stayed there a couple of hours, til night time.</span> <span id="s150">And h-he sat there and she gave us a shawl and clothes and gave us some food and she told him to take us to the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s151">Why she did it -- you know, my sister always says, “You gave -- give that woman credit that she saved our lives.”</span> <span id="s152">And I said, “Yeah, because if she hadn’t taken off the clothes from us and if she hasn’t told the soldier to take us, where he saved our lives.”</span> <span id="s153">What he did was, we went out and Luba, who could not longer go -- she was much older and we were and she said she was going to remain there.</span> <span id="s154">And when I was just back there, I found out that she died and they buried her right there in the farm.</span> <span id="s155">And so, anyways, we went with this so -- Russian guy and he said, “I’m not taking you to the Umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s156">What I’m going to do is -- is I’m going to -- I’m going to take you to the nearest point where it’s frozen.”</span> <span id="s157">It’s called the vikes -- it was called the Vikesel, now it’s the Vistula river.</span> <span id="s158">And -- the narrowest point and wi -- and he was on the horse, he was making tracks and we were following him.</span> <span id="s159">And he said to call on all our force.</span> <span id="s160">If it’s wet, we will drown, because that means that the ice is broken.</span> <span id="s161">And we should do it at night so nobody detect us.</span> <span id="s162">And all night long, we were crawling across.</span> <span id="s163">Th-They just filmed it and the film of there, you know, it was beautiful, you know, in the summer and that.</span> <span id="s164">And we got across on the other side and he told us to go to a convent.</span> <span id="s165">Th-The nuns w -- an -- but we should say we are not Jewish, we should say --</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: What country is this?</span> <span id="s167">And what language were you speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: This is -- we were speaking to him -- my sister knew Russian, because we lived under Stalin for a few years.</span> <span id="s169">And -- but this was -- they were all speaking German.</span> <span id="s170">Now, it’s Poland, but then it was Germany, was East Germany.</span> <span id="s171">So, what happened is we -- we -- my name became from Udit -- Uta.</span> <span id="s172">Beker is a German name.</span> <span id="s173">And hers, from Wachal became Anna and we were now were wandering and we got to the -- to the convent and the nuns were wonderful to -- but they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: So, the river was frozen?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: The river was frozen.</span> <span id="s176">We crawled across the river all night long and we are able to go on the other side.</span> <span id="s177">And he said to go to the -- on the other side.</span> <span id="s178">The river divided so it was -- where Stutthof was, was on one side and da -- and the road -- there is a bridge now that you can go over, is -- but it’s really frozen because they have horses going across, I mean, that particular year, it was frozen.</span> <span id="s179">That was also when they attacked Russia and they couldn’t do it, because the winter was so s-severe.</span> <span id="s180">And we are talking of the year of 1944 -- ‘45.</span> <span id="s181">And so, we -- she -- and we got into the convent.</span> <span id="s182">The convent, the nuns were wonderful, they washed us, they bathed us, they took care of us.</span> <span id="s183">And my sister’s typhus got better, but I got sick.</span> <span id="s184">And they said to us that we cannot -- they cannot keep us.</span> <span id="s185">They knew we were Jewish -- that we would have to -- they would have to baptize us.</span> <span id="s186">We’d have to convert.</span> <span id="s187">And that we didn’t want.</span> <span id="s188">It was the most important thing.</span> <span id="s189">The more they said they would do it, which in -- few days we decided we will not stay there.</span> <span id="s190">We were -- we talk about it now, how foolish we were.</span> <span id="s191">But we didn’t know what that meaned, conversion and we, only to survive, to -- wanted to survive as Jews.</span> <span id="s192">We wanted to tell the world what happened as Jews.</span> <span id="s193">We didn’t want to be Catholics or anything else.</span> <span id="s194">So we left and my sister -- and I was very, very sick, the -- again we met another Russian, because the Russian liberated that area and there were lot of fighting and took me to Danzig and left me on the steps of the hospital.</span> <span id="s195">And my sister said, “You can’t say a word, you s -- you’re stoom, you’re no -- no -- don’t make -- you know, don’t talk.”</span> <span id="s196">And she, without realizing it, crossed the bridge and went back to the same place near there -- near Stutthof, without realizing it.</span> <span id="s197">Because when I was just there, I’ve realize how close it is to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s198">She went to the bridge and they told her that there is a place there -- she didn’t know from Wehrmacht, from what, you know, she didn’t know of that -- that they are looking for work -- that they need workers.</span> <span id="s199">So, we wen -- she worked -- went into a Wehrmacht station, which is -- you know, the German army, where they get all their -- and thats was Mrs. Unstrom, that’s what she had.</span> <span id="s200">She had this huge, huge house and she was running like a hotel, or -- you know, for -- a stopover for the Wehrmacht -- for the German army to come.</span> <span id="s201">And when we worked -- and then, when I get better, she came and -- and got me back to the -- to the house where she worked.</span> <span id="s202">And it happened so fast, it happened within weeks, with the period of week.</span> <span id="s203">I was in the hospital, I think, for two weeks.</span> <span id="s204">She came and picked me up and we were there maybe 10 days on that farm and then we sailed for Denmark.</span> <span id="s205">But those 10 days was just horrifying, horrifying days, beca --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Do you think she knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Why on earth would she have treated children so badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Well, why -- why did they kill the million and a half children and a million -- 11 million people, six million Jews, why?</span> <span id="s210">I mean, she was German, her husband was in the SS.</span> <span id="s211">She -- She was real Nazi and -- and th-the people that are living around Stutthof right now, and I went into a couple of houses and interviewed them and asked them, did -- did you know what happened in Stutthof and they said yes.</span> <span id="s212">But, I’m talking the people who were, at that time, 18 - 20.</span> <span id="s213">I mean, they’re in their 80’s and 90’s, you know, and it’s -- the older people.</span> <span id="s214">And they said, “Yeah, we knew.”</span> <span id="s215">“What did you do about?”</span> <span id="s216">“What -- What can I do?</span> <span id="s217">They were our enemies, the Jews, the Slavs, they had to be exterminated.”</span> <span id="s218">And, you know, it’s -- was something, a matter of -- of fact.</span> <span id="s219">This was what was supposed to happen to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: There was another question that someone in the Oral History Department wanted me to ask you about, that you mentioned about your hair being pulled --</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: -- out in Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, when we first came from the ghetto -- when we were taken t -- from the ghetto, it was around July in the ghetto and we had to line up.</span> <span id="s226">First we had to take off whatever we had, our clothes and everything and -- and just throw it in the piles.</span> <span id="s227">And I’ll never forget when I first came in, the piles of shoes and combs and toothbrushes and you name it, they had it there.</span> <span id="s228">And I kept saying to my mother, “What’s happening?”</span> <span id="s229">And she said, “I have no answer.”</span> <span id="s230">And then they told us to get undressed.</span> <span id="s231">The first one to get undressed was my mother.</span> <span id="s232">When I think of how many times she had to stand naked in front of those beasts.</span> <span id="s233">She was such a beautiful, religious woman, gorgeous woman and had to be just like this, before they even killed you.</span> <span id="s234">What -- the humiliation that -- having to see what they are doing to her children.</span> <span id="s235">So my mother and my sister and my mother, she had gold denture, they just simply yanked it out.</span> <span id="s236">And her whole face was full of blood.</span> <span id="s237">And they threw her a striped dress, the Kapo lady threw a dress and a pair of clogs and pushed her on the side.</span> <span id="s238">And then my sister and then me.</span> <span id="s239">And I had long, curly hair -- blonde, curly hair.</span> <span id="s240">And they used to call me Shirley Temple, because Shirley Temple had -- did I know who Shirley Temple?</span> <span id="s241">But they used to -- you know, [indecipherable] she looks like Shirley Temple, they used say.</span> <span id="s242">And the Gestapo lady, on one side, tore out my -- the long locks and the guy -- big, black boots who -- who it was the commandant, took out and he said, “Oh, this’ll do for my poopy, for my dolls -- daughter’s doll,” in German.</span> <span id="s243">And then they continued cutting it and that and my whole head was full of blood.</span> <span id="s244">Then, the next one had to get undressed, her name is Hava.</span> <span id="s245">And my sister -- my daughter is an artist and she has paintings going around, all over the country and she has a painting about this.</span> <span id="s246">S -- It’s about stories my mother told me and she depict this Hava so incredible.</span> <span id="s247">And when I went back to -- to Stutthof, Hava is always with me.</span> <span id="s248">I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s249">Hava got undressed, she was wearing a loose dress.</span> <span id="s250">And when she -- by the way, when my mother got undressed, my mother had sewn in, in her -- a pouch in my sister’s and mine, like little pouches.</span> <span id="s251">She didn’t even let us know she did that.</span> <span id="s252">She put it -- sewed it in, because she thought -- there was some rings, there was diamond rings, some watch, some jewelry and some rings and whatever she had, so she put it in, she cushioned it.</span> <span id="s253">When we took it out, it fell all over and we never got it.</span> <span id="s254">Hava took off her dress and a little baby fell out.</span> <span id="s255">The baby -- I -- a tiny, little baby, because gave such a little squeak and he picked up the baby and he threw it.</span> <span id="s256">And -- the commandant.</span> <span id="s257">And, so those are the memory when I went to Stutthof, Hava.</span> <span id="s258">So, anyways, whens -- we got into the bunk -- to the barrack, and my mother was on top and I was in the middle with Hava, my mother was on top with my sister Rachel.</span> <span id="s259">And Hava would rub my -- like this with her fist, my hand.</span> <span id="s260">And I would say to her, “What do you have in your fist?”</span> <span id="s261">And she never answered.</span> <span id="s262">And we would all say, “Hava, what do you have?</span> <span id="s263">What do you have?”</span> <span id="s264">She had a little baby’s shoes, when they took -- and because she wouldn’t give up the shoe, they took her out.</span> <span id="s265">We all had to stand outside and watch and they put a bullet through her head.</span> <span id="s266">So that’s Hava’s story.</span> <span id="s267">And I have to tell it, because there’s nobody else for her to talk.</span> <span id="s268">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s269">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: We’re moving now, to tape one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: This is tape one, side B, Judith Meisel, and we’re continuing to talk about -- you were mentioning your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, my b -- when they took us from the ghetto -- from the Kovno ghetto, they took us trucks and we went to Kinigsburg, I remember, cause I could remember seeing the name written there.</span> <span id="s274">And from there they took us to Stutthof concentration camp.</span> <span id="s275">And at Stutthof my brother was taken from us and we didn’t know where they were taking him.</span> <span id="s276">And we didn’t find out until 1947 that he was alive, and he was in Italy, that he was in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So, as far as Stutthof and how it affected your life and your relationships, do you still have dreams?</span> <span id="s278">I know you have thoughts constantly, but how often does this come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: How often do the thoughts come to me?</span> <span id="s280">I think about it all the time.</span> <span id="s281">I think about it, I mean -- I dream about it.</span> <span id="s282">When I can’t fall asleep, it comes back to me, and it’s like a mirage of -- of -- see people’s faces.</span> <span id="s283">I don’t remember a lot of their names, but I can see their faces, I was with.</span> <span id="s284">They’re constantly with me and when my first grandchild was born, I remember when I held him, I held him for all the children that didn’t survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: That must have been a beautiful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: It was just -- I felt like I was holding him for all of them who were my age, who didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s287">So, I’m constantly thinking that here I am, thank God I’m alive and so forth.</span> <span id="s288">People ask me constantly also, “Do you feel guilty that you survived?”</span> <span id="s289">I’m constantly asked that.</span> <span id="s290">I said, “No, I don’t have no guilt.”</span> <span id="s291">I feel I had mazel -- I had the luck that I survived and because I survived, I have a mission that I have to tell and wherever I’m invited, I go out and I speak as long as they pay my -- my fare or a hotel, I go out to speak.</span> <span id="s292">And I’ve gone to places like Lubec, Texas and -- and -- and Livington, New Mexico and places like that, you know.</span> <span id="s293">Because I feel the scary thing is that the deniers are out there.</span> <span id="s294">And I feel that I need to be out there to tell what happened, to see what racism and bigotry do if it’s allowed to flourish.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: I -- I have a question which relates to your and your sister’s decision to leave the nunnery.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: And that was the strength of your faith, of your Judaism.</span> <span id="s298">Did you have this kind of attachment to being Jewish before the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, we lived -- from the time I was born in a little shtetl, I guess, from what I remember, we had a real Jewish life.</span> <span id="s301">I mean, my mother was very, very religious and my father, too.</span> <span id="s302">N-Not as -- from what I hear from my brother and my sister -- I’m the youngest in the family -- that she was more than him.</span> <span id="s303">But we -- we knew we were Jewish first and til this day -- to this day, if you ask me, “Who are you?”</span> <span id="s304">I will say, “I’m Jewish American.”</span> <span id="s305">I will not say I’m American and I’m Jewish, because my Jewishness came before my American.</span> <span id="s306">And that, to me, is very important.</span> <span id="s307">And I think I’ve instilled that also in my children.</span> <span id="s308">And the most important thing to me is to have a Jewish life and to live a Jewish life -- an ethical Jewish life and to respect other religions, their differen -- to respect their differences and to -- to me this is most important thing.</span> <span id="s309">But I will certainly -- my Judaism meaned more than anything, was my life.</span> <span id="s310">But it wasn’t just me, I was the younger and my sister.</span> <span id="s311">My sister was like my sister and my mother and everything, and her -- from her strength.</span> <span id="s312">I did what she told me to do.</span> <span id="s313">Now, it’s a little different, she’s more -- a very sick husband, very sick and it’s more difficult, so I’m become the role -- the mother figure to her now.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: When you say ethical Jew -- how do you distinguish ethical and religious and how does this affect your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Well, to me, I have to respect -- I think my involvement in the Civil Rights movement -- I got involved really, not just as another human being feeling for another human being.</span> <span id="s316">I got involved because I let everybody know I’m Jewish.</span> <span id="s317">It’s a moral racism.</span> <span id="s318">If the African Americans are not having, or the Black community do not have the same rights as I, as a white person who is Jewish -- they don’t have the rights, I don’t have my right.</span> <span id="s319">My right is tampered.</span> <span id="s320">And, to me, this became my -- my big thing as far as -- morality is for each person -- how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s321">Each person derives themselves what is moral and what’s immoral.</span> <span id="s322">My arriving on immoral is that we cannot allow to happen again, what happened, to anyone, no matter who they are.</span> <span id="s323">Black, White, Yellow, anyone.</span> <span id="s324">And to me, that’s the morality for me.</span> <span id="s325">I don’t know if I’d --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Now, respectfully, I’m taking this back a -- a little bit -- a -- a long while, to liberation and the moment you realized you were free and those first few -- few days and how you and your sister responded.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Well, we heard the word, Achtung, Achtung, that “Germany capitulia” -- that the -- there -- the war was over.</span> <span id="s328">And we couldn’t believe her, my sister said, “We have to tell them we are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s329">And I started crying, and I said, “I’m afraid.</span> <span id="s330">What if they find -- what if it’s a hoax?”</span> <span id="s331">And -- Because we was in hiding still, you know, we -- nobody knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s332">And we went over to the Red Cross worker, the lady, and we told her we were Jewish and she stood up and she started to cry and then she pulled out a piece of paper and she said, “Can you prove that you are Jewish?”</span> <span id="s333">And we signed both our name in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s334">And she got up and gave us each -- it was a big, heavy -- big hug.</span> <span id="s335">And she said, “Do you know where you are?”</span> <span id="s336">And I say, “We know we are not in Germany.”</span> <span id="s337">And from then on, they took us right to den -- to Co-Copenhagen and they put us into a big gymnasium and the place was called Endrupskoola.</span> <span id="s338">It’s a big gym -- actually, the Germans had build this for them to -- as an athletic club -- was huge complex.</span> <span id="s339">And there were several thousand people there in the -- in the auditorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: So, they built it?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: The Germans, when they occupied Denmark, built it.</span> <span id="s342">And the most interesting thing was that I was walking -- I was -- my sister and I -- it was like the second day we were there and I heard a woman going around and saying, “Shalom.”</span> <span id="s343">And I said, “Aleichem Shalom.”</span> <span id="s344">And she gave me a hug because her mother had told her -- they had just come back from Sweden -- that she heard that they m -- to see if there were any Jews in the -- amongst the refugees.</span> <span id="s345">And Bella Katsinelson and she’d -- in fact, when I was just there recently, she reminded me and she brought me back -- brought me to her house --</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: You saw her recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s348">And -- But the interesting thing was that we couldn’t leave unless we had a Dane sign out for us to come out.</span> <span id="s349">And I -- when they told me that I -- we were free, I collapsed like a puppet and they -- was pu-put in immediately into a real chair.</span> <span id="s350">And I wor -- and when -- and they gave me a kerchief.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: They is the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: The Red Cross, they gave me a kerchief, cause they could see my hair was -- little bit of hair and wounds and so forth.</span> <span id="s353">And I never took that kerchief off.</span> <span id="s354">And then I remember the reporter asking me -- immediately the reporter descended on us, and they’re ask me, “Do you hate the Germans?”</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What language do they speak to you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: German.</span> <span id="s357">“Do you hate the Germans?”</span> <span id="s358">And I said, I remember [indecipherable] “I am -- I hate hate.”</span> <span id="s359">And -- Because hate stifles you, you can’t live with hate.</span> <span id="s360">I am outraged, I am full of rage that the world allowed this to happen, that this -- something like that happen.</span> <span id="s361">And the second one was “What would you like to eat?”</span> <span id="s362">And I said, “Bread, herring and potatoes and all the water I can drink.”</span> <span id="s363">And the next thing happened, they came in there -- Red Cross lady came and she said there was a family -- a lady -- a man and a lady who would like to take us out for the day, they would like to show us Copenhagen and buy you some clothes.</span> <span id="s364">And their name was Paula and Swen Yensen.</span> <span id="s365">Well, for us it was heaven.</span> <span id="s366">And they took us out, and they took us out every day and then she saw how sick I was, she immediately took me to a doctor and they put me to -- into Siloril sanitorium and I had TB.</span> <span id="s367">I had -- my lungs were collapsed, my stomach was shrun -- you name it, I had every possible -- and I was almost for two years, in a hospital.</span> <span id="s368">They nursed my back to health.</span> <span id="s369">I weighed 47 pounds, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s370">And they literally nursed me back to health.</span> <span id="s371">Strangers.</span> <span id="s372">I couldn’t even talk to them, because they didn’t speak -- but Paula and Swen Yensen, they didn’t speak German, they only spoke Danish.</span> <span id="s373">And I learned Danish very quick.</span> <span id="s374">And they kept on saying -- and we kept on asking, “Are there any Jews?”</span> <span id="s375">And they said, “Oh, they’re coming back from Sweden.”</span> <span id="s376">I said -- we kept saying, my sister and I, “How do you know they’re coming -- there are Jews coming back from Sweden?”</span> <span id="s377">And they told us what happen, how they took the Jews over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s378">And I’ll never forget when the first gathering -- the first gathering of people that came back from Sweden.</span> <span id="s379">And they took me and they put me in pa -- and they put me in -- in the wheelchair, my sister and I and they took us both to the harbor and I saw the arrival of this Jews from Sweden, the first arrival.</span> <span id="s380">And the first one, Rabbi Fritakker came off the boat and he made a special cheriyon, or a special blessing.</span> <span id="s381">He was the chief rabbi then.</span> <span id="s382">And I think that I f -- we kept saying, “The Jewish people survived.</span> <span id="s383">If they survived, maybe my brother survived.”</span> <span id="s384">And we began to look for my brother and then we found him in 19 -- he was -- wrote to us in 1947.</span> <span id="s385">We put a -- we made a big poster and we sent it.</span> <span id="s386">We found someone who also survi -- who also came to Denmark and they --</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: You and your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: -- in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s391">Her name was Rena Gortz and she had left a -- a child with a family -- a Polish family and she was looking for the child.</span> <span id="s392">But she knew she had a brother-in-law in -- in Palestine and he wrote to her, the brother-in-law, saying that her husband survived and he is in Italy.</span> <span id="s393">And we said, “Well, Regina, maybe we’ll -- we should write to your husband, maybe he know --” And sure enough, about a month later, my brother saw it on -- you know, he was like in a Displaced Person’s camp in Italy and he saw it -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: He saw what?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: The -- We made a poster.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: You had a picture of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No, no, we had no picture wi --</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Just his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Just his name and then he wrote immediately for us to come and by then, my sister had met her future husband, who was Danish.</span> <span id="s400">And I wanted to -- when he came -- then he eventually ended up in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Before we get to Canada, though, I -- you were going to tell me about one of the first things the Red Cross gave you when --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Oh, the first thing when we did, is they put us into showers.</span> <span id="s403">Before they took us to Copenhagen, they put us into showers, washed us and then they gave me the kerchief.</span> <span id="s404">And then they gave me -- the kerchief I don’t have -- they gave me a blanket.</span> <span id="s405">And that was my first piece of possession I had.</span> <span id="s406">And I wore that blanket all over, I wrapped myself around.</span> <span id="s407">And they gave me a dress and it was much too -- my stomach was big and I began to develop after awhile, so -- but everything else was just hanging, like flesh, you know, just skin.</span> <span id="s408">And -- And so, the blanket I have.</span> <span id="s409">When all the years -- in fact, I asked my sister, “What do you -- what did you do with your blanket?”</span> <span id="s410">She says, “Well, when I got -- could afford to buy a new one, I threw it out.”</span> <span id="s411">I said, “That’s the difference between you and me.</span> <span id="s412">I still have it and now the museum wants it.”</span> <span id="s413">So, I still have that blanket and I’ll probably give it to them, except that blanket -- every time my child was sick, I cuddled it.</span> <span id="s414">It was my security blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Even after you had children?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: You cuddled them in that blanket?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s419">That was my special blanket.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Why do you think -- what did that blanket represent to you?</span> <span id="s421">Or does it?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Freedom.</span> <span id="s423">Freedom, freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s425">So, getting out of Denmark -- you were there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Well, I got to Denmark -- well, I was there from March of -- you know, before the war was over -- from March of ‘45 and I went for -- it was August of 1949, to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And -- And so, how did you reunite with your brother, only after Canada, so -- if so, how did you make plans for -- for immigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, he -- he -- when h -- when he survived Dachau, he wanted -- first thing he was going to go, is to look for us, to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s429">But when he came to the border, they told them that if he gets in, he won’t be able to get out, it was the Russians.</span> <span id="s430">So, he went back and he went -- go to Palestine then, to -- to Israel.</span> <span id="s431">Well, there was the British blockade, he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s432">So -- and they were taking people to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s433">So he remained in Italy and a woman -- it was very hard to get in the United States or Canada.</span> <span id="s434">There were quotas and so forth.</span> <span id="s435">So him and 22 others, a woman who literally mortgaged her house -- her name was Mrs. Sadoff, and brought the 22 young guys to Toronto, to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Was she Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: No, no, she was Jewish and she -- a lot of people did --</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Russian?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No.</span> <span id="s440">Born -- I think she was -- maybe came very, very young, as a child, to -- I think from Lithuania to Canada.</span> <span id="s441">But she was very involved with the refugees and so forth.</span> <span id="s442">She passed away since then.</span> <span id="s443">And he came on a quota to Toronto.</span> <span id="s444">And as s-soon as he came, he -- well, we were corresponding constantly and -- and that -- he -- I wanted to go to him.</span> <span id="s445">I wanted to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s446">By then my sister was married and had already a child, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Where were you living?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Where were you living?</span> <span id="s450">You?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Me, I had -- I was living by myself.</span> <span id="s452">I was live -- first we lived with a family, with the Frankel family and then, after my sister got married, I got a little -- tiny little hole in the ground, just for myself and I lived there and I -- I became a nanny and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s453">And my school was so disrupted that I began to -- I used to take courses and I spoke Danish fluently.</span> <span id="s454">People couldn’t understand -- I learned it so good because I wanted to communicate with the people.</span> <span id="s455">I just loved them, they -- to me, the Danish people are a holy people.</span> <span id="s456">They are so incredible.</span> <span id="s457">I’m -- they’re so incredible what they did, I mean, it just -- it’s as like -- it’s just unbelievable, like Paula Yensen, and this is -- this was happening all over Denmark, that when the Jews were taken over to Sweden, they have -- their friends had a factory and her husbands was taking care of the factory.</span> <span id="s458">When they came back, all the money that was made over the -- the two and a half years that they were in Sweden, were given to them.</span> <span id="s459">I mean, homes were painted -- their homes were painting -- flowers in their homes, everything -- I mean, it’s just -- and the fact that they risked their lives, you know, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: When you wrote back and forth from Denmark to Italy, what -- the -- can you remember the moment when you discovered that -- that your brother was alive?</span> <span id="s461">When you got the first --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Yeah, I have a postcard he sent.</span> <span id="s463">He sent a high holiday postcard, I’ll never forget, with a picture.</span> <span id="s464">They used to do the -- the picture would come in, you know, like heart and inside put a picture, that was the mode.</span> <span id="s465">And my -- my brother -- we could not -- I mean, we could not believe.</span> <span id="s466">We were horrified of telling h-him what happened to my mother.</span> <span id="s467">We just kept saying -- and we couldn’t just get the words to say that was taken in the gas chamber and I saw it.</span> <span id="s468">Many things -- my brother and my sister don’t want to talk about anything that happened.</span> <span id="s469">They can’t understand that I can go around speaking about it.</span> <span id="s470">I mean, they are proud of me that I am doing it, but they can’t.</span> <span id="s471">It was more things of how we can get together and -- and -- and be together.</span> <span id="s472">My sister already by then was anchored down in Denmark, so I left for Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Just a moment now.</span> <span id="s474">Did you -- How did you tell him that your mother was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: We didn’t until not too long ago.</span> <span id="s476">When they did --</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: But he knew she had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s479">Not how.</span> <span id="s480">Not how.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: So, I’m sorry -- what -- so, you were writing -- yo-you received a postcard from him.</span> <span id="s482">Your sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: We were writing mostly is not what -- what happened and the horror and so forth.</span> <span id="s484">We were more really writing of how we can be together and start as a family, be [indecipherable] him and me and my sister, whether -- wherever it would be that we would be together.</span> <span id="s485">And if he had gotten to Palestine, I would have been in -- in Israel today.</span> <span id="s486">In fact, it was very interesting, when I first met Martin Luther King, one evening at dinner and he asked me, “Why did you come to the United States?”</span> <span id="s487">And I said, “Well, I didn’t, I came to Canada and I came because of my brother.”</span> <span id="s488">If my brother was able to have come -- Canada was the furthest from him to come.</span> <span id="s489">The first one was to got to -- to Israel, to Palestine, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s490">It was the British blockade.</span> <span id="s491">I probably would have been in Israel today, cause I came just to be with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: So, did he help arrange a visa for you --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: -- or did the Danish help?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s496">I had to do everything myself.</span> <span id="s497">I had to -- one of the things that I had to do is I had to pay for the -- and I didn’t have money.</span> <span id="s498">So I had -- a gi -- friend helped me with some money -- Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s499">Paula was very upset, because sh -- that I told her I was leaving, she couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s500">She -- Paula Yensen, because they wanted really -- their dream was to adopt both of us, they had no children.</span> <span id="s501">They were Lutheran family, they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s502">And -- And so they -- oh, so hard to think no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Do you want to take a little break?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: So, how you got -- how you planned to get to Canada and the goodbyes you had to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm.</span> <span id="s507">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s508">Well, as soon as my -- I -- as soon as I found out my brother came to Toronto, to Canada, he had no money to help me to come.</span> <span id="s509">The -- There was no place that I could go.</span> <span id="s510">There was really, in Denmark, not even a HIAS that could help me.</span> <span id="s511">You know, HIAS was who -- was an organization that helped refugees, you know, go places.</span> <span id="s512">And there was the visa, how do you -- you get?</span> <span id="s513">Before that, you have to go to a doctor and thank God that in Denmark is socialized medicine so you have to see that you don’t have syphilis and th-that.</span> <span id="s514">And me having had TB was -- became a problem, but I was already clear out of that and they gave me a clear bill of health to come into this country.</span> <span id="s515">And so, I worked.</span> <span id="s516">The people who I took care of, the kids I babysat, I did all kinds of things in Denmark to earn some money to come.</span> <span id="s517">And one summer, I pick strawberries.</span> <span id="s518">That’s why when I go by now and I go on the way to San Francisco, I go on Salenas and so on, I see them picking that and I said, “Oh boy.”</span> <span id="s519">No matter how expensive we pay for strawberries, we get it so cheap, because it’s very hard work.</span> <span id="s520">You know, you empathize with what we get so cheap, the vegetables and how little they get paid, the migrant workers.</span> <span id="s521">Really, I always bring these things back, constantly to me.</span> <span id="s522">And so, when I finally had enough money, then there were everybody saying goodbye and Paula and Swen Yensen, they were -- they were just horrified that I would leave them.</span> <span id="s523">They were -- I was their little pia, their little child.</span> <span id="s524">And -- And I sailed -- I went through -- on train and I took and I was -- went to -- through -- going to Bremerhaven, where I sailed from.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: With a visa?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: With a visa.</span> <span id="s527">But I had to go through the -- the zone and I was taken, you know, here I am on the train and after all that, I’m going to Germany.</span> <span id="s528">I remembered -- I’ll never forget that -- with the visa and then there is the eastern zone and the western zone and you get on and you have to constantly show your visa [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s529">And lo and behold, as I’m doing that, for some reason, they take me off the -- the train.</span> <span id="s530">And I was going through Paris first, because a woman by the name Mrs. Wagner, Madame Wagner, she was -- she knew me from Denmark and she was going to pick me up in France.</span> <span id="s531">And here, I can’t -- I can’t -- I’m -- I’m taken over in Bremerhaven, and -- because it was stamped for there, but I was supposed to leave from LeHavre -- from France, going to Quebec.</span> <span id="s532">And for some reason -- I mean, I didn’t -- you know, it was stamped and they were -- they were not, but I gave them such a hard time.</span> <span id="s533">I was crying and I was like this.</span> <span id="s534">I mean, it was just so upsetting and I couldn’t talk to them and I didn’t want to talk German and being in Germany, I just hated, you know, the fact, you know, that I have to [indecipherable] what is happening, that kind.</span> <span id="s535">And so finally they stamped it and the next day they put me on the train and she picked me up and I was a wreck.</span> <span id="s536">I get on the train -- I get on the boat, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: At LeHavre.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: At LeHavre and I’m sailing for Quebec.</span> <span id="s539">And the whole boat -- it was called the Scertia, was owned by Conrad Whitestar or something -- and the whole boat, there are German uniforms and -- I mean, I’m not going up where the -- all the regular passenger are, this was steerage, you know.</span> <span id="s540">And all of a sudden, I hear there are about -- they’re all guys and they’re speaking Danish.</span> <span id="s541">And I went over to them, and I said “Adudansk,” I mean, I started talking to them Danish, and I became -- they -- they protected me.</span> <span id="s542">All the trip, they were taking care of me.</span> <span id="s543">They were just incredible.</span> <span id="s544">They were so wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s545">They were going on a special thing in -- up in Canada somewhere, doing agricultural -- you know, Denmark’s very a-agricultural.</span> <span id="s546">They had some kind of a thing going there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: This is tape two, side A, with an interview with Judith Meisel, conducted by Ginger Miles on January 20th, 1999 for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: So anyway, so then we finally -- when we arrived at Quebec, I was -- and then wa -- oh, so when -- part of that I -- si -- they told me they -- they were not in steerage, they were, you know, in the regular passengers.</span> <span id="s550">And they got me up and they said, “Oh, if you’re Jewish, there’s a whole group, there’s about three guys who are Jewish and they are on the boat.”</span> <span id="s551">So, that was even better for me, you know, and I started talking.</span> <span id="s552">That’s how I met my ex-husband, aboard ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: And which language were you speaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: The -- I was speaking to them, I was speaking Danish and to the three guys, a little bit of Yiddish they knew, very little Yiddish, but we communicated.</span> <span id="s555">The Danes spoked English, so they could translate.</span> <span id="s556">They were my translators.</span> <span id="s557">And I met my ex and I came to Canada, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: To -- Before you get to Canada, did you have a little courtship on the boat, or how long did it take?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yeah, yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: The boat -- The boat was almost -- over 10 days, I think was, you know, not that fast those years, the boats going.</span> <span id="s562">But they --</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Gabe Cohen.</span> <span id="s565">And yeah -- and he said, he -- he almost pr -- he proposed almost right there and then to me.</span> <span id="s566">He was coming back.</span> <span id="s567">He was -- during the war, went to Israel to fight -- really illegally to go to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: He was American?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: No, he was Canadian.</span> <span id="s570">And he could not get -- but he’s lived all his life in United States, but he didn’t know that his father was born in Ottawa.</span> <span id="s571">And his mother was born in New York, but they lived in New York all this time, in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s572">And he -- he could not come back in it -- to United States directly, he had to come back through Canada.</span> <span id="s573">So, I -- he had family Montreal and he took me off the boat and we went to visit his family in Montreal.</span> <span id="s574">And my brother comes to pick me up and here I’m gone with some guy that he doesn’t -- and he hadn’t seen me, so it was -- it was kind of difficult and finally I came to Toronto and I stayed in Toronto.</span> <span id="s575">We got married in Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: So, how -- you -- you arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: We arrived in July and I think it was the 22nd of -- of August, in -- in Quebec.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: This was in 1940 --</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: -- nine.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: ‘49.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: You arrived in Quebec and was your fa -- brother waiting for you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No, my brother -- yeah, my brother was waiting, but I didn’t know, was miscommunication.</span> <span id="s584">So anyways, we got -- and he went back to Toronto and then I came there like two days later, to Toronto.</span> <span id="s585">And I remember going out on the -- on the -- putting me on, on the train and I had to go by train from Quebec to Toronto and I couldn’t speak to anybody.</span> <span id="s586">I was completely -- until I finally fell in the arms of my brother, you know?</span> <span id="s587">And from there on -- we had tiny, little room, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Did Gabe go with you on this --</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: No, no, he couldn’t, becau -- no, he tried to get back to United States, he had a hard time, because he was -- he went illegally to fight during this -- the war of liberation and with Israel, you know and so --</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So, you were with him for two days, and [indecipherable] --</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: I always say I -- I knew him four days before we -- we got married, all told -- saw each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: And we have three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: -- when did you marry?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: We married 1950.</span> <span id="s596">January first, 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So, after your fo --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: From July, na -- I -- I didn’t see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: After your four days, you went to your brother and he went to the US?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Who, my brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: No, Gabe.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yeah, he went to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So tell me about being with your brother and seeing him for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: Well, for the first time, was really, you know, we -- we really rarely talked about what happened to us.</span> <span id="s605">We just wanted to know what’s going to happen, what’s going to be our future, what are we going to do, how are we going to live.</span> <span id="s606">And -- And it took awhile til we began.</span> <span id="s607">I mean, we didn’t dwell on the horrible things that happened to us.</span> <span id="s608">It was more about the now.</span> <span id="s609">What are we going to do now and so forth.</span> <span id="s610">Then, I got married and my brother moved in with me and lived with me for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: You got married in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: In Canada.</span> <span id="s613">In Toronto.</span> <span id="s614">And then, after we got married, it was very difficult to get me back into United States, because there was a McCowen Act Law.</span> <span id="s615">There was a immigration that you had the quota for so many people they would let in.</span> <span id="s616">And I -- I arrived and we got married in Janu -- Jan or Fe -- New Year’s Day, we got married.</span> <span id="s617">And I arrived, I think to --</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: 1950, and I arrived in nine -- let me see.</span> <span id="s620">I arrived in May of 1950, I arrived to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Married?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s623">By train, cause plane were too expensive.</span> <span id="s624">Trains were cheaper then.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: You didn’t need a passport to get there, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: To United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: So what kind of a citizen were you considered?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: I was an alien.</span> <span id="s631">An alien citizen.</span> <span id="s632">I wa -- had no country.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Stateless?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Stateless.</span> <span id="s635">So I had to get a -- and -- and I married -- I married a Canadian, so that was even a double whammy.</span> <span id="s636">But his parents vouched for me.</span> <span id="s637">They had to put certain amount of money in the bank, they had to show that bank account -- I still have those documents -- and all that, to bring me into United States, to vouch for me.</span> <span id="s638">And then, after he -- he wa -- he had one more year to finish college and after that, he -- he got an offer -- he is Jewish educator -- he had an offer to come to Toronto to work for Talmuttor, which is a Jewish day school, and we went back to Toronto and then my -- then my sister came to visit.</span> <span id="s639">But my brother got -- then my brother started courting his wife Simmy and he got married and my sister came.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: In Toronto?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: In Toronto.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: So, your brother moved with you and your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, my brother stayed in Toronto when I moved back, but when I moved back, after I got married, he moved in with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s645">Can I just go back a little bit, to your first weeks and months of marriage.</span> <span id="s646">Did you and your husband talk about the Holocaust at all, with each other?</span> <span id="s647">A: Me and my husband?</span> <span id="s648">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s650">I think there was a special thing that he knew, you know -- I had a lot of fears.</span> <span id="s651">I’ll never forget our honeymoon, I locked myself in the bathroom and wouldn’t come out, cause I was so scared of every little thing.</span> <span id="s652">Every new thing was the -- just a scary thing for me.</span> <span id="s653">But the most important thing is that I had lots of fears.</span> <span id="s654">I always looked for an exit and to this day I still do that, where all the exits are, when I go into a movie or anything.</span> <span id="s655">And I -- I -- I still have the same fears.</span> <span id="s656">I could never put like -- my field is early childhood education and I started two preschools.</span> <span id="s657">One here and one in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s658">And when you put the -- you don’t -- they don’t do it now as much, but we used to [indecipherable] put like a child’s name and put it around the neck so if we shouldn’t lose them.</span> <span id="s659">I could never do that, because that’s when people went for the firing squads.</span> <span id="s660">Things like that and a lot of nightmares and so forth.</span> <span id="s661">He had lot of -- share of problems that -- but our marriage didn’t broke because of that, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: It wasn’t that?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Where was he during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: He was in United States and he went -- in 1947, he went on to fight for state of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So, he had very strong --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: -- was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Comes from a very religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Very Jewish, Zionist family.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Were you involved with Zionism at all, yourself?</span> <span id="s673">A: No, I really didn’t know.</span> <span id="s674">I di -- I didn’t know if my parents were Zionists or something.</span> <span id="s675">I know one thing, that my parents -- in my parents home, we had very modest home in a little town and I can remember that we used to have little bags of earth and -- it was -- came from Palestine, came from Israel, from the Holy Land, so the f-for when a person is buried, the first shovel of that you brang from the Holy Land to put in the grave and every year there would come around a emissary from -- from Israel -- from Palestine then, and would sell this.</span> <span id="s676">And we would have that and ou -- oh, you know, so there was connection with Israel, with -- with the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s677">We had the JNF box, the -- that -- that -- over there, there is a li -- where you give for tadocker, you put in money and it goes for Israel, you know.</span> <span id="s678">We always have that, we cose -- call it the pushka.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: This is back in America now?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: No, that’s back in the shtetl, we always had pushkas for this, to -- for charity, to give.</span> <span id="s681">But there was all ones -- always for the -- Palestine, for the state of Israel.</span> <span id="s682">So, those are the kind of links, whether they were active Zionism and so forth, they didn’t -- they lived, they didn’t leave to go to Palestines.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Since we’re on the subject of -- of Israel, I -- I think it would be interesting to ask this question and that is -- do you think that the founding of Israel has a meaning for Holocaust survivors in general?</span> <span id="s684">A: Oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s685">I feel, if there was a state of Israel, maybe this would not have happened.</span> <span id="s686">I think that the fact is that Israel to me, is the most important thing.</span> <span id="s687">That it is the protection for people and the in-gathering of the exiles that we were -- we had -- we -- we did not have a homeland.</span> <span id="s688">And I feel there was no one talking up for us.</span> <span id="s689">The rest of the world really didn’t care.</span> <span id="s690">They knew it was there, but they didn’t do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Including Jews in the rest of the world?</span> <span id="s692">A: Oh, I -- including the Jews in United States.</span> <span id="s693">I think that they were so i-isolated and so insulated and not only that, but there was fear here.</span> <span id="s694">The Jews had fear here, because there was a Father Coglin who was on the radio constantly, telling [indecipherable] and was very anti-Semitic in -- in the 30’s and -- and in the 40’s.</span> <span id="s695">There was a Nazi party and the fact that United States went into the war ver -- th -- I owe my life to them, that they liberated me, if it wouldn’t be for United States, but at the same time, they went in so late.</span> <span id="s696">And so, to me, Israel is s-s-stands there and -- and we must make Israel a strong nation.</span> <span id="s697">I don’t like some of the politics what’s going on in Israel today.</span> <span id="s698">That bothers me, because that’s not the kind of state I would like to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: What about it bothers you?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Well, it bothers me that the equality is not there, that the --</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Between?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Between the religious and the non-religious.</span> <span id="s703">The fact that they, because I am not a ultra Orthodox Jew, I am not considered Jewish to a lot of them.</span> <span id="s704">And that the state -- the state has to be separation of religion and th-the poli -- you know, I think the politics in itself.</span> <span id="s705">And I think that, to me, peace is a long way off there.</span> <span id="s706">I try to go there about every two years, lately, to live there for about a month or two months.</span> <span id="s707">Basically, the people want peace on both sides.</span> <span id="s708">But on both sides, there are hatred.</span> <span id="s709">And the Arabs have such hatred for the Jews.</span> <span id="s710">I mean, there used to be before it was all about Israel, now they’re saying Jews, they’re hating Jews.</span> <span id="s711">And -- And it’s a very difficult thing when I -- I -- I have examples where I went to visit a very dear friend who lives there.</span> <span id="s712">American family, went there very early and they’ve lived there for a long time.</span> <span id="s713">Their kids grew up with the children whe -- in that little town where the interfadder started.</span> <span id="s714">And when the interfadder started, stones started flying through their window.</span> <span id="s715">And this is the kind of thing.</span> <span id="s716">Now, do you give up that peace and -- and let it happen to you, with -- stones kill.</span> <span id="s717">It’s a very, very difficult situation there, but nevertheless, I feel that, as a Jew, I’m very proud of Israel, what they have done.</span> <span id="s718">And I hope that there will be peace in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s719">There’ll be peace in Jerusalem, I’ve always felt, will be peace in the world.</span> <span id="s720">Cause it takes in so many religions and so many, it just everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: I find it so interesting that your family, even before the Holocaust, even before any awareness that there may be a Holocaust, was contributing to Israel.</span> <span id="s722">Can you tell me about that?</span> <span id="s723">Was that common?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Oh, it’s very common.</span> <span id="s725">It’s -- I mean, th-that part of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: How did the word get around in Jewish communities?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Well, because Palestine was our life.</span> <span id="s728">I mean, this was our -- this was in -- it’s in -- in our -- part of our Torah, it’s part in the -- we -- we -- we pray.</span> <span id="s729">We pray to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s730">It’s in our prayer book.</span> <span id="s731">If I forget the -- Jerusalem, let my right hand be cunning, you know.</span> <span id="s732">It -- It was always there and we were always taught.</span> <span id="s733">And Hebrew was the language and -- but it was part and parcel of all of us.</span> <span id="s734">And it was the yearning of every Jew in the shtetls, in -- especially w-where I lived, in eastern Europe, in Lithuania, that someday we will go to -- I mean, we -- we have it in the seder, you know, when -- Passover, everything, that -- to be in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s735">Next year in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s736">It is -- and if you say how old the Bible is and how old is the prayer books, that’s how old it is for the state of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: It wasn’t until the political state of Israel, but the state of Israel was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Now, what I -- we’re -- we’re just about to -- to get you some children.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Some children.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: From the first marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s743">I only have from the first marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: So, could you say now -- you were living now in Toronto and Abe is working and you are working, too, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: No, I was -- at that time, I was just my ha -- my ex was working, I was just a housewife, keeping the [indecipherable] my daughter was born in ‘51, so we had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: And his job was?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: He was?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: He was educational director at the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s754">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: My daughter was born in Toronto.</span> <span id="s757">And then, my sist --</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Her name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Mina.</span> <span id="s760">M -- named after my mother, and when my brother got married, my sister came with her son, Oscar and he was -- at that time, he was three years old.</span> <span id="s761">And, the -- then she decided she would stay and get a working permit, which she had, temporary, and she could work --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Away from Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Away from Denmark.</span> <span id="s764">Her husband stayed on in Denmark and to see if she likes it and if she does, they would move here, to us, cause I kept only wanting her to move.</span> <span id="s765">I mean, I just didn’t want her being so far away.</span> <span id="s766">And -- but it was very difficult because we didn’t have the money to bring her over and -- and everything else, so is -- she stayed for almost a year.</span> <span id="s767">I watched her little boy and my little -- my baby -- and Mina and she went to work and she’s a seamstress and -- and collect these -- she used to come home with those little tickets, you know, how many buttons and how many that and we would sit there and figure it out by the pennies, you know?</span> <span id="s768">This was years ago.</span> <span id="s769">And I’m -- this was in 1950 -- 50 -- wait a minute, that was in 19 fif -- beginning of ‘51.</span> <span id="s770">No, what am I talking, n -- they are married December second of ‘51, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Do you remember how it felt when you -- when you -- did you no --</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: He married a Canadian girl.</span> <span id="s773">Jewish Canadian.</span> <span id="s774">My brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Oh, your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: I -- I was thinking of Mina, your -- your first child, named after your mother, did -- the moment when you knew you were pregnant, did you have any thoughts that went back to your experience there, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Well, I’ve always felt that that -- always worried about what kind of world I’m bringing in.</span> <span id="s779">After all, I -- I used to pinch myself all the time that here I am in Canada.</span> <span id="s780">It’s like United States.</span> <span id="s781">I can go into any store, if I have the money to buy whatever I want.</span> <span id="s782">I’m -- don’t have to be hungry.</span> <span id="s783">I can, you know, do anything I want to.</span> <span id="s784">I -- I can be proud.</span> <span id="s785">And the most important thing is -- was -- always is that I didn’t have to look over my back if I’m lighting the Sabbath candles or if I’m doing anything Jewish, this was wide open.</span> <span id="s786">And that was the biggest satisfaction in living here tuvusta.</span> <span id="s787">And I had a very difficult pregnancy -- very di-difficult.</span> <span id="s788">I -- This was years ago, I too -- I found a Danish doctor who I could speak Danish to and he was wonderful.</span> <span id="s789">And I had almost like three days of very hard labor.</span> <span id="s790">And finally, when she was born, I’ll never forget when I went back -- Dr. Williamson, I went back to him and he said, “Well.”</span> <span id="s791">And I ask him, “When can I have another child?”</span> <span id="s792">And he looked at me, he says, “[indecipherable],” he said, “Boy, you women, you -- do you remember how difficult?”</span> <span id="s793">But then I had -- I had a -- a miscar -- I had a stillborn child after that.</span> <span id="s794">That was very difficult to take, because those years, they couldn’t do anything, said it has to take it’s natural causes and I was sick.</span> <span id="s795">And then after that, my son Michael arrived.</span> <span id="s796">And was not easy, but was fine.</span> <span id="s797">And then Debbie.</span> <span id="s798">And they were three years apart and I just wanted to have a family, I -- not a lot of children, but I wanted to have more and more and then the third, you know, it wasn’t really like we planned it.</span> <span id="s799">We didn’t plan it, whatever happened.</span> <span id="s800">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: Are they -- the other second two named after any other relatives?</span> <span id="s802">A: Yeah, they’re all named after relatives and they’re all named Hebrew names and they’re all called by Hebrew names.</span> <span id="s803">I never liked to give them a Hebrew name or a Jewish name and then call them a Danish -- a Danish or a -- my sister is different -- or a, you know, an American name.</span> <span id="s804">I figure that’s the name I gave them at birth --</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: So the second -- the boy --</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Michael, but the Hebrew name is Meechiel, which is Michael and Raphael is this -- his second name, the two angels.</span> <span id="s807">And my -- I remember asking my in-laws if they wanted to -- after all, the first one I named after my mother, was only that I should ask my in-laws if -- who were very religious, now it’s your turn to name, you know?</span> <span id="s808">And they said no, they don’t want to name after anyone.</span> <span id="s809">Was very interesting, because my father-in-law’s name was Jacob and my mother-in-law’s name was Jacob.</span> <span id="s810">See my -- her father was named Jacob.</span> <span id="s811">And if the two are the same, they usually have -- the namesake is usually carried after, you know, from the person passes away, you give the namesake, but you can’t give the namesake if the father is the same name.</span> <span id="s812">So, they had a lot of difficulty when she was getting married and she told me that.</span> <span id="s813">I never heard of it before, but she was very adamant that I should name a name that I liked, that the child will like when he’s -- you know, and will able to carry that name proudly.</span> <span id="s814">So that -- and when Deborah came along, was -- I had a sister-in-law who was shot down.</span> <span id="s815">Their plane was shot down over Bulgaria.</span> <span id="s816">She was going to -- back to Israel, she was from Israel and her name was Debore-ore and so I named Debbie after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: And Michael is named after?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Michael is named after my -- we picked out -- we didn’t name him after anyone.</span> <span id="s819">Meechiel Raphael, the angels.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Did your children learn about your and your -- your experiences in the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s821">Did you have a way to share it, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: My children knew that I was a survivor, but a survivor of what and how and when and what was happening, they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s823">They -- I never sat them down and told them that, you know, I’m a survivor and that they would ask me such questions, “Where is your m -- what happened to your mother?”</span> <span id="s824">And I would say she died.</span> <span id="s825">And, “How did -- oh, wh-where did she die?”</span> <span id="s826">And I said, “Well, in foul way.”</span> <span id="s827">And I didn’t even mention Stutthof, I would say foul way.</span> <span id="s828">I tried to shield them as much as possible that I could.</span> <span id="s829">I worked at the children’s camp in -- and -- called Camp Rama.</span> <span id="s830">It’s a Hebrew speaking camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: This was in -- this particular incident was in the Poconos, but I worked -- they have several camps all over the country.</span> <span id="s833">And they would have me speak -- it’s called, Tishubov, it’s when the -- the temple -- the second temple, when it was destroyed and it’s a holiday.</span> <span id="s834">It’s a mourning holiday and they’ve made it in -- really made it into memoral -- memorialized the Holocaust, Tishubov.</span> <span id="s835">And they would have me speak to the older campers and my daughter was there and I remember speaking to them and not trying them to -- traumatize them with real horrors, but [inaudible].</span> <span id="s836">And my daughter came over, she says, “Mom, I don’t believe, it’s a lie.”</span> <span id="s837">She just didn’t believe me, she says, “You never told me.”</span> <span id="s838">And she was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s839">And from then on, many things.</span> <span id="s840">They knew that I had no relatives.</span> <span id="s841">They knew that I would say certain things to them.</span> <span id="s842">In my house, you’re not allowed to fight, you know.</span> <span id="s843">I’ve had enough fighting.</span> <span id="s844">And -- But I would come out with words like that, or that would say, “We do not throw out food.</span> <span id="s845">Food is sacred.</span> <span id="s846">If you don’t eat this today, you’re going to eat it tomorrow.”</span> <span id="s847">And I would, I would make them eat it tomorrow.</span> <span id="s848">If they were hung -- they say, “Well, we’re hungry.”</span> <span id="s849">I said, “Well, there’s food you left yesterday, eat it.”</span> <span id="s850">That’s the thing I would do.</span> <span id="s851">They told me that.</span> <span id="s852">They still tell me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: You were learning English as well, during this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Yeah, well, with my oldest daughter I spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s855">And it’s -- was very interesting, she went to Israel for her junior year at the Hebrew university and she wrote, “Guess what?</span> <span id="s856">I’m in advanced class of college Yiddish,” because she knew Yiddish.</span> <span id="s857">She knew Yiddish before she knew English.</span> <span id="s858">And -- But I learned English, I went to night school and I learned, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: In Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s861">And I had to communicate with my ex, because he doesn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s862">He was -- he -- his parents were born here.</span> <span id="s863">My -- His mother was born in New York and his father in Ottawa.</span> <span id="s864">And his grandparents were very young when they came over, so there was no Yiddish spoken in their house.</span> <span id="s865">So, there was an older woman, I would go and she would translate the English letters for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: And she would s -- at the end, she would say, “He loves you, he loves you, he’s going to marry you,” at the end.</span> <span id="s868">And -- So she -- yeah, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: He was writing you from where?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: From -- From New York to Toronto.</span> <span id="s871">And I would write him in Yiddish and he would go to another old lady who would translate it to him in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s872">And -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: So you had to be careful with this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: -- I had to really work hard on my -- and I would refuse people to talk to me -- then my Danes, I had -- was a whole group of Danes in Toronto that I got to know and I would stay away from them, because I didn’t want to speak Danish, so was really -- but I learned pretty fast.</span> <span id="s875">For some reason, languages I pick up, yeah.</span> <span id="s876">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: I can say you do.</span> <span id="s878">How many do you speak now?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Oh, I don’t -- I used to speak a lot more.</span> <span id="s880">I mean, I -- Yiddish I speak fluently, I would say.</span> <span id="s881">And English -- I mean, I don’t -- Hebrew I understand some and I, you know, I read Hebrew.</span> <span id="s882">Danish, interesting enough, when I went to Denmark, I -- after I was there for a day and a half I spoke it, but before that, I can understand.</span> <span id="s883">So, when I come to somebody here in den -- fra -- whose Danish, I tell them, “Speak to me in Danish and I’ll answer you in English.”</span> <span id="s884">It’s hard, a language if you don’t speak.</span> <span id="s885">You forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: I’m going to turn this over to the other side -- other tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: This is tape two, side B, Judith Meisel and we are talking -- I -- I’ll hold that -- about your film.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: My film.</span> <span id="s891">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Could you tell us what -- what you mean by your film?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: In -- In 1998, in June, three students at University of Soderon, California Graduate School -- film school -- took me back to Lithuania, to my little town, to the Kovno ghetto, where I was, to Stutthof concentration camp and to Denmark, where I escaped from the Death March.</span> <span id="s894">And we completely -- did a complete walk through of wherever I was and the film played here, a -- or -- it opened up for -- in ‘98, of September, oh, Labor Day weekend.</span> <span id="s895">And within a week, it was sold out, 686 seats were completely sold out and they had a fundraiser for Beyond Tolerance Center.</span> <span id="s896">It’s been my dream to start a Beyond Tolerance.</span> <span id="s897">We were going to call it Tolerance Center, but tolerance, it means so much, it’s just an ambiguous, you know, thing.</span> <span id="s898">So we calling it Beyond Tolerance.</span> <span id="s899">And, because I’ve always felt -- because I go out and speak into schools all the time and wherever I go, that children need to be taught tolerance, from the very young age, especially in the schools.</span> <span id="s900">And the schools don’t have the money, so we got a whole group of people together here and who are funding it and it’s part of the county school system.</span> <span id="s901">So we have a one -- one is diversity, which is -- Scorbell Museum has a very good thing, it’s called a diversity -- teaching for younger children.</span> <span id="s902">Facing History and Thyself is going to be part of it, that schools --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: History and Thyself, which is an incredible thing, they teach all histories.</span> <span id="s905">And one is called Living Voices and it has about -- a com -- they do a composite of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s906">I was the edu -- it came out of me, when I was the education chairman for the Anne Frank in the World exhibits, which we brought here in ‘97.</span> <span id="s907">And it was here for a month and a half and I want to tell you, was the best thing Santa Barbara ever had.</span> <span id="s908">And we brought 10,000 students.</span> <span id="s909">I worked a year and a half on it, really got to know the school system and we brought that to Santa Barbara.</span> <span id="s910">We brought 36 th-thousand students downtown in -- where the exhibit were.</span> <span id="s911">We had a whole month of all kinds of things going in -- of teaching what racism and bigotry does.</span> <span id="s912">We had an incredible, credible program.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Focused strictly on Jewish life?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: It’s -- no, it was a tea -- well, it was -- it went with the Anne Frank in the World exhibit.</span> <span id="s915">We included all faith communities.</span> <span id="s916">We included the Chumus Indian, which we have a popul -- a sizable population.</span> <span id="s917">We found out that when we did that, that there were two Chumus Indians and they didn’t talk to each other.</span> <span id="s918">Doing this, they began to talk to each other.</span> <span id="s919">So we did that.</span> <span id="s920">And we -- the African American community had their own programs.</span> <span id="s921">We had programs -- completely diverse programs, but all teaching to tolerance.</span> <span id="s922">How to do away with hatred and bigotry.</span> <span id="s923">And it was a wonderful -- and my daughter has paintings that she painted for the 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s924">It’s been going around all over the country.</span> <span id="s925">My daughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: 50th anniversary?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: Of liberation.</span> <span id="s928">My -- She’s my oldest, Mina, she lives in -- she’s an artist, she lives in Mendocino, California.</span> <span id="s929">And it’s opening this -- opening in -- on February seventh, on my seven oh birthday.</span> <span id="s930">It’s opening up and I’m so happy my children are coming in, because it’s my birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: Where is it opening?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: And it’s opening at Abington Friends, in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s933">And from there, it’s going to go to the Sidwell School.</span> <span id="s934">Is it Sidewell or Sidwell School in Washington, DC.</span> <span id="s935">And it’s going to be there, opening.</span> <span id="s936">It’s also Quaker school.</span> <span id="s937">Supposed to be a real wonderful Quaker school.</span> <span id="s938">That’s where Chelsea Clinton wanted to go.</span> <span id="s939">And then -- so I been going and I go out speaking wherever I’m invited, I speak about -- but my field is early childhood education.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: That’s what I wanted to ask you now --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: -- when you got your children and your education and your career goals, how did that unfold?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Well, when we moved to ch -- to Rochester, New York, I still didn’t -- I was rather not well, I had a stillborn child, was a -- was -- and I was very -- not too well.</span> <span id="s944">So, I didn’t worked.</span> <span id="s945">When we moved to Wilmington, Delaware, I was very involved in the community.</span> <span id="s946">I was always involved in the community, always.</span> <span id="s947">If I knew there was something had to be done in --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: At school, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: -- in a poor area, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: -- synagogue?</span> <span id="s951">A: A synagogue and a school, wherever I could.</span> <span id="s952">And wherever I could make myself understand, because my -- my English was still not the greatest.</span> <span id="s953">But when I -- in -- in Philadelphia, I got really involved in the Civil Rights movement in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s954">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: What made you first -- how did you first know about it and how did you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Well, what happened was I was asked by a woman if -- who organizes, called the panel of American women.</span> <span id="s957">It was a group of women, and we went -- who went out to speak and they spoke mostly how it was -- this was in the early 60’s, like ‘61, how it is to live in United States, as a Protestant, a Catholic and a Jewish person and a Native American.</span> <span id="s958">And th-they asked me to be the Jewish person, and I said, “No, I’m very busy, I have” -- I was busy in my synagogue, I was busy with Haddassah, which is woman’s group, a Zionist organization, who take care of the hospitals in Israel.</span> <span id="s959">And I felt I really did not have time, with three children and I was busy enough.</span> <span id="s960">I just didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s961">Then, I’m sitting and watching the news and it was David Brinkley and John Chancellor, talking about a group -- I mean, I love news -- about a group of people that congregated themselves in front of a home that an African American family had moved into that home.</span> <span id="s962">And it was called -- I don’t even want to repeat it, of course.</span> <span id="s963">And taunting them, and it looked like 500 people.</span> <span id="s964">And the police standing, they aren’t doing nothing.</span> <span id="s965">And for me, it was like Kristallnacht, when people saw what was happening in Nazi Germany and nobody did anything.</span> <span id="s966">Everybody was just, you know, looking and doing nothing.</span> <span id="s967">Well, I wasn’t going to do that.</span> <span id="s968">I felt that if that family -- the name of the people were Baker, if the Baker’s weren’t -- in Folcoff, Pennsylvania, which is near the airport -- if their home is not safe, my home is not safe.</span> <span id="s969">So I -- I got dressed and I -- I was -- remember -- I was -- was sitting and took some cookies I had baked and I called a friend who was involved with that panel, if she would come and go with me to the Bakers.</span> <span id="s970">They were still trying to get me on that panel and those people were all I met through the public school, through Henry School in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s971">And I said, “Yes, I want to go.”</span> <span id="s972">And we went.</span> <span id="s973">And I -- for the first time in the United States, I was in Philadelphia, in the city of brotherly love, feeling this thing of hatred, when I was called white trash and throwing things at me when we walked by.</span> <span id="s974">We parked the car at a distance.</span> <span id="s975">And I went to Sarah and Horace Baker, I -- I have lost contact since, with them.</span> <span id="s976">In fact, they are going to try to have a reunion with all of us when I’m there, in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s977">And from then on, I called up the lady who was doing the panel was Lois Stalvy, and I said to her, “Lois, I want to be on the panel.”</span> <span id="s978">And I started speaking out what was happening to me, that ultimately this was going to be the result.</span> <span id="s979">And we spoke all over, all over.</span> <span id="s980">I’ll never forget when I went to Columbia, Maryland, which was a brand new town that was just built.</span> <span id="s981">And we were refused -- I was there with two African American women -- was refused to be served, the guy would not serve us.</span> <span id="s982">And I walked up to him in my broken English and -- I mean, my English, I told him, you know, “We’re waiting long, where is the food?”</span> <span id="s983">And he said, “I don’t have tea, coffee, or anything for the likes like you.”</span> <span id="s984">And I walked up and I remember having the water -- glasses of water, spilled out the water and I just -- and walked out.</span> <span id="s985">I said, “Let’s go.</span> <span id="s986">We don’t need this white trash.”</span> <span id="s987">And I -- you know, and I walked out.</span> <span id="s988">Said it loud enough that everybody turned around.</span> <span id="s989">Then I made a statement.</span> <span id="s990">And I went on and I felt that the Civil Rights movement was a si -- a time in my life that I felt -- this was before even Martin Luther King, that it was a very, very scary, that this is going to happen all over again.</span> <span id="s991">There were riots.</span> <span id="s992">There were all kinds of things that this is happening in the United States.</span> <span id="s993">I knew very little about the United States, even though I’ve lived here already a few years.</span> <span id="s994">I -- I had just become a citizen -- I had just become a citizen.</span> <span id="s995">It was -- Nixon was running for office.</span> <span id="s996">I was -- and he lost, the first time he [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Who was president when you became a citizen?</span> <span id="s998">A: Harry Truman.</span> <span id="s999">And th-there was just so many things going on, that [break] judge asking me, and the question.</span> <span id="s1000">You know, they ask you who -- who would become president and -- oh, no, he was -- he -- Nix-Nixon, oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1001">When I came here, Truman was the -- but Nixon was the vice-president, so he was with who?</span> <span id="s1002">With Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s1005">Now Eisenhower, for me, was my idol, because he was my liberator.</span> <span id="s1006">And when I heard his name -- to this day, when I see the American flag, I cry.</span> <span id="s1007">I get tears in my eyes.</span> <span id="s1008">The -- The Star Spangled Banner is just the -- the greatest thing that -- greatest piece of music to my life.</span> <span id="s1009">I mean that -- here they were.</span> <span id="s1010">There is no country in the world like United States.</span> <span id="s1011">But I remember distinctly when the judge asked me, “If the president dies, who becomes the president?”</span> <span id="s1012">And I say, “God forbid, Nixon.”</span> <span id="s1013">And the judge said -- I’ll never forget, the judge said, “You don’t like Mr. Nixon?”</span> <span id="s1014">And I said, “No, I want Mr. Eisenhower to live.”</span> <span id="s1015">He said, “It’s okay, I’m a democrat.”</span> <span id="s1016">I’ll never forget that, that was in Wilmington, Delaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Oh my God, you got the right judge.</span> <span id="s1018">So now, you’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: There, for the first time, I could go and vote.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And how did that feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh, greatest thing.</span> <span id="s1022">I think that people don’t realize what we have in this country.</span> <span id="s1023">That we can do anything we want with the ballot.</span> <span id="s1024">That one vote makes a difference.</span> <span id="s1025">And I don’t think many people exercise that right.</span> <span id="s1026">And that’s why, it became, during Civil Rights movement, so important for me -- every African American, every black person I met, I’d say, “Did you vote?</span> <span id="s1027">Are you registered to vote?</span> <span id="s1028">If not, let’s -- I’m going to help you.”</span> <span id="s1029">And I had a hard time doing it, because I was not -- you know, and [indecipherable] I was not even an -- a citizen myself, I couldn’t -- I did -- started doing that.</span> <span id="s1030">And I just -- I just felt I had an incredible kinship with the Black person, because, you see, the Black person never hurt me.</span> <span id="s1031">I was never hurt by a Black person.</span> <span id="s1032">I was hurt by a White Christian person.</span> <span id="s1033">So they were a different people and why would they, because of -- because they were -- looked different than me, I couldn’t -- couldn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1034">And people would say to me, “Well, you have to live here to -- to understand.”</span> <span id="s1035">So I guess -- but I couldn’t believe that United States would be that racist.</span> <span id="s1036">And so I began to speak out quite a bit on that.</span> <span id="s1037">And I took on -- there were a lot of, you know, the deniers and that, and -- and was hissed on and -- you know, and all the -- the -- the things during that time.</span> <span id="s1038">And went into certain neighborhoods, which was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1039">I didn’t even tell my ex where I was going.</span> <span id="s1040">To -- To --</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: At this time your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: -- registering -- my children were still little and my children always thought that something is going to happen to me during that time.</span> <span id="s1043">I know that my phone was bugged, because we had a police commissioner by the name of Rizzo and I would come home and I’d say, “Hello Mr. Rizzo, I live in your neighborhood.”</span> <span id="s1044">And he did, he lived in my neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1045">And I said, “Please stop bugging my line.</span> <span id="s1046">I’m --” I always telled to him, “I’m a caring person, I’m not a subversive person.”</span> <span id="s1047">I used to go on and tell him all the thing.</span> <span id="s1048">Anything I want to get off my chest, I would tell it into the phone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Did you sense, at the same time in -- that Americans were anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Anti-Semitism here in this country is different than anti-Semitism that I experienced in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1051">In Lithuania, it’s right out, anti-Semitism in the real [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1052">They hate you and they’re going to kill you.</span> <span id="s1053">Don’t say all, but even being back there with the film, they still talk candidly about hating the Jews.</span> <span id="s1054">Even after so many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Even to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: Last year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Did they say why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: What did they say why?</span> <span id="s1059">We are known as the Christ killers.</span> <span id="s1060">And anti-Semitism -- you have to remember, in Lithuania, in my little town or even in the big town, the synagogue is not there any more.</span> <span id="s1061">There’s not a single Jew in the towns -- town after town.</span> <span id="s1062">The church is standing majestic.</span> <span id="s1063">The synagogue was almost across the street, is not there, it’s a parking lot.</span> <span id="s1064">But in that church, when I was just there -- I was there a couple of time, the last six years, if the priest -- and it was quite almost weekly, would preach that the Jews are Christ killers, that the Jews killed Christ.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: To this day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: I’m not talking now, I’m not there, but I’m talking when I was there, when I lived there.</span> <span id="s1067">In, say in the 30’s and 40’s, when I -- then it gave the people the right to go out and -- and kill and maim.</span> <span id="s1068">If they killed -- if you were -- killed Christ our Lord, you shouldn’t live.</span> <span id="s1069">This is what that.</span> <span id="s1070">Now, I don’t think a priest is going to go in United States and say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Do you see any kind of connection with this strong religious Christian right movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Oh, that frightens me.</span> <span id="s1073">It frightens me -- it frightens me with the anti-abortionists.</span> <span id="s1074">That they can go out and maim and kill for their ideal, what they want?</span> <span id="s1075">What they think is the right thing?</span> <span id="s1076">What they think is moral?</span> <span id="s1077">Is it moral to go out and kill a doctor, what’s left four little children behind?</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, to go out -- those are the kind of things that worries me, yes.</span> <span id="s1079">And that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: Do you see it get -- get that serious in -- a-again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: If we -- it can, if we let it happen.</span> <span id="s1082">And again, it goes back to the ballot box.</span> <span id="s1083">Who we -- Who we elect.</span> <span id="s1084">And what’s happening now in the country with Clinton, what’s happening now?</span> <span id="s1085">We’re the laughing stock of the world.</span> <span id="s1086">40 million dollars you give a man who’s not -- I mean, how can it be so independent that it was all for the Republican party over the -- how can you have a person, give him that kind of money, to do whatever he wants to bring the president down?</span> <span id="s1087">To me, it’s scary.</span> <span id="s1088">It is very s -- very scary.</span> <span id="s1089">I mean, what he did is wrong, but he’s the president of the United States, he had another years and a half or two years for the term.</span> <span id="s1090">He’s been a good president for the economy, for the people.</span> <span id="s1091">I mean, this is between him and his wife.</span> <span id="s1092">This is not betw -- and I think he lied because he wanted to protect his family.</span> <span id="s1093">It’s as simple as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: They really laugh at us in Europe for this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Yeah, I mean he’s -- everybody -- everyone, th -- all the presidents, they’ve all had that.</span> <span id="s1096">And it -- I think that is because they are so powerful that people go towards it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: I -- I want to -- there’s a -- a whole list of events and I want to go back to the Civil Rights movement that there are several things that the Oral History department has put down that I think I want you to look at and see if there’s any -- anything there that you in particular had experience.</span> <span id="s1098">I don’t know if you were here then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: Well, I was here and I was glued to the television with the McCarthy era.</span> <span id="s1100">It was a very frightening time for me.</span> <span id="s1101">It was a frightening time because it was scary that people were -- you were afraid to talk to your neighbor.</span> <span id="s1102">You were afraid to say something before you would get a summons.</span> <span id="s1103">I mean, there were so many people who were being brought to trial.</span> <span id="s1104">The McCarthy era was a very, very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s1105">The Korean war -- war is scary to me and my brother-in-law was -- my husband -- my ex-husband brother was in the Korean war and it was very scary, cause war is very scary.</span> <span id="s1106">The Civil Rights movement, I feel was the greatest thing that happened in United States, by changing the course of events.</span> <span id="s1107">I think it -- not only for the Black community, m -- as much it did for the White community.</span> <span id="s1108">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: In what way?</span> <span id="s1111">I think that we began to look at it that racism is wrong and bigotry is wrong.</span> <span id="s1112">And I think that when people went to the south with the -- the buses, when they went with the buses to register people, to see their hatred of the group of people who were just [indecipherable] -- the Klan and -- and that -- that it’s wrong.</span> <span id="s1113">That if it can happen in Germany and we allow this to flourish, it’s going to happen here.</span> <span id="s1114">And we’re going to have to put a stop to it.</span> <span id="s1115">But it’s changed now.</span> <span id="s1116">You have now a Farrakan, who to me is a demagogue.</span> <span id="s1117">He’s a -- He’s a leader in -- in the Black community, but he still -- why do you need -- get a leader -- the difference between him and Martin Luther King and Farrakan.</span> <span id="s1118">I mean, you get a demagogue, who hates the Whites, hates everything, hates everybody.</span> <span id="s1119">And Martin Luther King, to me, preached -- preached self respect, the sanctity of life and to be peaceful and to be -- with the ballot box, that we can elect officials and I think when I went on the March on Washington, I’ll never forget.</span> <span id="s1120">It was the hottest day, I remember.</span> <span id="s1121">Saturday, we -- I stayed with a Black family for the first time.</span> <span id="s1122">Here I am a Jewish, religious girl.</span> <span id="s1123">Brought my tuna fish and my piece of choller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: This was six -- in the 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: This was ‘63.</span> <span id="s1126">And I stayed and I’ll never, never forget it.</span> <span id="s1127">And I went and I heard, “I Had a Dream.”</span> <span id="s1128">But I had met him before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: Well, tell me about this, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: I met him before.</span> <span id="s1131">I lived in west Mount Airy in Philadelphia, Germantown, west Mount Airy area, and -- and I was begin -- when I got involved with the panel of American women, I met a lot of interesting people and there was Judge Raymond Pace Alexander.</span> <span id="s1132">He was the first -- I believe, the first African American judge to be elected to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</span> <span id="s1133">And he wa -- I was walking my dog and he was walking in the morning and he said, “Oh, why don’t you come and have dinner with us?”</span> <span id="s1134">So I came -- I went and I had dinner with them and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: With his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Yeah, with his family.</span> <span id="s1137">He said, “I have a -- two -- two friends of mine are coming, one is a reverend and the other one, too,” I think and -- and it turned out it was that -- di -- didn’t I think so, he said, “Oh, but I know that you --” because we’ve been in several of the fellowship commission and so forth and he saw I was eating fish and that.</span> <span id="s1138">He said, “I’ll tell Sadie that you can onl --” I said -- I said, “Just some vegetables [indecipherable]” So he -- when the dinner was served, Sadie, his wife said, “Judy, I have vegetables, this is your -- this is the vegetables on the side.</span> <span id="s1139">The rest of it you can’t eat, it’s chitlings.”</span> <span id="s1140">So they turned out it was Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy was there that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: And it was very interesting and then, I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: How many of you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: We were -- he was there, Sadie and him and there was, I think, two other people.</span> <span id="s1147">I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1148">I think the Mitchells.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: A very small dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Y -- Very small, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: And -- And, so tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: So, he asked me, you know, want to know and -- and Raymond Pace Alexander told him I’m a Holocaust survivor and I’m [indecipherable] with this panel of American women and we -- you know, told him all that.</span> <span id="s1155">And he said, “No, tell me, why did you come to United States and not Palestine?”</span> <span id="s1156">And I told him, I said, “You know, I would have gone to Palestine.</span> <span id="s1157">I had no intention coming to Canada if my brother didn’t come to Canada.</span> <span id="s1158">If he went to Palestine, I would have gone.</span> <span id="s1159">Would have been -- ended up in Palestine.”</span> <span id="s1160">So -- And we were, you know, it was very interesting conversation, it was more about Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1161">Philadelphia was just beginning to organize with OIC, with -- they felt that if they trained people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: OIC.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: OIC, which is -- I can’t think what is [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1164">It’s was organized by -- oh, I can’t think of -- he was a minister who organized it, that if you take people and you train them in skills, like mechanics and that, because they weren’t going to go through college, and certain people that you would get them off the street and -- oh, it was Reverend Sullivan’s group, OIC.</span> <span id="s1165">And they were talking about -- and I think they were there, he was there.</span> <span id="s1166">It was very interesting group, but it -- it is interesting that on the second time I heard him speak was at the Fellowship Commission, which I was involved a little bit in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1167">But the third time I went is when he did that, “I Have a Dream.”</span> <span id="s1168">And to see all the thousands of people and to see all shades.</span> <span id="s1169">I mean, this was not just Black people.</span> <span id="s1170">To me -- and to get the buses, I remember was -- I had to pay into the Urban League, I be -- you had to become a member of the Urban League.</span> <span id="s1171">I don’t know where the Urban League is now.</span> <span id="s1172">And we all went on the bus and I went to -- with another friend, I went to -- because I didn’t ride on the Sabbath, so I had to stay close by, I stayed in -- in the district.</span> <span id="s1173">And I had m-money, you know, with hotels so I -- so there were a lot of African American families who put people up in their homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: I’m going to the next tape -- next side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: I’m going to the next tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: This is tape three, side A, of an interview with Judith Meisel, conducted by Ginger Miles, on January 20th, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s1179">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Okay, so to me, being involved was that I felt that there was a quality, because we alway say, you know, and -- and some of the words we -- we say democracy, I mean, I’ve always felt that there is no such thing as a democracy.</span> <span id="s1181">We just say the word democracy, but a democracy’s an utopia for -- to aspire to that democracy.</span> <span id="s1182">And I feel that United States is constantly working towards that end of a democracy of that.</span> <span id="s1183">And that end of when it came with the Civil Rights movement, meaned for me that I am -- want to be part of that, to bring it forward.</span> <span id="s1184">And then, of course, after that, became, you know, the Vietnam War and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: But before we get to the war, how did you follow up from, “I Have a Dream”?</span> <span id="s1186">Were you -- did you go back home and were you active, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: Oh, I -- I was very much involved.</span> <span id="s1188">We organized a group called Northwest Interfaith Movement, where I lived.</span> <span id="s1189">And where we had -- we began to have a -- a whole group of us and I think it still may be going on, where we met once a week and we took the New Testament and the Old Testament and we saw what was creating their anti-Semitism, all the isms, you know.</span> <span id="s1190">And we developed that.</span> <span id="s1191">I went out to speak, I must -- at least twice, three time a week, speaking to -- in Black churches, in Catholic schools, in -- in universities all over.</span> <span id="s1192">The Panel of American Women.</span> <span id="s1193">And each one of us spoke.</span> <span id="s1194">The -- I spoke what happened to me, fo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: You would tell them about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Well, experiences, but me -- very [indecipherable] we would open it up from -- from the audience, questions.</span> <span id="s1197">The Catholic person would speak how it is to grow up as a Catholic in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1198">And then the Protestant would say, “Well, I never knew who wasn’t there, you know, I never saw it, you know, what was happening.”</span> <span id="s1199">But it was a-an incredible, credible, we were an incredible group of people.</span> <span id="s1200">We were going to have a reunion in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1201">And most of them were housewives, but all of them felt really dedicated to erase racism and bigotry from the schools, from the -- from -- you know, the most important thing is your -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1202">The political person who is in charge of your neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1203">You don’t have that here, but your -- I can’t think of the -- wh-what it’s called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: In -- In Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">A: No, no, here, in United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: A council --</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A: Not -- Not the -- the counc -- well here in -- in -- you have it differently in back east.</span> <span id="s1208">The ward leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: Those are your important people.</span> <span id="s1211">They are the people who take your trash, who arrange.</span> <span id="s1212">Those are the people who do a lot of the things and certain neighborhoods, it’s done, in certain neighborhood, it’s not, you know?</span> <span id="s1213">Those are the nitty gritty grass roots things that I got very involved, because I can’t do globally.</span> <span id="s1214">I’m -- you know?</span> <span id="s1215">But you can begin in your own neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1216">And -- And a lot of those kind of things I did, I -- I -- I must say, I worked very, very hard.</span> <span id="s1217">Then my marriage broke.</span> <span id="s1218">Can I go on?</span> <span id="s1219">And I have three ch --</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: I -- Can I -- Can I -- Can I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: -- bring it back to the children before we --</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: -- and then go to the marriage breaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: You said something which brought together both your experience as a speaker -- when you spoke about your experience as a survivor and that your daughter was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: And then we went from there, to have a break and then we spoke about your daughter and what she’s doing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Can you tell me a moment in your relationship with your daughter, when she began to understand the stories that you told, what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Oh, I think that my daughter knew all along that was happen -- we just didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s1232">This was not a conversation that we had at the table -- at the dinner table.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: H-How did she know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: Well, she -- sh -- when you ask her, she’ll know that we didn’t have any relatives, we didn’t have -- that I didn’t -- that I -- certain things would bother me, like they -- you know, if they put -- put something on -- like, for instance if she would come home and -- and wore like a tag with her name on, I would immediately take it off and she’d say, “No, I want to wear it.”</span> <span id="s1235">I’d say, “No, you can’t.”</span> <span id="s1236">And I didn’t give them reasons, but they begin -- you know, children, they begin to talk to each other and so forth.</span> <span id="s1237">They say they always knew, but I remember not sitting down and talking to them.</span> <span id="s1238">How they knew, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1239">They knew.</span> <span id="s1240">They knew, they had the feeling and so forth.</span> <span id="s1241">And my brother certainly never tells his kids -- anything that his kids know, I told them.</span> <span id="s1242">And the same thing with my sister.</span> <span id="s1243">And I was very protective of them.</span> <span id="s1244">I did not want them growing up here, to carrying my burden what I had.</span> <span id="s1245">I was very protective of them, until a certain point when they got older and they began to ask questions.</span> <span id="s1246">I never -- when they asked me a question, I told them.</span> <span id="s1247">I remember when Eichmann was taken to Israel and my son came home and they talked about it in school.</span> <span id="s1248">And he said, “Is Eichmann one of -- is Eichmann the guy that killed your mother?”</span> <span id="s1249">And I said, “He killed many, and my mother was among them.”</span> <span id="s1250">I’ll never -- that was the first time I said -- he was 12 years old.</span> <span id="s1251">So, you know, snitches -- snatches like that, but I didn’t sit down, now I’m going to tell you my story, or -- or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Did ever any of them cry when you gave them an answer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1254">I tell you, I cried so much that I -- after a period, I had no tears.</span> <span id="s1255">After my mother was taken, I cried and cried and cried and -- in fact, I cry more now than I’ve done in years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Do you think that’s a healing experience?</span> <span id="s1257">A: I don’t think I can ever heal.</span> <span id="s1258">I don’t -- I don’t think that I -- it-it’ll ever heal.</span> <span id="s1259">How can you?</span> <span id="s1260">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1261">There’s no such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: But crying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: There’s no forgiveness and there’s no heal.</span> <span id="s1264">I can’t forgive a person who does something like that.</span> <span id="s1265">You know, it’s -- it’s not for me to forgive, it’s for the people who are not here to forgive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Who were -- who are dead.</span> <span id="s1268">Who they killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: I mean, someone asked me the other day, “How will the Nazi -- how will Germany -- I -- I don’t like to use the word just Germany, Nazi Germany know that they are forgiven?”</span> <span id="s1271">I said, “That’s not for me to say.</span> <span id="s1272">Maybe never, because they have to be forgiven for the people who they killed.</span> <span id="s1273">And they’re not here.</span> <span id="s1274">So, I can’t forgive them for them.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: So, jer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: But I don’t go around hating and make my life so miserable that I can’t live, cause that’s the satisfaction, if I did that, to Hitler, and I’m not about to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: But you are an activist and I think that is the way you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: I don’t know an activist.</span> <span id="s1279">I’m involve -- I -- I don’t know active.</span> <span id="s1280">I don’t go out with -- on the corner and raising a flag and that.</span> <span id="s1281">I -- I -- If I see something, I go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s1282">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: You were telling me about your marriage, so maybe we should get back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Your first marriage.</span> <span id="s1286">What happened?</span> <span id="s1287">Oh, you don’t have to go into -- whatever you want to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Well, I had a very s -- good marriage until it happens -- it was a very -- with a friend of mine, and it was an affair and my marriage broke.</span> <span id="s1289">I went to Israel, which I dreamed to go for the first time.</span> <span id="s1290">I became -- I went as a counselor with Camp Hamar and my marriage broke.</span> <span id="s1291">When I came back, he had an affair with my -- one -- a very good friend and -- and once trust is broken for me, I cannot deal with it.</span> <span id="s1292">I had a hard time dealing with it and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: You brought your children --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A: Yeah, it was very difficult, because the -- my youngest one was -- at that time was 14 and Michael was 17 and -- and Mina was fir -- was a sophomore in college.</span> <span id="s1295">And it was -- was very difficult and I lev -- it left me penniless.</span> <span id="s1296">He literally left me penniless, took all the money, everything, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s1297">And I tell you, I’m not ashamed to say that.</span> <span id="s1298">He really, literally -- and it’s one thing, I’m always -- I always say that, you can fall in love as much as you can fall out of love.</span> <span id="s1299">You can do that, but you don’t hurt your children.</span> <span id="s1300">And to see -- when I kept thinking constantly, and those years was very difficult, was -- that my mother suffered so much to see us hungry, and devastated with cold and hungry and have nothing.</span> <span id="s1301">And here I am again, left, I was nine years by myself with raising three kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: And how did you make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I held on three jobs and my kids all went to college.</span> <span id="s1304">I worked very hard, I went knocking on door at senators for senatorial scholarship and thank God I have wonderful kids, who adapt, and -- and they went on scholarship and when they graduated, they ended up paying and paying and paying.</span> <span id="s1305">They just finishing paying.</span> <span id="s1306">And one is a very successful attorney.</span> <span id="s1307">And my daughter is an artist and she married to a physician, thank God.</span> <span id="s1308">And my youngest daughter is a meeting planner and married to an accountant and they -- wonderful, wonderful children.</span> <span id="s1309">And wonderful grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: But you’re so -- your own education, at that time when your husband left, ho -- where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: Well, at the -- the thing what was, is that I st -- worked as a preschool teacher, as an assistant preschool teacher and then -- then I became a teacher.</span> <span id="s1312">I started going to school.</span> <span id="s1313">But I would go to school like once a week and so forth, you know, just take some courses.</span> <span id="s1314">But when the marriage broke, I went school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Full time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Full -- not full time, nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: Nighttime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Four times a week.</span> <span id="s1319">And a li -- I don’t know if you know Philadelphia, but I use go -- went to Temple University and I would take and drive -- take two buses and stand in cold and come home at night.</span> <span id="s1320">My kids told me they lived on hot dogs, because that’s -- I would leave and say, “This your dinner.”</span> <span id="s1321">And I’d go off and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: When did you graduate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: And I graduated the year my daughter, about couple of weeks before I got my degree, before -- my daughter was married and I was s-so excited with my degree, that I completely forgot about her wedding.</span> <span id="s1324">It took me forever.</span> <span id="s1325">You know, she said, “Mom, I’m getting married, and you talk only about your degree.”</span> <span id="s1326">But it was 11 years I went for it.</span> <span id="s1327">It was just such a satisfaction to have that piece of paper of mine.</span> <span id="s1328">I’ll never forget, I went to register at the first time, Temple University.</span> <span id="s1329">I go and register and you know, you go around the tables and you advisors and you know, you tell them what and you meet with them.</span> <span id="s1330">And I come back, and my ex said, “Where are you?</span> <span id="s1331">How come you’re in graduate school?</span> <span id="s1332">You didn’t even go to undergraduate school?”</span> <span id="s1333">And I said, “Well, that’s what they told me -- that’s what I should do, I should take non-matriculate courses and see what I would like.”</span> <span id="s1334">So I took a lot of non-matriculate courses and I -- and eventually I had to matriculate and work very hard on a whole summer on calculus and you name it and I don’t still ta -- after that, I don’t know what happened, you know [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: What year was it that you graduated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: I think ‘57.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: From college?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A: No, no, no, no, oh that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: From college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: From college, was -- I started in ‘57.</span> <span id="s1341">I think was ‘70 -- ‘74 or ‘75.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1343">And you still had children at home, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: And -- And how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: I had two.</span> <span id="s1347">Mina was already in college.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: When you graduated from college, there were still two at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Mm, mm, mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: And -- And then you started working?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: I had a sene -- when I -- the year that I graduated, he was a senior and -- in high school and Debbie was in eighth grade.</span> <span id="s1352">Eighth or ninth grade.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: And did you go ahead and get a teaching job, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: No, I worked in the same place.</span> <span id="s1355">I stayed in the same place.</span> <span id="s1356">See, those years --</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Germantown Jewish Center.</span> <span id="s1359">And I started there the preschool, practically.</span> <span id="s1360">Nothing.</span> <span id="s1361">And I start one here.</span> <span id="s1362">I came -- there, it was only in the morning.</span> <span id="s1363">The kids would go from nine to 12 and then I saw that there was a need for parents, already a lot of women, for single woman and I [indecipherable] because I was single, that they needed a place in the afternoon that the kids should stay, so I started in the afternoon, which was very unusual.</span> <span id="s1364">And so I taught all day.</span> <span id="s1365">I’d run home for an hour and then when I’d come -- and the -- they went there til four and then, at 6:30, I would go to teach Hebrew school, of congregation out of the jeshuona in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1366">And so I held three job.</span> <span id="s1367">In the summertime, I worked at Camp Rama.</span> <span id="s1368">And I would leave the 24th, 25th of June and come back around Labor Day [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: In Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: No.</span> <span id="s1371">In -- I went -- one summer I went to them in Israel.</span> <span id="s1372">I worked at Rama -- Camp Rama for many years.</span> <span id="s1373">Various camps, one in the Poconos, one in the Berkshires, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: And you taught when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: No, there I was in charge of the guests who would come and the store -- the camp store.</span> <span id="s1376">And odd jobs wherever they need me.</span> <span id="s1377">They would say to me they can put me in anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: So your -- your whole -- not your whole life, but a -- a lot of your life was surrounded by Jewish community, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1380">And the Jewish community was very, very important, but to me, the general community is just as important.</span> <span id="s1381">And I’m very involved in the general community.</span> <span id="s1382">I got involved here that I was honored by the anti-Defamation League.</span> <span id="s1383">They gave me the woman --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: In Central Park?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: -- of the year.</span> <span id="s1386">Yeah, you’ll see all my plaques.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Oh, how wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: And they -- the Woman of the Year award, I got five years -- four years ago, the Woman of the Year award, I got five years a -- four years ago, in Santa Barbara.</span> <span id="s1389">And I was shocked that they chose me, but they said I have been doing so many things.</span> <span id="s1390">The Anne Frank I did was not a Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s1391">I mean, it was Jewish in fact that was bought, but it wasn’t really -- we bought with -- to educate childre -- school children from all over the county.</span> <span id="s1392">I -- I tried to get involved wherever I feel I can be of any use.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">Q: I’d love to see your awards, but I think that what would be nicest, if we, instead of going into another --</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: You don’t want any this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: I do.</span> <span id="s1396">But I -- I think that your personal history is very, very important and of great interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: And that -- so, that -- that -- second husband, who I have seen around today --</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: How did he come about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1402">Well, I was almost, as I said, eight -- eight -- almost nine years, I was by myself and when Debbie went away to college, she went to -- first to Macallister and then she went to Maryland -- University of Maryland.</span> <span id="s1403">And she was my youngest and oh, the day she left, everybody wanted to know, what are you going to do with your house?</span> <span id="s1404">It was a big house.</span> <span id="s1405">Was, you know, was a nice house, wasn’t a big mansion, but it was a nice, comfortable, four bedroom house in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1406">And I said, “Nothing.”</span> <span id="s1407">And I remember when she went away, I got undressed and I pulled down all the shades and I was running around and I said, “I’m -- I can take care of just me, just me, just me.”</span> <span id="s1408">You know, I was just -- this was so overwhelming, that you know, I had the kids and -- and the responsibility.</span> <span id="s1409">I think that is -- with the divorce, I think that biggest difficulty is that the woman, especially the woman, is the father and the mother and everything.</span> <span id="s1410">And then, the biggest thing that I would have would -- when they would come home, they would spend some time, a couple of hours, he would take them to a movie, or take them out to a tuna fish sandwich, to -- and they’d come home, say, “Oh that’s -- we had such a wonderful tuna fish salad,” and everything -- you know, sandwich, everything.</span> <span id="s1411">It would kill me, you know, here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: With Daddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yeah, with Daddy.</span> <span id="s1414">Here I am, you know, everything, you know -- who’s up and get you out to -- to go to school and everything else.</span> <span id="s1415">And when I started preschool -- what?</span> <span id="s1416">What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: I-I’m just hearing something.</span> <span id="s1418">Maybe -- I’m sorry --</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s1420">When -- In preschool, I used to tell the teachers -- when I -- there was a single parent, when they come to pick up the child, don’t tell them anything.</span> <span id="s1421">The -- If the kid bit somebody, or that.</span> <span id="s1422">I had such empathy for a single parent.</span> <span id="s1423">It was just, you know.</span> <span id="s1424">It was very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Very difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: And, I think through all this, you probably have been very, very moved by the memory of your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yeah, and -- and when it happened to me, tha -- when my marriage broke, I still don’t know to this day why it did it.</span> <span id="s1429">I have absolutely no clue why it did it.</span> <span id="s1430">Is it something --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Let’s get to him.</span> <span id="s1432">Maybe he wants us to get to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1434">Well, I -- I -- I began -- then I began to start dating and I -- you know, what to me, I figure, oh, I’m going to -- if I do get, I’m going to get somebody who has money and I’m ga -- not going to have to -- three jobs to work on and everything else.</span> <span id="s1435">And I remember meeting somebody and I was going out with that person, and that person was -- oh, was pretty well off.</span> <span id="s1436">He had his own airplane and -- and was really, you know and I was scared to death to get on the plane and everything.</span> <span id="s1437">But he always berated his wife and after going out with him for a month or so -- he liked me, and he was get -- I figure, no, anybody can berate like that -- see, I didn’t and I felt that -- so I stopped dating and then I was so tired.</span> <span id="s1438">I had no -- I didn’t even want to go out anyplace, because used to come Friday night, that was my Sabbath.</span> <span id="s1439">I would literally sleep.</span> <span id="s1440">I -- I -- I just collapse from exhaustion, because I also work Sunday.</span> <span id="s1441">So, it was like from -- you know, from Sunday at -- to Friday and then Sunday again, it start the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1442">So, one day we decided to go to a -- I had another friend who was never married, an American born.</span> <span id="s1443">An-And we were -- decided to go to the Jewish [indecipherable] center.</span> <span id="s1444">And they had -- but women -- men and women, how is it, you know, your first date when you go out after a divorce or something and -- and there was just a discussion, you know, how is it to be single and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1445">And then, after it was over, they had some Israeli dancing and he was there.</span> <span id="s1446">He asked her -- Rebecca and me out for a drink.</span> <span id="s1447">I had -- to a bar and I’ve never been in bar in my life.</span> <span id="s1448">And I said, “Yeah, we’ll go, we’ll take.”</span> <span id="s1449">And we went and the wait -- come in, the waitress said, I remember, on City Line Avenue, the waitress said, “Well, you got 15 minutes to get a drink, cause we are closing.”</span> <span id="s1450">So, we ordered the drink and then he said, “Can I have your telephone numbers?”</span> <span id="s1451">And Rebecca said, “Oh, he’s going to call you.”</span> <span id="s1452">And I said, “No, he’s going to call you.”</span> <span id="s1453">And then he called me and we went out and th-that’s -- that’s history and then we met -- I remember he took me to -- it’s -- it’s playing now, oh well.</span> <span id="s1454">[doorbell] Oops.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: All right, now that was flowers that were delivered for -- well, you spoke where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Laguna Blanca, it’s a private school here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: And what did you speak about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: I go out speaking about what happened to me and they saw the film that was made.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: The name of the film?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: The na -- it’s called, “Sack for Alt”, in Danish it means, “Thank You for Everything.”</span> <span id="s1461">And they saw that film before and they were the only ones that had seen it, except for when it played at the Labarro Theater.</span> <span id="s1462">Everybody is -- wants me to show it to them, but it’s now going into film festivals and maybe to the Academy Awards.</span> <span id="s1463">It’s an incredible film.</span> <span id="s1464">I wish you have time.</span> <span id="s1465">Maybe when your uncle comes back, you could see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: I would love to, if we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: If we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: If you -- If you can.</span> <span id="s1470">So they -- I s -- I spoke Thursday and I spoke about what happened, but mostly about the Civil Rights Movement.</span> <span id="s1471">And it was very appropriate, so that’s the flower, thanking me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: And I -- it’s a beautiful thanks, is-isn’t it?</span> <span id="s1473">And -- Since this list is -- is activating a lot of your thoughts and your experiences, why don’t you just go down it and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: -- say what-whatever comes to your mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: The Vietnam War, and I remem -- that was very difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1477">The most difficult part was my son didn’t have a high number and I was worried -- terribly worried about -- of him being drafted.</span> <span id="s1478">E -- E -- I had sleepless nights about it.</span> <span id="s1479">My brother and my sister live in Canada and you know there were a lot of people who went to Canada.</span> <span id="s1480">And I was literally, if it didn’t stopped, I was thinking of moving back to Canada, cause I just could not deal with that.</span> <span id="s1481">And the scary part of the -- became even worse is when the Kent State -- I remember when the Kent State, with the shootings at Kent State, it was devastated.</span> <span id="s1482">It was very scary time.</span> <span id="s1483">The new left movement, I didn’t have that much of -- didn’t -- busy.</span> <span id="s1484">The sexual revolution is -- the drugs and so forth.</span> <span id="s1485">I think it was scary for me, the drug situation, because here I was with two teenagers and I remember the kids used to love to come to my house, his friends.</span> <span id="s1486">And my son is -- played basketball and he was on the varsity team, so all the kids would come.</span> <span id="s1487">And rather than him going down to north Philadelphia in a very not good neighborhood, we had a basketball court put in and he would play at home.</span> <span id="s1488">And I remember baking pies so they would all come in.</span> <span id="s1489">And I’ll never forget this instance.</span> <span id="s1490">I was running for my second job, teaching at congregation B’nai Brith.</span> <span id="s1491">[indecipherable] congregation B’nai Brith, [indecipherable] on congregation in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s1492">And my daughter and my son, they were home and then there were like four of Black kids who were playing basketball with him, who were on -- from Central High School.</span> <span id="s1493">And I remember this friend of mine happened to come and drop off her daughter.</span> <span id="s1494">And she said, “Are you kidding, you’re going out and you’re leaving four Black kids with Michael and Debbie?”</span> <span id="s1495">And I said, “Why not?”</span> <span id="s1496">She would not leave her daughter and that’s why I remember I was devastated.</span> <span id="s1497">Here is -- I trust my kids, in my own home.</span> <span id="s1498">They were -- they are all the time in my house, I trusted them and here is -- she’s trying to tell me that I’m doing something wrong.</span> <span id="s1499">And nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1500">My kids grew up in a very well integrated neighborhood of west Mount Airy.</span> <span id="s1501">And I think they are better off, because they are better human beings today.</span> <span id="s1502">They are very involved in their own communities, wherever they live and I’m grateful that I gave them that kind of home to live in.</span> <span id="s1503">So, the drug scene was very scared for me and I would say to them, “If you are caught and smoking marijuana,” -- which was that time, marijuana, “and you’re arrested, there’s no way I’m going to bail you out.</span> <span id="s1504">I work hard enough just to make you regular, decent human beings and if it’s against the law, then you shouldn’t do it.”</span> <span id="s1505">I knew nothing about it and so forth.</span> <span id="s1506">And so that’s -- that was it, you know, but thank God, my kids, I don’t know if they ever smoked marijuana or not, but I -- they’ve never been in trouble with the law, thank God.</span> <span id="s1507">The feminist movement I had a hard time understanding.</span> <span id="s1508">I couldn’t deal with, but I felt that because I was a single mother, I felt I should get equal pay for what I did, for that I worked hard for it.</span> <span id="s1509">I remember the assassination of Medgar Evers and I was devastated.</span> <span id="s1510">How it could happen them, because he was by then, a real name in every community.</span> <span id="s1511">And John F. Kennedy, I -- I felt that we will never know what he -- kind of president he would have been, died too young and too violent.</span> <span id="s1512">And Martin Luther King, he was -- he became my children’s hero.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Can you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Somebody to look for -- I remember Robert Kennedy when he was shot.</span> <span id="s1515">The fact that you could see that on television, it was just incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Can you remember your feelings when King was assassinated?</span> <span id="s1517">I think I better go to the next side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: I just want to say, this is Judith Meisel, tape three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: I remember it was on a Saturday when his funeral -- when ro -- when John Kennedy’s funeral and it was a big blizzard and we were all in watching the funeral, I can so vividly remember.</span> <span id="s1521">And I remember when Robert Kenne -- I mean, those are all memories that I have, but Martin Luther King was somebody larger in life to me.</span> <span id="s1522">Larger in life, that they could take him and that he went to a place to get better pay for ga -- people who were taking out garbage -- and that he was killed like that.</span> <span id="s1523">I thought Truman -- I loved Truman.</span> <span id="s1524">I liked Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">Q: Why did you love Truman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Well, Truman was the United States.</span> <span id="s1527">When I came here, he was the figure.</span> <span id="s1528">He was the president in United States.</span> <span id="s1529">I was lucky to be here.</span> <span id="s1530">It was like we used to say in -- in Yiddish, a golden immadina.</span> <span id="s1531">Or, to accept the gold you didn’t see, this means th-the -- the grounds are paved with gold.</span> <span id="s1532">It wasn’t, but it didn’t mean that, it meaned that I was free, there was freedom and -- and that he was a -- spoke to the common man.</span> <span id="s1533">Reagan, when he went to visit the gravesites of the German soldiers in Bittburg, I was at the preschool and I got a call from Jerry Rankin, who was the editor of the Santa Barbara News Press, if I could say something as a Holocaust survivor, if I would say to Reagan.</span> <span id="s1534">And the caption was, “What does --” Reagan lived far away from here, but it still said, “What does --” No, the caption was, “What does Reagan’s neighbor thinks of him going to Bittburg”.</span> <span id="s1535">And I had plenty to say, and to me, why visit the perpetrators who killed -- the killers -- and not visit American soldiers who were killed saving the people?</span> <span id="s1536">I couldn’t understand him.</span> <span id="s1537">It just beyond me.</span> <span id="s1538">It was just way beyond me that he could do such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Did you ever get an answer why he visited?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1541">But I -- I remember writing it to -- to him and to congressman and -- but I remember I was so hurt.</span> <span id="s1542">I felt it a personal hurt that here is a president of the United States, going to commemoration and going to Bittburg to honor the -- the soldiers -- to lay a wreath on the soldiers, well in the Americans he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1543">And that was just too -- too difficult for me.</span> <span id="s1544">I thought when the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was established, I thought that was the greatest thing that happened.</span> <span id="s1545">I thought, that has nothing to do because Jewish.</span> <span id="s1546">That here is a museum, a federal museum that speaks to the world what racism and bigotry does when it’s allowed to flourish, and man’s inhumanity to man.</span> <span id="s1547">And it’s still happening and I hope as many -- my -- what’d I say -- my wish one day, is that it take all the leaders of the world -- all the leaders of the world and bring them in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and just show them and talk to them what happened and what’s still happening in their countries.</span> <span id="s1548">It is still happening, except it is far away.</span> <span id="s1549">And, I was very proud this year of my -- my youngest daughter, when the Honduras flood, she called the Honduran embassy and she wanted to know what can she do.</span> <span id="s1550">I always used to tell my children, “Don’t tell me what can I do, I’m only one person.”</span> <span id="s1551">One person can do a lot.</span> <span id="s1552">So she said, “Oh, you’ll be proud of me.”</span> <span id="s1553">So I said, “Well, what’d you do?”</span> <span id="s1554">She says, “I called up the Honduras library, and I -- embassy, and I said, Well, how -- what can I do to help?”</span> <span id="s1555">And they said, “Well, we need diapers, we need aspirin and formula.”</span> <span id="s1556">And she says, “Oh, I can do that, how do I ship it?”</span> <span id="s1557">They said, “Well, if you have it in three days, we’ll ship it for you.”</span> <span id="s1558">She said, in no time at all, she had an auditorium full of things.</span> <span id="s1559">What she did is she Xeroxed -- put a note out in all the schools to bring.</span> <span id="s1560">People really want to help.</span> <span id="s1561">They don’t know how to do it, we have to empower them to help.</span> <span id="s1562">Because I think, basically, like Anne Frank said, basically people are good at heart.</span> <span id="s1563">They are.</span> <span id="s1564">It just -- we have to just get out the goodness in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1566">I -- I want to use this as a -- since you were talking about your daughter, is this the same daughter who’s the artist?</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: This is another daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: No, she is my youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: Could you say again about the daughter who’s an artist and tell a little bit about what she’s doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Well, ma --</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: -- [indecipherable] it relates to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1574">My daughter started doing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: Which daughter is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: In Mendocino, Mina.</span> <span id="s1577">She’s the oldest and she’s an artist and we always knew she was going to be an artist from the time she was a -- she was a toddler.</span> <span id="s1578">She always liked to draw and do things and put things together, collages and all kinds.</span> <span id="s1579">She is -- does a multimedia.</span> <span id="s1580">She started saying stories that my mother told me and -- I’ll have to show you, and stories that my mother told me about.</span> <span id="s1581">And she writes it about each painting that she did, or each collage.</span> <span id="s1582">Like sh -- about Hava.</span> <span id="s1583">She tells the story about Hava and she has a little shoe in the hand.</span> <span id="s1584">She has one painting with shoes.</span> <span id="s1585">She -- with real shoes.</span> <span id="s1586">She always used to collect shoes, I said, “What do you need the shoes?”</span> <span id="s1587">She said, “You’ll see.”</span> <span id="s1588">And it’s been going around to various schools all over the country, as long as they pay for the shipping and so forth and she does a wonderful -- she -- she does the narration, she has a -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1589">She narrates -- you know, she does the talk about what she does with the exhibit is, she’s compared my mother to me and then from me to her and from her to her two daughters.</span> <span id="s1590">And it’s a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful exhibit.</span> <span id="s1591">It’s really -- it -- it’s -- it’s -- it been -- wherever it’s been, it’s been very well received.</span> <span id="s1592">It’s been twice already to Santa Barbara.</span> <span id="s1593">And -- So it’s opening up on February seventh, in -- with a reception and her being there, at Abington Friends, in Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: It’s a school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: School.</span> <span id="s1596">It’s a Quaker school.</span> <span id="s1597">And then it’s going to another Quaker school, at the Sidwell school or Sidewell.</span> <span id="s1598">I don’t know, Sidwell, in Washington, DC.</span> <span id="s1599">And that’s opening up, I think, for April fifth.</span> <span id="s1600">So, I’m very, very proud of my kids, of all my kids.</span> <span id="s1601">And the film is -- is incredible what they did with the film.</span> <span id="s1602">They got the si -- not only that, we have Congressman Copps, who lived here.</span> <span id="s1603">I used to come to speak to his classes at UCSB before he became a congressman.</span> <span id="s1604">You may have heard about him.</span> <span id="s1605">Most incredible man and he had the largest class, the largest auditorium on the university, 875 students.</span> <span id="s1606">And I would come twice to speak.</span> <span id="s1607">And he was so wonderful to me, he -- I had -- came down with breast cancer and the day after I was operated, he called me and he gave me the schedule when I’m going to be doing it.</span> <span id="s1608">I said, “Oh, Dr. Copps,” I says, “I can’t even walk across the --” “You’ll be here,” and sure enough.</span> <span id="s1609">So unfortunately, he became [indecipherable] he -- one -- first one time and he lost, the second time he won.</span> <span id="s1610">Two years into his term, at Dallas Airport, he had a heart attack and he died.</span> <span id="s1611">So his wife runned for his ticket and she got in and this, now -- she got in on her own, Lois Copps.</span> <span id="s1612">And he speaks about me in the film.</span> <span id="s1613">So they -- they filmed him like a couple of weeks before he died, the filmmakers.</span> <span id="s1614">It’s just a -- so she wants this film.</span> <span id="s1615">This is her wish, to show it at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and invite the congress to see it, because he was really loved.</span> <span id="s1616">He was an incredible man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: This is the same film you’ve discussed before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Thank you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: In Danish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: And the filmmakers are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Laura Bialis, Sara Levy and Broderick Fox.</span> <span id="s1625">But Laura Bialis is really -- she raised the money, she did everything.</span> <span id="s1626">And now she’s entering it into film festivals and it -- there is going to be an opening, I think, in LA, I don’t know, in February, Stamford alumnis are going to have it.</span> <span id="s1627">But, it’s entered now into various film festivals and because it’s entered in film festivals, you can’t give it out too much, because there’s a film festival here and they are not sure they are going to take it, because it’s already played.</span> <span id="s1628">It’s just -- so, for her, she’s -- she’s holding onto it for dear life and every day we get calls, please can we see it.</span> <span id="s1629">Because people couldn’t get tickets.</span> <span id="s1630">It was sold out in one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: How does that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: Makes me feel -- I don’t want to say it makes me feel good, it makes me help to fulfill my mission of tell the story, that I promised.</span> <span id="s1633">We all -- especially the last two weeks.</span> <span id="s1634">We promised each other that if we survived, we wouldn’t forget each other, that we will remember each other.</span> <span id="s1635">That we will tell the world what happened.</span> <span id="s1636">To see that this doesn’t happen again.</span> <span id="s1637">And it’s still happening and it -- it’s -- it’s very -- I’m very devastated when I read what’s happening in Algeria, how many people daily get slaughtered.</span> <span id="s1638">And it’s -- a lot of it has to do with just religious hatred now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Q: When you say we tell each other, do you mean your sister or do you mean something more general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">A: That -- That -- When we -- that -- the people used to say that we have to tell -- whoever survives has to tell the world what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A: And because they are not here, I have -- I feel my mission is -- and I’m -- I’m going to be 70 when the paintings open -- it’s so happen it’s opening up -- is -- how long do I have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q: [indecipherable] opening on your birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A: That’s when the fil -- the paintings are opening, Mina’s art painting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: I-In Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Philadelphia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: How wonderful.</span> <span id="s1648">And that’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: On February seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: So you know, it’s all -- to me, I want -- before I go out of this world, I want to leave this world a better world.</span> <span id="s1652">I can’t say about the world, but my community and where I live.</span> <span id="s1653">And it’s -- and through my children, and hopefully my grandchildren, that this doesn’t happen, doesn’t occur.</span> <span id="s1654">That we can live side by side and respect the differences and because we’re all made in the same image of God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">Q: Yeah, that’s interesting that there’s so much religious hatred right now --</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: -- i-in -- in this country, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: It’s all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: In this country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: It -- It really is, and it scares me.</span> <span id="s1661">The fundamentalist groups are scaring me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q: You know what scares me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A: Because their tunnel vision, they can only see thems -- what they are -- is -- they don’t care about anybody el -- and what is happening with the abortionist group -- with the anti-abortionists, is -- is the right to life or is -- they only see from conception to birth.</span> <span id="s1664">Afterwards, they don’t care what happens to them.</span> <span id="s1665">They don’t.</span> <span id="s1666">I mean, there’s so many -- so much suffering and hunger and -- and squalor people leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: And yet, you say you weren’t connected with the Feminist movement, but that’s very much about women’s rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: Well, I -- yeah, in that sense, I am.</span> <span id="s1669">I’m not the one if I -- to, you know, to have -- to be -- in the beginning -- I think the -- the Feminist movement got such a bum rap is that they didn’t want men to open up doors, you know, and this kind nitty gritty.</span> <span id="s1670">I -- I don’t mind if man opens up the doors or, you know, or -- or picks -- or takes my bundle and -- wh -- I don’t need it.</span> <span id="s1671">To me, the most important thing is that we get equal pay and that we have a right to our own body.</span> <span id="s1672">It’s very important.</span> <span id="s1673">And I think that the biggest difficult because of that is that there are not -- because I am breast cancer and thank God I’m in remission is that there is so little studies done about women, there are more about men, because it’s a man’s world.</span> <span id="s1674">And I think we’re now realizing it, how little it’s been studied about women illnesses.</span> <span id="s1675">It’s been more about men.</span> <span id="s1676">And that -- for that I -- I am, if -- if you call it Feminist, I don’t know, I think it’s just the di-direction I want to go, this country to equality.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q: Equal rights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Equal rights under the law and -- and -- okay.</span> <span id="s1679">Oh, ‘48, that was -- I can tell you, I wasn’t in Denmark.</span> <span id="s1680">I’ll never forget when the state of Israel was created.</span> <span id="s1681">It was just incredible that we had a state.</span> <span id="s1682">In 1947, Israel was partitioned by the UN, to live side by side, that’s what right now is going on, but they want to live side by side.</span> <span id="s1683">21 nations, surrounding Arab nation declared war on Israel and Israel was isolated and fought that war and it so ironically, now we are -- right now, we are fighting -- they want the same thing what happened.</span> <span id="s1684">But look what happened.</span> <span id="s1685">The Arab nation -- the League of Arab Nations, said to all the Arabs, “Flee.</span> <span id="s1686">Leave Israel and go fight against Israel.”</span> <span id="s1687">And Israel said, Ben-Gurion said, “Stay, you will live side by side with us.”</span> <span id="s1688">But they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1689">So now, it’s happening, the Intifada -- I spoke to -- when I was in Israel, to a couple of young people, soldiers.</span> <span id="s1690">The worst part is to be sent into the area, to the occupied area, because children, they are fighting and children throw stones and stones kill.</span> <span id="s1691">So it’s not a real war, but it’s there and I think that the only way that it’s going to be -- peace will come, is if Yasser Arafat outlaws Hamas and all the rhetoric of hatred and then Israel does the same thing of hatred against, but -- but Israel don’t go and blow buses up with children.</span> <span id="s1692">They may use harsh words, but they don’t blow up buses with children -- with innocent children.</span> <span id="s1693">Hamas and the Palestinians have -- I don’t [indecipherable] say the Palestinians, they’ve been blowing up -- how do you negotiate peace with a suicide bomber?</span> <span id="s1694">You can’t.</span> <span id="s1695">You can -- you can do it with a leader, but a suicide bomber only knows one thing.</span> <span id="s1696">He’s going to kill themselves, because he’s going to go to heaven and blows up, yeah.</span> <span id="s1697">It’s wrong for Israel to blow up houses, too, if they find that they have been members of Hamas or something.</span> <span id="s1698">It’s wrong in both side.</span> <span id="s1699">But still, I think that the most difficult thing that I think is happening is, that if -- that nothing is going to happen until this hatred -- you don’t have to love each other, but you have to be able to tolerate each other, to live side by side.</span> <span id="s1700">But if you’re going to have nothing but hatred, it’s not going to happen.</span> <span id="s1701">I don’t know, what do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q: Now, we’ve taken a break, but I -- I just happened to mention to you about the child -- you told me about a child survivor’s group, are you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A: Yeah, there is an international children -- child survivor’s group.</span> <span id="s1704">For years, I -- when I would say to my sister, you know, this and this, she says, “No, it didn’t happen.”</span> <span id="s1705">I said, “What do you mean it didn’t happen?”</span> <span id="s1706">Then she would say, “How do you remember, you were only a child.”</span> <span id="s1707">And it used to bother me all the time, she would come out with that.</span> <span id="s1708">And, so when I heard that there was a child survivor’s group, the one -- and it -- from all the places, it was one near here, in Oxnard, we went and the energy of those people was incredible.</span> <span id="s1709">Is somebody here?</span> <span id="s1710">Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">Q: Yeah, he’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s1713">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s1714">Most of them, physicians, attorneys, you know, higher education.</span> <span id="s1715">The most wonderful group of people.</span> <span id="s1716">So I’ve been going this wee -- past -- and this -- in September I went to Washington, they had a conference.</span> <span id="s1717">The next one is in Prague.</span> <span id="s1718">Oh, I would -- never been to -- I’ve always want to go to Prague.</span> <span id="s1719">So, they have a region -- Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: [indecipherable] center, their -- their headquarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">A: Well, it’s very interesting, they just broke off in two groups, so the -- the santa -- the -- there’s none in Santa Barbara, there’s one in LA and I don’t really go there.</span> <span id="s1722">I tell you, to go into LA with the traffic, I hate that traffic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: What is the name?</span> <span id="s1724">I want to tell --</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">A: It’s Child Survivors inter -- Fred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A2: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">A: The -- The child survivor’s group, what is it called, the real name?</span> <span id="s1728">What’s the -- I me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: I’m sorry, you what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: I didn’t talk to -- tell you, I went back in ‘93 with a group called the s -- the Crusaders.</span> <span id="s1731">They’re owned by Buena Vista Film,

account, you know, your dividends, you know.</span> <span id="s1776">They say the reason grandchildren and grandparent get along so beautiful is because they have one -- a common enemy, the parent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: That’s cute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: But we’re very close, they’re wonderful.</span> <span id="s1779">And I going to go and get to see them on my

--</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: Did you say that?</span> <span id="s1783">I mean, I asked [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Well, I keep a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1785">I’ve always kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s1786">I eat out only fish when I go out.</span> <span id="s1787">I -- But my house is strictly kosher.</span> <span id="s1788">I live -- unfortunately in Santa Barbara where I live, it does not have any kosher butcher.</span> <span id="s1789">I have to go to Los Angeles to get my -- my chicken and we don’t eat meat much, but my chicken and whatever kosher things I have.</span> <span id="s1790">When I first came here to Santa Barbara they had absolutely nothing and I went to Vons, who is our supermarket and this and I started getting in -- they started getting in some frozen chickens and some other products and now they have quite a bit.</span> <span id="s1791">Also bagels.</span> <span id="s1792">There were only one bagel place, it was horrible bagel.</span> <span id="s1793">Now, we have so many bagel places.</span> <span id="s1794">But we -- I am so lucky that I live here in Santa Barbara, it’s paradise, it’s wonderful.</span> <span id="s1795">And I am -- I am on eight boards.</span> <span id="s1796">I am on the hello board.</span> <span id="s1797">I am -- was asked to be trustee on the most wonderful, wonderful things -- Santa Barbara Jewish Community Foundation, where we help people -- Jews.</span> <span id="s1798">And we help people, we send kids to camps, various camps of their choice.</span> <span id="s1799">And I’m sort of their idea person, but [indecipherable] to.</span> <span id="s1800">And I’m program chairman for Haddassah and let me see, what else?</span> <span id="s1801">Oh, I don’t know, I’m just in -- in the community, I’m very involved and my big things is that I do go out and speak a lot and it takes a lot out of me.</span> <span id="s1802">And I’m -- built the preschool here with -- started with six children.</span> <span id="s1803">When I left and retired, there were 60 children on the waiting list.</span> <span id="s1804">So, they -- hopefully they’re going to build and add a bigger place so they have more room.</span> <span id="s1805">And I’m very, very involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: I know there are lots of other thoughts you have --</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">Q: -- but you’re just going to be keeping --</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">A: After you leave I’ll remember I didn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Is it painful, do you think, to tell your story, or telling the story more of a -- you say healing will never be complete, but is it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: I think the story is -- helps me in a sense that I can get the message out and that I feel that maybe there will be somebody listening.</span> <span id="s1814">The biggest thing I had last year, was I spoke at a large Catholic high school, in one of the largest here, real, real big one.</span> <span id="s1815">And it was 11th graders.</span> <span id="s1816">And I was going out to my car in the parking lot and this young man, he looked like a man, you know, the 11th grade, tall guy.</span> <span id="s1817">He said, “Mrs. Meisel, I want really to thank you for coming to my school.</span> <span id="s1818">I was going to join a group -- I don’t know, they hate Latinos, they hate Jews, they hate Blacks and they call themselves skinheads, I don’t know if they are skinheads, but after I heard you today, I’m not going to join.”</span> <span id="s1819">And if I saved one life, I’ve saved the world.</span> <span id="s1820">And that’s -- to me, is very important.</span> <span id="s1821">So those are the treasures that I treasure when I go out.</span> <span id="s1822">Be-Believe me, it’s not easy.</span> <span id="s1823">So -- and the deniers are out there, saying that this never happened and you can’t debate them, cause it’s not debatable.</span> <span id="s1824">It’s the same people who would say that there was never slavery here in this country and it’s the same people who hate everyone, it’s just full of hatred.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">End of Tape Three, Side B</span></p>
