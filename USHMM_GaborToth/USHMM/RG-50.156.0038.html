Cowling, who was the president at that time, and then I was married to Jane Paetzold of St. Paul, who lived about three blocks from me all during my growing up period.</span> <span id="s12">Her father was secretary-treasurer of the Great Northern Railroad.</span> <span id="s13">We were married on June 21, 1940, and about a year and a half later we had a child, while I was teaching at Carleton, and the war was on, and I was deferred and life was a little too inactive being in the backwaters of Northfield, Minnesota, and so because of the people I had gotten to know at Harvard and in Washington when I went there before, I was asked to take a job as a desk Officer in the Latin American -- they called it a Division at that time -- in the State Department.</span> <span id="s14">So we went down there and spent about seven months, but I still, you know, sitting behind the desk, was too inactive, so I asked my draft board to induct me and I was inducted as a private and went off to Camp Callan, anti-aircraft training, at first.</span> <span id="s15">I cut my leg climbing a cliff and so was hospitalized, and my unit had shipped out, so I was sent to desert maneuvers in Yuma as a private in the infantry.</span> <span id="s16">Then I went from there with the 80th Infantry Division to England and we were there and then went in to Normandy about, I think, 30 days after the initial invasion.</span> <span id="s17">But they were still holed up in the peninsula of Normandy.</span> <span id="s18">We started racing across France with Patton, and finally, as you know, ran out of gas and couldn’t go any further, and finally were halted by the Moselle River in eastern France.</span> <span id="s19">Then we were there for a while, a couple of months, and couldn’t move until people caught up with us.</span> <span id="s20">And then came the Battle of the Bulge in early 1945, up in Luxemburg, and we were alerted and went up on a 24-hour march, and were out in front of Luxemburg City and -- the 80th is part of the Third Army still -- we finally broke through there and got across the Rhine and went up to Kassel in Germany and then went east to meet the Russians in Czechoslovakia, and from there we were told that we couldn’t go into Prague because that had been agreed was Russian area, and so we swung south toward the National Redoubt area, toward Austria.</span> <span id="s21">And Austria, we had heard from our intelligence -- by this time, I had transferred from being just an infantryman, went to G2 of the division, and then somebody was killed in the counterintelligence corps and they didn’t have time to send back for another body, and so I was put into that, in charge of the counterintelligence corps detachment in the 319th regiment of the 80th infantry division.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Did they also give you a promotion?</span> <span id="s23">You weren’t still a private.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: No, we were allowed to be promoted every thirty days.</span> <span id="s25">You had to be in one rank thirty days.</span> <span id="s26">I went from a private to private first class to corporal.</span> <span id="s27">And then there are four grades of sergeant.</span> <span id="s28">You had to go through each one of those, and I think at the time that I finally got what they called a “battlefield commission,” I got that when I was a tech sergeant.</span> <span id="s29">But my other title was Special Agent in charge of CIC detachment of the 319th regiment of the 80th infantry division of the Third Army.</span> <span id="s30">And we met up with the Russians in Stier on the Uns River in Austria about the end of April, 1945, and pulled back then into a town where the 80th Division had it’s headquarters -- I can’t remember the name now, it may have been Borchdorf, it was in that area -- and we started, as we had to, to clean up the Nazis, and our principal targets were the Gestapo and the Kripo -- the Kriminal Pilitzei -- and the SD, which was the Sichereits Dienst, and stay-behind agents that were members of the Einzatskommandos.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: How did you identify them?</span> <span id="s32">Were they identified for you, were they still in uniform and they hadn’t gone into hiding yet?</span> <span id="s33">How did you know who you were looking for?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Well, we always would set up when we got into a village, a local intelligence net and we’d have names from a master list compiled in higher headquarters, of people in our area that they knew you could contact, that would be good sources of information.</span> <span id="s35">And when we got to a village or a city, we would contact that person or persons, and then expand the net that they had, of people that they knew, and tell them where they could contact us.</span> <span id="s36">It was a pretty effective system.</span> <span id="s37">Even though we were moving fast, we had the names of people ahead of time of places that we were coming to.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So this was sort of an underground network.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s40">Some of them were Communists, and some of the Communists had some of the best information on who the Nazis were, and in fact it was a member of the Communist party who was from Austria, and fought in the Spanish Civil War in the ‘30s against Franco, that led me to the name and whereabouts of Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s41">The name we knew, but we had no information at that point on where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">I had with me Sidney Bruskin, who’s still alive.</span> <span id="s43">He’s living in New Haven, Connecticut.</span> <span id="s44">He went to Yale, but I think he’s just about to retire.</span> <span id="s45">He sold bicycles in New Haven, that was his job, and rented them.</span> <span id="s46">He was, I think, born in Germany, but whether he was born there or not, he knew German.</span> <span id="s47">He was my interpreter.</span> <span id="s48">And he and I would go into a lot of these towns in a jeep together.</span> <span id="s49">And he and I started off going south toward the National Redoubt area about May 4 or 5.</span> <span id="s50">And we came into the town of Gmunden, which was along Gmunden “See” -- lake -- and there we arrested Oberts Grupenleider, who was the Nazi party leader for the city or town of Gmunden.</span> <span id="s51">And we got information from our local liaison there that our Gauleiter and a member of Hitler’s leadership group, the labor leader, Robert Ley, who was one of the major Nazi criminals -- he was at the Nuremberg trial, too -- that he had gone south and had gone to the village, I think it was a day before we got there.</span> <span id="s52">And so we started out in hot pursuit of him, and we got to the town of Bad Ischl, which had the summer home of the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, and had also been the home of Franz Lehar who, as you know, has written many famous musicals, The Merry Widow, Land of Smiles, and a lot of others.</span> <span id="s53">And there we got in touch again with our local information man, and his name was Zeb Pleisseis.</span> <span id="s54">And he was the one, he was this Communist that had fought in the Spanish Civil War, the man that said he had information that Kaltenbrunner had gone to Strobl, a little town west of Bad Ischl, about 14 kilometers.</span> <span id="s55">So I radioed and got permission to move out, because it was out of our division area, and follow the lead, and they gave me a car, and one of the relatives of the Hapsburgs was along.</span> <span id="s56">I don’t know how he got mixed up in it, but it was the first and last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s57">We went west to the town of Strobl and we had to thread our way through the Nazi SS Panzer division headed by General Zeb Dietrich, who was a famous Nazi general during that period.</span> <span id="s58">They were retreating in front of the Russians and they didn’t care about us, they wanted to get out of the way of the Russians.</span> <span id="s59">They would have their heads cut off if they got caught</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: You mean literally or figuratively?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s62">They’d probably shoot them with a pistol.</span> <span id="s63">But we got to the town of Strobl and contacted the Nazi burgomeister.</span> <span id="s64">He was frightened and he was trembling and he was caught.</span> <span id="s65">I asked him where Kaltenbrunner was and he said he’s in a villa outside of the town.</span> <span id="s66">I asked him if he would show it to me and he said, “I’ll come part way, I’ll point it out to you, and then I’ll leave.’</span> <span id="s67">So he did, and we went up to this villa that had a driveway up, but the road was blocked, and there was a wall around, a small garden wall, not a high wall.</span> <span id="s68">And I walked up to the door, the entrance to the villa.</span> <span id="s69">As I walked up, people came out of the woods, and I assumed that they were security people.</span> <span id="s70">It was the first indication that this lead was really true, that it was a good lead, because they wouldn’t have this just around for anybody.</span> <span id="s71">They came up behind me, but they didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s72">And I knocked on the door and a large blonde lady who was about 38 came to the door, and I said I wanted to come in and talk to her.</span> <span id="s73">She said I couldn’t come in.</span> <span id="s74">And I said, “Is General Kaltenbrunner here?’</span> <span id="s75">and she said, “No he isn’t here now.</span> <span id="s76">He was here.’</span> <span id="s77">And I said, “Who are you?’</span> <span id="s78">and she said, “I’m his wife.’</span> <span id="s79">So I went inside and she ran upstairs, and I didn’t know what she was going to do, but I looked around the living room and I saw for the first time a photograph of this man --nobody had a photograph of him -- General Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s80">I took the photograph, and she came down and I said, “You’re under arrest, and you’ll have to come with me.”</span> <span id="s81">She said, “I have three small children.’</span> <span id="s82">And I said, “ Well you’ll have to leave them with your hausfrau, because we need to interrogate you back at division headquarters.”</span> <span id="s83">And so she came along, and as we walked down to the car, these security people came up around me and they said, “ We are the Dienstellar Kaltenbrunner, but we have just been ordered by General Eisenhower to cease our resistance and turn over our weapons to the Americans.’</span> <span id="s84">They said they weren’t going to put up any resistance.</span> <span id="s85">The war, in effect was coming to an end.</span> <span id="s86">So I took her back to division headquarters and as I went back through Bad Ischl I saw this man Zeb Pleisseis again and he said he’d had later information that Kaltenbrunner had left Strobl a couple of days before, and had gone up into the little town of Alt Aussee, Austria, which is up in the mountains, and part of the National Redoubt area.</span> <span id="s87">It was the place where -- rather than Berchtesgaden, we found out later -- Hitler wanted to come and to have his headquarters, and they were going to have sort of a Wagnerian last stand in the mountains, with rockets shooting down like in a Wagner opera, and the whole place was going to go up in flames.</span> <span id="s88">So I got permission from the division to follow the lead again with Sidney Bruskin, the interpreter, and we set off the next morning.</span> <span id="s89">But in the meantime we had learned from a message that had come into division headquarters that most of the great art treasures of Europe were in a salt mine outside of Alt Aussee.</span> <span id="s90">And so the division commander assigned a man who was a military government officer to go up with, I think, it was a couple of companies of soldiers to safeguard the art treasures so that they wouldn’t be blown up.</span> <span id="s91">And we were to meet them in Badhauszee, which was a little town below Alt Aussee, about 4 kilometers, that next day.</span> <span id="s92">And so we took off, Sid and I, in a jeep, at 4 o’clock in the morning, and climbed up this mountain road into the town of Alt Aussee.</span> <span id="s93">We didn’t see the Americans anywhere.</span> <span id="s94">And when we got in there, as we came into this village, on the street -- they had a haupstrasse, main street, that ran at sort of an angle around the lake -- the mountains were all up here, the lake was there, and it was beautiful, it was a beautiful setting.</span> <span id="s95">And the first man, by accident, that we ran into, who was out for his morning walk and inspecting one of his buildings was Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe Schoenfurst, whose grandfather had been the chancellor of Germany in the 1890s.</span> <span id="s96">And this was his hunting lodge, that this Prince Chlodwig, the grandson, had taken over.</span> <span id="s97">And in the hunting lodge, one of the outbuildings of the lodge, as we found a couple of days after we’d been there, was the mistress of Kaltenbrunner, Countess Gisela von Westaur, who had given birth to twins March 15, 1945, just a month and a half before we got there, named Ursula and Wolfgang, in what used to be the south building, a cowshed.</span> <span id="s98">She had told people that her children by Kaltenbrunner were born in a cowshed, and she was very proud of that.</span> <span id="s99">And with her, there were two other women.</span> <span id="s100">One was Uris Scheidler, whose husband was the adjutant to Kaltenbrunner, and another named Mitze Dumm, who had a store in Vienna.</span> <span id="s101">They were coming out of Vienna, had come up to the mountains where the last stand was going to be made, because they all had these Nazi connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">I asked Prince Hohenlohe if there were a place to stay there, and he said, “ Well, I own a lot of these buildings, and I have an interest in the hotel which is right next to where I live, and I’ll see that you can have a room there.”</span> <span id="s103">So we got a room in this hotel and then started to contact the people who were known to be the resistance people, and the deputy burgomeister was one of them.</span> <span id="s104">And after we’d been there three or four days, I got word through the deputy burgomeister that Kaltenbrunner, he wasn’t there, that he had gone up near the Bodensee Hute, which was a cabin on top of the Todesgeberg mountains, which are the mountains surrounding the lake.</span> <span id="s105">And so I got permission again to go up.</span> <span id="s106">But I had to contact this officer who was in command of the area who’d been sent down to take charge of the Nazi art loot in the salt mine.</span> <span id="s107">He was a man who wanted me to tell him everything, and I knew that if I told him everything, our plan to get Kaltenbrunner might be blown, so I didn’t tell him everything.</span> <span id="s108">.</span> <span id="s109">He said he was responsible for the security of all American personnel in this area, because he was the commanding officer by direction of Horace McBride, who was commanding general of the 80th Infantry, so I said, “you’re in command, I know.</span> <span id="s110">You have a responsibility for our security.</span> <span id="s111">But I have a mission that is different from yours, and I’ll make a compromise with you.”</span> <span id="s112">He wanted to send, if I went off up the mountain, a squad of soldiers to provide fire support in case we ran into anybody that was going to fire on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Whose soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: A squad of our soldiers would be sent up.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: Because it struck me that you were dealing with a lot of Germans here, in German territory, where the war was not over yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: And so we started off that night.</span> <span id="s117">Because of the contact with the deputy burgomeister and because the information leaked like a sieve, the word got around this little village fast enough that we were there and what we were there for, that we were looking for SS General Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s118">So into our office, before we took off, came the mistress of Kaltenbrunner by whom these twins were born, and she wanted to know what we knew, and we wanted to know what she knew.</span> <span id="s119">All she would say was that Kaltenbrunner was here in the cowshed.</span> <span id="s120">Really, it was no longer a cowshed, it was converted into s very nice little bungalow.</span> <span id="s121">And the wife of the adjutant, Uri Scheidler, came in with her.</span> <span id="s122">She said, “ If you’re going anywhere I want to go with you to make sure that there’s no firing.</span> <span id="s123">I don’t want my husband to get killed.</span> <span id="s124">And I’m sure you don’t want to get killed.”</span> <span id="s125">She was going to be the intermediary.</span> <span id="s126">And I said, “ No way are either of you going.”</span> <span id="s127">She was about to have a baby and the other one had just produced twins, so I told them neither one were going.</span> <span id="s128">But they wouldn’t give me the information on where he was, so I got together with the local leader of the resistance, and he got four Austrians who came from that village, who knew the mountains and skied through the mountains and hunted in the mountains, knew everybody and knew every part well.</span> <span id="s129">They’d been in the Wehrmacht and two of them had deserted and one of them had been wounded.</span> <span id="s130">One of them had shot himself in the hand so he wouldn’t have to continue to fight for the Germans against the Allies, because they were for the Allies.</span> <span id="s131">And so we met at midnight, or about 11:30 in the home of one of them.</span> <span id="s132">They gave me Austrian clothes.</span> <span id="s133">And the plan was for me, with them, to go ahead of this squad of American soldiers with whom we’d had no contact.</span> <span id="s134">American soldiers were a little leery of this plan, because they didn’t know who these Germans were that were going up.</span> <span id="s135">They knew they’d been in the Wehrmacht, and they thought it might be a trap, and that they’d all get killed, if we went into a trap.</span> <span id="s136">But they finally went along with the understanding that they would stay behind at least two or three hundred yards, and that the five of us, the four Austrians and I, would go up ‘til we got within telescope sight of the cabin.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">And so finally -- it took us from about midnight to about six in the morning, and the sun was beginning to show in the east -- and we got up to a point where we could see the “bildenzee” hut.</span> <span id="s138">There was no smoke coming out of the chimney, and all the shutters were shut, and it looked like it might be a dead lead.</span> <span id="s139">And the idea was for me, when we got up there, to leave the four Austrians about 250 yards down the slope, and to go up and find out who was in there, because I would act as a passer-by.</span> <span id="s140">If I carried a weapon I would attract fire.</span> <span id="s141">And they, with their rifles with telescopic sights, would form a ring about 250 yards down behind large rocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">As I walked toward the cabin I could hear this whistle.</span> <span id="s143">I thought it was a signal, and it was not a signal, it was just a bird, flying through this area, and I felt about as lonely as the bird did.</span> <span id="s144">I got up on the porch and knocked on the door and there wasn’t any response.</span> <span id="s145">It was a cabin that had three rooms, one off to the right with the shutters, and two off to the left, and a woodshed.</span> <span id="s146">It was a single story cabin with a porch in front that was covered.</span> <span id="s147">And there was no response to my knock on the door.</span> <span id="s148">But then I could hear heavy breathing coming through the shutters off to the left of the door and I knew somebody was there.</span> <span id="s149">I went over and knocked on the shutters and somebody got out of bed and came across the room, and they opened the shutters and it was a German that wasn’t Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s150">I had this description of Kaltenbrunner, had his picture, and I knew also from the people that I talked to.</span> <span id="s151">I guess it was the mistress and the wife of the adjutant, that he was six foot three and weighed 220 pounds, was forty-three years old, and he had dueling scars on each side of his face.</span> <span id="s152">This guy didn’t fit that description.</span> <span id="s153">So, I said to him in very American-sounding German, asked him if I could come in.</span> <span id="s154">I was cold.</span> <span id="s155">I said the transportation’s been knocked out, and I was going from one valley to the other.</span> <span id="s156">I don’t know what he thought, but he said, “You can’t come in.”</span> <span id="s157">So then I took out of my pocket a note that I’d gotten from the mistress.</span> <span id="s158">She said, “ If you come across Kaltenbrunner, hand this note to him, and it’ll identify you, and I’ll show him that you’ve been in contact with me, and it’s a plea for him to come down with the bearer of this note.”</span> <span id="s159">Because we were right then on the dividing line between the Russian zone and the American zone, and she didn’t want him to fall into the hands of the Russians, if he got caught, because they thought it would be the end of him right away.</span> <span id="s160">So he took this note, and it took him, it seemed, like an hour to read it, but it was just a couple of minutes.</span> <span id="s161">He was thinking as he was reading it.</span> <span id="s162">Then he looked down over my shoulder and I looked around and these four Austrians with rifles came out behind the rocks.</span> <span id="s163">When he saw them, he walked across the room to get a revolver out of the trousers that were hanging beside the bed.</span> <span id="s164">When I saw the revolver I got off the porch and went over to the blind side of the cabin, and he slammed the shutters shut, and then when the Austrians saw this, they gave a signal to the American squad that was further down, and they came up.</span> <span id="s165">They all joined in a semi-circle around the cabin -- the back of it was against a rock, there wasn’t any way out of the rear -- and after ten minutes of calling for them to come out, and no response -- they opened the door once, and they looked at what they were facing, and they went back in -- we went up on the porch and started knocking down the door.</span> <span id="s166">Four men came out with their hands over their heads, and one of them we could see right away was Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s167">But he was dressed, not in an SS general uniform, he was dressed in the medical doctor’s uniform of the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s168">He had the scars and he was six foot three and there was no mistaking who he was, but we didn’t let him know that we knew who he was.</span> <span id="s169">And with him was his adjutant and two SS guards.</span> <span id="s170">One of them was the driver of his car, as we found out later.</span> <span id="s171">We put them in one room, and I started to search the other two rooms.</span> <span id="s172">In the ash receptacle of the stove, I found Gestapo badge number 2, and the Kripo badge number 2.</span> <span id="s173">One was silver and one was bronze, Himmler had had number 1, in each case, but his were destroyed by him, so these were the highest Gestapo and Kripo badges in existence.</span> <span id="s174">And in the same place, I found the last message that Kaltenbrunner had radioed back to Hitler, saying that the headquarters had been set up and that he was in the process of ordering Stuka dive bombers to bomb the concentration camps and wipe them off the face of the earth, so that the Allies, when they came in, would find no evidence of what they all knew they’d done.</span> <span id="s175">So we packed all of this stuff into knapsacks on their backs, and started down into the village.</span> <span id="s176">We got down to the village at 11:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s177">And the first person that we ran into again was Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe, who was out in the street behind his building.</span> <span id="s178">And he stopped and he said, “I see you’ve got your man.”</span> <span id="s179">And I said, “ Which one is he?”</span> <span id="s180">He knew who he was, he pointed to him.</span> <span id="s181">Because his mistress was in one of Hohenlohe’s buildings, he, Kaltenbrunner had been there too.</span> <span id="s182">So then a crowd began to gather, and about two hours later after that, the deputy commanding general of the division arrived, my boss, Captain Thomas McMillan, came in, and we interrogated Kaltenbrunner and sent him back to Third Army headquarters in Bad Tos, which is south of Munich.</span> <span id="s183">Kaltenbrunner was held there, and then sent to 12th Army Group Headquarters, and then he and only he was sent over to Camp 0-2-0 interrogation center near Richmond, northeast of London.</span> <span id="s184">And Trevor Roper, who’s written a book called The Last Days of Hitler, was one of the ones that.</span> <span id="s185">along with another man who’s at Oxford University now, took him to Camp 0-2-0 and they did part of the interrogation.</span> <span id="s186">And as I learned from different sources, Kaltenbrunner was put under a hot spotlight with no clothes on and very little food and water, and they tried to force out of him confessions as to what he did.</span> <span id="s187">But he said his main area of responsibility was intelligence, it wasn’t Gestapo.</span> <span id="s188">It wasn’t the Kripo, it wasn’t the concentration camps it wasn’t the Einzatskommandos, the extermination squads.</span> <span id="s189">Purely intelligence.</span> <span id="s190">He then told about how he wanted to turn over his Intelligence Service and the net to the Allies in this final war against the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s191">Kaltenbrunner then went to a collecting point in Luxemburg and sometime in the fall, September or October of 1945, he was taken to Nuremberg for the Nuremberg Trial which was going to commence.</span> <span id="s192">I think it was on November 16.</span> <span id="s193">In the meantime, after I’d stayed there a month, after Kaltenbrunner had left, I had arrested 150 people.</span> <span id="s194">It was an amazing collection of people, the puppet governors of states to the east, and “kreisleuters,’ and four gauleiters who had their summer homes in this area, a lot of people from Vienna, a lot of artists, a lot of musicians --they all gathered in this little town of Alt Aussee.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">I was then sent to southern Germany to be in charge.</span> <span id="s196">In the meantime I was given the Silver Star for this, and was given a battlefield commission.</span> <span id="s197">But then, because I had found Kaltenbrunner and had known more about him by the time I got through than others had, they sent me to the Nuremberg Trial.</span> <span id="s198">And I went there in early November, I think it was, and I worked with Whitney Harris, who was in charge of the Kaltenbrunner case, but I was also put in charge of personnel and CIC security.</span> <span id="s199">This meant having responsibility for the security of the judges and the prosecutors, and the persons of high rank -- visitors -- who came to witness the trials.</span> <span id="s200">The security was lousy, because the Nazis were in the catacombs underneath Nuremberg, and they’d come out at night and shoot at cars.</span> <span id="s201">One night -- there was only one hotel that was left standing, and I set up a headquarters in there, and I had a room there -- one night as I was standing in the lobby of the hotel, a Russian came in, a Russian lieutenant.</span> <span id="s202">He’d been shot and he fell at my feet in a pool of blood, and I was ordered out by the Soviet general who was there, who commanded the Russian troops, to explain why security was so bad.</span> <span id="s203">And I told him -- I went out to his villa to see him -- I told him there was no way of making the place secure at night, or even during the daytime, because these people were hidden out in the catacombs that went for miles in all directions at different levels under Nuremberg, no way of knowing where they were, and you didn’t have the personnel or the time to root them all out.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: This is six, seven months after the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s206">They were there.</span> <span id="s207">There were stay-behind bombs that were left, that were timed to go off much later.</span> <span id="s208">So he said -- well, just then out in the driveway, a car backfired, and it sounded like a shot, and some of the Russians standing on this ground floor of this villa, where the Russian general was staying, jumped out of the windows, they thought the place was being attacked -- but then he called up Moscow from there, and they sent a division down from Berlin to provide the Russian personnel with security.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">I stayed on at the Nuremberg trial -- I had enough points by this time to go home -- and Kaltenbrunner had a cerebral hemorrhage, and he was sent to the hospital and he wasn’t there on the opening day of the trial.</span> <span id="s210">He came back into the trial in December, I think it was December 10, and I went up to talk to him, and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s211">He didn’t care about his wife or his children by his wife, but he cared about his mistress, where was she, and how were those two children that had been born to her by him.</span> <span id="s212">I said, “ A note has been given to me to give to you from her, telling you that she’s all right.”</span> <span id="s213">And I was about to hand it to him when the defense counsel for Nuremberg intercepted it, and I told him I couldn’t hand it to him, he had to see it.</span> <span id="s214">He was talking to a man named Daniel DeLuce who was an AP correspondent, and so there was a write up about that note being handed to him, that appeared, I think, in the American press.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">But then I had enough points to go home, Kaltenbrunner was in the dock, the thing recessed for Christmas, and I came back in January of 1946.</span> <span id="s216">Came back to be discharged and get together with my family in St. Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Now, I’ve done research, and you know who Kaltenbrunner is, but for the tape, will you tell us who Ernest Kaltenbrunner was?</span> <span id="s218">Why he was important for you to find?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: I should have mentioned that earlier.</span> <span id="s220">Kaltenbrunner was born in Austria.</span> <span id="s221">He went to school there.</span> <span id="s222">His father was a lawyer, a prominent lawyer in the Linz area of Austria.</span> <span id="s223">He went to the University of Graz.</span> <span id="s224">As many people did who were students in those days, he joined the dueling society, which became a forerunner of the Nazi groups in these universities.</span> <span id="s225">And he was known as a great swordsman.</span> <span id="s226">That’s where he’d gotten his scars from dueling.</span> <span id="s227">He then, in 1933 -- I forget the date but it must have been around 1933 -- he became a member of the Nazi party.</span> <span id="s228">He then became connected with the Austrian Sicher Hiedienst.</span> <span id="s229">At the time of the Anschluss, Hitler came to Linz -- and he liked Linz better, he hated Vienna -- and he wanted to make Linz the capitol, to make Linz a big art center.</span> <span id="s230">I don’t know if he wanted it to be the capitol for the greater Germany, or just for the Austrian part of it.</span> <span id="s231">Kaltenbrunner had impressed the Nazis by the ruthlessness with which he carried out the security service function, so he was made the “little Himmler” of Austria.</span> <span id="s232">At first, he had that position for just Austria.</span> <span id="s233">In 1942, Reinhart Heydrich, who’d been in charge for Himmler of the Reich’s Zicherheitzhauptdam, which was the Reich’s main security office -- the Reich’s main security office was the underpinning for the Nazi system, it had the Gestapo in it, the secret police, it had the criminal police, it had the internal intelligence service and the external, like our CIA and OSS -- it was all combined in this one office and it also had a responsibility for assigning people to the concentration camps, but not for running the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s234">Kaltenbrunner’s signature had to appear on all of these orders that assigned people to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s235">Kaltenbrunner then, with the assassination of Heydrich, wasn’t immediately brought up from Vienna, but six months later, in January, 1943, he became the head of the Reich’s Zicherheitzhauptdam.</span> <span id="s236">And he did his job again with great thoroughness, and at the time of the attempt on Hitler’s life in July, 1944, Kaltenbrunner was assigned, as he would have been, to finding out who the people were behind the attempt on Hitler’s life.</span> <span id="s237">He did this again with great thoroughness, and at the end, in the last three or four months of 1945, when Goering was in the south, out of favor with Hitler, when Himmler was out of favor in the north, Kaltenbrunner was the guy who was the closest, along with Bormann and Goebbels, closest to Hitler.</span> <span id="s238">And it was Kaltenbrunner that Hitler then told to go down and prepare the headquarters in the National Redoubt area, where the last stand was going to be made.</span> <span id="s239">And that’s why he went south to this area in Austria.</span> <span id="s240">They both were Austrians.</span> <span id="s241">They were born in Austria, Hitler in Braunau, and Kaltenbrunner forty kilometers to the east and south of that.</span> <span id="s242">This was another factor which caused Hitler to be close to Kaltenbrunner, because they both came from the same area, came from the same country, Austria.</span> <span id="s243">And he liked the way that Kaltenbrunner performed his duties.</span> <span id="s244">The Reich’s Zicherheitzhauptdam had an organization chart -- it actually came under Himmler -- but when Himmler fell out of favor and was sent off to command a division on the eastern front, Kaltenbrunner had more and more direct contact with Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: You also said that he was responsible in large part for implementing the “final solution,” so-called.</span> <span id="s246">Adolf Eichmann was one of his protégés.</span> <span id="s247">.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Exactly.</span> <span id="s249">I should have mentioned that, and that’s an important part of the story.</span> <span id="s250">Eichmann was also living in the Linz area, and had gotten to know Kaltenbrunner during this period when Kaltenbrunner was the “little Himmler” of Austria.</span> <span id="s251">And at the end, Eichmann came down to be with Kaltenbrunner in Alt Aussee, but he came with a lot of gold and a lot of reichsmarks, and a lot of dollars.</span> <span id="s252">At that time, Eichmann’s reputation among the Nazis was, he was known to be the hangman.</span> <span id="s253">And Kaltenbrunner, when he saw him appear on his doorstep, in this cowshed in Alt Aussee -- Eichmann came to see him, to see Kaltenbrunner -- the last man in the world that Kaltenbrunner wanted to see at this point was Eichmann, because of all these things that he, under Kaltenbrunner had been responsible for.</span> <span id="s254">So he told him, “Get lost.</span> <span id="s255">Get away from here.</span> <span id="s256">Go off some other place.</span> <span id="s257">I don’t want to see you.</span> <span id="s258">Take your money, take the gold, take the reichsmarks, take the dollars, and go off.”</span> <span id="s259">So Eichmann went up onto the Blau Alm, which is up above where the Nazi art treasures were, stayed there for a few days, and then took off to the north and was picked up later.</span> <span id="s260">But they got mixed up on his name, and they didn’t really know who he was.</span> <span id="s261">He just walked out one day and went up into northern Germany and worked with a forester, and it was later that he went to South America.</span> <span id="s262">But I met his wife there.</span> <span id="s263">She was living in the village there.</span> <span id="s264">And she lived, at first, in one of the buildings that Prince Hohenlohe had.</span> <span id="s265">So when more and more evidence came about Hohenlohe, I arrested him and we sent him off.</span> <span id="s266">They didn’t keep him, I think, more than six months, and he came back.</span> <span id="s267">When I went back for my first visit back to Alt Aussee with my wife in Easter time in 1956, I saw him, and he knew that I’d arrested him.</span> <span id="s268">He wanted to see me, because he wanted my side of what had happened, and I wanted his side.</span> <span id="s269">He invited us in for tea, and we saw him then, and I saw him a couple of times later.</span> <span id="s270">The last time I saw him was in 1960, which was the year that Eichmann was picked up.</span> <span id="s271">In 1956 I was able to go back to Alt Aussee because I was in the disarmament negotiations in London with the Russians.</span> <span id="s272">And in 1960 I was allowed to go back because I’d been down at the Summit meeting in Paris with Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s273">When the U-2 was shot down and the Summit was broken off -- we were in negotiation in Geneva at that time, and the Russians walked out after the U-2 -- I took my family and went back to Alt Aussee.</span> <span id="s274">And who should be there but Prince Chlodwig.</span> <span id="s275">I ran into him walking around the lake, in one of these “inhalariums” -- pine boughs you stand under, and there’s a vapor that’s supposed to come from pine boughs that’s supposed to improve your breathing.</span> <span id="s276">He was there, and he said, “Why are you here?</span> <span id="s277">You must be here because of the Eichmann case.’</span> <span id="s278">I said, “ No, I’m not here, I’m just here with my family because the Summit and the negotiations have broken off.’</span> <span id="s279">And he knew that Frau Eichmann had been living in his building, and that Eichmann had been picked up, I think, by that point.</span> <span id="s280">Frau Eichmann had gone over to be with her husband.</span> <span id="s281">And then she’d come back at one time to Alt Aussee and then went back again.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">But the other part of it was, in addition to Eichmann, the art treasures.</span> <span id="s283">They had all these famous paintings from the art galleries of France and Italy and every place.</span> <span id="s284">And the gauleiter wanted to blow up the art treasures, all of them, and he had dynamite placed in boxes at the entrance to the mine.</span> <span id="s285">But the salt miners who worked in the salt mine, the native Austrians, they didn’t care much about the art treasures, but this is their occupation, so they removed the dynamite, unbeknownst to the gauleiter, and so when the time came to blow it up -- there was a recorded conversation between Kaltenbrunner from the cowshed to Eingruber, who was the gauleiter who wanted to blow them up, he was one of the four gauleiters that were in the Nazi system for Austria, and he had upper Austria -- there was this angry conversation.</span> <span id="s286">Eingruber’s wife was in this town too, and he’d come back at the end of the war to be with her, and then take off into the mountains.</span> <span id="s287">And Kaltenbrunner ordered him not to blow up the art treasures -- not again, because of any love of art -- but because he was dependent upon these people who worked in the salt mine to be the guides to take him up to the cabin that he was going to hide out in.</span> <span id="s288">And it was two of these guides I tried to get, who had guided him up, to guide me up.</span> <span id="s289">They were afraid that if Kaltenbrunner saw them, they would be shot, so they wouldn’t go up, but they got me these four others, who also worked in the salt mine.</span> <span id="s290">I went back for the 40th anniversary in 1985, and I got together with three of the four that had gone up with me, and we had a reunion and a dinner in the Hotel Revive on the shores of Alt Aussee.</span> <span id="s291">That was the tenth time I’d been back to this idyllic, beautiful spot in the Austrian Alps.</span> <span id="s292">It’s like a fairy tale, you know, except for these terrible people that were there at the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: And you had kept in touch with these people and each time you went back you contacted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Oh, there were others there that I’d arrested, who’d been let out, Dr. Wilhelm Hottl, and a lot of others that were back there, and I’d see them and talk to them.</span> <span id="s295">And Austrian television came out one day because one of them had been working under Kaltenbrunner in the intelligence part and had charge of southern Europe.</span> <span id="s296">Dr. Wilhelm Hottl, who’d been a professor of history at the University of Vienna.</span> <span id="s297">And I’d arrested him, too, but he finally was let out.</span> <span id="s298">But he arranged for television to come down that time, and tell the story of the last days of the National Redoubt.</span> <span id="s299">And he would tell the Nazi side, and I would tell the Allied side, and that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s300">This was then shown on Austrian T.V. in a series of programs that they had over a period of six weeks, I think it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: How did you feel about all this?</span> <span id="s302">Did you have any doubts about whether you should be doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Which part?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: That you were being used?</span> <span id="s305">You had been on opposite sides during World War II and now you’re being friends.</span> <span id="s306">Or maybe I’m just looking at it from the vantage point now of having had this controversy over Kurt Waldheim.</span> <span id="s307">Did you have any thoughts about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Oh, I didn’t feel that they were friends, but I felt that I always wanted to see how people on the other side see the other side, from their vantage point.</span> <span id="s309">And I’ve been doing that with the Cubans these last two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: How did you find they looked at what had happened, what they had done, how World War II had progressed?</span> <span id="s311">What were their feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: Well, a lot of them claimed not to know anything, until very late in the game, about concentration camps or the Holocaust or any of that.</span> <span id="s313">They knew after the battle at Stalingrad that they were going to lose the war, and it was just a matter of time.</span> <span id="s314">So a lot of them were preparing their alibis, and some of them were leaving and a lot of them were going to Switzerland, and depositing money there, in Swiss bank accounts.</span> <span id="s315">But it’s like Hohenlohe.</span> <span id="s316">He didn’t have any love for me, because I’d arrested him, and he said he’d been mistreated.</span> <span id="s317">And I didn’t have any love for him, but we were both interested in seeing from the other person’s vantage point how they saw the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: One of the things I think William L. Shirer wrote about Kaltenbrunner was that in December ’44, Himmler issued an order to destroy the gas chambers and stop the killing of the Jews and the other prisoners and Kaltenbrunner just defied the order, and he kept everything running.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: Right.</span> <span id="s320">That’s true.</span> <span id="s321">Himmler, at that time, saw the sands were running out.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: And then we should have for the record that Kaltenbrunner was convicted at Nuremberg and hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: He was one of the eleven, I think, that was hung out of the twenty-one war criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: October 15, 1946.</span> <span id="s325">Let’s back up a bit, and talk about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s326">You must have read about them in Stars and Stripes.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I entered a couple of them at that time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Could you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Yeah, one of them was Ohrdruf, but the one that I really was the first at was outside the village of Ebensee.</span> <span id="s330">It was at the time that we’d left Borchdorf to go south into the National Redoubt after Robert Ley, and we were going from Gmunden to Bad Ischl.</span> <span id="s331">We found, again through the resistance people, that the concentration camp was four kilometers outside of this village.</span> <span id="s332">So we went out there, and it was surrounded by barbed wire and there were guard towers, but as we found out, the guards had all left about six or twelve hours before we got there.</span> <span id="s333">So the inmates were inside and there was a chain and a lock.</span> <span id="s334">We broke the lock and went in.</span> <span id="s335">They took me first to the hospital.</span> <span id="s336">And there on shelves, with rags over them, were huddled bodies that had lice on them, and they put out their hands for food, and we didn’t have any food.</span> <span id="s337">We were just the interpreter and myself.</span> <span id="s338">And then they took me to the crematorium, which was close by, and there I remember the first sight was a room just piled high with bodies, that were stacked.</span> <span id="s339">They couldn’t burn them fast enough.</span> <span id="s340">And out behind the crematorium was a chemical ditch into which they’d throw bodies that they didn’t burn, so that they would decompose.</span> <span id="s341">And I then came out of this, and reported it back, and they sent men down -- I don’t know how many of the military government people -- with supplies for them.</span> <span id="s342">But in 1985 when I went back to the university -- I went to Linz, to find Kaltenbrunner’s son and to find his wife, his real wife -- and when they heard I was there they hung up the telephone and they wouldn’t see me.</span> <span id="s343">His wife was still alive in Linz.</span> <span id="s344">And the son, who was a lawyer in Linz, wouldn’t see me.</span> <span id="s345">But my wife, then, went up to his second floor office in the town of Linz.</span> <span id="s346">We’d found out where he was, and found out that he was there, and she introduced herself to him, and he said, “ My mother has told me never to see your husband.</span> <span id="s347">I won’t see him.”</span> <span id="s348">So I went up anyway, and I walked into the room (laughs) and he said, “ You must be her husband.’</span> <span id="s349">I said, “Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s350">He said, “I’m not supposed to see you.”</span> <span id="s351">And I said, “ Well, we’re just here for a day, and I wanted to ask you some questions.”</span> <span id="s352">He said, well, if it’s just briefly, because he was curious as to what I was there for, so we sat down and talked for about half an hour, and he told me his story, he told me how he’d been back to the hut where I’d found Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s353">And we went down and got in our car, and our car had a flat tire, and he saw it out of the second story window, so he got one of these Austrian yellow cars that go along highways that help motorists.</span> <span id="s354">We went on out through this town where the concentration camp was.</span> <span id="s355">And I took my wife back to show her where it was, and who should be in the corner of this, because it was the 40th anniversary of all of this, but a Czech who was Jewish who’d been an inmate there, and who today, and then, was working in the Library of Congress.</span> <span id="s356">I can’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s357">But I saw him over in the corner of this area that was part of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s358">He had a notepad and a camera, and was taking down notes.</span> <span id="s359">He was the only other person there, so I walked over to him and I said, “ Why do you have an interest in this place?”</span> <span id="s360">and he said, “ I was an inmate here.”</span> <span id="s361">He said, “I was only fifteen years old.”</span> <span id="s362">And he said, ‘ When you came into the hospital, I was one of the ones in that hospital that was there.”</span> <span id="s363">But he said, “The Americans didn’t treat us very well.”</span> <span id="s364">I said, “ What did they do when they came in?</span> <span id="s365">They were supposed to come in, you know, with medicine and food.”</span> <span id="s366">He said, “ They gave us some food, and medics took a look at us, but then we were left here, for I don’t know how many months, and we had to live off of the local supplies, you know, what you could get out of the fields or out of the village.”</span> <span id="s367">He said it was a bad period.</span> <span id="s368">“We all thought, you know, that this was the end of the war and we’d be taken back to our homes and that everything would be fine.”</span> <span id="s369">He said it was six months, I think he said, later that he was allowed to go back to Prague.</span> <span id="s370">And eventually I came to this country, I was working, and I saw him in Washington about two years ago.</span> <span id="s371">We started correspondence after this, and I told him things that I knew, he told me things that he knew.</span> <span id="s372">I haven’t corresponded with him for about six or seven months, but he’s a wonderful guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Then later, I went to Mauthausen, one of the sub-camps of Mauthausen, which was the major Austrian concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: I should know, but I can’t think of the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: It begins with Ei, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s376">The only time I’ve done anything about writing this up is when Allen Dulles, when I was in CIA, and he’d been to Berne in charge of OSS, and trying to negotiate the surrender of the Nazis in northern Italy, and he’d been in touch with Troutner, and Dr. Hottl, this man that I’d arrested, had been in touch with Dulles in Berne.</span> <span id="s377">The only time I was asked to write this up is when I was on the Board of Estimates with the CIA.</span> <span id="s378">He told me to write it up for Studies in Intelligence, which is an internal CIA document.</span> <span id="s379">And in order to get a copy of this, to take it out of the government, I could do it only by leaving my name off as the author, because you weren’t supposed to be known to be in the CIA at that particular time.</span> <span id="s380">But I did write it up for him, and he had his people go over it, and they put notes and it was released within CIA, within the intelligence community.</span> <span id="s381">About the whole capture of Kaltenbrunner.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: What about Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I went back there but that was later, after the war, just to take a look at what it was like.</span> <span id="s384">There’s a picture that I have of Himmler and Kaltenbrunner and the camp commandant, named Zeros.</span> <span id="s385">It was taken in the quarry of the Mauthausen concentration camp, and they had these steps that they made, the inmates carrying marble up these steps, and go down and get another load, down and up, until they dropped.</span> <span id="s386">And it was in the quarry that this picture was taken that I picked up from Heinrich Hofmann, who was Hitler’s photographer, who was at the Nuremberg trial.</span> <span id="s387">He’d been arrested, and he was supposed to be identifying these people in these photographs.</span> <span id="s388">And he gave me that photograph of Kaltenbrunner and Himmler at Mauthausen, in the marble quarry with Zeros.</span> <span id="s389">God, I wish I could remember the name of that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: You still have the picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: It’s on the wall in my study, and framed.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I’d appreciate the opportunity to look at your photo collection.</span> <span id="s393">How do you think this has affected you?</span> <span id="s394">Did it have a bearing on your choice of career, or what you did after the war?</span> <span id="s395">How do you look at people, at human nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Well when the war came to an end, and I had a wife and a child, I could have stayed on in Europe.</span> <span id="s397">They offered me the job of being in charge of counterintelligence corps, for I don’t know how large an area in Germany.</span> <span id="s398">It was a fascinating job, and it was cleaning up, what you hadn’t been doing as you proceeded quickly through, following the military actions.</span> <span id="s399">There was a lot of work to still be done, so I was torn at that point.</span> <span id="s400">But my wife wanted me to come back and not stay over there, so I came back, and the first job that I wanted to get was in what had been the OSS under General Donovan, and if not that, to go into the State Department.</span> <span id="s401">And then, I came back to St. Paul, and a group of promising young people in this city that we’re in, Jimmy Otis, who later was a Supreme Court judge in Minnesota, and Bob Leach, and Karl Rolvaag, and Ted Christensen, the son of a governor, all of whom I had known, wanted me to run for Congress in the fourth district.</span> <span id="s402">So I started to run, but Ed Devitt had been in before me.</span> <span id="s403">I had been very much impressed by Harold Stassen, who was a young governor in Minnesota, and his liberal international policy.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Of course, that’s who was governor in ’37 and ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s406">He was elected in ’38, and stayed through part of his third term, and then left to go with Halsey in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s407">Devitt, who got in the race first, he’d been wounded in the Pacific in the marines, I think, he’d been an assistant attorney general, and he was a Democrat -- did they have Farmer -- Laborites Democrats at that point?</span> <span id="s408">I don’t remember, but if they were, he was both -- but he came from an Irish Catholic working area of the city -- his father was a working man and he was Irish and Catholic and I wasn’t -- and so I knew that he had the natural advantage and that we would split the same vote, and so I told these guys that he had been in first, and he’d pulled out because of the wounds he had, but they got sufficiently healed so he could come back in again, and I bowed out, much to the disappointment of these people who’d been working hard for me.</span> <span id="s409">And I walked into Harold Stassen’s office the next day and said, “ I’d like to work for you.”</span> <span id="s410">He said, “ Give me the names of five people that you know that I know and come back tomorrow and I’ll tell you if you can.”</span> <span id="s411">And I came back and gave him some of these names like Ted Christensen and Jimmy Otis and some of the others, and he said, ‘ You’ll be able to work for me.</span> <span id="s412">What do you want to do?’</span> <span id="s413">I said that I wanted to be on the operating side.</span> <span id="s414">He said, “There are two jobs.</span> <span id="s415">One is to be the head of research staff and the other is to be on the operating side.”</span> <span id="s416">And I said I’d been in research too much at Harvard College and I wanted to get away more into the field of action.</span> <span id="s417">He said, ‘ Well, go down to Chicago and spend a month there and travel the length and breadth of Tribune-Land, which is very conservative, and see what they think of me and my candidacy for president.”</span> <span id="s418">So I did, and I came back and told him they were all against him, and I talked to everybody.</span> <span id="s419">He eventually made me the head of his research staff and then I went with him, through that, to the University of Pennsylvania, and then down to Washington.</span> <span id="s420">Then he was forced out of the government, really by a combination of Dulles, Clifford and Strauss.</span> <span id="s421">He wanted me to go with him to Pennsylvania, but I had five children by then, and there wasn’t any certain job, and Sherman Adams asked me to stay on with him in the White House.</span> <span id="s422">Then Adams got forced out and then Allen Dulles asked me to go with him.</span> <span id="s423">Then Allen Dulles got forced out because of the Bay of Pigs, and John McClure came down when Kennedy came in, and McClure asked me to be the Director of his Arms Control Policy staff and he left after eight months, and so I had a succession of bosses there that were very short-lived.</span> <span id="s424">Foster took over and I had to choose between CIA and being on the Board of Estimates, which is more like being a professor at the university.</span> <span id="s425">I chose more the action thing, and became director of the program planning staff and the research council, two good titles.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: I had asked you if, as a young man, seeing these concentration camps and tracking down some of these Nazis, did you do any philosophical thinking about it?</span> <span id="s427">You must have had some feelings about what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: I didn’t know what had happened really, until my trip to Europe in 1937, my first trip after I’d graduated.</span> <span id="s429">All I knew was what I really read in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s430">I’ll never forget going to Germany at that time and seeing how the trains were running on time and the buses, and all of this, you know, and it impressed me favorably, as Hitler was really putting the country back on it’s feet.</span> <span id="s431">Then I went from there to Prague, where there was a Czech named Ferdinand Hitek, who was in my class at Carleton College and he’d said, “ Come and visit me in Prague.’</span> <span id="s432">And I told him my impressions of Germany, and he said, “ Well, we need to have a long talk.’</span> <span id="s433">And so we went out for dinner and we talked ‘til five o’clock the next morning.</span> <span id="s434">He said, “ That isn’t the real Germany.</span> <span id="s435">This is the real Germany.”</span> <span id="s436">You know, he described it, and from then on I liked and respected his viewpoint and he knew,, he was living over there, and from then on my eyes were open and I became aware.</span> <span id="s437">Then came after that Sudetenland, the Anschluss, the Polish thing, the whole thing, and one thing after another, but it wasn’t right away that you began to hear about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s438">Well, I think, in answer to the question, the more I learned, the more abhorrent the whole thing became, and the stronger my feelings were.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: Another thing I wanted to ask you, you were after Kaltenbrunner, you had your list of the people you wanted.</span> <span id="s440">Was there a sort of cut-off?</span> <span id="s441">How did you decide which Nazis, which police people we won’t bother with?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: You were given lists by higher headquarters of the gradations and who were the important people.</span> <span id="s443">So they were always at the top of your list.</span> <span id="s444">And of course the higher the rank in any one of these -- they all were ranked, the Gestapo had different ranks, the criminal police people had different ranks, the Sicherheiditz people had different ranks, the military and the political side had different ranks -- the higher the ranks, the more important.</span> <span id="s445">But then more information came in, particularly from the British, who were pretty good on their intelligence service.</span> <span id="s446">You got more information about things they’d done, in addition to the position that they held.</span> <span id="s447">So you would combine these two, and if the person was of lower rank but was known for atrocities and doing bad things, he ranked high on your “automatic arrest” list.</span> <span id="s448">And the information we got from the French as we went into villages crossing France, and that we got from Germans through these networks that we’d set up -- that was the job of CIC to go with the regiment.</span> <span id="s449">I was with the 319th regiment -- to go in with their troops as they took a town, and immediately go to the people that you had on your list who were friendly to establishing an intelligence information net.</span> <span id="s450">And then after we’d found that out, to begin to pick up the people who were in these arrest categories and send them back.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: While you were going along with the troops, you were fighting along with them.</span> <span id="s452">You were in the front lines, getting shot at.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: We were fired at, but we actually weren’t doing the shooting.</span> <span id="s454">We’d have a sidearm, I guess we’d carry a rifle in the jeep, but we weren’t out to kill soldiers.</span> <span id="s455">We were out to accompany them, and if we ran into a situation where you had to use a weapon, you’d use it.</span> <span id="s456">Or if you had to arrest somebody and they were putting up resistance you’d have to use it.</span> <span id="s457">But you’d go with them and you’d experience what they experienced.</span> <span id="s458">Except that your job was to do this other thing, and not their thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Did you ever have to defend yourself with your gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Nope.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Nobody resisted whom you arrested.</span> <span id="s462">If you were interviewing you, is there something I’ve forgotten to ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: You’ve done well, very well.</span> <span id="s464">And if I had forgotten things which you’ve already brought up, there may be other things that I’ve forgotten but I can’t think now what they might be.</span> <span id="s465">All I know is that it was a fabulous experience, and I, by luck -- you know, most things in life are by accident -- I happened to end up in Alt Aussee, which was where they were all coming to at the end of the war, It was like fishing in a stocked trout farm!</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Another part that I forgot, was that Toplitzsee was nearby, and one day after we’d cleaned up most of the automatic arrests, towards the end of May, I’d gotten this message to go out to Toplitzsee: “This is where the Nazis have sunk all of their gold, in a lake that has no bottom, and this is where you’ll find German scientists working.”</span> <span id="s467">So this is the end of May.</span> <span id="s468">The war had ended, three weeks before.</span> <span id="s469">I went out there with, I guess, Kurt Motell, or somebody.</span> <span id="s470">There were always Jewish interpreters who’d come from Germany, and that’s who I always had with me.</span> <span id="s471">And we got in touch with the resistance people in the area, and they led me out to this lake.</span> <span id="s472">You had to park your car in Gossl, and then you had to walk in for about a mile over this beautiful woodland trail.</span> <span id="s473">You came to this picture book lake called Toplitzsee, surrounded by mountains, with no roads, and the only building was this thing that I saw off to the right, and I went over to this building, and went inside, and there were twelve German scientists still working on the underwater rocket.</span> <span id="s474">And one was Dr. Detterman.</span> <span id="s475">We arrested them all, sent them back to army headquarters, and they, then, the leading German scientists, were brought over by our people and they helped us produce, later, the successors to the V-1, V-2 rockets.</span> <span id="s476">And these people were working on the underwater rocket.</span> <span id="s477">And they had a platform, it was really a raft, with cables underneath it, that went down with launching rafts.</span> <span id="s478">One of the stories that came to us from the natives was that there were “flying fish” at night.</span> <span id="s479">And these things would be shot from these underwater ramps against the cliffs that surrounded this lake, and that’s what the resistance people were referring to.</span> <span id="s480">Also, we found out later, they had dumped Foreign Office gold, and these forged British pounds.</span> <span id="s481">Another operation that Kaltenbrunner was in charge of was forging money to finance abroad the Intelligence operations.</span> <span id="s482">They made perfect specimens of British pound notes, and a lot of these were supposed to be down at the bottom of this lake.</span> <span id="s483">A lot of these Kaltenbrunner had on his person when I arrested him.</span> <span id="s484">They were so good, the forgery that they passed the Swiss banks and they were being circulated in England!</span> <span id="s485">And there’s a wonderful story called “Cicero” about the British ambassador to Turkey and his valet, was a guy who was working for Kaltenbrunner in the SD, and he was giving the ambassador sleeping pills at night to make sure he would sleep, and then he’d go into his safe and take out all of these documents and send them back to Kaltenbrunner.</span> <span id="s486">He was paid off by Kaltenbrunner in these false British pound notes.</span> <span id="s487">And he didn’t know that until later.</span> <span id="s488">His name was Moisesch.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">But there’d been a lot of stories.</span> <span id="s490">What was her name -- that wonderful author -- she died, that wrote a book -- Helen McInnis.</span> <span id="s491">Remember that name?</span> <span id="s492">She wrote a wonderful book about this area and about the buried treasure in this bottomless lake in Toplitzsee.</span> <span id="s493">There was another British authoress who wrote about the Nuremberg trial.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Barbara Tuchman.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: No.</span> <span id="s496">There’s another one who lived in England, north of London.</span> <span id="s497">I visited her there.</span> <span id="s498">She’s now dead.</span> <span id="s499">She’s a well-known name.</span> <span id="s500">You’d know it if I could remember it.</span> <span id="s501">That’s another story.</span> <span id="s502">You know, when you get past seventy, you can’t remember as well as you could before.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: I know, I like to put it in computerese.</span> <span id="s504">You’ve programmed in so much information, it takes you time to retrieve it.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: (Laughs) Yeah.</span> <span id="s506">Well, there was a man called “the officer in the tower,” a great British traitor, one of the three British traitors in World War II, and he’d been put into the London Tower, and he was communicating with a German girl who was a Nazi, who was the daughter of Countess Von Platten, and she, the countess, had a summer home in this Alt Aussee area, so I saw her there.</span> <span id="s507">But her daughter was in communication with Norman Bailey Stuart, this British officer of the C-Fourth Highlanders.</span> <span id="s508">And this woman wrote a book called The Officer in the Tower.</span> <span id="s509">And he was another guy that I’d arrested.</span> <span id="s510">And the way I arrested him in Alt Aussee was no big deal.</span> <span id="s511">He came in as an interpreter for a Dutchman who was telling us that there were B-3 weapons in the Russian territory, that had been developed by the Nazis, and that we should get them before the Russians got them.</span> <span id="s512">And this Norman Bailey Stuart came in the service as an interpreter, and I knew enough German to know that he was misinterpreting everything the Dutch journalist was telling me.</span> <span id="s513">So I took him off into another room and questioned him myself, because my interpreter wasn’t there at this point.</span> <span id="s514">He spoke, of course, English, because he was an Englishman.</span> <span id="s515">And so he just told me his story, about he was in touch with this German girl that he was in love with, and sending British intelligence information to her.</span> <span id="s516">She was passing it on to the Reichszicherhaus Hauptdamm.</span> <span id="s517">He finally was let out of the Tower of London in 1938.</span> <span id="s518">The British didn’t want him in England.</span> <span id="s519">So he decided to go over and find this girl again, and he went to Vienna and went into what he called a “sleeping partnership” with a couple of Jewish people to hide his identity and what he was up to, and he began to criticize the propaganda that Germany was beaming on England.</span> <span id="s520">So they called him up and he started the “Lord Haw Haw” programs in Berlin.</span> <span id="s521">Remember those?</span> <span id="s522">Lord Haw Haw came in later, William Joyce, but this guy, Norman Bailey Stuart, started it.</span> <span id="s523">But he was sort of a strange guy and he made a lot of mistakes and so they began not to trust him and they turned it over to William Joyce.</span> <span id="s524">So at the end, instead of being drafted into the Volksturm, he goes up to be with his girlfriend in Alt Aussee, where her mother had this summer place, and that’s where I talked to him and arrested him and sent him back.</span> <span id="s525">When he got back, going back through the chain, back to England, all the British correspondents from all over Europe came down and said, “ How did you find him?</span> <span id="s526">We’ve been looking for him all over Europe!</span> <span id="s527">He’s great British traitor.”</span> <span id="s528">And I said, ‘ He walked into the office.</span> <span id="s529">It was easy.</span> <span id="s530">There was nothing to it.”</span> <span id="s531">So I saw the author of the book in 1956 at the time of the London disarmament negotiations on my way up to Oxford, and I had dinner with her and her husband and my wife, and spent four hours going over all of this.</span> <span id="s532">I told her the story because she hadn’t known about it either.</span> <span id="s533">There were more people in that area that either were there when I was there, or came through and went some other place, and were picked up later.</span> <span id="s534">But I can’t think of any other questions at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: You certainly had a long and very distinguished career.</span> <span id="s536">I’d like to talk to you about Viet Nam, about some of the other things you’ve done, your conservation work, your new interest in Cuba.</span> <span id="s537">But I think we’ll save that for another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I’m getting right now into the Viet Nam thing.</span> <span id="s539">I’ve been writing these things up for the family, you know.</span> <span id="s540">I’ve finally gotten up to the year 1967, when I went over to Viet Nam.</span> <span id="s541">And I’ve been reading around that as background.</span> <span id="s542">When you relive it, you know, it’s like a slow movie when you relive it.</span> <span id="s543">Then it was fast action.</span> <span id="s544">You didn’t have time to do things.</span> <span id="s545">But now things are being put in place, and answers are coming that I didn’t have at that time, and it’s like having a whole new life.</span> <span id="s546">I was just reading at the public library this morning Westmoreland’s report, “a Soldier Reports” by General Westmoreland, and he talks about things that I wondered about at the time, you know, about the pacification program and why they set up the set-up.</span> <span id="s547">He explains it all.</span> <span id="s548">It had never been given an explanation by anybody.</span> <span id="s549">But there are a lot of things like that that are in these books, like Maxwell Taylor’s The Uncertain Trumpet.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Are you going to write your own book?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well that’s what these are.</span> <span id="s552">What got me interested in it was my Uncle Sumner, and he was the one that led me to Cuba, the early photojournalist.</span> <span id="s553">And when I began to find out more about him -- my father and mother had been killed in this automobile accident in Florida in 1936, I didn’t really know who I was -- so it wasn’t until 40 years later, because of my uncle, I began to wonder who I was.</span> <span id="s554">And so I started with the tombstone in Oakland Cemetery, with my wife, and worked backwards from my father to Decorah, Iowa, where he was born, to East Huntsville in New York near Watertown, to Dorset, Vermont, down to East Shaftesbury, and finally back to Prudence Island near Providence, in Rhode Island, where I found the first tombstone of my first ancestor who came to this country, and this was in 1666, Henry Matteson.</span> <span id="s555">On one of the tombstones I found a third generation from the Danish nation.</span> <span id="s556">It was the first time I really knew I came from Danish antecedents.</span> <span id="s557">So I’ve been back to Copenhagen, and I’ve looked in the city records there.</span> <span id="s558">And I couldn’t find any record because it was “the son of” and they didn’t use the whole name.</span> <span id="s559">Also for Copenhagen they had the records for the surrounding area but not the outlying districts, so I ran into a stone wall.</span> <span id="s560">But it led me to my uncle, and that led me to Mexico, and to Cuba, and that led me to this thing.</span> <span id="s561">Did I show you this?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Yes, the book about the Cuban.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: I see him tomorrow, I think; this is a picture my uncle took of General Maximilian Gomez’s wife and his two daughters in 1904.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: And your uncle’s name was…</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Sumner Matteson.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s567">PAGE 8</span></p> <p><span id="s568">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s569">PAGE 8</span></p></body></html>
