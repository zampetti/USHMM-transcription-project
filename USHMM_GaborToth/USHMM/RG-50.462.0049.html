particular antisemitic feelings in your community?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">AS: The only thing I remember, the reason, this was the reason why I went to Hebrew school, primary to escape.</span> <span id="s125">I was more sheltered, because I knew that children in the public school, many of them suffered a lot being Jewish.</span> <span id="s126">That's all I know.</span> <span id="s127">And that's what I heard from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">MS: Were...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">AS: I personally didn't experience before, too much, eh.</span> <span id="s130">Later on I

id="s137">It must have been in 1933, because I was born in 1920.</span> <span id="s138">I mean 1929, about five years old, when people were escaping from Germany.</span> <span id="s139">And they, we opened doors, and they moved with us.</span> <span id="s140">Quite a few families moved to our place...</span></p> <p><span id="s141">MS: Into your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">AS: Into our

can't quote, because I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">MS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s161">So he must have served, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">AS: He must have served, ‘cause I see his picture in uniform, but I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">MS: O.K.</span> <span id="s164">About how many Jews lived in your town or city, if you could estimate that, of course.</span> <span id="s165">I don't know.</span> <span id="s166">Was it a highly-organized Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">AS: Oh definitely.</span> <span id="s168">Definitely.</span> <span id="s169">I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s170">My husband would be able to tell you, if he comes in.</span> <span id="s171">I would say that at least 100,000 Jews must have lived in Krakow.</span> <span id="s172">But if it's wrong, I think Sol will be able to correct you.</span> <span id="s173">Cause Sol, you see, Sol was eight years older, and he remembers this much better than I do.</span> <span id="s174">The pre-war...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">MS: Period.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">AS: And he was active in various organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">MS: Do

your family during the weeks following the German invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">AS: This was very, very hard.</span> <span id="s186">Because the first few weeks we experienced a lot.</span> <span id="s187">Number one, because we were well-to-do family, then, we owned this building, and the superintendent from the building was the first one to point to Germans, "Go over there to this apartment.</span> <span id="s188">Here are the rich Jews."</span> <span id="s189">And the first week, when they walked in into our town, they came to our apartment.</span> <span id="s190">And the first thing they stripped, it is, eh, they took our piano, which, this was for me the hardest part to part, because I played piano.</span> <span id="s191">And, took our Persian carpeting, and crystal chandeliers.</span> <span id="s192">This was the first week.</span> <span id="s193">This was right away removed.</span> <span id="s194">And, they removed radios.</span> <span id="s195">We didn't have

apartment and removing these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">AS: Oh, very, very clearly.</span> <span id="s200">This I remember very clearly cause, and with it too, they, when they came to pick up the piano, they picked me up too, and they decided that I didn't look Jewish at all, that I should be in their, they called this experiments, what they were doing.</span> <span id="s201">And they took me in and took blood test, and I was AB positive blood type.</span> <span id="s202">Because of this AB positive blood type, they claim it's very unknown in European Jews to have this blood type, and it's prominent they called it in Anglo-Saxon religion to be this blood type.</span> <span id="s203">And they put me for all those tests, testing, like a guinea pig, which took about six weeks.</span> <span id="s204">My mother wanted to commit suicide, she was so upset with it.</span> <span id="s205">And she did not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">MS: Well let me, you say that they removed you from your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">AS: From my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">MS: And they kept you elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">AS: They kept me during the day, and during the night I came back home.</span> <span id="s210">I was undergoing all kinds of unknown tests and injections.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">MS: And this was before you were

moved to another quarter?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">MS: You...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">AS: No.</span> <span id="s222">They took in like a section.</span> <span id="s223">I'll give you an example where I live at the present time.</span> <span id="s224">They came in, and they said, "Up to here the second house will be the ghetto."</span> <span id="s225">O.K.?</span> <span id="s226">A few weeks later they came and they took the whole street, and they said, "This is going to be the ghetto."</span> <span id="s227">They put fence around it, and that's where they crowded into the, all the Jews which they live in various parts of Krakow—in this small area.</span> <span id="s228">This was the ghetto.</span> <span id="s229">They put wiring.</span> <span id="s230">They made gates.</span> <span id="s231">And that's where we lived for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">MS: You stayed within this framework.</span></p> <p><span

you went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">MS: And you were not involved in the labor camp then.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">AS: Later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">MS: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s247">AS: Not right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">MS: What about your parents?</span> <span id="s249">Were...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">AS: My moth-, I lost my mother in a

of camp.</span> <span id="s332">His name was Goeth, he was, Goeth.</span> <span id="s333">He was sentenced after the war.</span> <span id="s334">And, he says, "I must get you out.</span> <span id="s335">I can't see what's happening to you."</span> <span id="s336">O.K.?</span> <span id="s337">This, this Eichanholtz.</span> <span id="s338">His name was Eichanholtz.</span> <span id="s339">[phonetic]</span></p> <p><span id="s340">MS: Excuse me, Ann.</span> <span id="s341">Was this man who addressed you...</span></p> <p><span id="s342">AS: He was...</span></p> <p><span id="s343">MS: He was a Pole?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">AS: A Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">MS: A Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">AS: A Jew who was working for, for the Germans, making their uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">MS: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">AS: And he was well-liked by this German, because he was making all the uniforms.</span> <span id="s349">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">MS: So he was a person with some influence.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">AS: Influence.</span> <span id="s352">And he says, "I will try to get you out as fast as possible."</span> <span id="s353">O.K., in meantime, I was very, very run down.</span> <span id="s354">I couldn't take any more.</span> <span id="s355">I went to, I went to, to work.</span> <span id="s356">And I couldn't.</span> <span id="s357">And I dropped the stones.</span> <span id="s358">And they caught me.</span> <span id="s359">And I was supposed to be sentenced, sentenced to die.</span> <span id="s360">Then, when they were doing, they took me, they was on top of the mountains over there.</span> <span id="s361">They were making fire, and music was playing, and you needed to go, and dig your own grave.</span> <span id="s362">Undress yourself.</span> <span id="s363">[pause] And, dig the grave, and lay down.</span> <span id="s364">In meantime, I heard the shooting.</span> <span id="s365">There was this, and suddenly, everybody is running away.</span> <span id="s366">In meantime was a blackout.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">MS: Oh, you, you don't know where the shooting was coming from?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">AS: No, but it was a blackout.</span> <span id="s369">The Russians must have been invading this part of Poland and the Germans left everything and run out.</span> <span id="s370">I crawled out, out of the hole, and the last thing I remember, I found myself in a dispensary, and somebody was standing over me and crying.</span> <span id="s371">And, I opened my eyes, and I recognized this person.</span> <span id="s372">This person was, it, but my, like I was just saying, my whole story just is I am very lucky that I am alive.</span> <span id="s373">Because this person looked at me and he says—and my Polish name was Hannetchkah [phonetic]—It's Annka.</span> <span id="s374">It comes from Ann.</span> <span id="s375">He says, "I don't believe it, my child.</span> <span id="s376">You are here."</span> <span id="s377">And he says, "You must get out from here, because by tomorrow we supposed, everybody in this dispensary supposed to be gone, supposed to die.</span> <span id="s378">Nobody will be left."</span> <span id="s379">Then he bandaged my legs.</span> <span id="s380">He took me to my barracks, and they, they had opening in the barracks like on top of the ceiling which slides down.</span> <span id="s381">They pushed me there.</span> <span id="s382">They closed this, and this man who did it was a doctor.</span> <span id="s383">He was my father's best friend, a Jewish doctor.</span> <span id="s384">And the woman, the nurse, who was helping out in the dispensary, she was a very good friend of my mother.</span> <span id="s385">And they recognized me.</span> <span id="s386">Then they put me over there, and they say, "See, you stay over there."</span> <span id="s387">And, if they wouldn't have helped me, I wouldn't be here today.</span> <span id="s388">Because the same evening, they took anybody who was not able to work, perform; everybody died.</span> <span id="s389">They executed the same evening everybody else.</span> <span id="s390">Then, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s391">I stayed over there for about 24 hours.</span> <span id="s392">I [unclear] came down, and the rest of the people who survived this terrible thing, they came back, and they nursed me, and I became for a while, better.</span> <span id="s393">In meantime, this, these friends of ours, Dr. Eichanholtz, one day came into my barracks.</span> <span id="s394">He says, "Child, I am taking you out from here.</span> <span id="s395">You are going to work for me."</span> <span id="s396">Then he took me out, and I was working in his place—which, I never knew how to sew—but he taught me how to sew, and I was doing the buttons for the uniforms and the buttonholes for the uniforms.</span> <span id="s397">And that's where I stayed.</span> <span id="s398">And that's how I stayed till 1943, until they evacuated this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">MS: What was the name, do you know the name of the camp that this all...</span></p> <p><span id="s400">AS: Yeah, this is Plaszow.</span> <span id="s401">This was P-L-A-S-H-O-[pause]W, it will be in English probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">MS: And this was the original labor camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s403">AS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">MS: That made...</span></p> <p><span id="s405">AS: Put in.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">MS: That they put you into.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s408">And from then, from then, what happened, the Russians were approaching this, this camp, were very close to Krakow.</span> <span id="s409">They needed suddenly, Germans needed to wipe out all the evidence of camps.</span> <span id="s410">And what happened, then we needed to dig out, which was so much dirt between the bodies.</span> <span id="s411">Because what they were doing, they were burying people on top of the other, because they were executing them every day.</span> <span id="s412">Then we needed to burn all these bodies not to leave any trace when the Russians will come in.</span> <span id="s413">And the smell was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s414">Because they had small layer of dirt on top of them.</span> <span id="s415">And from then, we started to go on foot through whole Poland on to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s416">We didn't have trains, because every, everything was occupied and we were walking.</span> <span id="s417">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s418">MS: You were being, you were, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s419">AS: Transferred.</span> <span id="s420">Transferred by foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">MS: By foot, under German, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s422">AS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">MS: Eh, control.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">AS: Control.</span> <span id="s425">But the funny part, like I was just saying, not long ago, how, we didn't have confidence in Polish people that they will help us at all, because there were two German officers, and who knows how many thousands of us from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s426">I was passing my own house, and nobody tried to even fled, and to, because we knew nobody will help us.</span> <span id="s427">Then nobody even tried to escape.</span> <span id="s428">And we were walking, and walking, and falling, and dying.</span> <span id="s429">And nobody just ran out to anybody to be helped.</span> <span id="s430">Because we knew that they, they wouldn't help us.</span> <span id="s431">And then we ended in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">MS: Well, then, you walked then you say from your labor camp to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">AS: Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">MS: Which...</span></p> <p><span id="s435">AS: On foot, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">MS: How long, how long a march was that [unclear]?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">AS: Oh it was a long, I, I, we lost completely concept of days or nights or... I really truly don't know, until we landed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s438">And in Auschwitz I stay only for a week, because they were liquidating Auschwitz too.</span> <span id="s439">I just came the time...</span></p> <p><span id="s440">MS: You remember the year, Ann, that this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">AS: It must have been 1944, either, yeah, 1944 must have been, yes, because from there I went to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">MS: Well then, in other words, from the time that you went into the labor camp which was early in 1940, you stayed in that same labor camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s443">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">MS: For four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">AS: For, almost four years, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">MS: I see.</span> <span id="s447">Until '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">AS: '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">MS: According to the map, Krakow and Auschwitz were only about 35 miles apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">AS: Right.</span> <span id="s451">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">MS: And then, can you tell us a little about your experience in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">AS: In Auschwitz itself, we stayed only one week, because it happened the same thing.</span> <span id="s454">It was overloaded.</span> <span id="s455">They did not know what to do with all the Jewish people, and they were sending them to different various camps.</span> <span id="s456">And in 1944 again the Russian were approaching the area.</span> <span id="s457">And, from then, I don't, I can't remember too much from Auschwitz, and I didn't, the funny part, nobody, at least I did not know about gas chambers.</span> <span id="s458">I know they were there.</span> <span id="s459">I did not realize what was going on, maybe because I was tired.</span> <span id="s460">I did not know.</span> <span id="s461">And one day we woke up, and they told us we were leaving that Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s462">And we're going somewhere else.</span> <span id="s463">And this was the worst part.</span> <span id="s464">They put us in the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s465">I don't know how many, how many hundreds of people, and it was winter time.</span> <span id="s466">And we were who knows how many in open trains.</span> <span id="s467">Gave us only one eighth of bread.</span> <span id="s468">And we were traveling for few weeks.</span> <span id="s469">And none of the camps wanted to open door for us, because they didn't have enough room.</span> <span id="s470">And it was, this was one of the hardest time I ever I think had; it was terrible, because the cold, the hunger, and until finally we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s471">And when we arrived in Bergen-Belsen, they opened the door, we were sure that this is the end.</span> <span id="s472">Because there were about 50 or 100 Germans with big German shepherds, next to them with guns.</span> <span id="s473">We thought this is it.</span> <span id="s474">This is the end.</span> <span id="s475">They'll probably shoot us, and… They let us into this camp, a camp which, nobody worked, practically.</span> <span id="s476">They didn't give you food.</span> <span id="s477">They just left you to decay.</span> <span id="s478">It was, we didn't, we had a litt-, I lived in a barrack with, I don't know how many hundreds were in this place.</span> <span id="s479">We had one barrack, and one, two, three, five people squeeze in to get just a laying position.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">MS: In one berth.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">AS: In the, yeah.</span> <span id="s482">And there was no water.</span> <span id="s483">They gave us water only for a very short time a day which everybody was running to get sip of water to drink, to wash yourself.</span> <span id="s484">And that's when the whole epidemic started—lice, and with typhoid fever, and, and, it was terri-, it was, this was maybe, because the working was hard, but at least you got out.</span> <span id="s485">You were human, you did something.</span> <span id="s486">But here it was just, it was terrible, it was unreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">MS: Ann, the time that you were in Auschwitz, you were not aware that it was a death camp, you're saying?</span> <span id="s488">You weren't conscious...</span></p> <p><span id="s489">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s490">I was conscious that you're supposed, you needed to work—if not, they will kill you.</span> <span id="s491">But, we knew that we're going to take showers, and we never knew what's going to happen.</span> <span id="s492">But, really, truly, I did not believe that they would do such, I don't think I would be alive probably if I would have thought differently.</span> <span id="s493">But I could not believe that anybody would do such thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">MS: There were no rumors?</span> <span id="s495">You heard nothing...</span></p> <p><span id="s496">AS: Yes, there were a lot of rumors that, yes, that people are killed, and I have seen killing.</span> <span id="s497">Then you know, I, the same way that I was ordering to undress yourself, undress yourself if you didn't do it, but I couldn't believe that they would go and do it, to have gas chamber, and kill you by hundreds at the same time.</span> <span id="s498">I could not believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">MS: When you were in the labor camp, and, and then, on your walk to Auschwitz...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">MS: During all those years and during that time, did you, was there anybody there that you became friendly with, or someone, because you were alone in the world...</span></p> <p><span id="s502">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">MS: And there were no relatives then of any sort.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">AS: Nobody.</span> <span id="s505">But I had very good friend, which in, she is my mother's friend, and her, her, her husband was, I think not in throat specialist, in Poland.</span> <span id="s506">And she spotted me in Auschwitz and she helped me a lot too.</span> <span id="s507">She helped me morally, and tried to, to help me.</span> <span id="s508">There was nothing to help otherwise, because foodwise...</span></p> <p><span id="s509">MS: No.</span> <span id="s510">There were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s511">AS: There was nothing but just morally, psychologically...</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s513">MS: You were saying, Ann, that this person, this woman that you met, helped you morally and psychologically.</span> <span id="s514">And, do you know how long she'd been in Auschwitz before she met you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">AS: I don't know.</span> <span id="s516">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">MS: Well, did she, did she leave with you after that short stay with...</span></p> <p><span id="s518">AS: She leaved with me to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">MS: She went with you to Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s521">Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s522">And we were in Bergen-Belsen ‘til 1945 together.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">MS: That was what, almost a period of...</span></p> <p><span id="s524">AS: That's where we were liberated, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">MS: But you were in Bergen-Belsen for how, do you have any idea how long?</span> <span id="s526">Was it almost a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">AS: Close to it.</span> <span id="s528">I was till April 15th, 1945 I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">MS: In Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s530">And the American armies?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">MS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">AS: English.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">MS: The English armies liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">I wish the American would have liberated us, because I think that be cause, meaning well, I think English people, not realizing what was happening to us, they fed us, they brought pork, and they brought containers of food, like, I give you stew, and we were opening the cans, and we were eating this cold food.</span> <span id="s537">And half of the people got seriously sick.</span> <span id="s538">A lot of them died because of that.</span> <span id="s539">Not eating for all these years, and suddenly getting hold of this food.</span> <span id="s540">It was disastrous.</span> <span id="s541">Which, on American side was much, I heard it was much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">MS: Simply because they knew how to take care of these people from a physical point of view?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">AS: Probably.</span> <span id="s544">Probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">MS: More so than the English.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">AS: Probably.</span> <span id="s547">They meant well, because they wanted to give us right away everything to eat, but people who didn't eat for so many years, and we were so run down, suddenly opening can of fat, it was, people were consuming whatever they can get hold of.</span> <span id="s548">And that's when they got extremely sick.</span> <span id="s549">A lot of them died because of that too.</span> <span id="s550">[pause; tape off for a long pause then on].</span></p> <p><span id="s551">MS: Ann, you were saying

Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s633">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">MS: And Sol was able to find work there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">AS: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s636">It was very hard, but being, well, after we went through every thing seemed just great.</span> <span id="s637">We could only function.</span> <span id="s638">This was the main thing.</span> <span id="s639">And that's how we came to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">MS: Where in, where, what cities did you come to?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">AS: New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">MS: And you lived there for...</span></p> <p><span id="s643">AS: For quite a while, yes.</span> <span id="s644">And we went on our own, and I worked and Sol worked.</span> <span id="s645">We went to night school.</span> <span id="s646">And we found very lovely American family who were extremely nice to us, and felt that they would love to sponsor us, not financially, but just to help us to find ourself, to find something, to accomplish something.</span> <span id="s647">And they really did.</span> <span id="s648">They were just very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">MS: Ann, tell me, you were never, I'd like to hear about how you finally located your father, but, was Sol also able to find any relatives...</span></p> <p><span id="s650">AS: Sol found his cousin Kalman Sultanik, and his two brothers, Jacob Sultanik, and Sam Sultanik.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">MS: Not, not Sol's brothers, but Sol's cousin's...</span></p> <p><span id="s652">AS: Cousin's.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">MS: All, all the three...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">AS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s655">This is the whole family.</span> <span id="s656">Nobody else survived.</span> <span id="s657">Just four of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">MS: All right, would you tell us a little bit about how you finally [noise!]</span> <span id="s659">, how you finally located your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">AS: This was years, years after.</span> <span id="s661">I don't know how many years after.</span> <span id="s662">But I know it was 35 years after the war.</span> <span id="s663">I was in New York at somebody's house, and somebody asked me what is my maiden name.</span> <span id="s664">And I told them, and they said, "Wow.</span> <span id="s665">You know what?</span> <span id="s666">I have a doctor in Israel by this name!"</span> <span id="s667">I said, "Do you?</span> <span id="s668">Where does he live?"</span> <span id="s669">And he gave me the address, and I wrote a letter, and it was my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">MS: Did you, eh, did you have any idea that this same person could have been your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">AS: I don't, I still till today, I live, I can't believe it, and I cannot say many times, which is my, my, my sickness, that my family really is perished, that, any time I come across similar name, or anything like this, I become just so excited, because I think, it could be!</span> <span id="s672">It, maybe it's possible my brother survived.</span> <span id="s673">Maybe it's possible my father survived.</span> <span id="s674">And that's how I went and wrote my father a letter, and it was my father!</span> <span id="s675">Then I went and took Jeff, and immediately...</span></p> <p><span id="s676">MS: Jeff was your son.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">AS: Jeff is my son, yes.</span> <span id="s678">And, who was then nine years old.</span> <span id="s679">And we went to Israel.</span> <span id="s680">When we landed in, on the airport, I stood with Jeff for two-and-a-half hours.</span> <span id="s681">We couldn't locate my father.</span> <span id="s682">Finally somebody approached me.</span> <span id="s683">He says, "Are you waiting for somebody?"</span> <span id="s684">I said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s685">And I'm expecting my father and I can't locate him."</span> <span id="s686">Then he asked me my name.</span> <span id="s687">He says, "Do you know he's my family doctor?</span> <span id="s688">And look, he's over there in this corner, over there in the other corner."</span> <span id="s689">And that's how we met.</span> <span id="s690">And it was very strange meeting.</span> <span id="s691">It was very emotional meeting.</span> <span id="s692">And, a lot of, how shall I say it, my father was remarried.</span> <span id="s693">He married very lovely person.</span> <span id="s694">She never had children of her own.</span> <span id="s695">And, my father never told me that my mother's brother is in Israel, because my mother's brother never wanted to forget my father that he never put too much effort to look up if anybody survived from his family.</span> <span id="s696">And they stopped talking to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">MS: Do you, Ann, do you, um, did your father ever relate to you what his experience was?</span> <span id="s698">How he...</span></p> <p><span id="s699">AS: Surv-...</span></p> <p><span id="s700">MS: Well, no, after he left the family, and what countries he went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">MS: Was he in a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s703">Do you know what...</span></p> <p><span id="s704">AS: I know all about it, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">MS: Would you care to tell us what his experience was?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">AS: Sure.</span> <span id="s707">In, when my father fled from home, he landed eventually in Romania.</span> <span id="s708">Romania, part of Romania which the name was Cryova.</span> <span id="s709">Over there, in Cryova, most of the Jewish people who stayed over there, they survived.</span> <span id="s710">The king, I don't remember it was King Michael then, or whoever was then in power, was extremely good to Jewish people and immigrants.</span> <span id="s711">He placed them like in a ghetto, but not in a ghetto what you were restricted or anything.</span> <span id="s712">He gave them food.</span> <span id="s713">He gave them certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s714">And they lived very, very comfortable over there.</span> <span id="s715">And my father landed over there in Cryova, and who else landed over there is my mother's two brothers.</span> <span id="s716">They all lived, they were all in Brazil, I mean, in Romania.</span> <span id="s717">And that's how they survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">MS: And they were able to live there...</span></p> <p><span id="s719">AS: To live there all during the war, and then in 1945 it was, my father was, eh, coming from a doctor, he's practicing medicine, private medicine, and the Russian occupied then Romania, and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s720">MS: Ann, do, excuse me, during his internment in the, eh, ghetto, he was able, he continued to practice medicine?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s722">Yes.</span> <span id="s723">It was entirely different ghetto.</span> <span id="s724">It was not like under the German.</span> <span id="s725">They were just concen-, eh, congregating all the immigrants in this certain section, but it was not that they were restricted to get out or things like that.</span> <span id="s726">It was not.</span> <span id="s727">He was practicing medicine.</span> <span id="s728">He was doing work, and they decided to go to Israel, the whole family.</span> <span id="s729">And then that's how they landed in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">MS: That, that was your uncles and your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">AS: Father, yeah.</span> <span id="s732">And they all settled in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">MS: And that was shortly after they were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">AS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s735">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">MS: After he was liberated.</span> <span id="s737">I see.</span> <span id="s738">And then your father remained in Israel until his death, which was in what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s740">It was 1967.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">MS: Did you see him again, Ann, or just the one time?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">AS: I saw he was supposed to go, and I left, I knew he [unclear] he told me.</span> <span id="s743">But he told me, as long as he won't touch in particular [unclear] he had, he had problem with his eyes, it was affecting his vision, he says, it won't happen.</span> <span id="s744">That's why he doesn't want to undergo surgery.</span> <span id="s745">In meantime, the minute I left, he went undergone surgery, and from then on he went down the hill.</span> <span id="s746">By the same day, they notified me, the change in time, he was already buried in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">MS: So then, in effect, you only saw him...</span></p> <p><span id="s748">AS: Once.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">MS: One time.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">AS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s751">Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">MS: Ann, are, is, em, is there anything else that you would like to tell us about your ex-, your war experiences that you felt were very outstanding in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">AS: There are so many.</span> <span id="s754">They are so many, and hard work to...</span></p> <p><span id="s755">MS: Relate to...</span></p> <p><span id="s756">AS: To relate to, yes.</span> <span id="s757">It's extremely hard to...</span></p> <p><span id="s758">MS: Talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">MS: Well, Ann.</span> <span id="s761">I want to thank you very much for...</span></p> <p><span id="s762">AS: Yeah, but if you have any questions, then, it's easier for me to answer the questions than to relate...</span></p> <p><span id="s763">MS: All right, well let me just check through a minute.</span> <span id="s764">We can look at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">AS: Or you put on tape...</span></p> <p><span id="s766">MS: Eh, Ann, when you, eh, going back a little bit in your story, when you were in the labor camp, in Poland, were you aware of any underground resistance groups that were trying to operate within the camp to help the inmates, the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">AS: It must have been.</span> <span id="s768">Yes.</span> <span id="s769">I did not know, but I am sure they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">MS: You were saying if anyone would escape from the camp...</span></p> <p><span id="s771">AS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">MS: What was the procedure then...</span></p> <p><span id="s773">AS: The procedure it was after everybody who stayed in camp, this, then they were executing so and so many people.</span> <span id="s774">Like, if one Jewish person would flee, how do you say it, escape, they could take instead 100 and 250 people and execute them for this one person which escaped.</span> <span id="s775">And, it was terrible.</span> <span id="s776">Sometimes we were standing outside in the winter for hours, and we were watching, we needed to ex-, we were watching the execution.</span> <span id="s777">They made us see the whole execution.</span> <span id="s778">They were hanging people, and the music was playing, and you needed to stand and look at it.</span> <span id="s779">And they were going and coming, one, two, three, four, five.</span> <span id="s780">If you were the fifth one, out you go.</span> <span id="s781">And that's how they were choosing.</span> <span id="s782">It was a pot luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">MS: It, did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s784">AS: And, you never knew when you come out if you will come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">MS: Well were, there must have been a very tight system of roll call if they knew that one person escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">AS: They must have.</span> <span id="s787">They have it.</span> <span id="s788">They must have, because otherwise they knew right away if somebody escaped.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">MS: At any time that you were in the labor camp, did the thought of trying to get out of it ever occur to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s790">AS: No.</span> <span id="s791">No.</span> <span id="s792">I was, I was so resigned.</span> <span id="s793">Sure, everybody had in mind we would love to escape, but it seemed almost impossible.</span> <span id="s794">It was impossible, and maybe because I was so young.</span> <span id="s795">To me it seemed that this is it, and there is no way we will survive, or no way we will be able to escape, and you have seen so many soldiers and so many executions each day that, it, I felt it was not [unclear], and what would I do even if I escape?</span> <span id="s796">Where will I go?</span> <span id="s797">Who will hide me?</span> <span id="s798">Who will help me?</span> <span id="s799">And what's the use even to escape where you don't have where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">MS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">AS: O.K. I was passing by my own house, and I didn't even ask them to go in, because I knew what will I do there?</span> <span id="s802">The minute I walk in, the people will come out, the tenants or the superintendent, he says, "Here is a Jewish person.</span> <span id="s803">Take them."</span> <span id="s804">And there was no way to hide.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">MS: So therefore, the entire time that you were incarcerated, you had no contact with any member of your family...</span></p> <p><span id="s806">AS: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">MS: Or even friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">AS: The only thing what I knew almost, I was sure that my mother died, because I told you, I was working in a, they called this Masschneider, [custom tailor] like in a tailoring thing for a while, and I found my mother's coat over there, which was… We were assorting old clothes, which was brought back now we know from the, from the gas chambers, to be fixed, and then they were all cleaned, and then they were, I don't know what they did with them.</span> <span id="s809">Either they sent them to their wife or what, I don't know.</span> <span id="s810">We were repairing them, and I came across my mother coat.</span> <span id="s811">And I know, that I knew right away this is it.</span> <span id="s812">There is no other way she could have survived.</span> <span id="s813">But, [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s814">MS: Do you remember when you first heard that Jews were being murdered in mass numbers, or being gassed, and did you believe these reports?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">AS: No, I didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s816">I didn't want to believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">MS: Of course, the realization did come to you certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">AS: There is no question, there, in the end, at the end none of us thought we will even pull through, and we truthfully, I don't think we cared any more.</span> <span id="s819">I really truly mean by the time we were, the last few weeks before liberation, I don't think that there was one person who could say that they wanted to live.</span> <span id="s820">I don't, I don't think we had the will.</span> <span id="s821">We didn't have the strength.</span> <span id="s822">Most of us were sick.</span> <span id="s823">We, we didn't have, we couldn't work.</span> <span id="s824">We were, we were finished.</span> <span id="s825">And, then even when we were liberated, we still didn't believe, for weeks we did not believe that we are liberated.</span> <span id="s826">I was carrying a piece of potato, a raw potato, in my pocket four weeks after we were liberated.</span> <span id="s827">I was afraid to part with it, because this was, this, this is the way I could survive—a piece of tom-, potato.</span> <span id="s828">And I, then we were hiding.</span> <span id="s829">We were afraid to, to pass.</span> <span id="s830">And I was relating this with my husband, and he says, "Do you know, I had the same thing.</span> <span id="s831">I had diarrhea from the fears."</span> <span id="s832">For four weeks, he kept this, he was afraid to part after he was liberated.</span> <span id="s833">The hunger is so great, and believe it or not, there were mothers which, and, which, they had this piece of bread, they didn't even want to share it with their own brothers or sisters.</span> <span id="s834">It became so that, it was, it was sad but that's what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">MS: An experience like this was enough to make...</span></p> <p><span id="s836">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">MS: People so different.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">MS: Were you involved in any selections in the death camps at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">AS: If I was selected too?</span></p> <p><span id="s841">MS: Yeah, were you, were, eh, can you relate any selections that may have taken place in Bergen-Belsen, or, but not in Auschwitz, because you stayed there only a short time.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">AS: No, it was in Plaszow, this was the only way what I experienced the, the, being sentenced to die.</span> <span id="s843">This was my, my experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">MS: And that was your closest...</span></p> <p><span id="s845">AS: The closest one, because I was already was wounded, and if not, it was like, if not the blackout, I would have been dead.</span> <span id="s846">Because I had to, that's why I couldn't work.</span> <span id="s847">My husband too.</span> <span id="s848">But, this was my closest to being dead.</span> <span id="s849">And there were a few close ones which I didn't realize.</span> <span id="s850">I was in Auschwitz in that, taking the bath, the shower, but before us, the group was all gassed, and we went out from the other hall, and we were out because they couldn’t gas all at the same time.</span> <span id="s851">And after this following day, we went to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s852">But if we, it was just a matter of minutes I would have been gassed too.</span> <span id="s853">But we didn't know all those things till later.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">MS: They were taking you into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s855">AS: Into showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">MS: Into the showers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">AS: But you never know if they will put gas on, or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">MS: Water.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">AS: Because what they do, one got water, one got gas.</span> <span id="s860">They couldn't operate on the same circuits.</span> <span id="s861">Then we were, the same group what I went in, people got, they were on the one side, we were one side.</span> <span id="s862">I got shower.</span> <span id="s863">I got out.</span> <span id="s864">However, my friends, I came out, they were gone.</span> <span id="s865">And that following morning we went to Bergen-Belsen, because they were liquidated.</span> <span id="s866">And it, it was like I was just saying, it was just matter of luck.</span> <span id="s867">If they say, "How do you survive?"</span> <span id="s868">It's ridiculous to say it, "I survived this or this way."</span> <span id="s869">It was just plain luck.</span> <span id="s870">Plain luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">MS: Really amazing.</span> <span id="s872">Ann, when we were discussing the fact that you would be willing to talk to us about your Holocaust experience, you said something quite interesting, that up until the time of the filming and showing of the television film, The Holocaust, that you were not able to speak or come to terms about your experience.</span> <span id="s873">Could you tell us about, about it yourself a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">AS: Yes, it's true.</span> <span id="s875">Then the evening when they were supposed to show this movie, my son called me from college, and he says, "Mom, I don't want you to watch it.</span> <span id="s876">It will be too hard for you to go back and it, and look at it again."</span> <span id="s877">I said, "O.K." But I did.</span> <span id="s878">I decided, let me, I need, I need to, I know that I have completely, I blocked myself from the past.</span> <span id="s879">I need to, I need to watch it.</span> <span id="s880">I turn on the television, and I started to watch the movie.</span> <span id="s881">My husband was, I decided I was in one room watching, and my husband in the other room.</span> <span id="s882">I watched this movie and the, for the first time in all these years, I just completely broke down.</span> <span id="s883">I, for two days I, I just was wearing dark glasses, and I just could not go out, and just, I, I was total mess.</span> <span id="s884">Number one, it, it just brought all my memories.</span> <span id="s885">The name of the girl in this movie was Ann.</span> <span id="s886">My name was Ann.</span> <span id="s887">Her father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s888">My father was a doctor.</span> <span id="s889">My father got a medical degree exactly in the same place as this doctor got in Berlin.</span> <span id="s890">Number two, I was as a child very much involved and introduced to art and, and music, classical music.</span> <span id="s891">They were, they were the children in the movie.</span> <span id="s892">The whole thing, it was just like reliving the whole thing over again.</span> <span id="s893">After this, exactly the same way, she was undergoing the testing.</span> <span id="s894">Like, I don't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s895">MS: Medical testing.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">AS: Medical testing.</span> <span id="s897">I was in the same program.</span> <span id="s898">I was identical in the same program what, as this girl was, except I was younger than she was.</span> <span id="s899">O.K.?</span> <span id="s900">Then, it was just like, I was in this camp too, which we needed to completely be nude, and that's how I was sentenced the first time to die, to undress myself, dig my own grave, and then they were shooting.</span> <span id="s901">When I saw, I have seen all those men marching in nude, and being sentenced, this broke me up completely.</span> <span id="s902">I could not for two days sleep, because it brought my whole memories back.</span> <span id="s903">And after this I could slowly talk about it.</span> <span id="s904">I don't know why, but I can, now I can relate more to it.</span> <span id="s905">I never talked about it before at all.</span> <span id="s906">Whenever my son asked me about my past, I said, "Jeff, I can't talk about it."</span> <span id="s907">I would give him whole book, but I could never relate one-to-one basis to express my feelings.</span> <span id="s908">But this helped me, The Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">MS: Well, it's interesting that you made this comment, Ann, because there had, there had been a feeling that, a great amount of good has come from that particular episode, the filming of The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s910">And, and of course there was always, there had been the reverse...</span></p> <p><span id="s911">AS: Side, yeah, I had...</span></p> <p><span id="s912">MS: And, side too.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">AS: Reverse side too.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">MS: But, in general it was able to help many people, and obviously in, in some way it was able to help...</span></p> <p><span id="s915">AS: It helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">MS: It helped you.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">AS: I know it helped me.</span> <span id="s918">I wish it would help some other people, because I heard remarks that it was too gruesome, and people didn't want to watch, because it felt that it was too gruesome, too authentic, and they didn't believe that things like this happened.</span> <span id="s919">And, but, in my case, I know that it really, it was really so close to a, to be authentic that I relived being, cattle train, if you have seen it, I was in the same cattle train going to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s920">Identical, the same thing.</span> <span id="s921">When I saw those trains passing by, that's when I was in it, going into the [unclear] to take a walk, to take a shower, not knowing about it but I was there too.</span> <span id="s922">It, it is just, the everything, the march, when you were marching in your uniforms with, the blue and white in those wooden shoes, and, it really brought me out.</span> <span id="s923">But now I understand myself better.</span> <span id="s924">I understand why it, suddenly now I hate to sew.</span> <span id="s925">Everything now stems from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">MS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">AS: Sitting in the factory constantly...</span></p> <p><span id="s928">MS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">AS: Producing all those uniforms.</span> <span id="s930">All the things now I am intelligent enough to realize this, but I can talk at least now.</span> <span id="s931">I can realize why I am the way I am...</span></p> <p><span id="s932">MS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">AS: Because of the, of, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s934">MS: Of this...</span></p> <p><span id="s935">AS: Just, eh...</span></p> <p><span id="s936">MS: Of this movie bringing it out, and clearing...</span></p> <p><span id="s937">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">MS: And clearing your mind and your heart...</span></p> <p><span id="s939">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">MS: And your conscience.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">AS: I felt that really, the people who survived the war, after the war they all should have been undergoing either psychological treatment or something I think.</span> <span id="s942">This was what it was done wrong.</span> <span id="s943">Because many of these people are bearing this so deep, and they carry this fear for so long.</span> <span id="s944">For many years when I was raising Jeffrey, I was jumping, now middle of the night, not knowing, running to his room to see if he's still in the bed.</span> <span id="s945">I was afraid they will take him away.</span> <span id="s946">And, there is not one night, I was just saying this, that I could sleep with a pleasant dream.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">MS: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s948">[pause] A horrendous experience, horrendous.</span> <span id="s949">[pause] Ann, say that again what you just said about, again you can't hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">AS: You can't hate.</span> <span id="s951">I don't believe in hating.</span> <span id="s952">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s953">MS: Are you saying then that in your heart you feel that, em, well, I don't want to- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s954">MS: We'll go back and ask you a little bit about the children that might have been in the camps, in the labor camps, when you first were placed in them in Poland.</span> <span id="s955">And you of course were saying that there were, you, at, yourself were only ten years of age, and how were you able to remain in the camp at that, at that young age?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">AS: Number one, physically I was well-developed.</span> <span id="s957">I was tall for my age.</span> <span id="s958">Plus, my mother, it's terrible to say, but she forged my papers.</span> <span id="s959">She made my papers that I was twelve years of age.</span> <span id="s960">Otherwise I wouldn't be able to obtain the Jewish star.</span> <span id="s961">When you received the band Jewish star, it meant you are able and strong enough to work.</span> <span id="s962">She couldn't do it for my brother, because he was only six, and that's, this is the reason why he died—and she volunteered to go with him.</span> <span id="s963">He was not the work material yet.</span> <span id="s964">But because I was that, that's why my mother said, you can recall, “You go and work.”</span> <span id="s965">And that's how I survived, because I got the Jewish star.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">MS: So then, you could have been one of the youngest...</span></p> <p><span id="s967">AS: Yes.</span> <span id="s968">I was, I am actually one of the youngest survivors right now.</span> <span id="s969">Whoever survived in my age group who is right now 53 years of age, it's considered the youngest who went to, and survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s970">They are not, not younger than I am.</span> <span id="s971">This I can guarantee.</span> <span id="s972">Because if you are not, you were not able to work, or you were physically not developed, you went right away you were sentenced to die.</span> <span id="s973">And that's what it is.</span> <span id="s974">It didn’t mean not only mentally, physically.</span> <span id="s975">We all at the age of 10, 9 or 10, a young lady start, I was menstruating.</span> <span id="s976">I, they give us so many medications, I didn't menstruate till I was 19 years of age.</span> <span id="s977">They completely poisoned my whole system.</span> <span id="s978">I don't know what I was injected with.</span> <span id="s979">But, they told me I will never be able to bear children.</span> <span id="s980">That's why they call, we call this Jeff our miracle child, because they told me I will never be able to carry, with all these injection what they were injecting, never be able to bear children.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">MS: You, did you remember any of the people that policed the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">MS: Were they Poles, or were they Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">AS: Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">MS: All Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">AS: I think they were all Germans, but in some instance I know there were Poles too.</span> <span id="s987">But mostly, in my camp, where I was, they were also, they were speaking fluently German.</span> <span id="s988">They were worse than men in our camp, German women.</span> <span id="s989">They were, they were terrible.</span> <span id="s990">They were just cruel, mean [pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s991">MS: Some of the other interviews that I had, strangely enough, once or twice someone will relate that actually there was some humanity amongst some of the Nazi or German guards or on their death march, as they were going through the countries, someone, a German just handed him quickly a piece of bread in his hand.</span> <span id="s992">And that seems so amazing to me, but there was never an episode of any kindness that you remember, or anything that was ever...</span></p> <p><span id="s993">AS: I, I had been, I had been, when I was in the labor camp, I had few instances, being young, I was protected by many other women in other, not protected, what can you protect, but they tried to help me.</span> <span id="s994">But, unfortunately, the kindness what you received, many women received in camp.</span> <span id="s995">And not that I am downgrading anybody, because I feel that if it's your life at stake, that you are, you do anything to, how should I say it, to sustain your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">MS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">AS: But we had a lot of Jewish girls, and young womans, which they gave themselves to German to obtain some food, and hoping that they would, they would help them to survive the war or if they would aid them to escape.</span> <span id="s998">At the end, it didn't help so.</span> <span id="s999">But they, they led better life, and they were helped in some way by German.</span> <span id="s1000">But only in many ways you, how shall I say it...</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">MS: Were willing to submit to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">AS: To submit to them, or, they had [unclear] matter of time they were [unclear] few of the women which they were with me in the same camp, they were saying, I was young, but somehow I could never, didn't know what was right and wrong.</span> <span id="s1003">Still my mother must have told me something wrong, because I would never sell myself for a piece of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">MS: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">AS: And, but many did, and they led better life.</span> <span id="s1006">How long, at the end didn't matter, but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">MS: Do you remember how they, how they were treated by the other prisoners if this was obvious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">AS: They, it was very obvious to all of us.</span> <span id="s1009">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">MS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">AS: Who was helped and who was not helped, and, but, I would say that the girls when they received something, they shared with the rest of the mates in the, like food, they rescued some other people.</span> <span id="s1012">They didn't do it out of pleasure, out of, many of them did out of hunger, out of hope to survive, because very easy people say, "Why did you do it?"</span> <span id="s1013">But I felt it was, very easy to say and hard to do.</span> <span id="s1014">When they put gun next to your head, your life seems so precious, that many people would do anything to survive.</span> <span id="s1015">And I don't blame them.</span> <span id="s1016">Because I have seen very lovely, lovely girls, they went to bed with those Germans, the kapos, whatever they were, just to obtain better food, better living quarters, and they were hoping to escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">MS: That's interesting, Ann.</span> <span id="s1018">Ann, any time during your internment in the labor camp, primarily because this is where you spent most of your time, and maybe in Bergen-Belsen...</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">MS: Was there any religious feelings or services or anything of any Jewish content that went on that you were aware of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">AS: No there was not at all.</span> <span id="s1022">Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">MS: And what about in the Polish work camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">AS: Not at all.</span> <span id="s1025">Not at all.</span> <span id="s1026">There was no time even for religious things.</span> <span id="s1027">They kept us on the job going to work.</span> <span id="s1028">You came home.</span> <span id="s1029">You barely had to eat.</span> <span id="s1030">Sometimes you got an hour of sleep, and then they were calling us outside.</span> <span id="s1031">They were counting you, like this, every night at a certain time, you were standing over there for four, five hours in the cold.</span> <span id="s1032">You get back and you could get an hour or two hour of sleep you regarded, you were the happiest one.</span> <span id="s1033">It was never, matter of fact, it was somebody [unclear] religious home.</span> <span id="s1034">I always will be a Jew, and, but, it's very hard for me to pray.</span> <span id="s1035">It's extremely hard.</span> <span id="s1036">When I go to synagogue, I go primary out of tradition.</span> <span id="s1037">I am going because I wanted to bring up my ch-, my son in Jewish, in Jewish environment.</span> <span id="s1038">But, I am completely empty when I pray.</span> <span id="s1039">I hope I eventually will change, but it's very hard.</span> <span id="s1040">Either, people what I know, they survived the war, either they became very religious, or they lost, completely lost their faith in God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">MS: Now, that's interesting that you s-, because we know ourselves, amongst our own community we have a family that had been in a concentration camp, and they have maintained their religion very, very strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">AS: Strongly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">MS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1044">And you often wonder how those feelings come again, come on so strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">AS: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">MS: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">AS: But most of my friends, they feel the way I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">MS: It's very hollow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">AS: Very hollow.</span> <span id="s1050">I would lie, if I would say differently...</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">MS: No, there's no reason to l-...</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">AS: I go because of tradition, because I always will be Jewish.</span> <span id="s1053">But it's very...</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">MS: Ann, I want to thank you very much for your, for your, for this interview, and for your comments about your life.</span> <span id="s1055">I know it's been a very difficult experience for you to go through this, but I hope in many ways it will bring you satisfaction to know that actually you have it down on tape, and that it will be a lasting thing for your, for your son—and for yourself too, that your experience is recorded.</span> <span id="s1056">And I thank you once again for sharing it with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">AS: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">MS: It's very kind of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">AS: What I would like to say is the most important thing, it is that Jewish people should never ever forget what happened, because my parents always told me when it happened in Germany, "It could never happen to us."</span> <span id="s1060">And it did happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">MS: So we always have to be on guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">AS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">MS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1064">Thank you, Ann.</span> <span id="s1065">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1066">[tape off?</span> <span id="s1067">then on] Having it forced, you're a doll.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">AS: I am sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">MS: You're a doll.</span> <span id="s1070">Don't be sorry!</span> <span id="s1071">My God, if anybody should be sorry, we should be sorry!</span> <span id="s1072">You know, I, I have thought so many times...</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">AS: [unclear] together [tape off].</span></p></body></html>
