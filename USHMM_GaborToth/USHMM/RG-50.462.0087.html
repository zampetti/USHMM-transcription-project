one.</span> <span id="s3">Simone Horowitz is being interviewed by Sylvia Brockman on October the 19th, 1999.</span> <span id="s4">Simone, please tell me where you were born, and when, and a little bit about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">SH: I was born in Paris, on June 10, 1926, and I was born French.</span> <span id="s6">My parents already were French by that time, but they were born in Russia.</span> <span id="s7">My father came from Minsk and he was born in 1988 [she means 1888], and he left Russia in his teens, after having witnessed the pogroms in Minsk.</span> <span id="s8">He went first to Germany, or Switzerland--I don’t know which one first--but he spent time in both countries.</span> <span id="s9">He didn’t like it, and finally came to France, not too long after living in Russia.</span> <span id="s10">And he settled outside of Paris, in a suburb called Genevilliers, which is close to Asnières, close to Clichy, just northwest of Paris.</span> <span id="s11">My mother was born in Polotsk, which is a small town outside of Leningrad, and she was born in 1898.</span> <span id="s12">She, they both, both of my parents came from a large family and a very observant family.</span> <span id="s13">But my grandfa--my mother’s father, died when she was relatively young.</span> <span id="s14">She was still a young teenager, I think.</span> <span id="s15">I don’t know much, because nobody ever told me much about them, nor about my father’s family either.</span> <span id="s16">But the family, after this tragedy, my mother’s family after this tragedy, left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">SB: You mean the tragedy in Minsk?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">SH: No, no, the tragedy of my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">SB: Oh, of your, I see, oh, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">SH: Yeah.</span> <span id="s21">Left after having lost the father, the breadwinner.</span> <span id="s22">And they were a big family, and they, all but three of the children left for first Canada and then USA.</span> <span id="s23">And they settled most of them in Detroit at first.</span> <span id="s24">My mother, and another younger child--my mother was second from the youngest--lived with the oldest sister in Leningrad.</span> <span id="s25">She was already married.</span> <span id="s26">And I don’t think she had children then, because I know that afterwards she had two children but they were adopted.</span> <span id="s27">So she must have been without children for a long time.</span> <span id="s28">And there was another sister who, one of the older sisters--there were, I think there were eleven children--so there was another sister who settled in France and had been married to a Frenchman.</span> <span id="s29">And that’s how my mother got to know my father, through my uncle during the war.</span> <span id="s30">And that’s a long story which I will tell afterwards when we get to that.</span> <span id="s31">That’s the story of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">SB: Now…</span></p> <p><span id="s33">SH: In a nutshell.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">SB: And when your father came to France, what was his profession there?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">SH: Oh, he was a metal worker.</span> <span id="s36">He was making parts of cars.</span> <span id="s37">And usually, he was under contract from a big factory to do, it was a luxurious car, which looked on the outside like the regular Citroen car, which was very popular then before the war.</span> <span id="s38">But because it was a luxury car, so some part of it, like we do here in America, was changed.</span> <span id="s39">And this is what he was doing.</span> <span id="s40">He was changing the shape of fenders and of the, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">SB: The chassis?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">SH: No, no, the chassis was the same.</span> <span id="s43">But it was all the outside that he was changing--the hood and the trunk, and all the metal parts that could be reworked.</span> <span id="s44">This is what he was doing.</span> <span id="s45">He had a small plant near our house, and he had his workers working with them.</span> <span id="s46">Not too many; it was a small plant.</span> <span id="s47">And this is what he was doing.</span> <span id="s48">And he did that all for all his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">SB: Did you have a comfortable life?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">SH: Very comfortable.</span> <span id="s51">Very middle-aged.</span> <span id="s52">I mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s53">SB: Middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">SH: Middle class, I mean.</span> <span id="s55">Middle class!</span> <span id="s56">Yes, we did well.</span> <span id="s57">We had a car.</span> <span id="s58">We, on weekends we were all over, we used to spend summers on the shore, which not everybody did, but a lot of people did.</span> <span id="s59">All the middle class in France did in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SB: And what happened once the Nazis began to occupy France?</span> <span id="s61">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">SH: Well, we have to go back in ’38 when Munich came first.</span> <span id="s63">I remember that was the summer and then we were in the, at the shore, with my uncle and my aunt and my parents.</span> <span id="s64">And there was a real fear that war would be declared any day.</span> <span id="s65">And instead of finishing our vacation, we, they were talking about coming back home.</span> <span id="s66">And I was terribly worried that my father would be drafted.</span> <span id="s67">And he assured me that he wouldn’t be, because he was already too old.</span> <span id="s68">He had already fought in the First World War.</span> <span id="s69">And so he didn’t think that they would bother him again.</span> <span id="s70">And so was my uncle.</span> <span id="s71">So, at that point, I have to say first that even though my parents were, came from very observant homes, once they left Russia, they left everything behind them.</span> <span id="s72">And we had absolutely nothing really Jewish in the house.</span> <span id="s73">In fact, until Munich, I didn’t even know that I was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">SB: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">SH: Except that I knew we were not like the neighbors, who were Christians.</span> <span id="s76">They, not every one of my neighbors used to go to shul, to church.</span> <span id="s77">But enough of them did for me to ask, “Why didn’t we go to church?”</span> <span id="s78">And my parents said, “Well, we don’t do these things.”</span> <span id="s79">And they never told us why.</span> <span id="s80">So when Munich came, they decided that it was time to tell their children--I have a sister who is two years younger--to tell us where we came from, and who we were, because my father had some of, kind of a premonition that Munich was only, even though Munich came and passed and the war didn’t start for another year, he still had the premonition that something would happen.</span> <span id="s81">And it would be better if we knew what might happen, since he knew that already in Germany there were so many anti-Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s82">He was afraid that it would come to us too.</span> <span id="s83">And we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s84">So, when I found out that I was Jewish, you would think that I was shocked.</span> <span id="s85">But I was shocked in a pleasant way.</span> <span id="s86">Because all of a sudden I realized that we weren’t just from nowhere, you know, that we, we knew we had family in Russia, but that we, we had a connection.</span> <span id="s87">And so I felt much relieved.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">SB: So consequently, since you didn’t know that you were Jewish, you didn’t suffer any antisemitism before this?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">SH: Well there was, no--in our area, in the suburb where we lived, I must say that I had never, ever felt any kind of antisemitism, not even in school, nowhere.</span> <span id="s90">I never even heard the, I mean, I could see on the papers; there were some articles.</span> <span id="s91">But I wasn’t really allowed to read the paper.</span> <span id="s92">It was just like a sneaky…</span></p> <p><span id="s93">SB: So, your family then didn’t have any Jewish friends and any kind…</span></p> <p><span id="s94">SH: Oh yes, they had!</span> <span id="s95">Oh yes, absolutely!</span> <span id="s96">And they talked about it.</span> <span id="s97">But they always talked in Russian.</span> <span id="s98">And I always kept on hearing things, because in those days I could understand it.</span> <span id="s99">So, I wasn’t supposed to ask any questions because I wasn’t supposed to listen.</span> <span id="s100">And, you know, we had a very strict upbringing.</span> <span id="s101">And when we weren’t allowed to do something, it was best not to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">SB: Well, this is interesting, because most families, Jewish families, belonged to Jewish organizations, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s103">SH: Well, you have to realize that before the war, and until way after the war, the French Jewish community was not really very strong.</span> <span id="s104">There were organizations of foreign Jews, who had come in France because of what happened in eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">SB: As refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SH: As refugees.</span> <span id="s107">But the French Jews were very clannish, and they were very, they really didn’t particularly care for eastern European Jews.</span> <span id="s108">And those who came from the, you know, those who came from Germany went together, and the Russian Jews went together.</span> <span id="s109">My parents had a whole slew of them, but they--and if they, at that point, they never talked in front of us about anything that happened, in terms of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s110">And I know there was plenty, because it was in the papers.</span> <span id="s111">Politically it was not a good, a great situation.</span> <span id="s112">But it was all still, even though it was in the open, there was no dangers for Jews, just unpleasantness.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">SB: And consequently, were you aware that some of the Jews had served in the French Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">SH: Probably not, because, you know, I was talking to my husband recently about the Dreyfuss case, and I only learned about it way in the middle of the war, when I began to read more and discuss more with my friends.</span> <span id="s115">We were with the, you know, we had a lot of Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s116">So, that’s when I heard about it, but before, remember, the war started really in ’39 and I was 13.</span> <span id="s117">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s118">SB: When you found out that you were Jewish, what was, aside from your reaction, did you become involved in any Jewish organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SH: There was no way to get involved because my parents didn’t get involved and wouldn’t let me get involved.</span> <span id="s120">There was nothing where we lived anyway.</span> <span id="s121">We didn’t even have a synagogue in our area.</span> <span id="s122">So if you had to do anything, you had to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s123">I went to Paris in high school the first year in ’39 I think.</span> <span id="s124">But I didn’t have the time to really belong to anything because it was, you know, it was like almost an hour trip each way.</span> <span id="s125">And the school hours were long, so the only thing I got out of it was my friends in high school were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s126">As a matter of, just, I don’t know, but we sort of gathered together and, no, I really didn’t have any chance until a few years a couple of years later, when I joined the Jewish Scouts, and I began to learn about Jewish life and Hebrew, and all the things I should have done before.</span> <span id="s127">So I did it a little later than everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">SB: Would you say in general, then, that the Jews in France enjoyed a fairly secure life?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">SH: Well the, not all of them.</span> <span id="s130">Certainly the refugees had a hard time, because they weren’t really, they had a hard time finding some sort of work.</span> <span id="s131">And certainly by the time the war started in ’39, until the occupation of France, which was in June, they managed with whatever they brought with them.</span> <span id="s132">And I suppose that there was some form of help from the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s133">There was an organization.</span> <span id="s134">There was a, in France it was a different kind of organization.</span> <span id="s135">The synagogues are all, I think, they’re part of a consistoire, which is somewhat overlooked by the--not managed by the government, but certainly helped by the government at that point.</span> <span id="s136">And they must have had some form of help.</span> <span id="s137">But it didn’t last very long, because as soon as France was invaded, and that was in June ’40, then everybody had to be on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">SB: Prior to that time, I mean prior to the occupation by…</span></p> <p><span id="s139">SH: By that time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">SB: Yeah, but by, but prior to the occupation, you would assume, then, that the Jewish had a fairly…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">SH: Well the French Jews were pretty well-off.</span> <span id="s142">I would say most of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">SH: Not everyone, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s145">SB: But their life was pretty secure, you would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">SH: Middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">SB: Middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">SH: A lot of professionals.</span> <span id="s149">A lot of professionals.</span> <span id="s150">And some business people.</span> <span id="s151">A lot of them.</span> <span id="s152">You know, the usual, the furriers and tailors and the shoemakers and the, a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s154">Can you tell me specifically how your family’s life changed after the Nazi occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">SH: Well, quite a bit.</span> <span id="s156">When France was invaded, in the middle of June 1940, then like all the Parisians, we were afraid that the Germans would race into the city, because there had been terrible antagonism between Germany and France for generations.</span> <span id="s157">So most of the Parisians, who had any kind of means, left Paris on the road.</span> <span id="s158">Of course they owned cars.</span> <span id="s159">So we found ourselves--first of all we went to my aunt’s house outside of Paris, a weekend house.</span> <span id="s160">And then when they got closer, and the French Army wasn’t fighting, we decided to leave, to go south.</span> <span id="s161">And everybody was on the road.</span> <span id="s162">And I guess you know the story.</span> <span id="s163">There were some Italian planes who strafed the people on the road.</span> <span id="s164">We just missed them, because we knew there was a disaster before.</span> <span id="s165">We saw a lot of problems on the road and people lying on the side.</span> <span id="s166">And then we were as far as we could go.</span> <span id="s167">You know, the gas was extremely hard to get and there were stops on the road, on the way all the time, by the French military, who checked all the papers.</span> <span id="s168">But they didn’t stop really anybody because what could they do with them?</span> <span id="s169">So we ended up outside of Lorient, which is Southern Brittany on the coast.</span> <span id="s170">We stayed in a farm for about, I would say two to three weeks.</span> <span id="s171">And then everything quieted down.</span> <span id="s172">The Germans occupied half of France.</span> <span id="s173">The Vichy government was put in place.</span> <span id="s174">And so we decided to go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s175">But very soon after, in ’41, I believe at the end of the winter, my uncle, who was a pharmacist, on the outside of Paris, from us, was arrested.</span> <span id="s176">And we don’t know why, because at that point, we knew that Jews were being arrested.</span> <span id="s177">And he was, but he was French, and they weren’t arresting French, so they said.</span> <span id="s178">But that wasn’t so, because there were quite a few Frenchmen who got arrested.</span> <span id="s179">And he was put in a prison in Compiègne and from there he was deported to Auschwitz where he died in Pesach, 1942.</span> <span id="s180">That we found out after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">SB: How long ago?</span> <span id="s182">It was almost two years after the Nazis occupied France?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">SH: No, he was arrested in ’41 and he died in ’42.</span> <span id="s184">It was about six months after he was arrested that he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">SB: And you were aware that he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">SH: No, well, we--nobody wanted to believe what happened.</span> <span id="s187">There were rumors that they were sending them to Poland.</span> <span id="s188">Apparently the official word was that they were deported for work, but--and we believed it.</span> <span id="s189">Because we didn’t want to believe that there were concentration camps where they were exterminating people.</span> <span id="s190">Although at that time it wasn’t quite so; they were just killing them, in trucks and in every day.</span> <span id="s191">Crematoria were built a little bit later.</span> <span id="s192">But we didn’t want to believe it.</span> <span id="s193">Nobody wanted to believe it.</span> <span id="s194">So soon after that my father was afraid to stay home, because there was a rumor that if the men were arrested in a family, they would pick up all the other adult males in the family.</span> <span id="s195">So my father decided to go to southern France, which he had to smuggle through the demarcation line.</span> <span id="s196">And he was able to do it and he came outside of Lyon, where he lived, in Vénnissieux, which is the south side.</span> <span id="s197">And he lived there until July ’44, when he was actually, until June ’44, where he was arrested, because he was working for the underground, for the Resistance.</span> <span id="s198">He was put in the Montluc prison [Lyon], and in July 8, 1944, they shot him with 31 other hostages.</span> <span id="s199">[See attached copy of death certificate.]</span> <span id="s200">And there is a monument there.</span> <span id="s201">And it’s in Porte-Les-Valence, it’s about an hour away from Lyon.</span> <span id="s202">With 31 other hostage.</span> <span id="s203">And there’s a monument.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">SB: How did you become aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">SH: I only found out after I came back from Auschwitz and I asked the Red Cross to tell me if they had any news of my father.</span> <span id="s206">Already, in ’44, I had stopped hearing from him, letters.</span> <span id="s207">And I was wondering what happened, whether the mail, which was--of course the Allies had invaded France.</span> <span id="s208">So by June, and this was by the middle of June, three weeks after, I wasn’t hearing from him.</span> <span id="s209">So I suspected that the mail was difficult to reach, because of what happened with the front, the new front in France.</span> <span id="s210">And I left it at that.</span> <span id="s211">So when I was arrested later on, and on the 21st, I think, of July 1944, I was put in Drancy first.</span> <span id="s212">Of course I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself.</span> <span id="s213">But fate here.</span> <span id="s214">I was put into Drancy and there, before we left for Auschwitz, there was a whole bunch of young men, young middle-aged men who came from the Montluc prison, which they, Jews, of course, which they had emptied and sent to Drancy in order to send them to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s215">And when I found out that they were in Lyon, I asked them if they knew about my father.</span> <span id="s216">And they look at each other and one was winking.</span> <span id="s217">So they said, “No, we never heard of him.”</span> <span id="s218">And so I suspected something must have happened.</span> <span id="s219">But since I was optimistic always in those days, I didn’t believe anything happened.</span> <span id="s220">I didn’t want to believe.</span> <span id="s221">And I had, I hoped that nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s222">And then I--that’s what sustained me during the camp to come back, in order to see my father again.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">SB: So your family actually didn’t have time to make any plans to emigrate out of France?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">SH: Well, they could have, because my mother had a big family in Detroit, and they kept on asking them to come.</span> <span id="s225">And they assured my father he wouldn’t have any problems working there, here.</span> <span id="s226">He had a very marketable skill.</span> <span id="s227">But my father didn’t like America and he didn’t want to come.</span> <span id="s228">He hated the materialism of America and he hated the politics, although I can’t say that the French politics were any better, if anything.</span> <span id="s229">So they didn’t really make any plans.</span> <span id="s230">So after he was, after he left, my mother, of course was with us, in our house, until they arrested her in 1942.</span> <span id="s231">It was after June, after my birthday, so it was some time, either the end of June or beginning of July ’42.</span> <span id="s232">And they took her because they couldn’t find my father.</span> <span id="s233">And they didn’t take us.</span> <span id="s234">And I don’t know why, and I never found out why they left us.</span> <span id="s235">But they didn’t want any children at that point.</span> <span id="s236">And she went to Baune La Rolande, which was a collection camp.</span> <span id="s237">One of them in 1942 was in a, was what they call it Vel D'hiver, which was an arena in Paris.</span> <span id="s238">But she went to Baune La Rolande.</span> <span id="s239">And from there she went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s240">But we--I know she was in Baune La Rolande, because we used to get mail from her, for a little while.</span> <span id="s241">And then we didn’t hear anything.</span> <span id="s242">And we were told that they went to work in eastern Germany, in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s243">Deported in eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s244">They didn’t call it “deported”.</span> <span id="s245">They said, “transported”.</span> <span id="s246">But we didn’t hear from her.</span> <span id="s247">And I know they went to Auschwitz, because everybody from Baune La Rolande was transferred to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s248">But I have never heard, never found anything, don’t have any trace of her.</span> <span id="s249">We assume she died there.</span> <span id="s250">There would be no question she was, I don’t think she had the will, nor the ability to fight to survive from ’42 until ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">SB: And where do you think she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">SH: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">SB: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">SH: Everybody went to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s255">Now whether they transported her from Auschwitz to somewhere else, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s256">I really have no way of knowing.</span> <span id="s257">There is no record of, in that particular time of, span of time, of who went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">SB: So…</span></p> <p><span id="s259">SH: None from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s261">Can you tell me whether you were aware of any of the Jewish community organizations, at that time, that were involved in trying to save the Jews or to…</span></p> <p><span id="s262">SH: Not at that time.</span> <span id="s263">Only after we decided, my sister in I, in 1943, I think it was the fall, to leave our house, because it became very hard to live on our own.</span> <span id="s264">Financially we weren’t badly off.</span> <span id="s265">We had some money.</span> <span id="s266">So we were able to sustain ourselves.</span> <span id="s267">But just to be able to, you know, do our shopping for food, and taking care of the house and worry about all the news and studying, because we went back to, of course we continued our school.</span> <span id="s268">And we were--I was just not able to cope with it.</span> <span id="s269">So we decided to go to a Jewish home.</span> <span id="s270">And I can’t tell you how I found out.</span> <span id="s271">I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s272">I probably, well, no, in a way, no, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s273">Because even, as I was going to high school, in order to eat my lunch in high school, I would have had to surrender a lot of my food coupons, which I felt was unfair.</span> <span id="s274">And then we would be put in a certain section because we were Jews.</span> <span id="s275">And I’m not even sure that we were allowed to eat in that high school as Jews.</span> <span id="s276">So, what I found out is that not far from my school there was a, sort of a canteen, run by the Jewish community, for anybody who wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s277">So that was my first connection with a Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s278">And from there I found out that there were some, an organization which took care of those children who were left alone.</span> <span id="s279">And when the time came, I got in touch with them, in ’43, and I went to one of the homes in Paris, because my school was in Paris and it was more convenient.</span> <span id="s280">And my sister went to the, somewhere in the suburb outside of Paris.</span> <span id="s281">And we stayed there until we were arrested in 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SB: Did you hear about or in any way know about the experiences of Jews in other countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">SH: No, really, no, because there was no news, you know.</span> <span id="s284">Everything was terribly sanctioned.</span> <span id="s285">We knew that terrible things happened, that Jews were disappearing from France.</span> <span id="s286">And we knew that the, especially the foreign Jews, we knew, had an extremely difficult time.</span> <span id="s287">They had to hide.</span> <span id="s288">I knew of people who were hiding because by then I joined the Jewish Scouts, who were very, very active in the underground.</span> <span id="s289">So through them I learned a lot of what happened.</span> <span id="s290">Although I didn't want to believe half of what they told us, as always, like everybody else.</span> <span id="s291">And I also helped them in many, many ways, because I wasn’t look--I didn’t really look very Jewish.</span> <span id="s292">I don’t know if I do today, but I didn’t do then.</span> <span id="s293">I was blonde.</span> <span id="s294">I had light colored eyes.</span> <span id="s295">So they asked me to forward some false identification to families who needed it.</span> <span id="s296">And that’s what I was doing.</span> <span id="s297">But they were the ones who provided them.</span> <span id="s298">They were printing them or, the best thing to, we didn’t know what exactly where it came from, who was involved with it, because they were afraid that if you were caught, you would be able--they would force you to talk.</span> <span id="s299">So everything was really undercover.</span> <span id="s300">And we didn’t know as much as we, I would have liked to know.</span> <span id="s301">But I did what they asked me.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">SB: During this period and before, did you have to wear the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">SH: Oh yes, of course, immediately after.</span> <span id="s304">Of course as soon as the Germans invaded even the half of France, and then of course, in ’42 or ’43, I don’t remember, when they invaded the rest of France, we were subjected to all the laws, anti-Jewish laws.</span> <span id="s305">As a matter of fact, very soon after, and my father was already down in the south so therefore it had to be after ’42, after ’41, I have a receipt of a withdrawal of half of our funds in the bank, as Jews, that were forwarded to Vichy.</span> <span id="s306">I still have the receipt.</span> <span id="s307">And I’m still trying to collect.</span> <span id="s308">So soon, I hope to, because it’s so official that I will soon be able to get something out of it.</span> <span id="s309">But it took all these years, they, where they just wouldn’t want to do anything, didn’t want to recognize it, or even denied it.</span> <span id="s310">But very luckily, and I don’t know what kind of a miracle that was, but I kept the receipt.</span> <span id="s311">And I still have it with me.</span> <span id="s312">So there were laws against Jews and we, I mean, we had, for instance, we had some bonds.</span> <span id="s313">And this is how we were able to survive.</span> <span id="s314">And I had to have some non-Jew, of course, some kind of an accountant, to negotiate those bonds for me in order to get some money.</span> <span id="s315">But we couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s316">It was absolutely forbidden.</span> <span id="s317">This was all done in the black market.</span> <span id="s318">So that’s how we were able to survive.</span> <span id="s319">So the laws were very strict, and of course you couldn’t do work and you couldn’t--we had curfew.</span> <span id="s320">I was wearing the star but when I wanted to go out, later, after the curfew, which was 8:00 at night, I would wear a jacket without a star.</span> <span id="s321">And of course I took a big chance, because there was always some kind of a collecting of people, or raffling of people.</span> <span id="s322">I don’t remember how you say that, but where they would just check your identification.</span> <span id="s323">And once when I was eating in that community lunchroom, which by the way was very good for the war--it was probably one of the best places you could eat during the war--there was a check of identification.</span> <span id="s324">But I had nothing to worry at that point.</span> <span id="s325">I had the right identification.</span> <span id="s326">I was French, and I had my star, so, but I remember a woman jumped out of the window.</span> <span id="s327">And we were on the second or third floor, and she managed to escape that way.</span> <span id="s328">So we knew they were serious about checking identification, and taking away all the foreigners.</span> <span id="s329">And this was done by the French, by the way, under the Vichy command.</span> <span id="s330">I suppose they were forced by the Nazis to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">SB: But how about the general population of the French?</span> <span id="s332">How did they react to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">SH: Well, you have to know that the French, roughly, 55, 50% of the French, were right-wingers, which is Nazi sympathizers.</span> <span id="s334">The other half were totally anti-Nazi, and many of them fought.</span> <span id="s335">So, it depended where you were.</span> <span id="s336">In my area, where I lived, we happened to be in an anti-Nazi area.</span> <span id="s337">They--so, I didn’t feel threatened as such.</span> <span id="s338">But we were always aware that--and I must say also that my neighbors really helped us.</span> <span id="s339">They never, never touched anything in our house, including after we left, all the way until after the war.</span> <span id="s340">When I came back, everything was intact.</span> <span id="s341">They didn’t touch, they didn’t do, and as a matter of fact, they watched over the house.</span> <span id="s342">So, I had a very unusual, we lived in a very unusual street area, or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s343">Because they knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s344">We weren’t, you know, my parents couldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s345">We were so different.</span> <span id="s346">And we lived a little bit differently.</span> <span id="s347">Nobody had a car around us.</span> <span id="s348">But nobody was envious.</span> <span id="s349">My father was very nice to them, and they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s350">So, I must say I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s351">Because I had a lot of friends who lived in Paris in buildings where the minute they left their apartment everything was taken.</span> <span id="s352">And the apartment was taken.</span> <span id="s353">They couldn’t even recover it after the war.</span> <span id="s354">So I know those things existed, but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s355">These things, I didn’t have any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">SB: Was, your sister was how many years younger?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">SH: Two years younger than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">SB: And did she go along with you in all of these things that you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">SH: Well, she had very little choice.</span> <span id="s360">She was younger.</span> <span id="s361">She certainly was a little more, very mature anyway.</span> <span id="s362">She was a favorite of my father, and of course not being with him was very hard for her.</span> <span id="s363">And of course when she found out after the war--well, I’ll talk about it later--that he had died, it had a devastating effect on her and she never recovered from it since.</span> <span id="s364">So she went along with me, and we sort of supported each other at that point.</span> <span id="s365">Of course we had a hard time, because we didn’t get along too well.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">SB: And you said before that you were working in the underground…</span></p> <p><span id="s367">SH: Yeah, well, in my own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">SB: And that you delivered…</span></p> <p><span id="s369">SH: I delivered false papers to the families.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">SB: Was your sister also involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">SH: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s372">No, no, because we lived in different places.</span> <span id="s373">She lived in a suburban, one of the homes for the children in a suburb, near Versailles, so that’s quite a distance.</span> <span id="s374">So, no, she was too young to do it anyway.</span> <span id="s375">And, I mean, she lived in a Jewish home, but I don’t know how much Jewish life they had in the home.</span> <span id="s376">In the one where I was, it was very Jewish.</span> <span id="s377">We had Friday night service with a young man who had gone to yeshiva, who was, had a good voice, and had services.</span> <span id="s378">And there were some courses in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s379">There were some courses in Jewish history in that home.</span> <span id="s380">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s381">For me, it was great.</span> <span id="s382">This was just what I was looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">SB: And it really gave you a feeling of Jewishness that you didn’t have before.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">SH: Oh, absolutely!</span> <span id="s385">Yeah, and I was looking for it, and I found it there, which was one of the reasons I was so happy.</span> <span id="s386">And I told my father about it, and he was very happy that I did, because he realized he had made a big mistake not to tell us earlier or give us some form of Jewish life.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">SB: O.K.</span> <span id="s388">So when were you arrested and taken to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s389">Under what circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">SH: Well, in, apparently in July, 1944, the French had orders to arrest all the children who were in those Jewish homes.</span> <span id="s391">And there is a big question whether the Jewish community, the organization, which is UGIF, it’s called, it’s--I never know how to translate it, but anyway, it was the main organization allowed by the German, and the Vichy government, to take care of all the Jewish questions, all the Jewish refugees, all the Jewish population in France.</span> <span id="s392">So they had an order to arrest all the children.</span> <span id="s393">And there were like, I must tell you the exact number, because I never quite remember.</span> <span id="s394">There were 350 children that were arrested within two days and put in Drancy.</span> <span id="s395">And I was one of those.</span> <span id="s396">And my sister, whom I found the next day, she came up on the 22nd.</span> <span id="s397">So we were arrested in Drancy.</span> <span id="s398">We went, they came early in the morning.</span> <span id="s399">And I am absolutely positive that the French came, although my friends who were arrested with me made deposition that said that only Germans came.</span> <span id="s400">But I remember seeing that French policeman with that special K.P. they called it, Kap, and his navy blue uniform.</span> <span id="s401">So I know they were, but I suppose for a political reason, the French didn’t want to accept the idea that they were involved in this kind of disgrace.</span> <span id="s402">So they blamed the Germans.</span> <span id="s403">But I know it was done by the French police like they did when they arrested my mother.</span> <span id="s404">And they took us, they told us to take whatever we had.</span> <span id="s405">We didn’t have any time to take a suitcase, so they said, “Put everything in a sheet.”</span> <span id="s406">And we took our bundle and went to Drancy by, well, it’s not exactly a bus.</span> <span id="s407">I think it’s more like a police car, a big car, where they used to put inmates there.</span> <span id="s408">And that’s how we ended up in Drancy.</span> <span id="s409">And we stayed from July 21st til July 31st.</span> <span id="s410">No, July 21st, no, until August something.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s412">The 3rd, I think.</span> <span id="s413">No, until July 31st.</span> <span id="s414">That’s right.</span> <span id="s415">We stayed in Drancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">SB: In Drancy.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">SH: In Drancy, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">SB: Can you tell me about your life in Drancy?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">SH: Well, we were prisoners.</span> <span id="s420">It was a building that was not finished.</span> <span id="s421">It must have been built for apartment house or something.</span> <span id="s422">So there were some very large rooms.</span> <span id="s423">The stairs were built, the cement stairs, going from one floor to another.</span> <span id="s424">That I remember vividly.</span> <span id="s425">We didn’t have anything to do except to get, collect ourself to get counted.</span> <span id="s426">We went to the yard every so often, just walking.</span> <span id="s427">There was no activities, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">SB: And no forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">SH: Not there.</span> <span id="s430">No, not there.</span> <span id="s431">No, there were, it was just a collection point to send people to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s432">So there was no work.</span> <span id="s433">There was just a lot of people who worked for UGIF and tried, I know now they tried to find out where our relatives were.</span> <span id="s434">And of course we weren’t giving any of that information.</span> <span id="s435">At least the older, the oldest children, weren’t giving any of that information about where their parents were or where the, you know, the family was, and friends.</span> <span id="s436">We tried not to say anything, because we knew that they would be arrested eventually.</span> <span id="s437">So, that’s the only thing that we did then.</span> <span id="s438">It only lasted ten days, so…</span></p> <p><span id="s439">SB: And after ten days?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">SH: They collected us and took us to a train, which was right nearby.</span> <span id="s441">Or maybe they put us on a bus to take us to a train.</span> <span id="s442">I don’t really remember that very well.</span> <span id="s443">But they took us on a cattle train, 60 by car.</span> <span id="s444">And there were, of course as I said there were 350 children.</span> <span id="s445">And they asked the older girls to take care of the younger boys.</span> <span id="s446">I took care of a little three, four-year-old, to look after him.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">SB: Were they the youngest ones, the three and four-year-olds?</span> <span id="s448">Or were there any younger ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">SH: There probably were some younger, but they probably were with their mothers.</span> <span id="s450">But there were a lot of three, four-year-olds who had no one.</span> <span id="s451">Maybe five, also five years old.</span> <span id="s452">So they asked us to take care of them, to see that they should be in the facilities or whatever they had down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">SB: Were the guards cruel?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">SH: Not in Drancy.</span> <span id="s455">Then once we were in the car, piled in, we heard the Ger--there was strictly guarded by Germans, and dogs.</span> <span id="s456">And we heard them bark…</span></p> <p><span id="s457">SB: In France?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">SH: Yeah, in France.</span> <span id="s459">From France on.</span> <span id="s460">And they were barking and, you know, and scaring everybody and…</span></p> <p><span id="s461">SB: Let me go back for a moment.</span> <span id="s462">When you were in Drancy, the guards were German or French?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">SH: There were some Germans, but…</span></p> <p><span id="s464">SB: They were French.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">SH: Yeah, mostly French.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">SB: And they were not cruel?</span> <span id="s467">They…</span></p> <p><span id="s468">SH: There was, I don’t remember seeing anything, you know, that would have scared me to the point of, I mean, I was scared enough to, you know, to know where we were going and what will happen to us.</span> <span id="s469">But aside from there I didn’t see any life-threatening events, there.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">SB: And the food was adequate?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">SH: Well, no.</span> <span id="s472">I mean, the food was, we were, we took some stuff with us.</span> <span id="s473">And some people got some packages during these ten days and we shared.</span> <span id="s474">I didn’t, because there was nobody to send to me.</span> <span id="s475">I didn’t want to tell my aunt what happened.</span> <span id="s476">I’m sure she found out sooner.</span> <span id="s477">I had an aunt in France, the aunt whose husband was arrested and sent to Compiegne and then to Auschwitz, I knew she would find sooner or later where we were, but I wasn’t sure that she would send me a package.</span> <span id="s478">And I didn’t want to, I did send a card to my friends, who lived in that same town, with whom I grew up--And I’ll tell you about it later--that we were there, but we didn’t receive anything.</span> <span id="s479">We just shared with those who did get something.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">SB: So during the ten days that you were in Drancy, you really didn’t suffer too much, except for being incarcerated.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">SH: Yeah, that’s right, you know, and not knowing what would happen, and wondering what happened to my father, and who would tell him.</span> <span id="s482">That’s how I sent a card to my friend, telling him to tell, telling them to tell my father what happened.</span> <span id="s483">And, but of course I didn’t know my father was already dead by then.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">SB: And all of this time you were not aware of what was going on with the other European Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">SH: Very vaguely.</span> <span id="s486">We knew they were transported to a work camp and the conditions were terrible, just like the French camps.</span> <span id="s487">They arrested a lot of foreigners into many camps in France and we knew the conditions were appalling.</span> <span id="s488">You know, overcrowding and no food and no hygiene and no medication.</span> <span id="s489">And this we knew.</span> <span id="s490">So we were afraid this is what would happen to us.</span> <span id="s491">That we were afraid.</span> <span id="s492">To know, to tell you that I knew about crematoria at that time?</span> <span id="s493">No, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s494">Or if I heard, I wouldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s495">And I wasn’t the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">SB: Now, between 1942, then, and 1945, you did have contact still with some of your friends and with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">SH: Well, ’45, you mean ’44.</span> <span id="s498">Because ’45 is where I was in camp as of August, ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s500">So, from 1942 until you were taken to Auschwitz, then, you did have contact, then, with some members of your family?</span> <span id="s501">Your aunt and…</span></p> <p><span id="s502">SH: Well, I had an aunt, and she continued to run the pharmacy.</span> <span id="s503">And the Germans were trying, or the French were trying to force her to tell them that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s504">But because she didn’t spell her name as my mother, which is Ifliandik, and the E in different languages spells differently.</span> <span id="s505">In one language it’s an I.</span> <span id="s506">In another language it’s like, like in French.</span> <span id="s507">In English it’s an E. And in Russian is a U.</span> <span id="s508">So therefore the name wasn’t the same.</span> <span id="s509">My family in Detroit, my mother’s family in Detroit, spell it differently than my mother because of that first letter.</span> <span id="s510">So she told them she was not her sister, that’s all.</span> <span id="s511">And they even threatened her to take a blood sample to try to find out.</span> <span id="s512">They said that it would show in her blood that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s513">At that point I told her, and I knew, that this is, it was just a lot of bunk, because you can’t tell from a blood test that you become Jewish.</span> <span id="s514">It was just intimidation.</span> <span id="s515">And she was smart, I mean, you know, she kept her head on her shoulders.</span> <span id="s516">And so she was not arrested.</span> <span id="s517">She stayed until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s518">And her son was two years older than me.</span> <span id="s519">He managed to, while he was in school first and then he went and hid himself in many places.</span> <span id="s520">He even went to my father down in the south but he couldn’t stay because he realized that my father was deep in, up to his ears in the underground.</span> <span id="s521">And he was afraid that if he was to do that as a young man, at that point he would be arrested.</span> <span id="s522">So he, I don’t know, he managed to move around.</span> <span id="s523">And then he came back to Paris and felt that the best place to hide was in Paris because there were a lot of people and you could always hide better in a big city than in a farm.</span> <span id="s524">So he survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">SB: And did he ever tell you about what kind of underground work your father did?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">SH: He told me that he couldn’t be specific because he could see that the people my father dealt with always were very secretive.</span> <span id="s527">And when they had something to say, they wouldn’t say it in front of a stranger, not even in front of him.</span> <span id="s528">So he understood.</span> <span id="s529">And he didn’t ask too much, because as always, the more you knew, the more you were afraid that you would, if you were arrested, that you would be tortured to tell.</span> <span id="s530">So he was smart enough not to insist, but he saw right away that they were working.</span> <span id="s531">I don’t know what they were doing, probably planting bombs or alerting people of what happened or maybe they had information that trains were moving and somebody had to blow them.</span> <span id="s532">I mean there’s so many things that happened on those days.</span> <span id="s533">This was really the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s535">Now, let’s go back when you were arrested and taken into the cattle car.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">SH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">SB: Describe the conditions in the cattle car at this point, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">SH: Well, it was appalling, you know.</span> <span id="s539">It was so overcrowded.</span> <span id="s540">They had one big bucket for the facilities, for bathroom, with some kind of a, we put a curt--a sheet around to have some form of privacy.</span> <span id="s541">They emptied it only once a day when they opened the car, when they stopped, and it usually was at night.</span> <span id="s542">During, I’m sorry, during the day.</span> <span id="s543">At night the train rolled.</span> <span id="s544">During the day most of it, it was stopped.</span> <span id="s545">The crowding was awful.</span> <span id="s546">We only ate what we had.</span> <span id="s547">There was hardly enough water.</span> <span id="s548">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s549">I sat on top of bundles near the window.</span> <span id="s550">There was a teeny window with a bar, and I could see what happened.</span> <span id="s551">I know at one point that some people I knew, older men, who were part of the train which I had seen in Auschwitz, I mean in Drancy, tried to escape, and I saw a whole bunch of men walking on the ground naked, being taken to the first car, because they had tried to escape.</span> <span id="s552">So we knew things were really desperate.</span> <span id="s553">And then I had to take care of that little boy.</span> <span id="s554">And there were a lot of little children.</span> <span id="s555">There was the crying and it was just awful.</span> <span id="s556">And they opened the doors only once a day.</span> <span id="s557">That was it.</span> <span id="s558">So it was a…</span></p> <p><span id="s559">SB: And how long was your trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">SH: Three, I think three days.</span> <span id="s561">Something like that.</span> <span id="s562">And we arrived in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s563">It may have been four days.</span> <span id="s564">At that point it was very difficult to have any concept of dates, because you know, you didn’t have a calendar.</span> <span id="s565">You leave and it seemed to be forever, that trip.</span> <span id="s566">So we arrived, but I know, I remember, we arrived in the evening, late.</span> <span id="s567">And they told us to get down.</span> <span id="s568">There were some German.</span> <span id="s569">You know, “Raus, raus!”</span> <span id="s570">You know, the way they talk.</span> <span id="s571">With dogs.</span> <span id="s572">And there were some inmates with the striped uniform.</span> <span id="s573">I understand there was a Frenchmen or two there with a stripe, but I didn’t hear them.</span> <span id="s574">Some others did.</span> <span id="s575">The train was, I don’t know how many cars.</span> <span id="s576">There were thirt--there were 1300 I think in that train.</span> <span id="s577">So if you have 60 per wagon, so you can figure there’s a little over 20 cars.</span> <span id="s578">So there were some Frenchmen who told some people what would happen.</span> <span id="s579">But I didn’t see it.</span> <span id="s580">The only thing I knew is that we have to get off, not to take anything with us.</span> <span id="s581">And we have to jump down.</span> <span id="s582">And of course some people were afraid to jump down.</span> <span id="s583">There were people that were older.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s585">SB: This is side two of tape one, of the interview with Simone Horowitz, who will now continue.</span> <span id="s586">You jumped down from the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">SH: We jumped down from the train, and I remember the little boy who was with me didn’t have any shoes, so I had to carry him.</span> <span id="s588">And when I got to the, we got to the head of the line, there was there, there were two Germans with dogs, German Shepherd dogs.</span> <span id="s589">And there were, Mengele was there.</span> <span id="s590">And he had the stick and then he pointed to the left or to the right.</span> <span id="s591">And by the way, the train arrived in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s592">At that point, all the trains came to Birkenau.</span> <span id="s593">So he asked me in German whether the little boy was mine, and I said, “No.”</span> <span id="s594">I guess he realized he wasn’t my child.</span> <span id="s595">I was only 18, barely 18.</span> <span id="s596">So he said, “Well let him go.”</span> <span id="s597">And I let him go, and they took him, I don’t remember, the right, with all the other little children, and I went to the left, which was the right of Mengele.</span> <span id="s598">And so there were about, I would say about 60, 70 women, maybe less, I don’t know, maybe 50, who came to the camp.</span> <span id="s599">All the rest were gassed.</span> <span id="s600">Because the men were taken in a different area.</span> <span id="s601">So I, this was, they went to a, they were sent to another place.</span> <span id="s602">And then we found ourselves together, taken to a big building.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">SB: Just one moment.</span> <span id="s604">Did any of the mothers, or older girls, or any older person, refuse to leave the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">SH: Oh yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s606">As a matter of fact, the directress of our home didn’t want to leave the younger children because she had been taking care of them for quite a while.</span> <span id="s607">She wanted to go with them.</span> <span id="s608">And they all ended up in the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s609">And of course the mothers wouldn’t part with their children.</span> <span id="s610">That’s also true.</span> <span id="s611">No, we were all single, or we had left some of the young women, who were with me, had left the rest of the family behind.</span> <span id="s612">If there was a mother, she pushed them to go, you know, not to go with them.</span> <span id="s613">Because some of them, apparently, had the notion that if you were separated it would be best that you go with the young people and then they would go with the others, because if you put the young people together, that those who were able to, strong enough and to work, they would have a better chance to survive, or something like that.</span> <span id="s614">It was an innate instinct you see to go, and besides, we didn’t have much choice.</span> <span id="s615">It was very difficult to go to a different place, if you were sent in one place, because they would beat you up.</span> <span id="s616">And some were beaten up.</span> <span id="s617">So, there was no point to.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">SB: So Mengele, then, did the Selektsia, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s619">SH: He did all of them, all the trains that came in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s620">I understand he was there to do the selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">SB: And now with you, he had chosen you and your sister…</span></p> <p><span id="s622">SH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">SB: …and a lot of the other younger women.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">SH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">SB: Now continue from there and tell me what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">SH: Well, it was in, at night, and we were taken to a big place, a big building, a building.</span> <span id="s627">It looked big but I, of course after having been in a, confined in a cattle car for three, four days, I mean anything would look bigger.</span> <span id="s628">I have never been back there to really realize how big this place was.</span> <span id="s629">But we were told to undress, to leave everything we had.</span> <span id="s630">And then they shaved us, took all our hair off, sent us to the next room where we had a shower, cold shower, no soap, no towel.</span> <span id="s631">Of course we now know that it was either a shower or the gas.</span> <span id="s632">We were lucky we had a shower.</span> <span id="s633">And after we finished showering--I don’t know how long it took--they collected us and took us in another room.</span> <span id="s634">And then they gave us some rags to put on us.</span> <span id="s635">For some reason we kept our shoes at that point, and I had a good pair of shoes, a very good.</span> <span id="s636">It belonged to my father who was rather short and I was probably bigger than him by that time.</span> <span id="s637">So I kept these shoes because they were heavy leather shoes and I, somehow I took that and I kept them.</span> <span id="s638">And then for a long time that helped.</span> <span id="s639">So we got dressed, and then they took us to the bunk where we were supposed to be, which was a long building.</span> <span id="s640">They were made of wood.</span> <span id="s641">They were not bricks like in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s642">They were made of wood.</span> <span id="s643">They had, in the center there was a, like a long wall, but not a wall but like a long, well, where they had the, some kind of a pipe inside.</span> <span id="s644">And they would heat a little, at one end and it was supposed to heat the whole place.</span> <span id="s645">That divided the place into two but you could step over it.</span> <span id="s646">It was very long.</span> <span id="s647">And then on each side they had bunks, three-tiered bunks, where you put four to six in a bunk, depending on how crowded the camp was.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">SB: So each person had a bunk?</span> <span id="s649">Or some people shared, two people shared one bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">SH: No, no, we had four, six on each tier of bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">SH: Which had three tiers.</span> <span id="s653">And we were given some form of a blanket.</span> <span id="s654">That’s all we had.</span> <span id="s655">And I think they gave us, well afterwards they gave us like a container what you would eat from a liquid part of the food.</span> <span id="s656">But that was for three, four, or five, depending on how big it was.</span> <span id="s657">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s658">And we were, we went to sleep and it must have been around 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, and at 5:30 we were wakened up by the Kapo, who were brutal people.</span> <span id="s659">Mostly, the ones who were in our area were Czech.</span> <span id="s660">There were others, there were Polish and others, but the one that I, we had to deal with, that French contingent, they were Slovakians.</span> <span id="s661">And they were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">SB: And there were no Jewish Kapos?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">SH: I don’t know whether they were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s664">Maybe they were.</span> <span id="s665">But we had no way of knowing, because we couldn’t have any contact with them.</span> <span id="s666">They spoke whatever their language.</span> <span id="s667">They certainly didn’t speak French.</span> <span id="s668">They absolutely, everyone in the camp hated the French, just like today.</span> <span id="s669">Today they hate the Americans.</span> <span id="s670">Then they hated the French, because they had the wrong perception of what the French women were.</span> <span id="s671">They thought we were all prostitutes and easy women of easy morals.</span> <span id="s672">And they thought that, you know, we had the good life.</span> <span id="s673">And, which was ridiculous.</span> <span id="s674">But this was the perception and so many times we heard from the Kapos and others, “Oh, you French women!</span> <span id="s675">You are so elegant, and you thought you were the best in the world, and look at what state you are now!</span> <span id="s676">Nobody wants to look at you,” or something of the sort, very demeaning.</span> <span id="s677">I mean, life in Auschwitz was so brutal.</span> <span id="s678">So brutal.</span> <span id="s679">Because it, we were lucky we are a group of French girls together, so we could sustain ourselves morally.</span> <span id="s680">And we did.</span> <span id="s681">We, those who had gone to school tried to tell about the books we read, and tried to, you know, the novels we read.</span> <span id="s682">And there was no teaching.</span> <span id="s683">I mean, I understand some, were lucky to have people of Jewish knowledge who taught them something.</span> <span id="s684">But I never had this in the camp.</span> <span id="s685">All the months that I was there, I never had that luck.</span> <span id="s686">And very soon after we came there was a contingent of Budapest Jews who came.</span> <span id="s687">And they put them with us, to fill up the bunk, the barrack, actually, it’s not a bunk.</span> <span id="s688">The barrack.</span> <span id="s689">And I made, I was, I made a connection with one of them, who was a little bit older than me but she had been, she was a pharmacist, and we communicated in very poor English, but both of us had learned English in school.</span> <span id="s690">And this way I had, she told me a little bit about herself and I told her about us.</span> <span id="s691">And it was very pleasant.</span> <span id="s692">But it didn’t last very long because within two weeks the Germans, during one of the Appel [roll call], the Germans asked if there were any nurse, any doctors, pharmacists among us.</span> <span id="s693">And so she said yes, she was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s694">So they took us, they took her, and they took her I think in Auschwitz to work in a, in the famous medical…</span></p> <p><span id="s695">SB: Experiments?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">SH: Well, building, whatever they were doing.</span> <span id="s697">And they were doing experiments on twins in those days.</span> <span id="s698">But we didn’t know of course.</span> <span id="s699">These things were known only afterwards.</span> <span id="s700">And once we were in camp we tried to find out, you know, what it was all about.</span> <span id="s701">It was very difficult.</span> <span id="s702">Most of the inmates were really Polish, or certainly Eastern European.</span> <span id="s703">And those who knew--and it was difficult to get to talk to them.</span> <span id="s704">You had to sort of know Yiddish, if they knew Yiddish, because none of us knew Polish.</span> <span id="s705">Even among some of our friends whose family was Polish, they didn’t speak the language.</span> <span id="s706">If they did speak a little Yiddish.</span> <span id="s707">So we tried to know, but slowly we found out there were some men floating around the camp, even though it was mainly a women’s camp.</span> <span id="s708">And the camp was, Birkenau was divided into sections.</span> <span id="s709">So we didn’t have any contact with the men except those who were responsible for certain specific work that had to be done by the men in the camp.</span> <span id="s710">So, you know, word filtered down what’s happened, you know, by the crematorium.</span> <span id="s711">First of all we had the terrible smell all the time.</span> <span id="s712">So we knew something was not really right.</span> <span id="s713">Where did it come from?</span> <span id="s714">So finally we found out that they, they were burning people.</span> <span id="s715">And, you know, living with that, just with that thought, with that possibility, was frightening enough.</span> <span id="s716">Of course there was no food.</span> <span id="s717">We got food three times a day, so in the morning, right after the Appel, and the Appel it was a collection of everybody by a row of five, in order to count every day, three times a day, how many people were in a camp.</span> <span id="s718">There were several attempts to escape.</span> <span id="s719">Not among us, but certainly among the Polish Jews, who knew the language of the country and who could, who had hope to be able to escape the camp.</span> <span id="s720">So the Appels were constant, and they could last from an hour to three hours, five hours, half a day, if anybody was not around.</span> <span id="s721">So you had to stand up, any weather, any weather.</span> <span id="s722">Sometimes during the rain we would be collected inside the barrack and they would count us there.</span> <span id="s723">Mainly because the Kapos and probably the Germans didn’t want to get wet, or whatever.</span> <span id="s724">But most often it was out, under the brutal sun of August, in, you know, this is in southern Poland, and it can be very bad, and it's in the bottom of a hill.</span> <span id="s725">It can be very muggy.</span> <span id="s726">And in the fall it’s like a swamp, because there’s a lot of rain.</span> <span id="s727">And in the winter there’s a nice amount of snow, so you stood in the snow.</span> <span id="s728">It was just awful.</span> <span id="s729">Three times a day.</span> <span id="s730">So in the morning they gave a black water, which was called coffee but really was chicory.</span> <span id="s731">And then lunch they had some kind of, what they called a soup, which was brought in big barrels--like the coffee, by the way, in barrels--and I suppose they cooked a few potatoes in it, and the peels and the cabbage.</span> <span id="s732">The potatoes never came to us.</span> <span id="s733">It was taken out during the, on the way either by those who worked in the kitchen, those who transported the food, the Kapo, I mean, if we found a leaf of cabbage, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s734">And that’s all we had for lunch.</span> <span id="s735">And for supper they gave you like a, maybe a, less than a quarter of a pound of bread.</span> <span id="s736">And sometimes it was a little pad of margarine.</span> <span id="s737">Sometimes it was a little pat of marmalade or jam.</span> <span id="s738">And sometimes it was one slice of salami.</span> <span id="s739">That’s all we lived on.</span> <span id="s740">It was nothing else.</span> <span id="s741">And you had to eat it right there, because if you left it anywhere, you would never find it.</span> <span id="s742">There was a tremendous amount of stealing.</span> <span id="s743">When we slept, it was best to sleep with our shoes, because otherwise we wouldn’t find them in the morning.</span> <span id="s744">Somebody would take them.</span> <span id="s745">And you never knew who it was.</span> <span id="s746">Of course it wasn’t the one around you.</span> <span id="s747">It was always somebody who was watching what you were wearing.</span> <span id="s748">And in the summer we’d use our blanket as a pillow, but in the winter we didn’t have any pillow.</span> <span id="s749">It was just a straw under your head.</span> <span id="s750">So we used a blanket to cover ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">SB: Did you work at all during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">SH: No, because I came in the camp in August.</span> <span id="s753">And I think by September, some time in September, probably toward the end, I came down with scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s754">There was an epidemic at that time.</span> <span id="s755">And of course I had never had it, so anybody who didn’t have it would catch it.</span> <span id="s756">My sister also had it a few days later.</span> <span id="s757">So they isolated us in the so-called infirmary, the barrack which was just to put us away so the rest wouldn’t catch it.</span> <span id="s758">But there was no medicine.</span> <span id="s759">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s760">They just let you stay in the, in a bed.</span> <span id="s761">If you were strong enough, you could get up for the Appel, because they had the Appel there too.</span> <span id="s762">And there we were subjected to the Selektion more often than the rest of the camp.</span> <span id="s763">But this was already toward the end of the camp life.</span> <span id="s764">I have to say that the Russians were not far.</span> <span id="s765">We heard the bombing very, and all day.</span> <span id="s766">Very, you know, in the distance.</span> <span id="s767">And in many ways that’s what kept us, our morale, up.</span> <span id="s768">Because we knew that eventually that camp would be liberated.</span> <span id="s769">Of course we didn’t know that the Germans would put everybody on the road and empty the camp before the Russians came.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">SB: So you had no routine as far as work is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">SH: Not then.</span> <span id="s772">Not until after I was sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s774">And then they took count of the number of people who were in there…</span></p> <p><span id="s775">SH: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">SB: Still three times a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">SH: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">SB: And…</span></p> <p><span id="s779">SH: The only kind of work was those who volunteered to do this kind of medical work, that was associating with medical work.</span> <span id="s780">They were separate from us and taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s781">Otherwise not.</span> <span id="s782">I remember one day, and it was before the time that I was sick, they took us to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s783">We were in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s784">It’s about, I would say, three to five miles away.</span> <span id="s785">It’s hard to say.</span> <span id="s786">I think it’s 5km.</span> <span id="s787">So it’s under three miles.</span> <span id="s788">They took us all on a road in five, in, you know, like two by two, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s789">And there we took a shower there.</span> <span id="s790">I don’t know whether the shower in Birkenau wasn’t working, but for some reason they took us there.</span> <span id="s791">Which in a way was what also saved me because this way I knew how to go to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s792">You know, the road to go to.</span> <span id="s793">And then they took us back by the evening.</span> <span id="s794">It's the only thing I remember that were outside the routine of the camp.</span> <span id="s795">Then after I was sick, then I went to the infirmary and stayed there until, and I think it lasted about, oh, I don’t remember, a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s796">But by then at the end, then I caught either typhus or typhoid.</span> <span id="s797">I don’t know because they had no way of testing.</span> <span id="s798">But I had to stay in isolation in that infirmary.</span> <span id="s799">My sister recovered, and there was another woman who also stayed with me, another French girl, who stayed also with me in the infirmary until the end like me.</span> <span id="s800">But I don’t, I didn’t remember her until very recently.</span> <span id="s801">They told me afterwards.</span> <span id="s802">But my sister, and whoever else was with us, caught the, that scarlet fever and got better, went back to the camp.</span> <span id="s803">By the beginning of October there was a selection throughout the camp, plus in our infirmary.</span> <span id="s804">But I was still strong enough and didn’t show exaggerated sign of emaciation.</span> <span id="s805">So I, they let me stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">SB: Was Mengele also making this selection?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">SH: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s808">As a matter of fact, I remember there was an Austrian woman whom I met there, an older woman.</span> <span id="s809">And she talked him out of taking her to the crematorium because she spoke beautiful German.</span> <span id="s810">She was from Vienna.</span> <span id="s811">And in many ways she was rather interesting, because she had supposedly had a good life in Vienna and told us all about it and all the food they ate.</span> <span id="s812">But one of the terrible things in camp is we were starving but we were always talking about what we ate before, and what we would eat afterwards.</span> <span id="s813">That was really torture, but we did it.</span> <span id="s814">And she talked him out of taking her to the crematorium, and she managed to do it because she spoke German.</span> <span id="s815">And he let her stay.</span> <span id="s816">Another woman, who was a Polish woman who spoke German also, but she had a child with her.</span> <span id="s817">And that child had the scarlet fever so she stayed with the child in that bunk, in that isolation barrack.</span> <span id="s818">But she couldn’t talk Mengele into saving her, because she had the child, which was illegal in the camp, and she stayed with him.</span> <span id="s819">And so he sent her to the gas.</span> <span id="s820">And she knew because the selection was done and they took them the next very early morning.</span> <span id="s821">She was wailing throughout the night.</span> <span id="s822">It was just absolutely unreal.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">SB: So there were no children at all.</span> <span id="s824">They were…</span></p> <p><span id="s825">SH: There were no young children in Birkenau legally.</span> <span id="s826">Now, if anyone was smuggled and stayed there, I didn’t see them because that, they had to stay hidden.</span> <span id="s827">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s828">I, some say there were but I never saw any, another one, except in that bunk.</span> <span id="s829">And that’s how he ended up.</span> <span id="s830">I mean, they found the child and the mother and they sent both into the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">SB: How many people, do you judge, were in the camp at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">SH: Impossible to tell.</span> <span id="s833">I don’t even know how many people were in that barrack.</span> <span id="s834">It’s, you know, you’d have to look into, there is a lot of books written about the camps.</span> <span id="s835">And, but meanwhile, as I explained to you, there was a, that selection.</span> <span id="s836">And they also selected the rest of the camp and took all the able-bodied of my barrack, went to Czechoslovakia, to work.</span> <span id="s837">And my sister went with all my friends.</span> <span id="s838">So I found myself with only one French girl there.</span> <span id="s839">I found another one later on when they transferred her outside of that barrack and put her somewhere else.</span> <span id="s840">[unclear], before the end of the war.</span> <span id="s841">Wait, let me finish.</span> <span id="s842">And they all went into Czechoslovakia to work.</span> <span id="s843">The rest stayed in camp, whoever was not selected to go to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s844">So that’s how I found myself staying in camp, in Birkenau, not working.</span> <span id="s845">This was already in October.</span> <span id="s846">And by the end of October, not even the very end of October, they stopped using the crematoria.</span> <span id="s847">They only burned those who died, of all kind of reasons.</span> <span id="s848">So, this is, you know, this was a break for us, who managed to survive at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">SB: So, what did you do during the day in between the taking roll, to find out how many people were there?</span> <span id="s850">What was your routine?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">SH: Well at that point I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s852">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s853">I had a big fever and I had the…</span></p> <p><span id="s854">SB: But even before you got sick, what…</span></p> <p><span id="s855">SH: Nothing!</span> <span id="s856">We did nothing!</span> <span id="s857">We sat around, mostly outside, except if it rained, and we talked to each other.</span> <span id="s858">At one point we, they told us to bring some stuff from one end of the camp to the other, and then bring it back.</span> <span id="s859">For a few days they did.</span> <span id="s860">But that was it.</span> <span id="s861">There was--our group was not involved in work in Auschwitz at that point.</span> <span id="s862">And those who were involved in work were sent to work into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s863">In other words, at that point, Auschwitz was--I mean Birkenau, which I should talk about because I don’t know, Auschwitz was another camp not far--at that point the camp was just a collection point of people who could survive the hard condition of life in camp, but who would be strong enough to go to work.</span> <span id="s864">And the work was in other camps.</span> <span id="s865">They took people to other camps.</span> <span id="s866">But in Auschwitz, per se, there was no work.</span> <span id="s867">There were some people who worked from Auschwitz, but not in our area of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">SH: Because I know there were people who were taken every morning, who had to go outside of the camp, walking, do some form of work.</span> <span id="s870">Some of them worked in factories, because there was a lot of factories around, and came back at the end of the day.</span> <span id="s871">That’s why they were always counting us so carefully, because there were people who went outside.</span> <span id="s872">And there was always a chance of escaping.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">SB: I see.</span> <span id="s874">Were there any religious services at all during that…</span></p> <p><span id="s875">SH: Absolutely nothing!</span> <span id="s876">The only thing we found out, as I explained to you, one day we were taken to Auschwitz to take a shower there.</span> <span id="s877">And while we passed the head of the, of that particular camp--the camp was divided into sections--that section of the camp, when we passed that place where he lived--it’s not a house; it’s not a, it’s the guard's house really--the window was open and that dope had a big map of Europe on the wall.</span> <span id="s878">And wherever the Germans were, there was a German flag; and wherever the Allies came, or the Russians, he had the flag of the country.</span> <span id="s879">So we saw that.</span> <span id="s880">In Paris, the flag was the French flag.</span> <span id="s881">And even a little further there was a flag.</span> <span id="s882">So we knew that the war was going on and that things were almost finished in France for them.</span> <span id="s883">But that’s the only thing that we knew.</span> <span id="s884">We, there was no way to know anything else.</span> <span id="s885">And sometimes some of the Polish men who worked in the camp would give some news to somebody.</span> <span id="s886">And it would run like a wildfire through the camp.</span> <span id="s887">And that’s the only way we knew.</span> <span id="s888">And there was very little of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">SB: Was there any one particular figure in the camp who helped you, and others, to hold on, to struggle to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">SH: Well, not really.</span> <span id="s891">You know, I was sick for so long that I was probably, you know, many days I was sleeping more than anything else.</span> <span id="s892">And it was just a vegetative life, with not much.</span> <span id="s893">Then they emptied the, as I said, they emptied this isolation barrack and put us in another one.</span> <span id="s894">That day I met another French girl, who had been in France.</span> <span id="s895">As a matter of fact I knew her brother, but I found out only slightly later she had been in France and she lived, I think, around Grenoble.</span> <span id="s896">She had an affair with a German and she got pregnant and they sent her to Auschwitz as a reward.</span> <span id="s897">And then she had the child while we were there.</span> <span id="s898">And I’m sure they induced the labor.</span> <span id="s899">Or the child was prematurely born because of the kind of life she--and she tried to hide, and she hid for quite a long time.</span> <span id="s900">Of course the infant died, and then she remained there for a long time.</span> <span id="s901">She also came down with typhus or whatever.</span> <span id="s902">And this camp was essentially, this barrack was essentially of those who were sick with typhus.</span> <span id="s903">And we stayed there until they emptied the camp.</span> <span id="s904">They emptied the camp in stages.</span> <span id="s905">We were the very last one to be put on the road, the sick ones.</span> <span id="s906">And we were marched.</span> <span id="s907">It was in January.</span> <span id="s908">January of ’45.</span> <span id="s909">Snow on the ground.</span> <span id="s910">Very cold.</span> <span id="s911">And they marched us for a while.</span> <span id="s912">And all of a sudden, after a while we found ourselves alone.</span> <span id="s913">The guards left.</span> <span id="s914">It was really that late in the war.</span> <span id="s915">The Russians were really around.</span> <span id="s916">We, the cannon noise was already deafening and pretty close.</span> <span id="s917">And we were really very scared.</span> <span id="s918">So we didn’t know where they wanted to send us, but we found ourselves alone.</span> <span id="s919">So we finally decided to go into the homes.</span> <span id="s920">There were homes on the road, houses.</span> <span id="s921">And so some of us, the French, we were three French girls together at that point, we went into one of the homes.</span> <span id="s922">There were already some people there, in a basement.</span> <span id="s923">And we stayed there for a whole week, with a quarter of a pound of bread.</span> <span id="s924">That’s it.</span> <span id="s925">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s926">SB: For the whole week.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">SH: For the whole week.</span> <span id="s928">And then we sometimes melted snow and broke furniture.</span> <span id="s929">And they melted, so sometimes we ate the snow.</span> <span id="s930">But, the clean snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">SB: When you first started out of Birkenau, how many people were with you in that…</span></p> <p><span id="s932">SH: It was a whole, I mean there were quite a few but I can’t tell you in terms of numbers.</span> <span id="s933">It was a long line.</span> <span id="s934">Now I can’t tell you how many.</span> <span id="s935">It was impossible to tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">SB: The guards, or the Kapos, gave you no prior information?</span> <span id="s937">They just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">SH: They just left!</span></p> <p><span id="s939">SB: And…</span></p> <p><span id="s940">SH: In the middle of everything!</span></p> <p><span id="s941">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">SH: They had, apparently they had trucks around, but they just left.</span> <span id="s943">And we found ourself after, you know, after about, I don’t know, half an hour, an hour, that there was nobody around for us.</span> <span id="s944">We were sort of free.</span> <span id="s945">So, but because it was really the front at that point, pretty much the front of the war, we knew that we shouldn’t stay outdoors and try to run.</span> <span id="s946">I had an idea that we were on the way to Auschwitz, and in fact we were.</span> <span id="s947">We were only, I don’t know, maybe fifteen minutes by walk on the road to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">SB: Tell me, when you were in Birkenau, how many, how long altogether were you in Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">SH: Well, I was there from August the 3rd, or 2nd, until January the 5th or the 6th.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">SH: Something like that.</span> <span id="s952">Maybe, maybe January, yeah, something like that.</span> <span id="s953">And the, I think the 8th the camp was emptied.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">SB: O.K.</span> <span id="s955">Now you said…</span></p> <p><span id="s956">SH: And it was…</span></p> <p><span id="s957">SB: That you, the thing that you discussed so very often was food, because you were so hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">SH: Well, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">SB: And you tortured yourself with discussing it, but you, that helped to lift your spirits, the way things were.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">SH: Yeah, we did try to lift our spirits, but I couldn’t talk philosophy to my, to people around me.</span> <span id="s961">I was used to discussing much more serious stuff before but there was nobody to talk to there at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">SB: [laughing] All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">SH: So we had to do the best we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">SB: Yes.</span> <span id="s965">Now, what did you think, or what did the others think in terms of your survival?</span> <span id="s966">Did you think you would go, you were going to get out?</span> <span id="s967">Did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s968">SH: At that point, once we found ourself alone on the road…</span></p> <p><span id="s969">SB: No, I’m talking while you were in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">SH: Well, as I explained to you, I had always the hope to see my father, so I fought in order to survive.</span> <span id="s971">And even though I was sick, you know, I could have let myself go and then I would have been finished.</span> <span id="s972">But I sort of had a spark in me, to say, “Don’t do it.</span> <span id="s973">Don’t do it.</span> <span id="s974">Go back.”</span> <span id="s975">And it was enough during the end of the war to have a hope that we would be able to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">SB: And did you discuss this with the other women and young women in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">SH: Well, remember, at that time the young women were gone.</span> <span id="s978">Whatever I knew were already different people.</span> <span id="s979">Because they were those who were left in the infirmary or in the so-called isolation barrack.</span> <span id="s980">And these were not French.</span> <span id="s981">I only had one I spoke to.</span> <span id="s982">The second one I found when we were moved from one place to another at the very end, before we were put on the road.</span> <span id="s983">So, at that point, yes, we all said to each other, “It’s time, you know, we have to survive.”</span> <span id="s984">And we did try to help each other.</span> <span id="s985">But these gals were not, I mean they were not, they were, I couldn’t discuss too much with them, except life that we had before the war.</span> <span id="s986">That’s all we could do.</span> <span id="s987">They were not on my level and, you know, they hadn’t gone to high school as far as I went.</span> <span id="s988">So it was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">SB: So the Russians actually, while, well nobody so, liberated, so-called liberated your camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">SH: Nobody liberated the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">SB: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">SH: We were marching to it when they came close enough.</span> <span id="s993">As a matter of fact, the Russians knew all the time where Auschwitz was, and we know that today.</span> <span id="s994">Just like they knew that in Warsaw there were, there was a ghetto and they could have liberated it years before, but they didn’t want to.</span> <span id="s995">They weren’t particularly interested in saving Jews anyway.</span> <span id="s996">But when they had to march through they found the camp.</span> <span id="s997">And I remember after staying a week in the basement that two young Russian soldiers--and amazingly, one of them looked like my father, but in a young face.</span> <span id="s998">And I didn’t know how to speak Russian but I could understand because my parents had once spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s999">So in my very broken Russian way, I asked him, “Are we close?</span> <span id="s1000">Or do you know where Auschwitz is?”</span> <span id="s1001">And he said, “Yes, at the end of the road.”</span> <span id="s1002">And that’s how I took myself out after.</span> <span id="s1003">I asked him, “Is it possible to get out?”</span> <span id="s1004">He said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s1005">So I went, by myself, no, with one other woman, but not the, one of the French.</span> <span id="s1006">They were, one of them had frozen feet and the other one was in bad shape.</span> <span id="s1007">They decided to stay.</span> <span id="s1008">But I went with another Polish woman, and we went to the camp, which was not far, maybe 15, 20 minutes walking in the snow.</span> <span id="s1009">It was hard walking, and I didn’t have any strength, but by the time I went there I found out that there was a bunk of, a barrack, of French survivors.</span> <span id="s1010">So they directed me there.</span> <span id="s1011">And then another story of my life started.</span> <span id="s1012">There was another chapter.</span> <span id="s1013">I was able to connect with a French group.</span> <span id="s1014">They were not all Jews.</span> <span id="s1015">Because in Auschwitz they sent some political prisoners from France.</span> <span id="s1016">I met a doctor, a researcher, from Clermont-Ferrand, who was about my father’s age, but he was of tremendous help to me.</span> <span id="s1017">First of all, he told me what to do, where to go, since I was still sick.</span> <span id="s1018">And then while I stayed in, sort of an isolation, infirmary barrack, there they were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">SB: Where?</span> <span id="s1020">Were…</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">SH: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">SB: In Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">SH: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1024">There they took care of me.</span> <span id="s1025">I don’t remember getting much medication, but at least some food, which I first, the very first food I got reaching that place was the wrong food so I got jaundice on top of everything.</span> <span id="s1026">But that eventually cleared, and I stayed in bed for about two, three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">SB: Now, at this point who was in charge of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">SH: I don’t really know.</span> <span id="s1029">I can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s1030">But there must have been some Russians taking care of the camp.</span> <span id="s1031">At that point also the Red Cross took care of it too.</span> <span id="s1032">And the French Red Cross took care of the French contingent.</span> <span id="s1033">And so, but I don’t really know much about it.</span> <span id="s1034">I was still very sick and weak.</span> <span id="s1035">I, and I wasn’t interested in knowing.</span> <span id="s1036">I knew we were liberated, that we were free, and that there would be some way of getting back.</span> <span id="s1037">And this was what I was trying to get, to get back.</span> <span id="s1038">And this doctor helped me and others to get in contact with the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1039">And eventually, I mean we stayed from the beginning of January-- should say the middle of January--until sometime in April, the beginning of April.</span> <span id="s1040">We stayed in that camp because there was no place to go, until they collected enough people to repatriate to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">SB: And how was the sanitation, then, at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">SH: Oh that was, that wasn’t a point.</span> <span id="s1043">It wasn’t bad because we had a more normal life.</span> <span id="s1044">I wouldn’t say it was normal, but we had food and they took care of us as far as health is concerned.</span> <span id="s1045">But there was no kind of study group or any kind of normal life.</span> <span id="s1046">It was still a matter of getting better and survive to be able to get back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">SB: O.K.</span> <span id="s1048">Now when you finally recuperated and you felt strong enough, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">SH: Well then I waited until I could be repatriated.</span> <span id="s1050">We spent the days, you know, like going around, walking and talking.</span> <span id="s1051">And at that point there were many other French, mostly men.</span> <span id="s1052">And you know it was easier, much easier.</span> <span id="s1053">I was in a room with women, and they were, you know, in another bunk with the…</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">SB: And tell me, how were you repatriated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">SH: Oh.</span> <span id="s1056">So the French Red Cross managed to get enough inmates from Auschwitz, forced labor from all around central, all the liberated area, I should say, of Europe, and made a train, a cattle train, to go back to France through Russia.</span> <span id="s1057">So, first we went to Krakow, which was the place where the train left.</span> <span id="s1058">So they kept us in Krakow for about a week, in a school.</span> <span id="s1059">And I remember some very strange things.</span> <span id="s1060">We had a little, they gave us a little money, Polish money, and we tried to supplement our diet.</span> <span id="s1061">So we wanted to find some eggs and cook them.</span> <span id="s1062">So we bought eggs, but no matter how little we cooked they were always hard eggs.</span> <span id="s1063">Until we realized, they were selling us hard cooked eggs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">SB: [laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">SH: And we tried to go around to see a little bit of Krakow, but right around where we were.</span> <span id="s1066">We can’t say that there was an encouragement in doing that, or that we were terribly anxious to do it.</span> <span id="s1067">We knew that the Poles were pretty unpleasant at that point.</span> <span id="s1068">We knew that they had done some terrible things to Jews too.</span> <span id="s1069">They hadn’t helped them.</span> <span id="s1070">We didn’t know the extent to which they were bad.</span> <span id="s1071">And they were retaliatory to the Jews, for those who came back.</span> <span id="s1072">But we knew better.</span> <span id="s1073">And we were told by the Red Cross not to get too close to them anyway.</span> <span id="s1074">So we were warned.</span> <span id="s1075">And we stayed around.</span> <span id="s1076">We tried to get to do things, until the train got, they had enough people in Krakow.</span> <span id="s1077">They put us in the train.</span> <span id="s1078">And I don’t think we had any papers at that point.</span> <span id="s1079">It was just a list.</span> <span id="s1080">They had lists of people.</span> <span id="s1081">We didn’t have any private papers.</span> <span id="s1082">So we couldn’t go very far.</span> <span id="s1083">We couldn’t do much because you never knew if you didn’t have an identification of some form.</span> <span id="s1084">So we were put in cattle cars again, but certainly not 60 to a car.</span> <span id="s1085">We had enough to all lie down on one level so we didn’t, I don’t know, there must have been about 30 or 35 people.</span> <span id="s1086">And whenever we had meals, the train would stop.</span> <span id="s1087">And we went from Krakow all the way to Odessa, through the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s1088">So they would stop for each meal.</span> <span id="s1089">They would cook, I mean they would prepare the meal in the car, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">SB: And this was under the Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">SH: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1092">Definitely under the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1093">There were some French people there that were not part of the prisoners or that took care of it.</span> <span id="s1094">There were some Russians, of course, to guard the cars.</span> <span id="s1095">And it was pathetic, because the country, you know, Ukraine is flat.</span> <span id="s1096">And we found out it was, as they say.</span> <span id="s1097">And it was, they had gone through a terrible ordeal.</span> <span id="s1098">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s1099">It was in the, of course it was in the early spring.</span> <span id="s1100">And you had Russians who came to the cars with their rags who tried to sell us something, tried to buy something from us.</span> <span id="s1101">It was just pathetic.</span> <span id="s1102">It was a very, very sad experience.</span> <span id="s1103">And it lasted about a week until we got to Odessa.</span> <span id="s1104">And in Odessa we were put also in a school.</span> <span id="s1105">And there we met a lot of people from the French Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1106">There we were given some papers, some clothes, some food.</span> <span id="s1107">In other words, our…</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">SB: Your identity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">SH: Identity and our self-respect back, which of course while in Auschwitz or in Birkenau, forget it.</span> <span id="s1110">I mean, we were dragged through the mud every time, especially the French women, as I explained to you.</span> <span id="s1111">It was just insult after insult after insult.</span> <span id="s1112">There was never a nice word from anyone that I had heard, except from friends, inmates.</span> <span id="s1113">It was just terrible, a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1114">That’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">SB: So, what happened after Odessa?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">SH: Well, we stayed there for a week or so.</span> <span id="s1117">Of course we were not really allowed to get around.</span> <span id="s1118">The Russians were still very careful not to let us co-mingle too much with everybody else.</span> <span id="s1119">Of course we didn’t know the language either.</span> <span id="s1120">I mean I understood a little Russian.</span> <span id="s1121">I could understand a little bit, but I couldn’t get around enough to be safe.</span> <span id="s1122">So we saw the city a little bit.</span> <span id="s1123">They took us once or twice in sort of, not, maybe it was buses or maybe it was trucks, to show us a little bit of the city, which it was a nice European type city, much more cosmopolitan than anywhere else, I understand, in Russia.</span> <span id="s1124">And we stayed there.</span> <span id="s1125">We were fed.</span> <span id="s1126">We waited until we were put on the boat, a British boat, who would take us back to France, to Marseilles.</span> <span id="s1127">And remember, this was still war time, so there were some problems, and of course we were worried that we won’t be shipwrecked with a torpedo or something.</span> <span id="s1128">There was still that worry, and they were doing drills all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">SB: And this was what month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">SH: This was in, this was, it had to be in April, the end of April.</span> <span id="s1131">The trip lasted about ten days.</span> <span id="s1132">And we got into Marseilles May the 1st.</span> <span id="s1133">That I will always remember, because May 1st is a holiday.</span> <span id="s1134">It’s our Labor Day.</span> <span id="s1135">So I remember landing on May 1st, of 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">SB: And then what happened?</span> <span id="s1137">How did you get back to your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">SH: Well, in Marseilles we were of course put together in a building and the Red Cross was there and they asked us, as I said, they fed us, gave us clothes, identity, and money, and asked us what did we want to do.</span> <span id="s1139">And it was up to us.</span> <span id="s1140">They would take us wherever we wanted.</span> <span id="s1141">So, theoretically I wanted to go back to Paris, but for some reason I asked whether they knew what happened to my father.</span> <span id="s1142">And they said they would find out.</span> <span id="s1143">And the next day they told me that my father had been killed.</span> <span id="s1144">So, I don’t have to tell you the shock and the trauma that it did.</span> <span id="s1145">But I didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1146">I just didn’t want to go to Paris.</span> <span id="s1147">I didn’t know where to want to go.</span> <span id="s1148">And my aunt was still in Paris, and I was debating whether to go.</span> <span id="s1149">And my researcher offered to take me to his home for at least a couple of weeks, a month, until I get in touch with my aunt or my friends back in Paris.</span> <span id="s1150">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1151">I went back to Clermont-Ferrand with him, to his family.</span> <span id="s1152">He had his wife and his children.</span> <span id="s1153">His children were about my age.</span> <span id="s1154">There was a boy, a girl, and a younger girl.</span> <span id="s1155">I can’t say that the wife was terribly happy to have a Jewish survi--he wasn’t Jewish--a Jewish survivor, you know, skinny and no hair, practically none, coming to her.</span> <span id="s1156">I stayed with him about two weeks.</span> <span id="s1157">And then he had a friend who lived in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1158">Clermont-Ferrand is in the, what do they call it, in the Auvergne and there's mountains there, not very high but still mountains.</span> <span id="s1159">He had a friend there, who was a pharmacist, a spinster, an unmarried gal.</span> <span id="s1160">And I stayed with her for the rest of the summer, where I prepared, I went back to my less--I mean my studies.</span> <span id="s1161">I hadn’t studied for almost a year, so I wanted to go back to my studies, review it, because I had to pass my, now my second part of the baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s1162">And I prepared myself to enter the school.</span> <span id="s1163">I knew I was going to go back to Paris, but I didn’t want to go to my aunt.</span> <span id="s1164">So I went to another orphan home, also under the, well at that point they were under the supervision of the OSE.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">SB: What is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">SH: Organization of Saving Children, Enfants, OSE [Oeuvres de secours aux Enfants], E means Enfants.</span> <span id="s1167">So they had the responsibility of having some homes for the orphans during the war, those who were hidden during the war by their parents, the few who came back from the camps.</span> <span id="s1168">So that’s where I headed, in one of them, not far from Versailles.</span> <span id="s1169">Because that’s where the older children went.</span> <span id="s1170">And I lived there for a year, not quite a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">SB: What happened to your sister during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">SH: Oh, my sister, yeah, my sister, after the selection in October went to Czechoslovakia with all the other French girls.</span> <span id="s1173">And she worked there.</span> <span id="s1174">And she was liberated, and they were liberated much later because the front lasted longer before the, actually she was liberated also by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1175">And they were liberated in the, I think at the end of May, oh, no, pardon me, in the beginning of May, the 8th, I think, when the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">SB: And this was in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">SH: ’45, yes.</span> <span id="s1178">And I don’t exactly know what happened to her right after, because I never really got a very straight answer from her or the friends who came back with her.</span> <span id="s1179">But they came back with the Red Cross, and she came back to my aunt, lived there for a while, but then decided to go to, also one of the orphan homes, for a while.</span> <span id="s1180">And then after that I left for, I lived on my own in Paris, rented a room and went back to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">SB: When did you go back to Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">SH: At the end of the summer of ’45, in the end of September.</span> <span id="s1183">School started later there.</span> <span id="s1184">It starts in October.</span> <span id="s1185">Before school started.</span> <span id="s1186">So I went back maybe a couple of weeks before.</span> <span id="s1187">I went to see my aunt, but didn’t live with her.</span> <span id="s1188">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">SB: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">SH: Well I lived in that home, in an orphan home outside of Paris, not far from Versailles.</span> <span id="s1191">I think it was a station, station before you got to Versailles on the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">SB: You did not go back to your own home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">SH: No.</span> <span id="s1194">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1195">For a while we, the home was left like this, and after a while we rented it to someone, who also used the plant for- Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">SB: Side one, in the continuing interview of Simone Horowitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">SH: Yeah, the, so the, our house was rented for a long time.</span> <span id="s1198">And we left it at that until we sold many years later, when I was already in America.</span> <span id="s1199">My sister took care of it.</span> <span id="s1200">It was sold.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">SB: How did you find your home when you came to, back to look at it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">SH: The way we left it, as I said.</span> <span id="s1203">Nobody touched anything.</span> <span id="s1204">Very soon after, we were, at that point we were, both my sister and I, back in Paris.</span> <span id="s1205">We were still both minors.</span> <span id="s1206">So in order to do anything we wanted, renting or, you know, we wanted to sell the furniture and the machinery that was there, so what we did, we had to get, what do you call it, oh, somebody who was responsible for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">SB: A guardian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">SH: A guardian.</span> <span id="s1209">Otherwise we would have been the guardians of the state and then when you do that, it’s extremely difficult to dispose of what you have because you have to go through the red tape and it takes forever.</span> <span id="s1210">So we were lucky.</span> <span id="s1211">My friends with whom I grew up, that one family that I knew very well, whose children, the oldest girl was in my class all the way through school, even in university, her mother, they were M. D.s, all of them, the children afterwards.</span> <span id="s1212">And, but the parents also were M. D.s.</span> <span id="s1213">She volunteered to be, I asked her and she said yes.</span> <span id="s1214">My aunt, I didn’t want my aunt as a guardian because we didn’t get along very well and there was a lot of friction there between her and my father, and I didn’t want that to be projected into my life.</span> <span id="s1215">So, she was a guardian, so she took sort of care of the paperwork there.</span> <span id="s1216">And because eventually, within a couple of years, we sold everything that was inside the house.</span> <span id="s1217">Actually, before we even rented the place.</span> <span id="s1218">And the man who took, who rented it, was interested in using the plant--I don’t know for what, but it wasn’t my problem.</span> <span id="s1219">And then it was in the hand of a notary who took care of it, not too well either.</span> <span id="s1220">And they were not as nice.</span> <span id="s1221">After that I had much more problems with the outside world than I had with my neighbors, who never took anything.</span> <span id="s1222">So it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1223">But…</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">SB: Now, all of this time you still had not found out what had happened to your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">SH: No, never, not to this day.</span> <span id="s1226">I mean, I, there was a name, there is a name of my mother in the Klarsfeld book, but it’s a wrong date.</span> <span id="s1227">So I don’t think that’s her.</span> <span id="s1228">There may have been somebody else with that name.</span> <span id="s1229">You know, Zuckerman was not an unusual name, which was my maiden name.</span> <span id="s1230">It was not an unusual name.</span> <span id="s1231">So it’s very possible it’s somebody else.</span> <span id="s1232">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1233">I tried to find out through the Klarsfeld, but I never got any answer, even though I wrote three times.</span> <span id="s1234">Remember, I live in America.</span> <span id="s1235">It is very difficult to get anything out of the French from here.</span> <span id="s1236">Very difficult.</span> <span id="s1237">From America everything takes twice as long, if not three times as long, and they’re not always willing to bother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">SB: Did you…</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">SH: And remember that the Jews in France are very weak.</span> <span id="s1240">They are very, they’re not actively involved in helping really the survivors or the Jews in general.</span> <span id="s1241">So it’s very hard to get anything, even from the Jewish outfits.</span> <span id="s1242">Or from the government it’s even worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">SB: Do you have a date when your mother was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">SH: Yeah, a specific date, no, but I could figure out through Klarsfeld books, because they are, they have, for instance, in Beaune La Rolande and on they have several dates where they were taken from there to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">SB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">SH: And I know they were taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1247">So I could figure, it was after my birthday, sometime in the third or four weeks of June 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">SB: Perhaps you might contact Yad Vashem in…</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">SH: Oh, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">SB: And that’s not…</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">SH: I mean, from 1971.</span> <span id="s1252">I put some information there in order to find some of the people from Russia that might, people from here that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1253">That I knew I had some family from my father’s family, because they got in touch with me after the war.</span> <span id="s1254">I met one of, he was in the army.</span> <span id="s1255">I don’t know what he was.</span> <span id="s1256">He wasn’t exactly a GI, but, and I know I spoke to him and I saw him, but I lost his name, and my aunt didn’t keep it either.</span> <span id="s1257">So that I never, I know I have somebody here, but I never bothered putting my name in HIAS.</span> <span id="s1258">By now it’s too late anyway; he wouldn’t be alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">SB: Oh.</span> <span id="s1260">Oh I, now, tell us then, you went to school and you graduated high school in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">SH: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">SB: Continue with your life.</span> <span id="s1263">Tell me what happened after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">SH: Well, for, for a while I lived with the directress of that home I went.</span> <span id="s1265">She was there for about a year, not quite, so I was there a little less than a year.</span> <span id="s1266">And I rented the room which she had for the maid, all the way on top.</span> <span id="s1267">In Paris that was very common, to--but she didn’t have a maid living there, so she would rent it.</span> <span id="s1268">I stayed there for, well, under, I think less than a year, until I found myself renting a room in an apartment with an older lady, not far from there.</span> <span id="s1269">But I was back in school.</span> <span id="s1270">I finished my high school with the second part of the baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s1271">Then after that since I wanted to go into med school I had to do one year of basic chemistry and biology, which is required, which is university work.</span> <span id="s1272">And then I went to med school.</span> <span id="s1273">And I took care of, you know, myself.</span> <span id="s1274">My sister was back, but she had left the orphan home and went back to live with my aunt because my aunt wanted her to go back to school.</span> <span id="s1275">But she couldn’t study.</span> <span id="s1276">She said there was no way she could concentrate.</span> <span id="s1277">And so she tried to work, but it didn’t work and she drove me pretty much crazy because she didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1278">And she, then she decided to go to Israel because one of the boys that she had met in that home went to Israel and she was kind of sweet on him.</span> <span id="s1279">And I warned her that she would end up in Cyprus, because that’s where most of the boatloads of immigrants to Palestine went.</span> <span id="s1280">And this is what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1281">And she lost everything, her money, which she took with her, which she shouldn’t have had.</span> <span id="s1282">And her clothes.</span> <span id="s1283">So she came back with nothing, and stayed with my aunt, and tried to sponge on me, which I couldn’t let her do, because by that time I had decided I would leave France anyway.</span> <span id="s1284">I couldn’t see myself living there after what I had gone through.</span> <span id="s1285">There was tremendous amount of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s1286">Certainly the French weren’t ready to listen to the survivors, and of course in America they didn’t either, but--and then the Jewish community was nonexistent.</span> <span id="s1287">It was pathetic.</span> <span id="s1288">The little that I found during the war, it was barely there after the war.</span> <span id="s1289">It took many years for it to reorganize.</span> <span id="s1290">That’s because a lot of the Jews from North Africa came and they were of a different, they were Sephardim and they had a very well-organized--in their countries, in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia.</span> <span id="s1291">And they rebuilt the French community, but this was way after I had come here.</span> <span id="s1292">So there was nothing for me.</span> <span id="s1293">There was hardly any Jewish community, if anything, except the Scouts whom I had known before, the Jewish Scouts which I had known, which I sort of kept, kept going for a while with them.</span> <span id="s1294">And then we didn’t have meetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">SB: And that was your only Jewish activity?</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">SH: Well, also I studied, you know, Jewish, I had plenty of catching up to do.</span> <span id="s1297">So I studied Jewish history.</span> <span id="s1298">We had, I went to services.</span> <span id="s1299">I, of course, studied Hebrew, which I could never remember too well.</span> <span id="s1300">I mean there must have been a block there.</span> <span id="s1301">[chuckles] It took me a long time after I came here to do it right.</span> <span id="s1302">But it was also not done right.</span> <span id="s1303">I mean the people they used to teach you were not really teachers.</span> <span id="s1304">It, you know, everything was really in chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">SB: But you really wanted a Jewish identity at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">SH: Oh absolutely, from the time I learned of my Jewish roots that’s what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1307">I wanted to know about Jewish life, about Jewish, you know, my roots.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">SB: And so then what happened after?</span> <span id="s1309">Did you finally graduate high school and then, what was your decision after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">SH: Well I went, I told you, I went to that one year that you have to do before you go to med school, then I went to one year in med school.</span> <span id="s1311">By then I decided I would finish it in America, thinking that I would have less problem doing it because I had already started, which was a big mistake because they didn’t care for foreigners.</span> <span id="s1312">They certainly didn’t, in America they certainly didn’t take too many Jewish students to go into med school, and certainly not women.</span> <span id="s1313">So I had really three strikes against me.</span> <span id="s1314">And also what I didn’t realize is that they would ask me to get some form of equivalence for a Bachelor’s degree here, in, with a major in science.</span> <span id="s1315">So I had to do that back here and, you know, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">SB: So you contacted your mother’s family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">SH: My family, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1318">I knew I had my mother’s family here, because I knew they got letters before.</span> <span id="s1319">So I wanted to write to them, to tell them what happened, in my broken English, which was still better than my family from here, who couldn’t write English.</span> <span id="s1320">They spoke it pretty well but their writing was atrocious.</span> <span id="s1321">But I wrote to them and they--I had a friend in France, an older friend who was the directress of one of the homes for the orphans, who finally came to America to speak, as a public speaker, to UJA [United Jewish Appeal], in order to tell about her sad story, and make, and sort of induce people to give for the UJA Appeal.</span> <span id="s1322">And I knew her, and I knew she was going all over, and I asked her, “Do you ever go to Detroit,” where my family was.</span> <span id="s1323">She said, “Of course.”</span> <span id="s1324">And my family lived very close from a close friend of hers, with whom she stayed every time she came.</span> <span id="s1325">So she was in touch with my family, told them about me, you know, in more detail--and so anyway--which was not bad at that point.</span> <span id="s1326">And they insisted that I should come.</span> <span id="s1327">Of course they couldn’t force me, but I got myself talked into coming here.</span> <span id="s1328">So I applied, and it takes about eight months to get the visa.</span> <span id="s1329">Until you get your passage it’s about a year.</span> <span id="s1330">And within a year I was here.</span> <span id="s1331">I left France behind without too much regret.</span> <span id="s1332">They, as I said, the Jewish community life was nil, despairing even.</span> <span id="s1333">And certainly the politics of France hadn’t changed since the war.</span> <span id="s1334">It’s like nothing had happened.</span> <span id="s1335">They were in total denial of what happened.</span> <span id="s1336">They’re still in denial today, 55 years after, but not quite as much.</span> <span id="s1337">I would say there is some form of recognition.</span> <span id="s1338">But there’s a lot of people who won’t accept it, even today.</span> <span id="s1339">Because I’ve been there twice, and I read what’s going on in France and you can tell.</span> <span id="s1340">It’s a disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">SB: So continue on your own career.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">SH: So, so I, until I came here I stayed in school, obviously.</span> <span id="s1343">And then finally I came.</span> <span id="s1344">I ended up in Liberty ship, American.</span> <span id="s1345">As a student I had priority.</span> <span id="s1346">They gave me a passage, which I wouldn’t have had if I hadn’t been a student.</span> <span id="s1347">I don’t know I would, you know, your visa is good for six months and if you don’t take advantage of it and you can’t find passage, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s1348">And in ’48, in the fall of ’48 it was very difficult to find anything.</span> <span id="s1349">I wanted to fly and there was no way to fly.</span> <span id="s1350">So, I went on the boat for ten days, a miserable trip.</span> <span id="s1351">It was in October.</span> <span id="s1352">Say the end of September, middle of October, the rough, the sea is very rough.</span> <span id="s1353">I don’t know if there had been any hurricanes, but it was very rough.</span> <span id="s1354">I was sick for ten days and I landed in New York on Yom Kippur, 1948, of all days.</span> <span id="s1355">Nothing I could do about it.</span> <span id="s1356">I had another friend, an older woman, who--my friend could not come pick me up because she had to speak somewhere.</span> <span id="s1357">So she arranged for someone else whom I had known about, to take me.</span> <span id="s1358">And I stayed in New York for oh, two, three days until I got passage on the, on a train to go to Detroit.</span> <span id="s1359">And I can’t tell you the shock to find everything, filled with everything!</span> <span id="s1360">Food, clothes, shoes.</span> <span id="s1361">She took me to Macy’s.</span> <span id="s1362">And we had department stores, but they were empty!</span> <span id="s1363">It was just, I was, you know, absolutely flabbergasted, to see the amount of, you know, freedom and availability of everything that was there in, remember, in 1948 we still had food coupons.</span> <span id="s1364">The food was still rationed, very hard to get what you needed.</span> <span id="s1365">So it was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1366">Then I went on a train and got to my family.</span> <span id="s1367">I didn’t even know how I would even recognize them.</span> <span id="s1368">They sent me a picture.</span> <span id="s1369">And I couldn’t tell.</span> <span id="s1370">But by the time I got off the train--it was an overnight train--I went down and I saw them.</span> <span id="s1371">And I had an aunt who looked exactly like, I looked exactly like her.</span> <span id="s1372">I mean there was no way to be worried about it!</span> <span id="s1373">And it was so funny.</span> <span id="s1374">It was just weird.</span> <span id="s1375">And I stayed with them for a year-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s1376">It was a shock to go to Detroit after Paris, even as bad as Paris was.</span> <span id="s1377">My family was Jewish, but not connected to religious life.</span> <span id="s1378">They were just travel Jews.</span> <span id="s1379">And they would meet, you know, for the holidays and have meals.</span> <span id="s1380">And, but not much more than that.</span> <span id="s1381">The children had gone through a Bar Mitzvah, yes, but that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s1382">So they didn’t know much about their life there, which neither--it was a great disappointment, very great.</span> <span id="s1383">And besides, I was independent.</span> <span id="s1384">I didn’t really like to live with a family, you know, which, their rules, and you know, and I wanted to be on my own.</span> <span id="s1385">But I had to learn the language well and I had to be able to be on my two feet.</span> <span id="s1386">So it took me about a year-and-a-half.</span> <span id="s1387">I went to school there, first of all took the language of English for Foreign Students.</span> <span id="s1388">I did it in one term.</span> <span id="s1389">It was in a university, at Wayne University.</span> <span id="s1390">Then I realized that I had to take some science course to get some equivalency, because I applied for medical school and they laughed me out of my sleeve [chuckles] if I can say that.</span> <span id="s1391">And now, there was no way, they told me.</span> <span id="s1392">I have to have some form of equivalency.</span> <span id="s1393">And in Detroit they had never, in Wayne University they had never had a foreign student before.</span> <span id="s1394">So they didn’t know how much credit they could give me, nothing.</span> <span id="s1395">So I stayed there for a semester-and-a-half, after which I came, I decided to go to New York, advised by some relative in my family that I would do much better in New York than in Detroit.</span> <span id="s1396">And I applied to Hunter and they were willing to take me.</span> <span id="s1397">But I would have to go back also to get a Bachelor’s degree first.</span> <span id="s1398">So I came to my friend, who was a speaker, and she wanted me to stay with her because she wanted to bring her children and stay in America.</span> <span id="s1399">So while she was speaking, her children went to school and I was in my school, but I took care of them in the evening.</span> <span id="s1400">I was kind of a, well, a nanny I suppose, if you want to call it that way.</span> <span id="s1401">And I stayed there for, until I got my Bachelor’s, which was a year later.</span> <span id="s1402">And then I decided it’s enough, I can be on my own, because I got a job.</span> <span id="s1403">And I rented a place, not far from the Jewish Theological Seminary.</span> <span id="s1404">But this was just plain luck, because that building had a lot of Columbia married students in it.</span> <span id="s1405">And by the time I worked, I worked for the hospital where I worked, and in a research lab, the staff was paid by Columbia, and the hospital was the City Hospital.</span> <span id="s1406">It was, they were working on cancer.</span> <span id="s1407">The whole hospital was working on, and had patients only for cancer.</span> <span id="s1408">So I had a chance to go to Columbia.</span> <span id="s1409">And Columbia gave me a chance to get an apartment in one of those buildings where there were a lot of people there, renting them, married, usually married couples or people who wanted to be out of the campus.</span> <span id="s1410">And I took some classes at Columbia and I worked during the day.</span> <span id="s1411">And then eventually I met my husband.</span> <span id="s1412">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">SB: And that was a great and important event in your life, too!</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">SH: That was the only great event in my life at that point!</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">SB: You know, why doesn’t it want to pause?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">SH: Oh, you have to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">SB: No, come on now, let’s try.</span> <span id="s1418">[tape off then on] What do you think is the lesson of the Holocaust now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">SH: That we should be aware, beware, that it could happen any time, any place again, as we have seen already, maybe not with Jews, but certainly with a little [unclear].</span> <span id="s1420">So, we should be prepared.</span> <span id="s1421">As Jews we should know about our roots, try to defend ourself as much as possible, not let the world run us.</span> <span id="s1422">Of course we have Israel now, it’s much easier than it was before the war.</span> <span id="s1423">Remember, before the war there was no place to go, if you were being persecuted.</span> <span id="s1424">This was the tragedy of the '30s.</span> <span id="s1425">And now we have a place to go.</span> <span id="s1426">I don’t know if that’s the solution for everybody, but I know for me it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">SB: And did you always feel this way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">SH: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1429">Since, certainly since Israel.</span> <span id="s1430">That’s the only thing that made me feel that life is worthwhile living.</span> <span id="s1431">Without Israel, I don’t think I would have wanted to have children, to marry, to have a normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">SB: What do people ask you about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">SH: Really, very nothing.</span> <span id="s1434">Never did.</span> <span id="s1435">My family didn’t ask when I came to Detroit except to ask me if it’s true that my mother died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1436">They didn’t really, I told them about my father, who had been shot as a hostage.</span> <span id="s1437">They were not that interested; they didn’t know him.</span> <span id="s1438">But never asked me what happened in Auschwitz, never!</span> <span id="s1439">And I know that I have some second cousins, the children, because the family was a big family, and my mother was one of the youngest.</span> <span id="s1440">As a matter of fact she was the second youngest.</span> <span id="s1441">And the people in Detroit were all mostly older, mostly older chil--siblings.</span> <span id="s1442">And they had children, who already had children my age.</span> <span id="s1443">So I remember a second cousin, within a year or two of my age, wanting--and I found out that only recently when I got into contact with one of my second cousins who lives in California--and she told me that she wanted so desperately to ask what happened, and be my friend, because she felt, you know, some kinship.</span> <span id="s1444">But they wouldn’t let her.</span> <span id="s1445">They said, “Don’t ask her.</span> <span id="s1446">It might make her sad, or you may not want to know.”</span> <span id="s1447">Absolutely unbelievable!</span> <span id="s1448">To this day I, you know, I find this appalling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">SB: How do you feel about the Germans now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">SH: Well I still hate them.</span> <span id="s1451">I cannot, I just cannot, I know they were not all Mengeles, but for me, they were the perpetrator of a horrible, horrible nightmare, which devastated my family, and others.</span> <span id="s1452">And I can’t forgive them that, ever.</span> <span id="s1453">It’s sad, but that’s the way it is.</span> <span id="s1454">I know it’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">SB: How about…</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">SH: …unfair, but that’s the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">SB: How about the Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">SH: Just about the same level.</span> <span id="s1459">They were just as brutal.</span> <span id="s1460">Certainly in the camp we didn’t have any good relationship with any of them, ever.</span> <span id="s1461">They hated the western Jews anyway, even though they knew nothing about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">SB: Would you like to visit your native country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">SH: Oh I did, twice.</span> <span id="s1464">As a matter of fact, my second visit, I made a tape of it, because after coming back to France, and all these years, I never tried to find out what happened to all these young women who were with me, my friends.</span> <span id="s1465">So one day I decided that I should really find out and through a long connection, and it’s kind of a little bit out of this tape, I managed to put an ad in one of the little pamphlet, which was published in France, which I saw, to find out if anybody from my, from my transport, which was the 77th transport, and the one before the last that went from France to Auschwitz, if anyone had come back.</span> <span id="s1466">And within a week I got some answers.</span> <span id="s1467">So I have never seen them.</span> <span id="s1468">So, they meet every year, the 8th of May, which was the end of the war, but I never had a chance to see, to go and, especially not at that time.</span> <span id="s1469">But this last year, in 1999, I finally decided to go.</span> <span id="s1470">And we went with my husband at the end of May, and met them.</span> <span id="s1471">And there is a tape about this encounter, which, if anybody is interested is a quite, quite, quite an interesting subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">SB: We will attach it to these tapes.</span> <span id="s1473">And, how do you feel about your years in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">SH: Well, I have no regret.</span> <span id="s1475">I mean, it hasn’t been easy.</span> <span id="s1476">It’s a very difficult thing to acculturate yourself, especially where I came into my family, which certainly had very little to do with our family.</span> <span id="s1477">My father was much more of an intellectual than any of them are.</span> <span id="s1478">They were mostly business people, very well off, some of them, but not interested.</span> <span id="s1479">And my cousins, their children also were mostly in business, somehow, there are not too many professional in that family.</span> <span id="s1480">And there were a couple, two or three, but it was a very, it was a difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">SB: But now?</span> <span id="s1482">You’ve lived…</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">SH: Now?</span> <span id="s1484">Oh well, as I say, I have no regret.</span> <span id="s1485">How could I regret?</span> <span id="s1486">I reestablished my life and I have a family here, and you know, this is, this is my country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">SB: And how do you feel amongst Jews who did not go through the Holocaust experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">SH: Which ones, the European Jews or American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">SB: No, here in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">SH: Oh, here in America.</span> <span id="s1491">Well, they’re a special breed.</span> <span id="s1492">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">SB: [chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">SH: One thing I like is that they’re very active in Jewish affairs of any kind--social action and helping others and helping Israel.</span> <span id="s1495">That I like.</span> <span id="s1496">This is what I wanted when I was in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">SB: And here in the United States, have you had any experiences with antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">SH: Personally?</span> <span id="s1499">Well, yes, I couldn’t go to medical school.</span> <span id="s1500">That was definitely one of them.</span> <span id="s1501">And it was a shock after having gone through the war.</span> <span id="s1502">And also in school.</span> <span id="s1503">I mean, when I went to Hunter College, which was 99.9% Jewish student population, but not faculty, I did find antisemitism, because here I was, a slightly older student, two years older than the average from--for the class I was in.</span> <span id="s1504">And we were still forced to go into, into a big festival for Christmas and Easter.</span> <span id="s1505">And I tried to get out of it by telling them where I come from, and they said it was compulsory.</span> <span id="s1506">So my only way out was to have somebody sign in for me and not go, because I just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1507">I just couldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">SB: To what religious, civic or charitable organization do you belong personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">SH: Well I always belong to a synagogue, Hadassah.</span> <span id="s1510">That's just about enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">SB: How do you feel about intermarriage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">SH: Oh, well, this is a disaster.</span> <span id="s1513">Disaster number one for us.</span> <span id="s1514">And I don’t have the answer.</span> <span id="s1515">Yes, I have some answers, but they don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s1516">[chuckles]</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">SB: What contacts do you have with other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">SH: Well, I belonged for a while to a Children--they call themselves Children of the Survivors, but there were a lot of survivors among them.</span> <span id="s1519">And, of course, since a few years ago I got into contact with my friends, who were survivors in France.</span> <span id="s1520">And there’s a big disparity between what they do there and what we do here.</span> <span id="s1521">They’re much more active here.</span> <span id="s1522">They’re much more aware of, really, of the whole picture of Jewish life than they are in France.</span> <span id="s1523">Of course it depends on who you talk to.</span> <span id="s1524">They’re not all on the same boat.</span> <span id="s1525">But some of them, I don’t know how they can stay there and do what they’re doing.</span> <span id="s1526">It’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">SB: And of course you belong to the Holocaust Oral Archives [Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive]…</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">SH: Oh yes, oh well that’s…</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">SB: Where you do volunteer work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">SH: That’s the best place.</span> <span id="s1531">That has been the best place for me.</span> <span id="s1532">It has allowed me to look squarely to the past and not be afraid to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1533">And hopefully helping a little bit in their work because I find that I owe it to the Holocaust survivors to do something for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">SB: There’s no, there is no question that you do add to the total…</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">SH: I hope so.</span> <span id="s1536">I hope so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">SB: …experience of the Holocaust and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">SH: I’d like to do more.</span> <span id="s1539">Unfortunately I, the only way I help other than going to Gratz is to support Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, which I feel is really the only true, authentic museum for the Holocaust that has been built anywhere in the world, including here in Washington, including the one in New York, and including the one in Paris, or anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1540">They are the only one that really have captured--and I know as a survivor, and I went through the Holocaust--they are the only one who has captured the mood, the whole experience of the Holocaust, and present them, as difficult as it is to see, because when I went there several times, I can never go through the children’s exhibit.</span> <span id="s1541">I always go, and I leave before I can even go there more than a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1542">It is so painful.</span> <span id="s1543">But this is what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">SB: When did you discuss your Holocaust experiences with your spouse, children, or friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">SH: Well, my spouse right away.</span> <span id="s1546">I mean, I, when I met him I told him I was a survivor.</span> <span id="s1547">There’s no point to hide it.</span> <span id="s1548">And I wasn’t wanting to hide.</span> <span id="s1549">And they, with my children that’s another problem.</span> <span id="s1550">For the longest time I would not tell them about it.</span> <span id="s1551">But, of course, they guessed it.</span> <span id="s1552">Like all children, they’re pretty bright.</span> <span id="s1553">And I suppose, but they don’t ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s1554">They are still afraid to hurt me.</span> <span id="s1555">And, or hurt themselves.</span> <span id="s1556">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1557">I have never really, with my oldest daughter I have talked to her about it.</span> <span id="s1558">She has a strange, she has her own idea about it, and I don’t think it’s quite correct.</span> <span id="s1559">But it’s difficult to make her understand that.</span> <span id="s1560">But I do speak to her more freely than the others.</span> <span id="s1561">The others are really reluctant, still today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">SB: And it affects your relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">SH: Oh absolutely.</span> <span id="s1564">Absolutely.</span> <span id="s1565">First of all, the fact itself of my not wanting to talk to them about it, you know, put a certain reserve in our relationship.</span> <span id="s1566">And they knew there was something there, but, you know, I wasn’t talking about it.</span> <span id="s1567">So whenever you do that, with any kind of problems, let alone the Holocaust, there’s always a problem in the relationship.</span> <span id="s1568">In a way I regret to have done it, because, but with hindsight we’re very smart, you know.</span> <span id="s1569">Now I wouldn’t do it, but then I had to do it because, remember, nobody spoke about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1570">For the first twenty-five years there was no way you could find, nothing!</span> <span id="s1571">The media was silent.</span> <span id="s1572">Peop--the Jews were silent.</span> <span id="s1573">The survivors were silent.</span> <span id="s1574">Of course, they were, they felt that they had to follow the, you know, the, what people wanted.</span> <span id="s1575">And since they didn’t want to listen, who wanted to tell?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">SB: It’s true.</span> <span id="s1577">What ideas do you, as a Holocaust survivor, want to pass on to your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1578">SH: Well, I don’t know, I, you know, about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1579">I don’t, except, you know, that they should know about it.</span> <span id="s1580">Not only what happened to me, but what happened to others, to the six million.</span> <span id="s1581">And I want them to know about what happened during the war.</span> <span id="s1582">But there’s also more to it.</span> <span id="s1583">You know, I want them to know about their Jewish roots and we certainly did plenty to make sure that they would know.</span> <span id="s1584">Because we sent them to day school, not to public school, all three of them.</span> <span id="s1585">And two of them went to the Jewish Theological Seminary as a student and earned a University graduation degree.</span> <span id="s1586">So we really made sure that they would know enough about their background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">SB: Which of course was different from what your parents had attempted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">SH: Oh, the opposite!</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">SB: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">SH: I have seen the fiasco of what they’ve done, and I certainly wasn’t going to repeat it to my children.</span> <span id="s1591">And of course my husband was totally with me with that.</span> <span id="s1592">There is no question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">SB: What activities do you enjoy personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">SH: Me?</span> <span id="s1595">Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1596">What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">SB: Well, what…</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">SH: Being very involved with the Jewish community because of my husband’s work.</span> <span id="s1599">And I’m very happy now that we’re not in it any more because it was too overwhelming and too consuming.</span> <span id="s1600">So now we, you know, we have time to read and talk and enjoy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">SB: And intellectual pursuits.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">SH: Yeah, mostly.</span> <span id="s1603">We love music together.</span> <span id="s1604">I mean we have a lot of common tastes.</span> <span id="s1605">And of course I like to do anything with my hands.</span> <span id="s1606">At one point I painted, and believe it or not, what I did, the Holocaust had some reflection on it, because most of my colors were dark, brown, ochre, very little bright color.</span> <span id="s1607">And I even have a painting with a, it’s a special technique and you’re supposed to do something first and then afterwards if you see something, you know, you go over it.</span> <span id="s1608">And it, I mean, it’s sort of in the war.</span> <span id="s1609">I could have called it The Holocaust, but I didn’t want to do it at that point.</span> <span id="s1610">So it really influenced me, what I, really what I, react and the way I thought and painted and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">SB: Is there anything else you wish to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">SH: Oh, no, one thing I forgot to say is that when you get to camp you get a number.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">SB: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">SH: Yes, and my number, and I don’t, I had it removed when I came to America, was A16, 832.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">SB: Would you repeat that again, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">SH: A16.</span> <span id="s1617">16,832.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">SB: O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">SH: I had it removed when I came to here because I like to wear short sleeves and I didn’t want people to see and ask the question all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">SB: But things are different now and…</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">SH: Thank G-d.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">SB: And you have a wonderful life with your husband, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">SH: Right.</span> <span id="s1624">It’s much different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">SB: And thank you.</span> <span id="s1626">We are delighted that you are working with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">SH: Oh, well, I am happy to do it.</span> <span id="s1628">And I wouldn’t want to do it otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">SB: Thanks again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">See attached copy of receipt.</span></p> <p><span
