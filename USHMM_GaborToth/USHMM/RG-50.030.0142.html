Arrokoveetsaplatz, and later I attend to the gimnasium, Meekoayray, in Warsaw, in Marrahowskiplatz.</span> <span id="s31">During the World War second -- that’s in the beginning, that’s meaning September, 1939, I started into the lissond, it was like a teknusha shula.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Teknusha -- teknusha -- skula, sorry, as I meant, a te-teknu-teknusha school.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Well, if we can go back then, for just a few minutes to think about what it was like for you in your family, when you were growing up as a very young child.</span> <span id="s34">What kind of work did your father do, or what kind of family experiences do you remember having as a young person?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s36">I had two brothers, and I was the oldest one.</span> <span id="s37">The -- one brother was four years younger, and another was eight years younger what I am, and my father was a builder, he was like investor, he build the houses of all the business in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: So, how would you see your family?</span> <span id="s39">Was it an average family, was it [indecipherable] A: I-It

the public school in Arrokoveetsaplatz.</span> <span id="s46">You know, was a regular public school, and later was a problem, because my father decided that we have two good friends.</span> <span id="s47">One was German, another Russian.</span> <span id="s48">And he thought that from his experience, he survived during the war first, because he know perfect Russian language.</span> <span id="s49">He told me that if I would like to survive, probably would be the wa-war not in five, then in three -- in five, in 10 years.</span> <span id="s50">You know, we’re talking about nine -- the early 30 years.</span> <span id="s51">Then I have to attend to the gi -- gimnasium, in which I would be learned perfect one of these languages, Russian, or German.</span> <span id="s52">And he asked me which one I would like to selected.</span> <span id="s53">I decided that I would like to speak German.</span> <span id="s54">There is on the [indecipherable] to the gimnasium [indecipherable] what was next to the Augsburg Evangelist Church, to which belonged most of the German people.</span> <span id="s55">The German people which -- it was a Polish people, but with the German background, and these people speak most time -- the kids speak most time in home, German.</span> <span id="s56">That’s mean the German languages were very, very high level.</span> <span id="s57">I was a very poor student, very, really poor, you know, compared with the kids who would speak home every day, German -- that I have every year a tutor.</span> <span id="s58">The tutor was this way, that usually my parents, and parents of another my friend -- I remember Yashu Nashuroski, you know, rent the room someplace in vacation place, and come there tutor from Germany.</span> <span id="s59">Usually every year was a tutor from different part of Germany, and we speak during this one month, almost two months, only German.</span> <span id="s60">That’s mean, if we s -- we cannot speak one word -- one to each one other Polish, because he immediately beat us, because he expect we were talking something wrong against him, because he do not understand.</span> <span id="s61">And this way, when the German come, I speak fluently German.</span> <span id="s62">All the -- almost the same German went -- when the Polish.</span> <span id="s63">And additional I know, because the tutors were from different parts of Germany every year, that I know different slang, and different -- different accent, because one was from one da -- one year were from Berlin, the ‘nother day was from Vien-Vienna, the ‘nother year from Hamburg, that I speak Haplardeutsch, and Howdeutsch, and gin accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: I can recognize these accents.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: So when the war began, you were able to converse in German?</span> <span id="s67">A: That -- I can -- I can speak fluently German.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So now let’s go back to the time when the war began.</span> <span id="s69">Can you tell us a little bit about where you were, and what your reactions were, what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Just at the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Just before the war.</span> <span id="s73">You know, before the war I attend, in 19 -- the year 1938 -- ‘39, I was attend to the last year, to the gimnasium, because folsee -- the education was four years in gimnasium, and was in mas -- last year.</span> <span id="s74">This year, I attend -- I have one class like a -- they teach us -- they train us th -- something about the army.</span> <span id="s75">That’s mean we have training with -- like what’s in the army.</span> <span id="s76">That’s mean that the -- when German come, we have a special uniform, you know, like a student uniform grim, looks something like a skulls -- like was most adverse like skulls.</span> <span id="s77">And when the German co -- before -- when the war start in 1939, in September first, when the German attacked Poland, that I start working for the organization which take care about fire and houses in -- in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s78">I was in -- very lucky, because I was 16 years [indecipherable] in June, and additional I can drive.</span> <span id="s79">I can drive motorcycle, and I can drive car.</span> <span id="s80">What this time was something you know, like special knowledge, this was, you know, like high education, this knowledge, that when the -- the -- th -- the war start, I get fr-from this organization the motorcycle, and I was a line officer, you know, just delivered information.</span> <span id="s81">And a few days later, when the German come close to the Warsaw -- and Warsaw was, you know -- Warsaw was on the -- all side of the Warsaw was the German army.</span> <span id="s82">Then, was no water that the army -- the army give me a truck, they -- a soldier make on that truck -- put the big barrels, they pump the water, and I drive this water from the -- from the hospital when they -- wh- where was that water place, you know, go to the bakery for they make bread for the army, that during the night I pull water -- drive the water.</span> <span id="s83">During the day I delivered documents from the -- for the army, you know that I was very busy this time.</span> <span id="s84">And meantime, we go on the roofs, and throw away the small bump, what the German put to make a fire, what a bump approximately one foot long, and like a to -- 32 inches diameters, you know, and make a fire.</span> <span id="s85">They grab this, you know, a lot which I’ll grab this and throw away on the street, and the kids who on the street put with the sont, cover this.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: When the war began then, you found yourself with which organization?</span> <span id="s87">A: When war began?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: No, during the -- this was -- this was an organization -- aha -- this was organization, but this was like a public organization, they call -- I don’t -- difficult to translate it, it was aupahelle.</span> <span id="s90">This was organization against the -- like a self defense of the -- of the bombing of the fire -- you know, for the -- for the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: How long did you remain in the self defense?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: This was -- this was from the first day -- no, from the first day of the war, to the day what was Warsaw, you know, capital, you know, surrendered.</span> <span id="s93">It was like one month -- no -- approximately one month, maybe a little bit less.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: And then where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Pardon me?</span> <span id="s96">And later was -- you know, was --</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Well, what happened to you at the time when Warsaw surrendered?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: When the Warsaw surrendered, this is -- it was -- did nothing, was few weeks we’re with nothing, because it was completely disaster.</span> <span id="s99">I used to try to work in ki -- this time in the - - like voluntary in different organization.</span> <span id="s100">That’s mean we have two people -- bread, you know, daily bread, the breadmaker, breadmaker -- food, because was completely disaster.</span> <span id="s101">This was -- was like almost the fu -- two or three weeks.</span> <span id="s102">Later, they opened the schools, but they opened the schools for the Polish children only, for the technical school.</span> <span id="s103">That’s mean it was not like a grammar school, it was not the gimnasium, only was technical school.</span> <span id="s104">And I attend -- start attending to the school which was the mainin -- mechanical school, because I finished this full class gimnasium, and then I attend to this school, it was in Gorsky.</span> <span id="s105">This was a very famous gimnasium, Gorsky in Warsaw, and in this gimnasium they opened like -- it was not the school like a training for the -- techni -- for the mechanics.</span> <span id="s106">I attend to this school to one year, maybe one and a half, and German closed the school, because they find the school is not only the training the -- the mechanic, but the same time they train the underground terrorists, you know, they closed the school.</span> <span id="s107">They opened another school, which I started and was another mechanical school.</span> <span id="s108">It was in Mokotof, the different parts of the town.</span> <span id="s109">This school I attend I think one year that -- anyway, I finish, I was get a diploma from this school.</span> <span id="s110">And in the meantime they opened a -- a polytechnic institute they call herateknisha fakshula, in German.</span> <span id="s111">This mean the school with the highest -- highest education like a -- they call betripinjinids.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">That’s mean the -- like a high level technician.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: And how long did you stay [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: And this -- this school I stayed -- this is what I have documents in there, I document -- this school I think I attend one and a half year, because at ex -- started the uprising there, and a -- August first was uprising.</span> <span id="s115">This August?</span> <span id="s116">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: June, July, yes, sorry.</span> <span id="s119">Uprising -- the school was ot -- not open any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Okay, let’s go back a little bit to think about when you found yourself working with the underground army --</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s124">In 1939, in th -- December, I remember this exactly, in December, they -- I met a friends which have connection with the -- like a main organization they call zetfouzet.</span> <span id="s125">This was the like organiza-organization which supposed to fight with the arms against the occupation.</span> <span id="s126">I had -- I have a fr -- met a friend, and he thought, listen we start organize, I already have connection, organization will be five.</span> <span id="s127">This mean we have to have five guys who have to -- fi -- five more.</span> <span id="s128">Four guys, they will be together five.</span> <span id="s129">Because this was organization, they would be very difficult to discover by the German.</span> <span id="s130">That’s mean if the German find -- they all will find one guy and one small group, no more.</span> <span id="s131">Will be no connection between the group -- was completely no connection.</span> <span id="s132">You know, was this system of the organization.</span> <span id="s133">And this start in th-the -- exactly I remember was December thirti -- 1939.</span> <span id="s134">And in the beginning was training, that’s mean we have to know how use the guns.</span> <span id="s135">We already have guns, because during the ja -- the war, I hired few different guns, and I hired few different radiopera.</span> <span id="s136">The German -- because German, when come, they take all radiopera, you have to bring to the German, they destroy.</span> <span id="s137">I hide at this time - the people get that I hide, you know, on different places, usually on the attics, in the basement.</span> <span id="s138">In the basement was a big hole in the wall.</span> <span id="s139">In the wall I remember that I put the cover with the -- with the rubber, with the fabrics, you know, because was no plastic this time, and [indecipherable] I put, you know, wall, and I covered this.</span> <span id="s140">Then, when we start going to [indecipherable] then we start learning how using the -- the arms, and how - we start using the radio, listen the BBC, because BBC was in the Polish language, all information.</span> <span id="s141">And additional, we tried to organize, you know, and learn.</span> <span id="s142">In meantime, we get from the alliance, I think it was a little bit later, the name of the organization changed.</span> <span id="s143">I think was maybe in 1940 or ‘41, we started to get the arms and material from the sky, you know, from the alliance.</span> <span id="s144">And then, because I was mechanic, I was very, you know, was very good working my hands, that I start learn from this book what they sent from the -- England, usually, they drop off, you know, about the mine.</span> <span id="s145">That’s mean I know how make the mines to blow up the bridges, how blow the trains, and then I was expert for this.</span> <span id="s146">And this was the -- all the -- the action they call tashma -- tashma, this mean the [indecipherable] one, you know, that’s the same time was blow the train in many places, usually the train with the supply to the east front of the oolopsageta.</span> <span id="s147">Oolopsageta was a train which bring the German from the east front for vacation.</span> <span id="s148">Vacation train they call oolopsoogen.</span> <span id="s149">They would blow up this -- this oolopsoogen.</span> <span id="s150">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: What was your role in this process?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: In this process, you know, because I was very fast in making mines, installed the mines on the train, that I was like a miner, you know?</span> <span id="s153">Usually the people stay in the back of me, they care about me, and I built, and I installed this equipment, and this material to blow up the trains, mostly we did many, many this action.</span> <span id="s154">The problem was usually to deliver it, the material, because this time the material was -- they call it troten, I don’t know, they named it troten, was -- looks like a -- you probably remember many, many years ago, the soap was in the bar, approximately one foot long, like a two inches time two inches core.</span> <span id="s155">This to -- looks like a -- this material looks approximately like this bar of soaps.</span> <span id="s156">And to use this material [indecipherable] soap, you know, the material you need lot.</span> <span id="s157">Not like now when you can use a few pounds, this was not, we have to like 10 - 20 pounds.</span> <span id="s158">We have to transport this material, sometimes from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s159">Outside the Warsaw was problem, because in that train, that German you make -- checking everything.</span> <span id="s160">They check -- their people check documents, they’re using counterfeit documents, and this material, usually we have connection with the train man, you know, was because this time most people belong to this different organization.</span> <span id="s161">We don’t know one -- each other, but we get this, and they help us to transport this.</span> <span id="s162">When we go to the same place, we have usually there somebody from the local place, who get us -- was a guide for the place, and the guide let her disappear.</span> <span id="s163">She was not involved, you know.</span> <span id="s164">This required that not people try don’t know one each other too good, because if they catch one guy, it’s better if he don’t know too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: When you found yourself in this informal army activity of destroying trains, was this when you were also part of the AK, or was this earlier than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: This was -- this was -- the name of the AK changed, because first was zed vouset, then later was different names of this organization.</span> <span id="s167">Before it was AK, they call -- the AK have different names.</span> <span id="s168">I don’t know -- is difficult to translate it.</span> <span id="s169">It was deska broda 69.</span> <span id="s170">It was the name of organization.</span> <span id="s171">Deska, this mean bort.</span> <span id="s172">Broda -- you know broda.</span> <span id="s173">This was like a bed, was a synonym for this organization, but this was always the same.</span> <span id="s174">They call lar -- verka de versia.</span> <span id="s175">This mean large -- big diversion, right?</span> <span id="s176">Because was a small diversion, a big diversion.</span> <span id="s177">Because additional what we did, because I was a little bit older, and this time you know, 17 - 18 years old, because 16, I finish in June 19 -- 1939, that’s -- we trained the young kids from the scouts.</span> <span id="s178">We bring him the gun for the meetings and train him into -- was usually no more like five guys, you know, because was a rule, you know?</span> <span id="s179">And t -- we bring guns, and explain him how you say gun, how clean, how open, how loading.</span> <span id="s180">If they stuck, how release, you know, because was very important.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Okay, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: And because guns we have different, because we have Polish guns, we have guns, we have guns which we get from the England -- it was -- some was American, and some was English, Sten, and tommy gun, Thompson, and Colt was -- lot of different, that you have to be -- when I be -- because I was mechanic, this for me was very, very simple, very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Okay, so during ‘41, this is what you were doing.</span> <span id="s184">In ‘42, the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: The same, ‘41, ‘42.</span> <span id="s186">What else we did additional.</span> <span id="s187">We release -- we clean -- we call the clean the apartments.</span> <span id="s188">What that’s mean?</span> <span id="s189">For instance, you belong to the organization, and you was -- the Gestapo arrest you.</span> <span id="s190">But in your house was a lot of hiding places we know about, in the floor, in the wall, you know, in the furnitures, some documents, some information, some ti -- with the cords for the radio, you know, many important documents.</span> <span id="s191">This guy was arrested, and then they arrested the people, but Gestapo still watching for this house, and watching who is coming to this apartment, they would like to arrest him.</span> <span id="s192">That our job was cla -- come and take everything from this apartment, what was less -- left of it.</span> <span id="s193">We usually -- somebody know what is there -- make the -- you know, a place was hiding.</span> <span id="s194">Usually wa -- it was -- was in the ba -- in the floor.</span> <span id="s195">You have to use a special knife, stick in the hole, and slip and this spring open, you open, and can remove this.</span> <span id="s196">That’s mean we have to clean this.</span> <span id="s197">Usually this can equal very -- pretty dangerous, because the German -- few people are watching for this Gestapo, and we have to come and take -- come in that room and clean everything.</span> <span id="s198">We fight -- sometime was fighting.</span> <span id="s199">I remember once we have bitte -- big -- very high kiting because somebody watching, and -- have seen us.</span> <span id="s200">When we come to the room, they called the -- not Gestapo, they was a fredgendarmarie come.</span> <span id="s201">It was the ‘nother group of German which helped Gestapo.</span> <span id="s202">They -- I remember this fredgendarmarie have a big metal plate he -- that was feltgendarmarie.</span> <span id="s203">And they come.</span> <span id="s204">Before they come, we fortunately ran away, but we take out everything what -- what has to be take out from there.</span> <span id="s205">And it was the ‘nother job.</span> <span id="s206">The ‘nother job was liquidation, the -- no spy there -- they spy the people, which was informed for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s207">No, this was the -- the ‘nother -- not -- not very funny job, but we have to sometimes kill -- liquidating the person, because this get lot of trouble for our organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: During this period of time, were you able to witness what was developing in relation to the Jewish community in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Were you able to observe what was happening to the Jewish community in Warsaw -- A: Oh yes, oh yes, yes, because we -- we helped Jewish people different way.</span> <span id="s211">You know, Warsaw different, like a people -- was always different people, but we help the Jewish -- my organization helped the people -- to Jewish -- to the ghetto, because was a ghetto -- the ghetto, they need their food.</span> <span id="s212">Then we supply as much as we can, and this time, in the beginning, then German take Jewish people from ghetto to different work, outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s213">You know, they make like a column.</span> <span id="s214">In the front was a German, in the end of the German, but in the beginning was not very strong, the -- the -- the -- these people who doesn’t strong very -- th -- you know, was not watching very strong, that sometimes we tried to -- these run away, these people.</span> <span id="s215">And some people, some people -- I remember that it was in 19 -- in 19 -- before the uprising, it was like a -- May, or June in 1944, yes, uprising was ‘44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: ‘43</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: ‘43.</span> <span id="s218">In 1943, before the uprising, because I attend to this school -- let’s start this way -- when I attend to this school, the German sent us for vacation to work for the German factory.</span> <span id="s219">This time a -- they sent me to the BMW factory, what was like a branch in Warsaw, in okentsia, and in this factory, where I built the engine for the German plane, for Faulkebuvs.</span> <span id="s220">Because was few guys that our job, first of all, was how we can make -- rebuild this engine, this good, to where the engine would be not working.</span> <span id="s221">You know, it was our thinking.</span> <span id="s222">You have to under -- that everybody tried to do something against, that we tried go this way.</span> <span id="s223">They get us a tolerance -- because I was like a technician there -- in German was a rule that, it depend what you have a function, you have a different coat.</span> <span id="s224">I was like a technician, they have a gray coat.</span> <span id="s225">The -- the other people have a red coat, they can make a control, then other people blue coat, the black coat, it depend what they doing, they -- the -- the German come on the -- on the -- to the fabri, they know immediately who is who, what he is doing.</span> <span id="s226">That we’re organized with my friends, which will make a control, and with this, what I get the -- in this information, we tried to change the tolerance.</span> <span id="s227">We find when we change the tolerance in this -- this engine was for the folkewulf, what I told for folkewulf fighters.</span> <span id="s228">And to change this lightly, the tolerance.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">And the -- and there was this, the plane -- the engine approximately, was working on that, because after they repaired the engine, they placed it that end -- the -- the engine on the stand.</span> <span id="s230">Then later, they take this engine from stand, and install to the plane, and plane was fighting.</span> <span id="s231">Was a problem that most this engine blow out, that they stuck, approximately after -- between 30 and 35 minutes fight -- flight.</span> <span id="s232">They came Gestapo, to start investigating why from this plate that all engine stop.</span> <span id="s233">And we know about this, the -- one day they se -- they start investigated, then next day we disappear, we didn’t come any more.</span> <span id="s234">We run away.</span> <span id="s235">Fortunately, if I remember, was June, I think, and unfortunately, we inform a lot of -- because in this factory, was working a lot of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s236">They didn’t know Jaimander was the Jewish, but what’s important, Dakin hired himself like a worker for the factory.</span> <span id="s237">And the problem, they have a good ousva, that mean good documentation, they can live in there, not in the ghetto, they can be hired like -- not the Jewish, like -- like, you know, Catholic people, you know, like a cri -- Christian -- Christians.</span> <span id="s238">And this day, when the -- we ran away, and to inform -- we know which is Jewish, you know, w -- because we keep this inform over there.</span> <span id="s239">They were let him know, they -- ris -- disappear together with us, was like a -- the Jewish, maybe, was five, maybe six, and a -- us was five guys together.</span> <span id="s240">We attend to the same school, and we send to the same job.</span> <span id="s241">And was more Jewish people, which we didn’t know about, they sent.</span> <span id="s242">Unfortunately, when the Gestapo come, then start investigated these people, and few people was killed over there, between this, if I remember what they told me later, two Jewish people, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: When you were observing what was going on in Warsaw, how do you remember seeing the developments of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: I have to think a little bit.</span> <span id="s245">Maybe you can break a moment?</span> <span id="s246">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s248">Maybe we can talk about because I did not understand good question.</span> <span id="s249">Let me

g -- around the wa -- ghetto, like they make in there -- in Berlin, the Communists make the wall the same.</span> <span id="s263">But in the beginning was not the wall, later they make a wall.</span> <span id="s264">And then, this time was very bad, because the -- i-it was -- th -- it was big problem with food.</span> <span id="s265">The problem with food was not only in the ghetto, but was all around there, everybody has a problem.</span> <span id="s266">We had the same outside the ghetto, the same problem with food.</span> <span id="s267">But in the ghetto was a big problem because was lot of people, they bring their people from -- not only the Polish people, but bring the Jewish people from different part of the -- Europe.</span> <span id="s268">They bring from -- if I remember, from Holland, from Hungaria, from -- from France, from many parts of Europe, they bring to the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s269">Because later they bring these people from Warsaw ghetto to the concentin cap.</span> <span id="s270">It was later.</span> <span id="s271">In -- in the ghetto was terrible, you know, because first of all was not [indecipherable] on the German, you know, shooting

go away, they will probably lost something.</span> <span id="s436">They -- I -- w-we was very friendly, and we use -- we stayed together, they’re good friend with these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">And after a few days, you know, they start be more confident.</span> <span id="s438">But in the first day, you see, was difficult to -- was -- for this -- this -- like young kids, and it was professional people.</span> <span id="s439">And we divided this people, we told him, you have three choices.</span> <span id="s440">If you’d like to fight with us, because we have a lot of guns, you get a gun since you will be fighting with us.</span> <span id="s441">If you don’t want fighting, we can -- you can -- you would like to stay with us, because we need people who would be -- carry our supply.</span> <span id="s442">That’s mean foot armor in the back -- on the back.</span> <span id="s443">If you don’t want, we help you to switch the cloth, and to go to the people.</span> <span id="s444">If I remember, all these people stay with us, all of them.</span> <span id="s445">Some -- some, you know, fighting, and some stay with us like supply.</span> <span id="s446">But some of this was, you know, so hungry for this situation, for the German, they would like to fight.</span> <span id="s447">And was, you know, very good friends.</span> <span id="s448">I was very friendly with these people, and because -- when we [indecipherable] in the old town, then we have to go to the mid-town -- to the mid -- middle of the Warsaw, with the canals.</span> <span id="s449">And some of these guys told me, “Listen, if we go to the canal, the German drop their bomb [indecipherable] to the canal, we could be killed.</span> <span id="s450">We have -- we prepare someplace in ghetto,” -- because some building in ghetto still exist, you know, ruins, but still exists.</span> <span id="s451">We have someplace, when we have water and some food, we can go over there, put the -- destroy the entrance that ve waiting, because we know the Russian was on the other side there.</span> <span id="s452">The oth-other side of the, you know, river, of the Visla river.</span> <span id="s453">And to stay we’ll be waiting, Russian come right away.</span> <span id="s454">Thought, who knows when the Russian coming?</span> <span id="s455">We don’t expect.</span> <span id="s456">And then, all of -- all these people we got together to the mid-town.</span> <span id="s457">And I remember something, because one of these people was engineer, he was waking -- working before the war was second in the -- in this sir -- sir -- sewer institution, you know, on -- in Warsaw, and he thought -- I know they can’t answer very good, and he help us to go to this canal.</span> <span id="s458">This his worl -- worl -- his trip was much longer what regular, but much more safeky.</span> <span id="s459">And this the reason there was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s460">If was problem, I was wounded, my leg was wounded, I was shot here, with this open, you know, open, you know, bleeding, run, I got to the sewer, you know that, to this place.</span> <span id="s461">I was survive, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s462">The ‘nother guy was -- one of the J- Jewish guy was a doctor, and he told me this way, “You will be survived, don’t worry, I have to steal from German some medicine.”</span> <span id="s463">I don’t know what medicine was, because was no pain [indecipherable], was nothing this time.</span> <span id="s464">I know that only I pee in the violet color.</span> <span id="s465">This was some medicine, you know, which helped me against the infection.</span> <span id="s466">And from these people -- from these people, I do not change their moment -- from these people you know, was another guy whom I remember very good his name even, because he was a wholesaler for the factory, for the sh-shoe -- Polish factory, Dubrolen, and he was like a wholesaler.</span> <span id="s467">I don’t remember this time at -- in which place of the Poland, but I remember his name, because this guy, Mr. Zinberstein -- I think this was the name, he come after the World War second -- you know, when everything arrived.</span> <span id="s468">One day I see the guy in English uniform in the house, he come to my house, and looking.</span> <span id="s469">I thought, “What is going on?”</span> <span id="s470">“You don’t remember me?</span> <span id="s471">I survived because you -- yo-you explained me the -- the best way for me if I will go to the -- to the -- to the camp together with all soldiers.</span> <span id="s472">And like a soldier, I survived.”</span> <span id="s473">I disappear, because I was wounded, cannot walk, that -- from the Warsaw, they give me to the proushkoov, I change, you know, th-the time, the time was changing.</span> <span id="s474">I go to the proushkoov, and in this proushkoov, because I was wounded, cannot walk, they send you the hospital.</span>

makes is that your story is really so interesting that we’d like you to speak a little more slowly, so that we can not only hear it better, but think with you, as you’re telling the story.</span> <span id="s554">So, we’re going to go back as I’d proposed to you earlier, while we were on our little break, and we’re going to pick up the story again, with you back in -- in the AK, during the uprising, when you were telling us that you were in the process of being wounded.</span> <span id="s555">And if you can tell us again how you were wounded, and where you went when you were wounded,

after next day of two days later was releasing the -- the ga-gayshoufka.</span> <span id="s560">Then next project what I have the order, was tekae for recognition to Naftousha.</span> <span id="s561">Naftousha was a part of the povonsky where was the group and the camp from the SS.</span> <span id="s562">That was the place when we have to go - go over there and take care -- make a recognition over there.</span> <span id="s563">And I wen -- went over there with my group, over there to recognition, and this time the German who wi -- the German -- we was in this school building

like a group around maybe hundred, maybe 150 soldiers, this SS, and they have not only SS, they have additional the Russian -- no Russian, this was Ukrainian people.</span> <span id="s566">This time they organize -- the German organize, you know, the -- for the German army, different nationality.</span> <span id="s567">They didn’t have only the Polish nationality, they didn’t have a -- but they

-- exist, was not the people, they think they are people, you know.</span> <span id="s576">And this group, the German SS, and this, the ‘nother SS, going to attack.</span> <span id="s577">When we see they prepare for attack, then we start, because they was waiting, you know, they was not ready for fighting, and we just come and we start fighting with these people.</span> <span id="s578">We probably give him a very hard time, because this was on the cemetery.</span> <span id="s579">We go to the cemetery, to the Povalsky smentoush because on the -- on the north side was a Jewish cemetery, and this was a Catholic cemetery.</span> <span id="s580">We go to the cemetery on the ‘nother side.</span> <span id="s581">And we start fighting very strong with these people, and this time I was wounded.</span> <span id="s582">A friend of mine was killed, and I was wounded.</span> <span id="s583">When I was wounded, I ask to my friend because I was wounded, to try -- like I immediately lost, you know, cannot stay on this leg.</span> <span id="s584">That I told to my friend, “Give me more grenades, hand grenades and leave me alone.</span> <span id="s585">You go, run away and I will stay here, and I be waiting for this German, you know, with the hand grenade, this -- you know, I will be fight as long as I can.”</span> <span id="s586">They thought oh no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s587">We was together so many times before the uprising, we have together so hard time, then no.</span> <span id="s588">They grabbed me and told you no, you will not stay.</span> <span id="s589">And they helped me walk back to this school.</span> <span id="s590">And from this school -- I come to this school, the friends of my see this I wounded, they give me their first help, and then drop me off during the ghetto, because ghetto was no more German, they drop me during the ghetto in the ambulance, because we have ambulance.</span> <span id="s591">During the fighting we find everything.</span> <span id="s592">We have car, we have tanks, and we have ambulance.</span> <span id="s593">They give me -- and they put me in the ambulance, and go with this ambulance through ghetto, through the old town -- through the old town to the hospital.</span> <span id="s594">Was a hospital for the mental people hospital, but still was the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">And they dropped me off.</span> <span id="s596">Over there was -- the drive was terrible because this ambulance go over the street bad -- on street -- across the street, the German make a small train to g - to, you know, to -- they remove the bricks, and use the small train, you -- the wagon, you know, with car -- de-delivered the bricks to the -- t-to the train station, they take the bricks to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s597">And they go with this ambulance over this railroad.</span> <span id="s598">Was terrible, you know?</span> <span id="s599">But still I was survive.</span> <span id="s600">When they get me over there to this hospital, they find -- they make a ha -- this time was still electric, so they make me x-ray.</span> <span id="s601">They find the bones are okay, and they put me on the second floor, this Polish first floor, but the one floor over the ground, to the bed.</span> <span id="s602">I was in this bed to the next day, because next day the Germans start bombed.</span> <span id="s603">And they come, friends of mine which drop me over there, take me from the bed, you know, because was sno -- nothing, was only one dus together with the -- you know, with the mattress, from this on the fl -- on the stairs, dropped me down, and over the street to the ‘nother building.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Did the Germans bomb that building?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: They bombed all building.</span> <span id="s606">The German -- listen, the -- the German bombed the hospital, the German -- like a ghetto, what was in the ghetto was in the beginning -- the uprising in ghetto was later, but in the beginning was no uprising.</span> <span id="s607">The g -- people in ghetto, they didn’t fight with the German.</span> <span id="s608">And when the -- when the Jewish people start uprising, start uprising because they’re innocent people, innocent people what the people -- what the -- they bombed these people, they killed these people.</span> <span id="s609">That was the reason that in -- in the ghetto they start uprising.</span> <span id="s610">But first they start to kill the innocent people, and the German dropped the bomb on the hospital.</span> <span id="s611">They don’t recognize nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Somewhere you had mentioned that as a consequence of a bombing while you were in the hospital, you were almost buried --</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes, it was from this hospital, they give me to the -- over the street to the ‘nother place what was near hospital, that was restaurant.</span> <span id="s614">In this restaurant the windows was covered with sandbags, and then was the people which survive from this hospital, they bring to this restaurant.</span> <span id="s615">Was a one cell -- I don’t remember how many people -- was no more like 10 - 15 people in this one room, you know, wounded.</span> <span id="s616">And -- and if I remember only was Sunday, this I remember, and I remember that this Sunday, the -- the Germans start very hard bombing the -- this area, the whole old town, because was in old town.</span> <span id="s617">And then I stay up and I talk to the friends of mine that listen, we have to maybe try to go to the -- under the church because it’s a very strong building.</span> <span id="s618">This time I cannot walk, but they give me, you know, now they -- piece of wood, you know, with a little bit cut what I put under th -- my arm, and I use this wood and my left leg.</span> <span id="s619">In this moment, what I se -- I remember only onet.</span> <span id="s620">I have seen the orange color only, I never -- no noise, no nothing, and I see the orange -- very orange color, and was finish, I was unconscious, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s621">This I remember the last moment, orange color.</span> <span id="s622">And I don’t know when I wake up, I don’t know how long, maybe -- maybe few hours, maybe two days, I don’t know this, exactly how long.</span> <span id="s623">But anyway, when I wake up, I t-tried to make a voice, I couldn’t, because when I start talking, I start pick up a lot of dust, you know, because I was completely covered.</span> <span id="s624">And w -- st-start make a voice, that I cannot, that I start yelling, very slowly, and this time when I start yelling, I have heard some girl voice that, “I heard you, I will try to help you.”</span> <span id="s625">And then she start looking for me, and open me, a little bit over my head, because what happen, the bomb throw away me from the building, the building collapse, my legs was in the frame of the -- of the doors, and my head was outside.</span> <span id="s626">And through the very large doors, the -- all the dust go out, you know, on the angle, and I was here.</span> <span id="s627">There was pretty -- not very high over there my head.</span> <span id="s628">She open me, you know, that I see the light, and I have the a -- then she call for the help, they come, the people, and remove me from this.</span> <span id="s629">When they remove me from this place, I was completely without cloth, nothing, everything was take out from me.</span> <span id="s630">I was completely like a newborn, and I -- my body was a violet color.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: Papers that you had with you, your identification?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: No -- everything stay -- I don’t know, because everything was out.</span> <span id="s633">What was else?</span> <span id="s634">When -- first moment when I wake up, I know that I have in my pocket gun, that I told to myself I would be -- I would die here, this is only one [indecipherable] that when I shoot myself, I kill myself.</span> <span id="s635">I would be n -- I would be short story, would be -- not stay like this.</span> <span id="s636">But I was in this position that I cannot move hand, nor move nothing, because I was completely cover, you know, with bricks, with dust, with everything.</span> <span id="s637">And when I -- when they -- when they find me, when I said I was completely -- all clothes, all documents, everything was out, I have nothing on me.</span> <span id="s638">And later, it was in January or February -- no, febru -- no, after the war was -- it was like in May, I think, they exhumated all bodies from -- because the places like this in Warsaw was plenty.</span> <span id="s639">They exhumated lot of places.</span> <span id="s640">Over there was my ver -- my very good friend who were over there.</span> <span id="s641">And I was told by [indecipherable] he -- he -- his wife told me that he was bed -- be -- that will be his funeral in the church, that I went to this church.</span> <span id="s642">This time, th -- when they exhumated these bodies was I don’t remember, six or seven bodies, was six or seven casket, one of the top the ‘nother one, in one church was one mass, and one funeral for these all people.</span> <span id="s643">And on each casket was their name and their all information.</span> <span id="s644">And I was for this funeral, because this George who you know, you [indecipherable] he was over there.</span> <span id="s645">And after I was sick, I feel very bad, and I was a little bit late that I stay on the end in the church, that was fuel -- full with the people.</span> <span id="s646">And then come to me the one girl, and she take from my hand and bring to me to the -- to the casket.</span> <span id="s647">I thought -- was a surprise because she know me very well, my name and everything, and she -- the name they -- and because her boyfriend was killed over there between these people, and I saw, hey, this is everything correct.</span> <span

that’s me.</span> <span id="s650">That when I find this I went later to the Red Cross, and I start discuss with the Red Cross that -- that it was whole big discussion, because they thought listen, the story was close, why you bothered us?</span> <span id="s651">You know, the person was buried, everything is finished, and you start open the case again?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: And how was it resolved?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: And the result, you know, I get -- they give me these documents, and they opened the documents, and they find these documents because I’ve [indecipherable] they find the -- the -- you know, the doc -- all documents in red color, they find this document, and this document what I bring here, down from the Red Cross in Warsaw what I get.</span> <span id="s654">And because was -- the house was buried -- the -- the -- bombed, and tof -- was fired, this reason, that this document was like a few months, or few weeks -- few months in the -- in the building, and this -- there is under -- was in this condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: Do you remember more or less when this accident took place, this bombing when you were buried?</span> <span id="s656">Do you remember more or less when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: What the --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: This orange flash of --</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Yes, I just remember the orange flash and finish, and no more, and -- and I didn’t know what happened less.</span> <span id="s660">I didn’t -- did not, completely no idea.</span> <span id="s661">And only find -- I don’t know how long I was unconscious, I don’t know how long they keep -- when they again -- somebody heard my voice and opened this.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Okay, from that period of time, do you remember when the funeral took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Oh, it was few months, because was during the uprising in the old town.</span> <span id="s664">It was the -- it was August, approximately.</span> <span id="s665">It was not September yet, it was August, maybe eight -- maybe 20, maybe 25th August, during the uprising, before you know, this -- when I was oo -- oo -- ooldit -- when I was, you know, under the -- under the bombing, and then the funeral, it was in ‘44, and funeral was in the -- when the -- was a Russian come, it was probably in May, maybe a -- maybe April, maybe May ‘45.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: This was few -- nice few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: So it was seven or eight months after.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Seven or eight months, and the people even then exhumated the people, during this time they can not recognize, you know, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: -- absolutely not.</span> <span id="s672">They find the body, they find the [indecipherable] was this -- that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Was impossible, you know, the thought -- you know, find what is the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Well, you have given us a very impressive variety of issues.</span> <span id="s675">Okay.</span> <span id="s676">We’d like you to go back now in the discussion to when you were talking about the sabotaging of trains that you were trained to do.</span> <span id="s677">And if you could tell us a little about the difference between your, or -- the difference bet -- how you sabotaged military trains, and whether you sabotaged non-military trains, passenger trains, or any other kinds of trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No, we -- we sabotage only -- because we have a -- the people which working on trains will belong to organization and get us all information.</span> <span id="s679">We sabotage two type of train, the military train with the soldiers, and the train with supply, with ammunition, with other supply which went to the east front.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s681">Okay.</span> <span id="s682">So those were the only two trains -- two types of trains that you were actually sabotaging?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">Q: And in the sabotaging, how did you get word of which train to destroy?</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: We know exac -- we know exactly how it works.</span> <span id="s686">We -- before we sabotage the train, first we went to the fute and check the -- find the area in which place we can blow the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Because I was engineer, I was very good t-train that I know, I have information from the sky.</span> <span id="s688">You know, we called from sky, from the -- from the -- what they drop us off, which place was the best.</span> <span id="s689">Always the place to blow the train was a curve, when the train was on the curve.</span> <span id="s690">Because when you blow on the curve the train, you blow the same time, two lines.</span> <span id="s691">That’s mean you di -- di -- two -- because was two train, two direction there, you have to blow that train this way, that you blow both direction, not one direction.</span> <span id="s692">The train which you blow has to the same time block the ‘nother direction of the line.</span> <span id="s693">It was the whole -- the most difficult combination.</span> <span id="s694">Then we find the place, that when we find the place, we told the -- we ready to take care about this place.</span> <span id="s695">They told us okay, that the same day was designed.</span> <span id="s696">For instance, one day, one approximately time, was designed in different place, that mean different group the same -- get the same orders.</span> <span id="s697">And now, they orga -- have connection with the -- with the time table of the train, they thought, listen, this place when you find would be the train, this, this and this time, there will be the train which is going eastbound, or westbound, they told -- told us, they told this time, because the -- the same day was explode the train different places.</span> <span id="s698">And sometimes you get the train from there, this oolopsoogen,, the vacation train, or other time you get the train for the supply.</span> <span id="s699">You know, this was not the plan from us, it the plan from the schedule, you know, what you can find this time.</span> <span id="s700">And they told us the train will be approximately this -- on this time, run.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: That’s mean, you know, th -- they -- we know that that -- that train will be going over there, will be blow.</span> <span id="s703">The train we make it two different way.</span> <span id="s704">In the beginning, we make explosion.</span> <span id="s705">This way, the explosive material was start for explosion by the locomotive, in the beginning, because we didn’t have so much supply.</span> <span id="s706">That’s mean we put the whole material, prepare under the train, and the -- before the material was in the o -- some land was all explosive for the start explosion.</span> <span id="s707">It was beginning.</span> <span id="s708">That’s mean if something happened, if would be wrong train, you don’t have a choice, because was explosion automatically.</span> <span id="s709">Fortunately we never have an accident in which we don’t want.</span> <span id="s710">And later, we get machine for explosion.</span> <span id="s711">Was a machine when you press down, you make electric explosion.</span> <span id="s712">You know, that mean you explode that train which you want, in that time which you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: And that was more effective?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: More -- not -- not only more effective, but you know, the first you have to calculate it, the time, how long, you know, you have to calculate it the speed of the that train, because it - you can poss -- if you maybe too -- too close that the locomotive passed the explosion, and would be the fourth or third, you know, car blow up.</span> <span id="s715">And you have to blow always the locomotive, was more ecu -- effective.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: During the time when you were involved in these activities, did you ever find any Jewish participation [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s718">We have -- we have -- because for this action, usually go this way, that we working in different ways, was three different ways.</span> <span id="s719">In the beginning, was a group like three or four guys from our group only blow the -- make this action.</span> <span id="s720">Later, was action required more people that come the people, the people from the woods.</span> <span id="s721">That’s mean we coming like a specialist, and they come, they people which they [indecipherable] watching for us.</span> <span id="s722">And we help him, and in this group was the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s723">In this group I met few times the Jewish people, because we make -- they was made arrangement and we met in the place, and we didn’t watch the face one [indecipherable] but you can find right away, you know.</span> <span id="s724">We have the -- the -- this Jewish people was in the woods, they was.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: How did you know they were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: They -- they -- they talking, you know, because we talking, you know, they -- sometime they thought we help a Jewish guy [indecipherable] they thought.</span> <span id="s727">Because the Jewish people in this time in the partisan, what they thought was they were very valuable, you know, when they fighting, because the worse -- worse -- if somebody -- fighter was the worse if he have family.</span> <span id="s728">The most active, and most valuable, was without family.</span> <span id="s729">The most of us was single, was ne -- no married, you know, because married has a wife, got the children, and who was single, you know, all the young kids what were fighting was single.</span> <span id="s730">We didn’t have this -- this ballast, you know, for they -- for they remember about the family.</span> <span id="s731">The problem [indecipherable] ours mothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s733">That you had.</span> <span id="s734">Do you remember whether you’ve heard of, or you saw any hostility on the part of the Polish AK towards the Jewish partisans, or Jews who wanted to participate in the uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s736">Never I have heard -- even I tell you.</span> <span id="s737">It was the additional -- two Akar was two different organization.</span> <span id="s738">Was a BH, bartelyoni huopsky, it was -- it was the ‘nother organization -- it was the ‘nother organization, the Communist organization was -- no -- have to remember, remind myself.</span> <span id="s739">One second, I remind myself.</span> <span id="s740">Armia ludova, AL, armia ludova.</span> <span id="s741">That’s -- what was the story?</span> <span id="s742">Akar was friendly for everybody, bartelyoni huopsky was friendly for everybody, but armia ludova was not friendly for everybody.</span> <span id="s743">They always watching for another people like for the same for enemies.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Could you give me an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I have heard -- I was not involved, but I have heard from friend -- friend of mines that armia ludova fight a few times with the -- with the armia cryova, and with the bartelyoni huopsky.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Do you have any idea why they did?</span> <span id="s747">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: But in your experience you’ve never heard of any hostility between the AK and Jews who took [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: No, never, never, never.</span> <span id="s750">This, never.</span> <span id="s751">You know, I tell you additional.</span> <span id="s752">The Polish people, during the hard time, when you have a really problem, they are fighting all together against the -- against the problem.</span> <span id="s753">They try -- everybody, you know, help very, very good.</span> <span id="s754">I give you -- maybe we’re not taping this, but I tell you the ‘nother story.</span> <span id="s755">It was in Warsaw, in 1940, maybe one -- ‘41, was a gun -- was a helmia -- hel -- Nearna Street run -- I was a witness, run the guy away, and ta -- oozas calling politics, politician.</span> <span id="s756">And was not -- of the street was no cars, not buses, was a crowded old people walking on the street, you know, small street.</span> <span id="s757">The people just give him a space, and the guy ran away.</span> <span id="s758">The guy who ran behind him, he cannot -- and in one moment the guy was -- he run -- he is not politic, he steal my [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s759">The guy was on the floor in one second.</span> <span id="s760">You -- you understand this?</span> <span id="s761">When he was -- the people help him right, but he was a chief, oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: This is a good example, you know, how the all people, all people was tied together.</span> <span id="s764">Was not enemies, was always was all the friends.</span> <span id="s765">But I talking the bo -- the armia ludova was not -- they was not fighting, they didn’t have a group in Warsaw, they have only the small group outside the Warsaw.</span> <span id="s766">Only one action with the armia ludova have said that was belong to him, I was not sure -- it was -- I don’t remember exactly, yeah, they bir -- they dropped few gra -- hand grenades to the cafeteria which was only for the German.</span> <span id="s767">It was on the corner the allia zalinsky and nofisfiat, I don’t remember the name of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s768">And they dropped the bomb, you know, explosive that later was a big story because for this, a -- grenades which didn’t kill no Germans, just wounded few, they probably kill few hundred of Polish people.</span> <span id="s769">One action -- what vogler was d -- was done by the -- by the -- by the -- this armia ludova.</span> <span id="s770">You’re talking about another sabotage.</span> <span id="s771">I have even here the article, I wouldn’t to translated this, because what I told you the -- the -- our job was cleaning the apartments, what I told you, that.</span> <span id="s772">Gestapo was so upset that they come to the room, apartment was clean, and sometime they fight with us because was -- we expect they coming, you know, they waiting one or two guys, and we was coming big group, and -- you know, with good recognition.</span> <span id="s773">They bring small -- small Panzer wagon.</span> <span id="s774">You know, the small Panzer wagon they prepare was not new, but was used, and they bring to the harkapay.</span> <span id="s775">Harkapay was head of [indecipherable], it was a German organization which repair and tribute all cars for the army.</span> <span id="s776">This car was over there, but people which working was a Polish worker.</span> <span id="s777">They bring this small Panzer car to this -- to one garage ou forty per.</span> <span id="s778">And this car, the German supposed to pick up -- the Gestapo -- supposed to pick up like nine o’clock in the morning one day.</span> <span id="s779">It was winter, and this day we know about this, and we decided that this guy would be better would be - belong to us like for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s780">That we come seven o’clock in the morning and pick this car up.</span> <span id="s781">I have whole article, if I have the time I translate it, you know, because this was -- we call this action plouskva.</span> <span id="s782">Plouskva, this is a back, the small back I don’t know, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Well, perhaps after the interview we can hold it up and -- and take a picture of it, and we can discuss it.</span> <span id="s784">But I -- I would like to thank you very much Mr. Madejski.</span> <span id="s785">Okay.</span> <span id="s786">Okay.</span> <span id="s787">Then, what we’re going to do is move beyond this experience, into the time after the war when the Russians came, and found you, and inducted you into the Russian army, or the equivalent of it at that time.</span> <span id="s788">So maybe you can tell us a little about that part of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Yeah, this mean, in -- after the uprising, I was in Potekovalishna what I said.</span> <span id="s790">From Potekovalishna, in February -- in February what was very cold -- something like in February, or maybe beginning the February, maybe end of the appa -- s -- f -- January, when the Russian come over, because they come like in the January, begin the January, I went from Potekovalishna, because you have no -- no possibility to live.</span> <span id="s791">I go to the Piotkov Telbunaski.</span> <span id="s792">Piotkov Telbunaski, this is another village, what I have a friends.</span> <span id="s793">Is on the south of Poland.</span> <span id="s794">I went over there, and then come the -- this time come the Russian over there for good.</span> <span id="s795">And then I pick up all young people to the army, because I was in the Akar, and for me was convenient go to the army, because they looking for the member of Akar, and send him for Siberia, that I went for the army, but I have a good friends.</span> <span id="s796">And friend of mine was -- he was priest, and he was there because this time in the army was a priest and was rabbi.</span> <span id="s797">In -- in Polish army there was, you know, religion, was a p -- the priest and rabbi in all branches.</span> <span id="s798">And was friend of mine was a priest in the army and he thought listen, I have a very good friend which is in there, you know, this -- no politic, I -- d -- d -- the branch which s -- s -- s -- you know, send the people in different parts to the work in the army.</span> <span id="s799">They make a -- for you, this -- that you will be sent for the - to the priest, to help the priest because you have -- you can drive, and the priest need a driver for this car.</span> <span id="s800">And they sent me to the priest there, I went to the army, and they sent me to the priest, I go back.</span> <span id="s801">Was this organization, was this headquarter of this priest was close to the Warsaw, in Vuokie.</span> <span id="s802">It was one small building, in half a building was the priest.</span> <span id="s803">They called general priest of the army, they -- now they have a building with general rabbi of the army.</span> <span id="s804">There was -- I remember the name of this priest, the rabbi was a Dr. Kahanai, and the priest was do -- was Dr. ves -- Vahaworski.</span> <span id="s805">These two names -- these two guys was in one building, very good friends, you know, we help one each other, always the -- they come to priest for the -- for the Catholic food, and we go to the good fish to th -- to th -- to the rabbi.</span> <span id="s806">It was like this, I was in this place up to the end, it was ‘45 up to the end of the October, because in the end of the October, there was the order for the army, that all soldiers which have a -- have diploma on the Polytech Institute, they has to be released from the army to finish his study.</span> <span id="s807">And he’s doy -- was the end of my experience with the army.</span> <span id="s808">And this time, I went to the Polytechnic Institute, and I s-study.</span> <span id="s809">The study was not long time ago, because after approximately two or three weeks, three o’clock in the morning was big knock to my doors.</span> <span id="s810">“Wake up, you are mik -- ma -- Mieczyslaw Madejski?”</span> <span id="s811">“Yes, I am.”</span> <span id="s812">“Come with us.”</span> <span id="s813">They took me to the endcavoodare, to the -- to praga, to the city and metro district.</span> <span id="s814">Over there they put me to the nice room on the second floor -- on the main floor, you know, was like a -- I was only one person in this building.</span> <span

to the building.</span> <span id="s817">Hey, I get a breakfast, I get the supper, very good.</span> <span id="s818">I thought, “What they keep me here for?”</span> <span id="s819">The next day come the 'nother guy in the same uniform like I am, and he ask me, “What you sitting for?”</span> <span id="s820">I don’t know, I don’t know what they give me from home, I don’t know what is going on.</span> <span id="s821">The guy told me the same.</span> <span id="s822">I didn’t discuss too much, because I didn’t know what the story.</span> <span id="s823">I know from the -- from the -- you

interrogation, and they told me you belong to the Akar.</span> <span id="s826">No, I never belonged to the Akar, what is Akar?</span> <span id="s827">I was -- you know, I don’t want -- I know that Akar was to Siberia.</span> <span id="s828">I was in the army, you know, I was the pu -- student, and so on, you know.</span> <span id="s829">And was like a -- two or three days, and they -- after four days I still didn’t say nothing, they tried to talk with me, “You are a student, you attend to the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute, you a smart guy, you have to -- we need a guy who will be co-operating with us.”</span> <span id="s830">I told myself, oh, ho, ho, this is the -- I have -- I cannot hang myself yet, I’m too young.</span> <span id="s831">If I go up with this way I will hang myself, that I -- on the -- was the summer -- no, it was -- I don’t remember what.</span> <span id="s832">Anyway, I see the -- on the yard, they repaired the car, that the guy told me about this, I thought this car working improperly, the engine is work improperly.</span> <span id="s833">He told me, “You dummy.”</span> <span id="s834">And hit me in my face, and I fall on the floor.</span> <span id="s835">That was discussion like this seven or eight days, every day.</span> <span id="s836">Sometimes 12 o'clock in the night, sometime bring me like a two o'clock in the morning, and they keep me

trip, and how he survived.</span> <span id="s873">And he taught me that Communist is a system.</span> <span id="s874">That system, that’s mean in the beginning they have to explain all poor people -- all poor people that everything what is wrong, this is because the rich people.</span> <span id="s875">They taught me -- my father taught me, when every people will have the same, you know, level, they thought the blonde people are nice, and the people which have a black head are no good.</span> <span id="s876">And when there will be -- when they went all people, changed their color, the people

<span id="s887">And then the reason that he can go to the Polytechnical University without examp -- without points, you know.</span> <span id="s888">You need the points, if you worker you have five points, if you in prison you have negative five points, or zero points.</span> <span id="s889">And he thought -- I very glad that he win, because he to -- able come to university.</span> <span
