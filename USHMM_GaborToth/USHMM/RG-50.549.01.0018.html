are right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">Answer: Well my name is Felix Horn.</span> <span id="s4">I was born in Poland, in Lublin.</span> <span id="s5">And I am a survivor.</span> <span id="s6">I was liberated in 1945 and after liberation I went searching for anyone who might be still alive from my family so I returned to my hometown, Lublin.</span> <span id="s7">Which is in the middle of Poland.</span> <span id="s8">It is one of the rather bigger, larger cities.</span> <span id="s9">There were 140,000 people prior to the war.</span> <span id="s10">Out of this at least half of it, 70,000 people comprised of Jewish population.</span> <span id="s11">My family, a rather assimilated family and they all perished, all prior to 1945 when Lublin ghetto was destroyed and all went to, as far as I know, to the concentration camp, My-don-ick (ph).</span> <span id="s12">I came back to Lublin in 1945 and there was already some Jewish life present in Lublin, mainly from people who had returned from Russia, who escaped the war, escaped the Nazis and went to Soviet Russia and survived the war over there.</span> <span id="s13">I met some of my acquaintances, some friends even from my school days, but not from my school per se since I was only Jewish student in a Catholic school.</span> <span id="s14">And as anybody else you register and you left notes on the walls and then anybody who talked to you, look I am here, if you hear anything from this and that please let me know, and to my surprise, I found two Uncles, they survived the war.</span> <span id="s15">One survived being hidden by a Polish family.</span> <span id="s16">He used to be an officer in Polish Air Force prior to the war, which was very, very uncommon.</span> <span id="s17">And he was looking for the property that belonged to my grandparents actually, thinking everybody perished so he can probably take over the property.</span> <span id="s18">One of my favorite Uncles.</span> <span id="s19">Another Uncle, his younger brother, survived in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s20">He escaped the Nazis in Eastern Poland and he was a musician.</span> <span id="s21">He organized a military band for Marshal Teito (ph) of Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s22">And that's how he got into the partisan group and so on and he spent all the time until 1945 when I found him in my home town too.</span> <span id="s23">Everybody came home looking for survivors.</span> <span id="s24">And he attempted to take me with him to Yugoslavia since we found that nobody else survived the war, which my parents and my sister, all my Uncles, cousins, numerous people.</span> <span id="s25">And he couldn't get me legally to Yugoslavia since I was not so-called blood relative.</span> <span id="s26">I'm only a nephew.</span> <span id="s27">If I be his brother or his child it would be different.</span> <span id="s28">So I couldn't go with him so I was left in Poland again.</span> <span id="s29">My Uncle was not particularly close to me after the war anyway.</span> <span id="s30">And we didn't find too many things in common.</span> <span id="s31">However, I didn't know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s32">I remember I promised my Mom that if I survived I would make all attempt I can to resume my education.</span> <span id="s33">I did have two years of medical school, until 1941.</span> <span id="s34">Between 1939 and 1941.</span> <span id="s35">And then I had to interrupt for obvious reasons, and then the decision had to be made.</span> <span id="s36">Should I go make a living somehow, I was hungry?</span> <span id="s37">I had a wife.</span> <span id="s38">We were married in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s39">And, or go to school.</span> <span id="s40">We couldn't afford, both of us were young, to go to school.</span> <span id="s41">How's going to support us?</span> <span id="s42">So I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s43">I __________________ in a kind of a confused frame of mind but my first Uncle came to rescue.</span> <span id="s44">He gave me some gold coins to sell in the black market and buy food, and do whatever I wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Who did this?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: My Uncle who survived in Poland.</span> <span id="s47">He was the officer of Polish Air Force.</span> <span id="s48">I used the coins for about two years to survive.</span> <span id="s49">I didn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s50">It was, situation very chaotic in Poland.</span> <span id="s51">The Communists took over.</span> <span id="s52">The only chance was to go to school.</span> <span id="s53">So I thought, well, there's time to do it.</span> <span id="s54">I registered, I had saved all my documents, they were buried.</span> <span id="s55">All my documents except my High School Degree, which somehow was lost.</span> <span id="s56">But I did have my University Degrees, my University books, and attendance in the classes, and fortunately all the professors from my former University in Luneburg called Woolf (ph), they moved to Western Poland at that time, and I decided to move to Breslau, __________________, former German territory, where the same professor of my former school, Woolf (ph), resided now in the same town.</span> <span id="s57">So I registered with no problem whatsoever.</span> <span id="s58">The papers were okay.</span> <span id="s59">The only thing is there was another Jewish student with me, don't recall exactly where he came from, but the remarks I heard in the class.</span> <span id="s60">It was, another two Jews.</span> <span id="s61">Hitler didn't kill all of you?</span> <span id="s62">You know, and the class was so annoying, not annoying but frightening even.</span> <span id="s63">And the common trend was at that time the refugees coming back from Russia to Poland, not finding no purpose living in Poland, they all were going West.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Let me ask you about that a little bit, just the atmosphere in Poland at that time.</span> <span id="s65">The Nazis were gone, but as you're describing, it was still not a very friendly environment for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what that was like?</span> <span id="s68">What that felt like?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, just to mention here that I was raised in a rather very modern Jewish home, although my home was kosher.</span> <span id="s70">Just because kosher was believed to be healthier and free of any contamination and so on.</span> <span id="s71">But my father was very progressive man.</span> <span id="s72">First he was a locksmith then he became an architect with night education and so on.</span> <span id="s73">He was a modern person.</span> <span id="s74">And we were living away from the Jewish center mostly so I had a formal Jewish education.</span> <span id="s75">I had a teacher come to my home teaching me religion, Torah, you know, Hum-ish (ph), all the biblical stories and so on.</span> <span id="s76">I never spoke Yiddish though.</span> <span id="s77">My parents spoke Yiddish to each other.</span> <span id="s78">I brought from school, I was going to a Catholic school, Yiddish was foreign to me.</span> <span id="s79">But I did understand everything they were saying but they were talking to me in Polish.</span> <span id="s80">I was so comfortable, my Polish is really impeccable.</span> <span id="s81">Poles have difficult time to look at me, I have Semitic look though.</span> <span id="s82">And then my Polish is so different than the Jews in Poland.</span> <span id="s83">You can spot a Jew during the war, they looked super.</span> <span id="s84">In other words, they looked like typical Pole, Nordic type.</span> <span id="s85">Blonde, blue eyes, etc.</span> <span id="s86">I have a very short nose and the way they walked and so on you can tell the difference.</span> <span id="s87">Jews were walking more as bent __________________, kind of scared a little bit.</span> <span id="s88">Even peaceful time, they are looking left and right.</span> <span id="s89">Someone might be hitting them or attack them or something.</span> <span id="s90">It didn't have to be a problem.</span> <span id="s91">You could be hit by one person, only two people, but young hooligans.</span> <span id="s92">Boys.</span> <span id="s93">Seven, nine, ten years old throwing stones, hitting with a piece of anything, an iron pipe, or whatever.</span> <span id="s94">So, you know, I was different.</span> <span id="s95">I was straight.</span> <span id="s96">My Polish was impeccable as they say but they knew who I was because I did return to my original name, which is not classical Polish but its not Jewish or Yiddish either.</span> <span id="s97">Horn is really rather German or Dutch.</span> <span id="s98">Van Horn, Von Horn, they are German names.</span> <span id="s99">So there was a little confusion, __________________ wanted to know who I am.</span> <span id="s100">No one dared to ask me exactly, are you a Jew or not?</span> <span id="s101">But then shortly in classes I didn't hide it.</span> <span id="s102">I didn't have no reason to hide it anymore.</span> <span id="s103">I was hiding all those years.</span> <span id="s104">So then they come and seek it, who I am.</span> <span id="s105">So there was people, I still have quite a few friends, Polish friends.</span> <span id="s106">But many of them were for safety or security reasons, to say, shy away from me.</span> <span id="s107">They exchange words with me rather polite and so on but not very cordial.</span> <span id="s108">So I felt very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s109">And then during the pilgrim in Kielce in Poland I got fired to existing situation, you know, and we felt, we felt very insecure.</span> <span id="s110">And being young, saying what am I going to do in Poland?</span> <span id="s111">I couldn't live in a country that I didn't have a grave to go to.</span> <span id="s112">We had nobody left.</span> <span id="s113">My Uncle went back to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s114">The other one converted to Christianity, the first one.</span> <span id="s115">They had nothing to do with Judaism, they had nothing to do with me either because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">Not that he hated the Jews.</span> <span id="s117">No.</span> <span id="s118">Why did he do it?</span> <span id="s119">I don't know.</span> <span id="s120">We never talked about it.</span> <span id="s121">He was not a person I could have a dialogue with anyway.</span> <span id="s122">When I left I didn't say good-bye to him, he was not very interested.</span> <span id="s123">So talking to a few other students of other departments in University, the University __________________ school, philosophical department, so on and so on.</span> <span id="s124">We talked about it and I inquire how they feel about it?</span> <span id="s125">What would they do?</span> <span id="s126">Would they stay here?</span> <span id="s127">What are their plans actually?</span> <span id="s128">They were all in the same boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: These were other Jewish students?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: These were other Jewish students or?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: That you were speaking with about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Some of them.</span> <span id="s135">But most of them not.</span> <span id="s136">But they admitted who they are.</span> <span id="s137">They were Jewish and so on.</span> <span id="s138">And we all agreed that probably it is time to leave.</span> <span id="s139">It would have to be illegal.</span> <span id="s140">There was no legal way for them to have left.</span> <span id="s141">You didn't have no visa.</span> <span id="s142">You have nobody over seas to send us legal papers.</span> <span id="s143">Besides those papers would take ages before you get legal entry, you know.</span> <span id="s144">Even after you get you're visa you might take five, ten years.</span> <span id="s145">Some of my friends had to go to Sweden because it was much faster to get out of Sweden to the United States they say than wait in Poland for you're number to come up and not to be recognized, especially if you're a Jew.</span> <span id="s146">And so I organized a student Kibbutz (ph), an academic Kibbutz (ph) of students.</span> <span id="s147">And I think in Hebrew they call it Kibbutz acadamime (ph) if I recall correctly, what I was told.</span> <span id="s148">I was not good at Hebrew either.</span> <span id="s149">I read Hebrew, I read my Prayer Book and so on but I don't understand them.</span> <span id="s150">I read automatically.</span> <span id="s151">I know the text, what it means, but not word by word.</span> <span id="s152">But my wife speaks Hebrew.</span> <span id="s153">And we elected to leave and we made contact with some what they call a Bree-ha (ph), I don't know if you're familiar with that word?</span> <span id="s154">Bree-ha (ph) is a group of young, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s155">The avant-garde of the Pal-mach (ph), of the Jewish driving force of information of Israeli Armed Forces.</span> <span id="s156">Those are the young people who are politically involved in Zionist organizations and they are pioneering, collecting the remnants of whatever is left over for the Jewish people to go back to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s157">There was no Israel yet.</span> <span id="s158">And this was one of the stages, first to get us out of the hostile Poland where people didn't want to give us back nothing what we had.</span> <span id="s159">As a matter of fact all my furniture was given to some neighbors and so on.</span> <span id="s160">They refused to give me anything, you know?</span> <span id="s161">They belonged to us.</span> <span id="s162">The fur coats and radios, instead of give to the Nazis we give to the Poles.</span> <span id="s163">They did not have to relinquish their status.</span> <span id="s164">And we gave to them, good idea, that if we survived we'd get something back, at least something.</span> <span id="s165">Talking about silverware, the candelabra that were a few hundred years old, heavy, tall.</span> <span id="s166">All those things perished of course.</span> <span id="s167">They, when they found out that I am alive, you know, they said the Germans took it, they had to sell it, some of them.</span> <span id="s168">They couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s169">Anyway, it was immaterial anymore to me, I lost more than that.</span> <span id="s170">And with this we made a contact with the bra-ha (ph) and on a given night all gathered and by train we are going to a little town near the border.</span> <span id="s171">From there we were met by a group of people, we never really introduced before.</span> <span id="s172">They knew about us though.</span> <span id="s173">And with their help and their contacts with the border police and so on, they just looked the other way.</span> <span id="s174">We went right across the border to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s175">Don't forget, this was, at that time it was 1946.</span> <span id="s176">Still people coming and going to Poland, looking for family.</span> <span id="s177">From Poland to Vienna, Austria, Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s178">Looking for some survivors, different concentration camp.</span> <span id="s179">So the guards at the border were not very religious in stopping people.</span> <span id="s180">Even if they seen somebody.</span> <span id="s181">There was no invasion or so, there was a peaceful type of a bi-directional type of movement, you know.</span> <span id="s182">But anyway, as a group maybe we would create suspicion so we were able to get from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s183">They put us on trucks to Vienna.</span> <span id="s184">And then over there we were met by a group of Zionists, all __________________ Zionists.</span> <span id="s185">And they were very instrumental.</span> <span id="s186">Thanks to them, they saved us in the beginning.</span> <span id="s187">First they had contact with the local authorities, also notorious.</span> <span id="s188">Don't forget they had a lot of influence because Austrian authorities were more Nazi than the German Nazis.</span> <span id="s189">So they were very, very guilty during the war, what happened.</span> <span id="s190">So for that reason alone probably they tried to collaborate with the Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s191">First we got a school to our disposal.</span> <span id="s192">We have no home so they give us a whole school, big room, and there were twenty or twenty-one of us, two married couples and some girls and some boys.</span> <span id="s193">So we had to divide the one huge room, it was like a theater of some kind or an auditorium, with sheets, wires, and we cover, you know, separate, like small cubicles.</span> <span id="s194">We had the beds over there like military beds.</span> <span id="s195">And it was very comfortable really.</span> <span id="s196">And they took all of our documents, I'm talking about student books and our academically type of documentation, and they translate everything for us into German.</span> <span id="s197">And they, having some contacts at the University, we didn't have to go to a very rigorous type of screening or so, as long as our documents were in order, then they segregated us into different facilities and who ever was in medicine, some were first time that they started the University.</span> <span id="s198">I was already a third year medical school student, fourth year.</span> <span id="s199">I had one year after the war in Poland so this would be my fourth year.</span> <span id="s200">But medicine in Vienna was seven years so I still had four, five, six, four more years to go.</span> <span id="s201">In German, that I never handled.</span> <span id="s202">I spoke French.</span> <span id="s203">I speak Slavic languages, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, never German.</span> <span id="s204">But I learn it fast.</span> <span id="s205">And they were accepted, they accepted all my former papers and exams I passed.</span> <span id="s206">Maybe because we were survivors.</span> <span id="s207">I'm sure there was some bearing to it, you know?</span> <span id="s208">They did not let us suffer, they wanted to make it as smooth as a transition until they knew, around this new medical school, as they could.</span> <span id="s209">Which I was very grateful for.</span> <span id="s210">We had no tuition.</span> <span id="s211">American Joint provided this.</span> <span id="s212">And then we received food, they provide food for us too.</span> <span id="s213">So we were like a little Kubbutz (ph), student group, living and doing nothing but study so we were not hungry.</span> <span id="s214">And that's, slowly we got ourselves kind of use to the new surroundings, new people.</span> <span id="s215">We met some friends who were there before us from Poland.</span> <span id="s216">Some of them Viennese Jewish students, one.</span> <span id="s217">We were very close.</span> <span id="s218">I'm sure we're much closer now than if this would have happened before the war.</span> <span id="s219">Because we have something in common, we're all Jews and we all lost somebody.</span> <span id="s220">There was not one person who was not victimized by loosing his family or part of his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Let me just ask you did people in that situation you're in, with people with that background, did you all talk about, did you compare experiences much?</span> <span id="s222">Talk about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s224">I think our experiences were different.</span> <span id="s225">Everybody had a different story to tell.</span> <span id="s226">And, someone came from Russia, some had survived in the labor camps in Romania, some students survived in ghettos in Hungary and they were beaten and so they were persecuted, but they survived.</span> <span id="s227">And someone survived in their families even, like a sister or two brothers or one parent survived, you know?</span> <span id="s228">But always someone had somebody that he lost, he or she lost, you know?</span> <span id="s229">But we had common ground because we belonged to the same group of people.</span> <span id="s230">We were Jews, we are students, but we got there different ways, by different routes, you know?</span> <span id="s231">And everybody had their own stories.</span> <span id="s232">We sit at night and talk and talk and talk.</span> <span id="s233">And everybody was not fascinated because this was a tragic story to be fascinated with, but it proved the just human will to survive and the question was, how did you survive?</span> <span id="s234">Until today I ask myself the same question, how did I survive?</span> <span id="s235">I don't know.</span> <span id="s236">There was nothing that you are smart, that you knew what to do.</span> <span id="s237">If you turn left it was you're death but I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s238">You turn right, you survive.</span> <span id="s239">If you walked out during the day no one stopped you.</span> <span id="s240">At night, they shoot you.</span> <span id="s241">So it's hard to say.</span> <span id="s242">Is that fate?</span> <span id="s243">I never believe in fate, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s244">Some of my Indian colleagues, physicians, right now who is very, __________________, he believe fate is something of, some external thing.</span> <span id="s245">He tried to convince me, this was inscribed in the Book upstairs, that I would survive.</span> <span id="s246">Well, I can't prove it, let's prove that.</span> <span id="s247">But I had many, many days and nights of doubt if I will.</span> <span id="s248">The only sad story was, if I perish this second, this minute, why didn't I perish earlier?</span> <span id="s249">Why should I have to suffer all the time, you know?</span> <span id="s250">But we had one goal, to go ahead and study was the number one.</span> <span id="s251">Most of us promised our parents, we want the memory of our parents not let down.</span> <span id="s252">I personally promised my Mom before they took her away to concentration camp that if I escaped from the ghetto, my town Lublin, she had asked me that I had to promise to her, if I ever survive.</span> <span id="s253">She apologized, she cannot help me anymore, that I will never forget to go back to school.</span> <span id="s254">To make a better person of myself.</span> <span id="s255">And I promise her.</span> <span id="s256">My Mom was an opera singer.</span> <span id="s257">She was very disappointed when I decide to go to medicine.</span> <span id="s258">My Dad, after he became an architect, he was upset I won't be an architect.</span> <span id="s259">I play violin so I try to compromise.</span> <span id="s260">I drew, I've been drawing beautiful pictures of buildings, talent from my father, that I got accustomed to seeing everyday.</span> <span id="s261">And to them, the best writer, clearly, printing and so on, you know, I draw things beautiful, I paint.</span> <span id="s262">So I do lots of things, so in memory of my Mom that I still play music.</span> <span id="s263">Maybe this gives a little peace, that I didn't let her down completely.</span> <span id="s264">But I felt since I was 13, that's all I want to do.</span> <span id="s265">I remember sick little boy.</span> <span id="s266">He was at that time maybe seven or eight, I don't remember his age exactly.</span> <span id="s267">I was maybe 13 or so, and he was getting shots and he was so sick.</span> <span id="s268">There was a clinic, we couldn't afford a private doctor, we go to poor people's clinic.</span> <span id="s269">And I felt if I could help that kid, if I could do something for him but I didn't know what I could do.</span> <span id="s270">But that give me the idea that I would like to go to medicine.</span> <span id="s271">Didn't know what I'm going to do in medicine but I like to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s272">Anyway, I have no regrets.</span> <span id="s273">I am happy I am, I'm almost not anymore, I'm retired now, private practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Another question I have about, there you are in you're sort of student Kabbutz (ph) as you describe it, and all these people who survived this experience.</span> <span id="s275">Do you think that, and it sounds like you're all very diligent in you're studies, I'm wondering whether because of the experience, because you survived, whether that was part of the motivation to do this?</span> <span id="s276">To make sure you became a doctor?</span> <span id="s277">Or for the other students to make sure that they did what they intended to do?</span> <span id="s278">I'm guessing maybe people were even more serious than they might have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I'll give you a surprising answer, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I knew what I wanted to be when I was 13, war or no war.</span> <span id="s282">I knew what I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s283">But the war forced me more of less to definitely not forget about it, and the fact that I promised my Mom that I will.</span> <span id="s284">Although if I could have physically, been able to, I would have done it anyway.</span> <span id="s285">So I don't believe that my personal experiences had any bearing or influence.</span> <span id="s286">Although, I have to admit, that because of the course of events after the war it came easy for me in terms of, everything was facilitated for me.</span> <span id="s287">The Zionist organization, American Joint, they paid for that and I didn't have worry about expenses, food, shelter.</span> <span id="s288">We even had __________________ nights of fun, a little singing and someone playing harmonica and so on.</span> <span id="s289">Little things.</span> <span id="s290">But I really don't believe that this reinforced it, tortured me and so on.</span> <span id="s291">I would have done it anyway.</span> <span id="s292">I know myself.</span> <span id="s293">I know.</span> <span id="s294">I am a very determined person.</span> <span id="s295">I would have done it anyway, yeah, unless I was sick or something, but I would have done it.</span> <span id="s296">I think that my wife's Uncle that we discovered after the war in Vienna, him being in New York, he wrote us a letter.</span> <span id="s297">I never met him before.</span> <span id="s298">He was not my Uncle, he was a distant Uncle to my wife, when he wrote us, "Don't you ever come back to the United States with doubt about completing you're education.”</span> <span id="s299">And again, this was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to complete it anyway, but definitely if I want to go to Israel, my wife felt, which is not true, we're not in pioneering type of mood anymore.</span> <span id="s300">We're young but still we're physically devastated.</span> <span id="s301">And to be a pioneer, go to Israel now, fight from beginning.</span> <span id="s302">Again, she felt maybe life in the States would be easier for us.</span> <span id="s303">Do we deserve a better life?</span> <span id="s304">Do we deserve a life better than our parents maybe had?</span> <span id="s305">I don't have the answer to it.</span> <span id="s306">I would say, yes, why should we?</span> <span id="s307">But common sense and logic convinced me my wife was correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: If I could stop you again for a second, I am curious about again you and you're wife and also the people you're with now in this new environment.</span> <span id="s309">If you could tell me a little more about, was it a big topic of conversation, whether or not to go to Israel?</span> <span id="s310">Was there debate about that?</span> <span id="s311">Were there people determined to do it?</span> <span id="s312">Whether you had discussions or even arguments about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Right.</span> <span id="s314">Well some group of our friends discovered some relatives in South America, in Argentina and Paraguay.</span> <span id="s315">Another one discovered family in Australia, distant family.</span> <span id="s316">They knew of.</span> <span id="s317">They never met them, like this distant Uncle that left Poland before the war yet, before they were born maybe.</span> <span id="s318">They knew of them because they remember their parents reading letters and so on.</span> <span id="s319">They seen pictures but they never met them personally.</span> <span id="s320">To them they were strangers.</span> <span id="s321">So some of them had friends or family in Canada, and so on.</span> <span id="s322">Some of them in the United States.</span> <span id="s323">I would say the majority of us, perhaps more than 50% of the group, fell with Israel.</span> <span id="s324">We felt more secure going to Israel.</span> <span id="s325">Not in terms of our lives, secure terms in no one would attack you from behind again and hit you, be anti-Semitic is all.</span> <span id="s326">You might be killed by a bomb, by a grenade, by an action, whatever, if you go to army, but you're in your own country.</span> <span id="s327">No one can make a __________________ to you, __________________.</span> <span id="s328">But you know we thought someday, sooner or later, after the war we were optimistic.</span> <span id="s329">Things would work out somehow, sooner or later there has to be peace.</span> <span id="s330">And we didn't predict what is going to happen, what is going to happen right now?</span> <span id="s331">But at that time, and this was my idea to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s332">In Israel medicine was not exactly a favored profession.</span> <span id="s333">But this was my idea to do.</span> <span id="s334">But then finally my wife said, well, if we go to Israel and we won't be able to make it there, how are we going to get to the United States?</span> <span id="s335">Almost physically and financially impossible.</span> <span id="s336">But if we got to the United States, we cannot make it here.</span> <span id="s337">We can always make it __________________ and they will help us, make illegal.</span> <span id="s338">We can always do that.</span> <span id="s339">Which made common sense to me.</span> <span id="s340">And against my better judgment though, I consented.</span> <span id="s341">We probably should consider that as a more practical thing.</span> <span id="s342">And I betray my thought, maybe in a sense, that I was kind of geared toward Israel.</span> <span id="s343">My years, the few years I was in Vienna and in school that is where I am going to go.</span> <span id="s344">But the common sense prevailed and then maybe the convenience, and we got older a little bit at that time, and we are looking for a little easier life.</span> <span id="s345">No one says its going to be an easier life in the United States, which I found out they, found it was true.</span> <span id="s346">It was not easy at all.</span> <span id="s347">I never worked so hard in my life.</span> <span id="s348">But I was looking forward to it then, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: To?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: To come to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: But you're saying you felt you betrayed yourself a little bit by not going to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Yes because I was geared to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s353">I just felt that's my place to go.</span> <span id="s354">Mentally, you know?</span> <span id="s355">Although my parents were not Zionists.</span> <span id="s356">My Dad was a Bund-ist (ph) which was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s357">And my cousin who was a young, what do they call it?</span> <span id="s358">A Scha-bo-tin-ski (ph) man, you heard about it, it's ultra right.</span> <span id="s359">Nationalist.</span> <span id="s360">My Dad, showing me my cousin when we're young, dressed in a brown shirt with a belt.</span> <span id="s361">And the belt across his chest with a hat.</span> <span id="s362">Looked like a young Hitler uniform, like a Nazi.</span> <span id="s363">He said, "Look at you're cousin.</span> <span id="s364">That's a Jewish Hitler unit.”</span> <span id="s365">And down on me and always was embedded in my mind, by saying Israel doesn't mean it has to be all like my nephew there.</span> <span id="s366">There's going to be the __________________, there's going to be all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s367">And I could contribute to the well being of Israel in my own way.</span> <span id="s368">I discover my Judaism, so to say.</span> <span id="s369">Because I was raised, I knew I was Jewish but I was going to a Catholic school, so I was kind of like a little odd type of an individual.</span> <span id="s370">I knew I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s371">I had Hanukkah at home and Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s372">My Catholic friends come into, to my parents it didn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s373">They knew I was Jewish and they knew they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s374">They were Yiddish speaking, but they were very progressive people.</span> <span id="s375">And my father didn't believe in Israel.</span> <span id="s376">Free Israel, Palestine, he was a Socialist.</span> <span id="s377">He believed that they should build a future where they are.</span> <span id="s378">Fight for their right to work and so on.</span> <span id="s379">But this was before he became an architect.</span> <span id="s380">I remember he was lucky, he was a more professional.</span> <span id="s381">Before he was a locksmith, he was a worker.</span> <span id="s382">So maybe that's why he believe in it, all his colleagues, all with the same group of people, same professions, that's what they were fighting for.</span> <span id="s383">But I knew.</span> <span id="s384">If my father would have survived the war, he would change his political views too.</span> <span id="s385">It was a different theatre after the war.</span> <span id="s386">I mean, you cannot fight for certain ideology that either was in bankruptcy, although it was premature to say that.</span> <span id="s387">I say that now after __________________, but I didn't believe that you can suppress human feelings and tell him what to do.</span> <span id="s388">You're going to be a clerk, or you're going to be a whatever, a machinist, or a truck driver.</span> <span id="s389">I wanted to be what I wanted to be.</span> <span id="s390">It wouldn't be right to tell you what to be.</span> <span id="s391">And in this kind of environment, my father was promoting and so on, there was less freedom probably of choice, and so on.</span> <span id="s392">So I knew right away, I was too young to be politically involved at that time.</span> <span id="s393">Although today people at the age of like 17, 18, 19, they have certain convictions, political . . .[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]. . . and so on and they mature more.</span> <span id="s394">Sure they can change their views.</span> <span id="s395">On the other hand, they go in one direction they were raised or maybe they are convinced they are doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s396">So I discovered that I want to be Jewish, I am Jewish and I won't deny that, I suppress this all those years.</span> <span id="s397">Suppressed to survive.</span> <span id="s398">Now I don't have no need to suppress it.</span> <span id="s399">But which direction to go?</span> <span id="s400">In Judaism, I didn't know that yet because I was like a newcomer to this kind of a thing.</span> <span id="s401">I was never raised in a Jewish __________________.</span> <span id="s402">That Yiddish was my tongue and going to the shul (ph), the synagogue all the time.</span> <span id="s403">I going once a year with my father because my father had to go because my grandfather looked at it, you know?</span> <span id="s404">He had to go.</span> <span id="s405">But again, I felt I developed my own things.</span> <span id="s406">My own life when I get older.</span> <span id="s407">And of course I was influenced by the course of events, no question about it.</span> <span id="s408">See?</span> <span id="s409">So talking, going back to a group of my friends, which are still, we are like a family.</span> <span id="s410">We still are very close friends.</span> <span id="s411">We see each other, even people in Australia or so, we are meeting each other maybe every five years or every year, every two years.</span> <span id="s412">I go to Israel.</span> <span id="s413">Half of my class eventually left for Israel.</span> <span id="s414">I will never forget the moment where the first airline, EL-AL plane landed in Vienna to transport the remains of Theodore Hershel (ph), was buried in Vienna.</span> <span id="s415">And I was one of the delegates honored to carry on my right shoulder.</span> <span id="s416">There were eight students of us, carried the casket to the airport, from the cemetery to the airport.</span> <span id="s417">And this was, the rest of my life I will remember that.</span> <span id="s418">I have pictures of it, too even.</span> <span id="s419">You know, we had nothing, we were as poor as poor could be, but I felt we were happy.</span> <span id="s420">We were happy.</span> <span id="s421">We live with the memory of our past, our families, our parents.</span> <span id="s422">__________________.</span> <span id="s423">As any youngster will tell you, his parents were the greatest.</span> <span id="s424">Mine were too.</span> <span id="s425">But anyway, so about 50% of my group went to Israel and they established themselves there and they did very well.</span> <span id="s426">And we elected to go to the States.</span> <span id="s427">I was at the end of my study.</span> <span id="s428">There was one professor of ____________, who was an old, old Nazi.</span> <span id="s429">He was about, close to 90 years old.</span> <span id="s430">Klein (ph) was about 88, 89.</span> <span id="s431">No one knew for sure his age, he looked like 120.</span> <span id="s432">He lost three sons on the Russian Front.</span> <span id="s433">And he flunked every Jew going for an exam in front of him.</span> <span id="s434">There was no, and these were the smartest kids, flunked the first time.</span> <span id="s435">So I, there was another assistant professor who was giving the exams too, but not while the old man was still there.</span> <span id="s436">And he was never taking vacations.</span> <span id="s437">So I decided, a few of us decided, we'll go and get it over with.</span> <span id="s438">We're going to flunk anyway.</span> <span id="s439">We didn't even study, we're going to flunk, with or without studying, we are going to flunk.</span> <span id="s440">And sure enough, we flunked ____________, all of us.</span> <span id="s441">And then summer vacation started.</span> <span id="s442">This was about July, school didn't start until the end of September, beginning of October, I think the beginning of October.</span> <span id="s443">So I had one more exam to take.</span> <span id="s444">This was the final thing.</span> <span id="s445">I finished all the studies.</span> <span id="s446">I had to repeat, there were things I was allowed to repeat it if I flunk.</span> <span id="s447">I was called to the American Embassy in Vienna, that my visa arrived and I have two weeks to go.</span> <span id="s448">There was a young lady there, I said, "No.</span> <span id="s449">I'm very honored with it and I didn't expect this to come so fast but I have a little problem.”</span> <span id="s450">I told her, I flunked one exam.</span> <span id="s451">And I have to repeat the exam.</span> <span id="s452">But it is summer vacation, now the school is closed.</span> <span id="s453">And the next one, the first one, and with my connection with the secretary of the University, only connection where you had to have preferential date on an exam, I would be the first one because I'll be leaving for the United States.</span> <span id="s454">And I said I have to wait until October.</span> <span id="s455">And she tells me, "How are you sure that you're going to pass it?"</span> <span id="s456">And I said, "Well, I'm not sure but I hope I pass it because I study now, if I didn't study and . . .", I told her the story.</span> <span id="s457">She was very uncomfortable and very upset about it.</span> <span id="s458">She was very hostile.</span> <span id="s459">She said, "I lost a son in Korea.</span> <span id="s460">And he would like to come back home, but he's dead.</span> <span id="s461">Here you are given a chance to come to the United States and you're rejecting it?"</span> <span id="s462">I said, "I'm not rejecting it.</span> <span id="s463">But you don't understand.</span> <span id="s464">That's my whole life.</span> <span id="s465">I will study, I promised my Mom."</span> <span id="s466">And I had to study and I'm going to finish it whether you like it or not.</span> <span id="s467">If I go or I don't go.</span> <span id="s468">I cannot go.</span> <span id="s469">My Uncle, that I had just discovered, a new Uncle, told me, don't you ever come here without you're diploma.</span> <span id="s470">You'll be nobody.</span> <span id="s471">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s472">Come to the States and dig ditches?</span> <span id="s473">In memory of my parents I will never do that.</span> <span id="s474">If not I'll go to Israel.</span> <span id="s475">I told her this.</span> <span id="s476">I want to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s477">My wife wants to go.</span> <span id="s478">We don't have no family.</span> <span id="s479">She just discovered a family, an Aunt and an Uncle.</span> <span id="s480">Somebody we can call our family.</span> <span id="s481">And I don't understand that you are so difficult.</span> <span id="s482">I don't know.</span> <span id="s483">Is this a law, that you have to do that?</span> <span id="s484">Or is it flexible?</span> <span id="s485">I didn't have anybody to talk for me in the Embassy.</span> <span id="s486">I didn't have a lawyer, I didn't have no body, just myself.</span> <span id="s487">Me and my wife.</span> <span id="s488">My wife was crying.</span> <span id="s489">And she didn't respond to us so we got out and walked away, walked out.</span> <span id="s490">And this was the end of our dreams.</span> <span id="s491">We told our friends.</span> <span id="s492">They said, don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s493">We'll go to Israel.</span> <span id="s494">So I was already set to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s495">Sure enough, what happened?</span> <span id="s496">My good old professor got sick.</span> <span id="s497">During the end of vacation.</span> <span id="s498">And sure enough, the assistant professor that we adored was in charge of exams.</span> <span id="s499">I think it was something like the 3rd or 4th of October, I took the exam.</span> <span id="s500">And sure enough I passed it.</span> <span id="s501">And I got my diploma with a formal ceremony, the University of Vienna.</span> <span id="s502">My Uncle send me a tuxedo, his old tuxedo.</span> <span id="s503">We were graduated without robes.</span> <span id="s504">The professors were wearing robes, we wore tuxedos.</span> <span id="s505">Some with tails some with tuxedos.</span> <span id="s506">And I graduate and started to say good-bye to all my friends in Vienna.</span> <span id="s507">Didn't know to go to Israel probably.</span> <span id="s508">All of a sudden I got telephone call from the American Embassy in Vienna.</span> <span id="s509">This lady was replaced by somebody else.</span> <span id="s510">They knew my story.</span> <span id="s511">There was no problem at all.</span> <span id="s512">She was just a bitter person because she lost her son.</span> <span id="s513">And maybe my age, I don't know, I never seen him.</span> <span id="s514">And maybe she was just devastated by it and she took the anger, I knew it is not a personal thing.</span> <span id="s515">But she was an angry person, she had a tragic event.</span> <span id="s516">I had tragedy all my life, since the war.</span> <span id="s517">But this other person was very understanding, very warm.</span> <span id="s518">And she said, this other lady said to me, "There was no problem at all."</span> <span id="s519">Even the first time.</span> <span id="s520">And this happens quite often, that things will be changed, dates and so on.</span> <span id="s521">Asked me when I'll be ready to go?</span> <span id="s522">I said, I am ready to go any time from now and just packed and that's it.</span> <span id="s523">And so we said good-bye to a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s524">Some were disappointed that we didn't go to Israel.</span> <span id="s525">And some went to South America, Australia and so on.</span> <span id="s526">We promised we are going to keep in touch with each other.</span> <span id="s527">Because we were one family.</span> <span id="s528">We went through our youth, the formative ages actually without our parents, without somebody from our direct family.</span> <span id="s529">We create our own family.</span> <span id="s530">If my friend was like a brother to me, his wife was like a sister to me.</span> <span id="s531">And we had two couples on the list were single, they were always looking up at us.</span> <span id="s532">Although we are not the oldest, not at all.</span> <span id="s533">But we married very young, my wife was less than 16, we got married in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s534">So we had certain authority because being married, you know?</span> <span id="s535">It carries certain weight, at least within our group.</span> <span id="s536">And those were the happiest days, outside my youth of course.</span> <span id="s537">The second stage of my life.</span> <span id="s538">And here we are, we knocked at the door of United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Let me just ask you, how did you, when you came over how did you come over?</span> <span id="s540">On a ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s542">Well we were separated me and my wife.</span> <span id="s543">They took us to a camp in Germany, in Hannover.</span> <span id="s544">Men were separated and women separate.</span> <span id="s545">We could see each other during the day.</span> <span id="s546">Otherwise we are confined to separate rooms and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What kind of camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: It was some form of labor camp or something.</span> <span id="s549">It was not a concentration camp before, no.</span> <span id="s550">It was labor.</span> <span id="s551">Barracks, you know?</span> <span id="s552">And it was like an office, big building I remember.</span> <span id="s553">And I was a young doctor without any experience yet, just a piece of paper, that's all.</span> <span id="s554">And I was assigned to check some of the immigrants who were suppose to go to the United States, for the inflectional diseases or any lice and other things, things like this.</span> <span id="s555">And we're waiting for arrival of a ship.</span> <span id="s556">And I remember the name of the ship.</span> <span id="s557">It was a military transport ship normally carrying something like 300 or 400 soldiers or military men.</span> <span id="s558">But 1,800 people were on that ship.</span> <span id="s559">I remember the wait for a small ship, General Blachfort (ph) was the name, you don't forget that.</span> <span id="s560">And I've got to tell you, being on that ship, like in three weeks I think we were in the camp before the ship arrived, and we boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s561">It took us about 10 or 11 days through the Atlantic, it was November.</span> <span id="s562">And the sea was very unruly.</span> <span id="s563">We were sick, seasick, all of us.</span> <span id="s564">On top of that, I never ate ham with raisins.</span> <span id="s565">Not that I was Kosher.</span> <span id="s566">I ate ham, but not the raisins.</span> <span id="s567">Polish culinary thing didn't allow sweet in ham.</span> <span id="s568">Ham was always with spices or salt and so on, but not with sweet, not normally with ham.</span> <span id="s569">So when I just took this, tasted the ham, it got me sick to my stomach.</span> <span id="s570">And anyway we survived the war, we survived worse things than that, so we survived the trip too.</span> <span id="s571">And my wife's Aunt expected us at the port in New York and was a distinguished lady, beautiful person.</span> <span id="s572">Elegant, never seen such elegance for years.</span> <span id="s573">And turned out that she was instrumental in having us moved to a hotel, to some kind of a gathering thing for the, old immigrants were going to.</span> <span id="s574">They pay for the room, the hotel.</span> <span id="s575">There was a big suite.</span> <span id="s576">So with one room, some other people, another room, you know?</span> <span id="s577">But it was very nice.</span> <span id="s578">They paid for this.</span> <span id="s579">And then we got introduced to each other, with my wife's family.</span> <span id="s580">Her husband, who was the one that I wrote to and he wrote to me.</span> <span id="s581">And after all those years he wrote very beautiful Polish and my English was very bad, very bad.</span> <span id="s582">It was tragic.</span> <span id="s583">I didn't know too much at all.</span> <span id="s584">And they had two daughters.</span> <span id="s585">And of course you invite you're poor relatives to the house.</span> <span id="s586">They lived on 5th Avenue in New York.</span> <span id="s587">We are not properly dressed for that kind of encounter but that's all we had.</span> <span id="s588">The only thing I brought was a big case with books that's what I had.</span> <span id="s589">Otherwise, I looked like a rook sack.</span> <span id="s590">Nothing.</span> <span id="s591">I didn't have no suits, no shoes, just what we had with us.</span> <span id="s592">And they had two daughters, two beautiful girls.</span> <span id="s593">And I felt very uncomfortable and she introduced us as DP's.</span> <span id="s594">Displaced Persons.</span> <span id="s595">Like embarrassed that we are part of the family.</span> <span id="s596">And we were invited for dinner there.</span> <span id="s597">And when my wife came in and put her coat in the closet and when we left for the hotel she found $20.00 in the pocket.</span> <span id="s598">I was very upset about it.</span> <span id="s599">I didn't learn the American way.</span> <span id="s600">Is this the American way?</span> <span id="s601">To put $20.00 in you're pocket?</span> <span id="s602">I think this was an insult.</span> <span id="s603">I could use that money, no question about that.</span> <span id="s604">The way it was done, I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s605">How to do.</span> <span id="s606">Maybe afraid I wouldn't take it if they proposed, you know?</span> <span id="s607">Besides, we are getting food in the hotel, I needed the money.</span> <span id="s608">I did need the money really.</span> <span id="s609">My wife very soon got a job, right there in New York.</span> <span id="s610">She spoke some English, among immigrants she spoke several languages, fluent in German of course, and in Polish.</span> <span id="s611">And she speak Spanish too.</span> <span id="s612">And she could be like an interpreter, helping the American __________________ to distribute the refugees to go left, right, wherever they needed to go.</span> <span id="s613">Giving information, translating and so on.</span> <span id="s614">And she was paid for it.</span> <span id="s615">Not much, but she was paid enough to get a bus and pay a bus.</span> <span id="s616">And I talked to this Uncle whom I adored.</span> <span id="s617">He was really a fascinating person.</span> <span id="s618">And I took to him right away, he showed me his heart, he opened up completely.</span> <span id="s619">A man that I never met before.</span> <span id="s620">Never heard of me.</span> <span id="s621">His brother-in-law was a Director of American Joint in Warsaw, prior to the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Director of?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: My wife's Uncle.</span> <span id="s624">His brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s625">You know, his wife and my wife's Aunt in Warsaw, they were sisters.</span> <span id="s626">And the husband of her Aunt in Warsaw, he's that American, he direct American Joint in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s627">You know, Joint Committee, American Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Joint Committee of?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Well American Joint was an organization helping the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: He was a very big, important figure, pre-war, in Poland, of course.</span> <span id="s632">Anyway, we sat and talked and so on.</span> <span id="s633">He asked me to go to register, where young doctors went to register, in New York.</span> <span id="s634">You have to do something with yourself there, you've got you're diploma, now you're going to be a doctor.</span> <span id="s635">I don't know what that means really, yet.</span> <span id="s636">And I went to register.</span> <span id="s637">I had to wait in line, not on a line, there was about 300 or 400 people, all doctors.</span> <span id="s638">Young doctors like me.</span> <span id="s639">And it was where someone takes you're name and give you some options, hospitals in New York, in Brooklyn, you name it.</span> <span id="s640">And I look at this.</span> <span id="s641">In the meantime I had to go there by subway and the transportation there, in New York, people, I never was in a city of 10 or 11 million people.</span> <span id="s642">And to me I was in Vienna, which was 2 1/2 or 3 million people, was a huge city.</span> <span id="s643">By comparison to Poland, Vienna was a metropolis.</span> <span id="s644">I came to New York, I was totally lost.</span> <span id="s645">And I was uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s646">A little scared too.</span> <span id="s647">What am I going to do here?</span> <span id="s648">How can I live in a big city like this?</span> <span id="s649">And then I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s650">I wanted to go to a small town.</span> <span id="s651">And I talked to my Uncle, my wife's Uncle, he said, "You're right.</span> <span id="s652">I suggest you be, you'll find yourself better in a small town.”</span> <span id="s653">And they send me to Jewish Committee in New York City with my dilemma.</span> <span id="s654">And I found a very listening ear there in an older lady who listened to my story and she said, "You know what?</span> <span id="s655">You should maybe stay in one of the bigger cities, in New York State maybe, you'll be not too far from you're Uncle, just in case you need that contact with him and so on, and maybe you'll find yourself even more comfortable and feel more secure that way.”</span> <span id="s656">So I said, "Well, fine.”</span> <span id="s657">She asked me, "Where do you want to go?"</span> <span id="s658">I said, "I don't know."</span> <span id="s659">She opened a book, an Atlas, a map.</span> <span id="s660">I put my finger on it.</span> <span id="s661">Rochester, New York.</span> <span id="s662">She said that's a good city, University City, she said.</span> <span id="s663">She made arrangements with Jewish Committee in Rochester to expect us there.</span> <span id="s664">They assign us to a German speaking family that they sub-let a room in their house.</span> <span id="s665">We could speak German, it was easy.</span> <span id="s666">And we went.</span> <span id="s667">With our big suitcase, one suitcase with books.</span> <span id="s668">I had a medical instrument there which I brought with me, I wanted to be a pathologist.</span> <span id="s669">We called it a micro-tomb (ph), it's outdated now.</span> <span id="s670">I brought them from Vienna, it was world famous in those days.</span> <span id="s671">That's one thing I brought with me.</span> <span id="s672">So we stayed with, I felt good already.</span> <span id="s673">I felt __________________.</span> <span id="s674">They had a long car and the streets, there was no traffic, there was no subway.</span> <span id="s675">I mean, you could talk to you're neighbors, you know?</span> <span id="s676">You could walk around.</span> <span id="s677">It was great.</span> <span id="s678">And after maybe a week or so of staying there my wife got a job.</span> <span id="s679">Got a job working at Woolworth's.</span> <span id="s680">Selling donuts.</span> <span id="s681">Behind the counter, selling donuts.</span> <span id="s682">She would bring in $6.00 each night, for nothing.</span> <span id="s683">And she was telling me her experiences at work.</span> <span id="s684">She worked with a lot of African-American and some minorities, but not as many that, well they were lower class American people, white people, but some of them didn't even finish High School, and so on.</span> <span id="s685">Very soon she was, she graduated from the University of Vienna, she was an educated person.</span> <span id="s686">They discovered she was a very intelligent woman, so they moved her right to the office with the bookkeeping department.</span> <span id="s687">And she was taking orders and supplies and so on.</span> <span id="s688">I remember she told me one day they had some device, you count together six donuts of sugar donuts, six donuts with chocolate, they had to use the machine to add it up and she didn't need to.</span> <span id="s689">She added it up in her head, and say it's $1.97.</span> <span id="s690">They would look at her, how do you know?</span> <span id="s691">Well I figured it out.</span> <span id="s692">I don't know, my brain.</span> <span id="s693">Anyway, they discovered she's smart and that's how she got the job.</span> <span id="s694">At least she got a paying job.</span> <span id="s695">Now I felt more insecure than ever.</span> <span id="s696">Myself, I didn't know what to do myself.</span> <span id="s697">So talking to my benefactors, the German-Jewish family that we stayed with, they say, "You know what?</span> <span id="s698">I'll introduce you to our German doctor.</span> <span id="s699">He is from Germany, a Jewish doctor in Germany.</span> <span id="s700">Maybe he can help you because you're a doctor, he's a doctor.</span> <span id="s701">He has contacts and maybe he tell you what's next step."</span> <span id="s702">Because we don't know what to tell you.</span> <span id="s703">And the Jewish Committee, they were awaiting any assistance, if I need anything they will, but they want to leave me alone and see what I want to do.</span> <span id="s704">I met this German doctor.</span> <span id="s705">He say, "You know what?</span> <span id="s706">Let me talk to the Chief of Staff of one of the hospitals, which was the University Hospital, he's on staff.</span> <span id="s707">Let me talk to him and see what he suggests."</span> <span id="s708">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s709">"In the meantime, I have a lot of German people, my patients, if you want to come and help me in my office here?"</span> <span id="s710">I said, "I don't have a license yet to practice medicine here.”</span> <span id="s711">He said, "I won't let you practice medicine.</span> <span id="s712">You assist me, help me with the x-ray department, x-rays and moving the files and so on, and I'll pay you for it.”</span> <span id="s713">I said, "Okay."</span> <span id="s714">So I felt better yet, you know?</span> <span id="s715">And one day he came back to me, this German doctor, and he said to me, "You know what?</span> <span id="s716">I made an appointment for you with the Chief of Staff.</span> <span id="s717">He speaks a little German.</span> <span id="s718">He is Jewish, but he has a resident who speaks fluent German, so he will be there when you are there."</span> <span id="s719">I said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s720">He brought me in, he picked me up and brought me there, he said he would pick me up later.</span> <span id="s721">When I walked in, he spoke very broken.</span> <span id="s722">My English was just as bad as his German.</span> <span id="s723">But the German resident was there, German-speaking.</span> <span id="s724">American of German extraction.</span> <span id="s725">And at first he wanted to know my life story.</span> <span id="s726">Being a Jew, knew I'm a survivor.</span> <span id="s727">He wanted to know the whole story.</span> <span id="s728">And we're sitting there for four hours.</span> <span id="s729">He asked for lunch to be brought to his office there.</span> <span id="s730">We had lunch together.</span> <span id="s731">And finally said, he released the resident to go away, and he said, "You speak German, I understand what you're talking about.</span> <span id="s732">I maybe don't speak as good but I can understand."</span> <span id="s733">And he was fascinated with my story, wanted to know all the story.</span> <span id="s734">And I thought he felt guilty for some reason, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s735">Maybe because here he has his whole family here, survived.</span> <span id="s736">I found out later he had a son of my age who was a young doctor too, and maybe he felt sorry for me, you know?</span> <span id="s737">That I was so physically, mentally devastated.</span> <span id="s738">And in the meantime I found out that its almost impossible to get accepted in that hospital as an intern because American boys, interns, medical students, have in advance, a year in advance, have to file their documentation and so on in the hospital of their choice and its like a lottery.</span> <span id="s739">Either they take you or not.</span> <span id="s740">The hospital has a choice of taking the best.</span> <span id="s741">So I, it looked like the situation was very grim, that I might not be able to get in there even.</span> <span id="s742">Beside I cannot give, this was February, February of 1951.</span> <span id="s743">We arrived in November of 1950, in New York.</span> <span id="s744">For February, 1951, right.</span> <span id="s745">And the year doesn't start until June, the end of June or July 1st is when the academic year start in the hospital, new interns come in.</span> <span id="s746">So I told him in German plainly, I said, well, I see that it's probably is hopeless for me to even, since I don't speak English, I don't understand the nurses.</span> <span id="s747">How can I talk to patients?</span> <span id="s748">He said, "Well, you got since February, until July 1st to pick up you're English."</span> <span id="s749">"And what are you going to do?"</span> <span id="s750">"I'm going to introduce you to two ladies, they speak fluent German.</span> <span id="s751">They will be you're personal teachers, they will teach you English for nothing."</span> <span id="s752">Two spinsters.</span> <span id="s753">And that's the paper I want you to sign.</span> <span id="s754">I was so suspicious, I wanted to know what I am signing.</span> <span id="s755">What am I signing?</span> <span id="s756">You're signing that you want to be an intern, didn't you?</span> <span id="s757">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s758">So you sign that you agree to be an intern.</span> <span id="s759">I said, but, I haven't taken the exam.</span> <span id="s760">You don't have to take no exam, I am the boss here.</span> <span id="s761">I am the Director.</span> <span id="s762">You don't have to take an exam.</span> <span id="s763">You would have passed the exam, he told me.</span> <span id="s764">He looked at my books and my __________________ and he said, you deserve to be here.</span> <span id="s765">If you're English is going to improve you'll be okay.</span> <span id="s766">He was like a God sent person to me.</span> <span id="s767">And my Archangel was the German resident.</span> <span id="s768">Wherever I was he was with me.</span> <span id="s769">Where he was, I was his tail, you know?</span> <span id="s770">And when they were making rounds in the hospital, I was first the Chief resident, then the middle resident, then the Junior resident, then the Senior intern.</span> <span id="s771">I was finally the Junior Intern, I was the tail end of the procession, and the nurses between.</span> <span id="s772">So I never even heard all the discussion that took place when making rounds in the a hospital.</span> <span id="s773">The door would open, only the front of the group could participate in the discussion.</span> <span id="s774">I couldn't even hear from a distance.</span> <span id="s775">But I listened as much as I could.</span> <span id="s776">Wrote some notes in German.</span> <span id="s777">Enough that when the rounds finished, I went to the record, hospital of the patient, I made copies of certain things.</span> <span id="s778">And at night with one bulb on me, I would look in a German dictionary, I was translating.</span> <span id="s779">That's how I learned medical terminology, how to converse with a patient, how to make a diagnosis, what tests you do, and so on.</span> <span id="s780">It was so different than I was use to in Vienna.</span> <span id="s781">But in Vienna, all fairness, I never was an intern.</span> <span id="s782">I graduated and I was shipped right away.</span> <span id="s783">So I didn't have the exposure to the hospital in the practical type medicine, you know?</span> <span id="s784">But there was a double hazard here, no language and no experience.</span> <span id="s785">And I had very little time to pick up my English.</span> <span id="s786">Anyway, but to make a long story short, the two old ladies, they were beautiful old ladies, they taught me English.</span> <span id="s787">It was a practical English, I never had a formal English education of course.</span> <span id="s788">But I bought a radio from the first money I made, and my wife, and I listen phonetically to everything.</span> <span id="s789">And not to music, listen to people talking.</span> <span id="s790">To get acquainted with.</span> <span id="s791">Oh, I forgot to mention, when I lived in New York before we left for register, for twenty-five cents I went to a movie on 42nd Street.</span> <span id="s792">I stayed there from 9:00 am until about 5:00 or 6:00 PM, my wife was working as a translator, right?</span> <span id="s793">I was there, not watching the movie, I didn't understand nothing, but I would listen to the phonetics, people talking.</span> <span id="s794">And after their third time around I understood what they were talking about.</span> <span id="s795">Then I'd comprehend some, some of the mimics, some of the interaction, and I understood.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So you watched the same movie three times?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: No.</span> <span id="s798">Me, myself?</span> <span id="s799">Oh yes, I did.</span> <span id="s800">Only to listen.</span> <span id="s801">I watched, I was not interested in the movie, I didn't know, but I wanted to hear people talking.</span> <span id="s802">Maybe I could stay in the park someplace but I couldn't force anybody to sit with me and talk for eight hours with me.</span> <span id="s803">Here, in the movie, they talked.</span> <span id="s804">So I could listen, for twenty-five cents.</span> <span id="s805">And if I had fifty cents, I put twenty-five cents into a saving thing, a little piggy bank, and for the first money I bought a radio.</span> <span id="s806">I managed $7.00 so I bought a radio.</span> <span id="s807">And at night I listened to the radio too, not to music, just to people talking.</span> <span id="s808">A talk show or something.</span> <span id="s809">I listen to all people talk.</span> <span id="s810">That's what I was, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s811">I want to know that.</span> <span id="s812">And I knew I had to meet a deadline.</span> <span id="s813">It's like a prisoner who has only the sense of the death.</span> <span id="s814">He is going to be executed in four months.</span> <span id="s815">My execution was in four months, either I pass it or I don't pass it.</span> <span id="s816">And I didn't want to think about it.</span> <span id="s817">What's going to happen if I don't pass it?</span> <span id="s818">What am I going to do?</span> <span id="s819">I know my wife's Uncle would not let us down, maybe he would send me some business or someplace or so.</span> <span id="s820">But this was not my cup of tea, I wanted one thing only and that's what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s821">And things got, it, what do you call it?</span> <span id="s822">With perseverance.</span> <span id="s823">And there were days we were really didn't think we were going to make it, financially and otherwise.</span> <span id="s824">We were hungry, not hungry while interned, but we didn't eat meat for months, just vegetables, we couldn't afford any.</span> <span id="s825">But we were not hungry for meat, once a week when I became an intern, we were invited to hospital cafeteria, the family.</span> <span id="s826">Like an intern could bring his family, like a wife and children.</span> <span id="s827">Our son was born then, in Rochester.</span> <span id="s828">And we came to the hospital and had a fiesta, a beautiful dinner.</span> <span id="s829">Turkey, for almost three years, every Sunday, turkey.</span> <span id="s830">Finally, after three years, I hated turkey.</span> <span id="s831">But I, at least I had meat.</span> <span id="s832">And we met the other young families, wives of other colleagues of mine.</span> <span id="s833">And they all knew my story eventually because my resident spoke German told everybody.</span> <span id="s834">They did not shy away from me, they were so nice, they were so warm, they were so assuring.</span> <span id="s835">They invited me, they were very well-to-do young people.</span> <span id="s836">Their families were very wealthy.</span> <span id="s837">Each one has a sports car and so on.</span> <span id="s838">I looked at them, will I ever live long enough to have that?</span> <span id="s839">But they invited me to country clubs, you know.</span> <span id="s840">When they partied, I am their colleague.</span> <span id="s841">They invited me and my wife.</span> <span id="s842">How am I going to go there?</span> <span id="s843">I have no transportation.</span> <span id="s844">I have no money for bus.</span> <span id="s845">I mean, it was twenty-five cents a bus, one way.</span> <span id="s846">It was fifty cents, both ways is $1.00.</span> <span id="s847">$1.00 is a lot of money, so we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s848">This is not the problem yet.</span> <span id="s849">What are we going to wear?</span> <span id="s850">I didn't have a decent, I had hospital uniforms, but I cannot go to a country club party, and no money to buy it.</span> <span id="s851">My wife didn't have a dress either.</span> <span id="s852">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s853">I told them I'm sorry, my wife doesn't feel good.</span> <span id="s854">She's sick.</span> <span id="s855">I cannot go.</span> <span id="s856">Well come yourself.</span> <span id="s857">Is she that sick?</span> <span id="s858">She belongs in a hospital.</span> <span id="s859">No, she's not that sick.</span> <span id="s860">Well then you can go.</span> <span id="s861">I cannot leave her alone.</span> <span id="s862">She doesn't have nobody to help her, if she needs a glass of water or so.</span> <span id="s863">Well, they understood.</span> <span id="s864">But the fact was I was invited.</span> <span id="s865">I was treated like equal.</span> <span id="s866">And I was reassured.</span> <span id="s867">And I gained a kind of security right away.</span> <span id="s868">I felt good.</span> <span id="s869">And I was not afraid no more and I knew I can make it probably.</span> <span id="s870">What happened to my wife?</span> <span id="s871">She had parties too.</span> <span id="s872">She worked there.</span> <span id="s873">Eventually, by the way, she switched jobs, she got a better job at Blue Cross/Blue Shield.</span> <span id="s874">My wife had some medical education, I think it was two years of medical school.</span> <span id="s875">She didn't like it though so she quit, she went . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s876">End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: . . . to politics, economy.</span> <span id="s879">She is excellent at this.</span> <span id="s880">Really tops.</span> <span id="s881">So she had the experience of medical terminology, she had a job, worked for Blue Shield.</span> <span id="s882">They invited her to a party.</span> <span id="s883">Same story.</span> <span id="s884">She told them I don’t feel good so she cannot go.</span> <span id="s885">And so we kind of navigating for a few years, three years or so.</span> <span id="s886">Until I finished my residency.</span> <span id="s887">And then it was time to move further.</span> <span id="s888">We discover our good friend who's, her parents, my parents were friends when they were single yet, came from Sweden, she survived the war in Russia.</span> <span id="s889">She came back to Poland after I left Poland.</span> <span id="s890">And she found out that I was alive.</span> <span id="s891">So she found an Aunt in Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s892">She contacted her Aunt who send the papers to Warsaw, but she had to leave Warsaw, Poland to Sweden in order to be eligible for transfer to the United States.</span> <span id="s893">That's how it was at that time.</span> <span id="s894">She arrived.</span> <span id="s895">She was in Buffalo, New York, where her Aunt use to reside.</span> <span id="s896">And she found out I was in Rochester.</span> <span id="s897">And they came to visit me with her husband.</span> <span id="s898">She lost her first husband, which I never met, and the second husband that she met in 1945, they married, he was like my brother.</span> <span id="s899">He's dead now.</span> <span id="s900">So we are good friends.</span> <span id="s901">After I finish my residency, internship in Rochester, we elected to go to Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s902">At least we have a very personal friend, bring back the old days, you know?</span> <span id="s903">Part of our happy days yet, and part of our family really.</span> <span id="s904">Because her parents were friends of my parents.</span> <span id="s905">And she worked at the Cancer Institute, Rosewell Park.</span> <span id="s906">She __________________ already.</span> <span id="s907">I came to Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s908">I was already after internship, I spoke English and so on.</span> <span id="s909">And I began working in the hospital as a resident.</span> <span id="s910">And started saving a little money, or I was making some more money.</span> <span id="s911">And I bought myself a car already, I had new Chevy I bought myself.</span> <span id="s912">I have to retract something.</span> <span id="s913">Going back to Rochester, I mentioned I had a big case with books and a micro-tomb (ph).</span> <span id="s914">When I was in Rochester, one of the pathologist at the University, when he heard my story from the Chief of Staff, who was a surgeon, he said he heard I wanted to be a pathologist.</span> <span id="s915">He approached me, if I would like to continue it.</span> <span id="s916">But in the meantime, I lost the vision in my left eye during the war, when I was beaten by the Germans, so I could not use a binocular microscope.</span> <span id="s917">And pathologists have to use binocular.</span> <span id="s918">So this was, I was professionally handicapped so I said no.</span> <span id="s919">So I said, but you know what?</span> <span id="s920">I have a micro-tomb (ph), if you want it you could use it for the University.</span> <span id="s921">He said, you mean you have a micro-tomb (ph) set from Vienna?</span> <span id="s922">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s923">You know, we've tried to get this for years but during the war we couldn't get it, and so on.</span> <span id="s924">He said, definitely.</span> <span id="s925">Are you sure you want to get rid of this?</span> <span id="s926">I said, yes, I want to give it to him.</span> <span id="s927">Not to him, to the University.</span> <span id="s928">I mean, the University was good to me.</span> <span id="s929">They accepted me as an orphan, practically an orphan, and they already put me on my feet.</span> <span id="s930">I wanted this, it's a little thing I can do.</span> <span id="s931">No way.</span> <span id="s932">No way.</span> <span id="s933">We are a University, we have a budget, we'll pay for it.</span> <span id="s934">They insisted on it, insist on it.</span> <span id="s935">But even not, I had so much money, I even bought a car, a used car.</span> <span id="s936">A Plymouth, 1947.</span> <span id="s937">I remember that.</span> <span id="s938">This was 1952, I think.</span> <span id="s939">A five-year-old car.</span> <span id="s940">A Plymouth, for that micro-tomb (ph), you see?</span> <span id="s941">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: And then you were able to go to parties after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: [Laughter] Now I could go to parties, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: As long as you've gone back a little bit, I want to, just before we pick up with you in Buffalo, but I want to go back for a second.</span> <span id="s945">I'm very curious if you can remember, you talked about coming over on the ship and coming into New York Harbor.</span> <span id="s946">I'm very curious if you can remember the day when you actually first entered the Harbor in New York?</span> <span id="s947">What was it like on the ship?</span> <span id="s948">What was it like coming into the Harbor?</span> <span id="s949">Or you're first impressions?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I only remember one thing.</span> <span id="s951">I was sick from eating that raisins with ham.</span> <span id="s952">I remember, or hot dogs with raisins or sweet things, marmalade, so I was safe from this __________________ and plastic food and so on, but I see the Ellis Island, which I knew all about.</span> <span id="s953">But this was a holiday, it was a very memorable day for us.</span> <span id="s954">Maybe symbolic.</span> <span id="s955">I remember I said I don't know if I should believe in fate or not.</span> <span id="s956">It was Thanksgiving Day.</span> <span id="s957">Still today, our Thanksgiving Day is a very important holiday for the whole family.</span> <span id="s958">Children, us.</span> <span id="s959">And for us particularly.</span> <span id="s960">This was a holiday, I don't remember what day it was, but it was Thanksgiving Day, I remember that.</span> <span id="s961">And I don't know what to tell you.</span> <span id="s962">It was a huge port, the harbor you know?</span> <span id="s963">Seeing all the immigrants, the refugees spilling out like, you know, on the port, you know, and going through the control, which was nothing.</span> <span id="s964">They asked me what I had, a big, huge case of books.</span> <span id="s965">I said, asked them if they wanted to open it and in the few words I knew of English, he said, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s966">They knew we were refugees in trouble, what would we have?</span> <span id="s967">Nothing.</span> <span id="s968">We have no clothes even.</span> <span id="s969">And then, but they opened this and the trust, the people, you know, the official clerk like the customs, I mean, it was not like searching us or asking personal questions, nothing of that kind.</span> <span id="s970">Of course we had to go through health control.</span> <span id="s971">This was very strict because there were many immigrants coming who had tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s972">In those days, we had to have x-rays taken at the German camp before we boarded the ship.</span> <span id="s973">And if there was any scar they wouldn't let you through.</span> <span id="s974">You had to stay, be treated there in Germany, and you were just delaying you're arrival in the United States, after some time, I'd say a year, six months to a year, you stayed in that camp there.</span> <span id="s975">That's why I stalled.</span> <span id="s976">I talked to some doctors there because I was a little doctor already.</span> <span id="s977">And our chest x-rays were negative, it was fine, so we didn't have no problem with this.</span> <span id="s978">The only thing was annoying me, at the time the custom control and so on, entry, legal entry in the United States, I had to sign that I was never a Nazi.</span> <span id="s979">This was beyond understanding.</span> <span id="s980">I had to sign I was never a Nazi?</span> <span id="s981">Well later I found out that some of the Nazis in the United States, imports from Balcan (ph) countries, you know, false papers, there were many Nazis and many were acknowledged by our government.</span> <span id="s982">I found out our government paid even some Nazi collaborators in Europe, right after the war.</span> <span id="s983">The Butcher of Lyons, for example, he was in solid with the CIA.</span> <span id="s984">Of course I understand she was being paid like $50,000.00 a year.</span> <span id="s985">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s986">This was obviously after a certain period of time, all the secret things were legalized.</span> <span id="s987">People opened the archives.</span> <span id="s988">That's where I found out, reading things about it.</span> <span id="s989">But it brought back memories.</span> <span id="s990">I had to sign that I was never a Nazi.</span> <span id="s991">I didn't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Did you ask the person?</span> <span id="s993">I mean, why should I have to sign?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: No, that's just the procedure.</span> <span id="s995">To sign it.</span> <span id="s996">I would understand if this was, at that time it wasn't even such a hostile territory, __________________, not yet.</span> <span id="s997">They were really partners in the war, you know, allies.</span> <span id="s998">But if I would have to sign I was not a Communist, I understand.</span> <span id="s999">Maybe I would understand that.</span> <span id="s1000">But that I was not a Nazi?</span> <span id="s1001">How could I be a Nazi being a Jew?</span> <span id="s1002">Of course, even if some Jews were collaborating with Nazis, there were some in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1003">But not because, the Germans used them only, of course, right?</span> <span id="s1004">But a Nazi would never allow those Jews to become Nazis.</span> <span id="s1005">They just used them for their dirty work, that's all.</span> <span id="s1006">There were some Jews collaborators, of course.</span> <span id="s1007">Jewish Police in Warsaw ghetto, for example.</span> <span id="s1008">But anyway, it didn't effect me that much, but they just, for years, it just lingered in my mind.</span> <span id="s1009">Why did I have to do that?</span> <span id="s1010">Why sign it, you know?</span> <span id="s1011">And then I was wondering, those German Nazis you read here and there, Ukrainian discovered now, Deb-yan-uk (ph) for example, you know, that was arrested and sent to Israel eventually.</span> <span id="s1012">He was exonerated, not by the United States but by Israel.</span> <span id="s1013">So that's, it stuck in my memory, I would say.</span> <span id="s1014">But otherwise, the American way of openness, people friendly, New York City, they are too busy sometimes for us and that's something that bothered me, but I didn't blame them because they are American, because the style of life was in New York.</span> <span id="s1015">10 million people.</span> <span id="s1016">I mean, nobody has no time to be too nice to you because, they are nice if you stop them, but I remember in Europe I asked a cab driver to go to the highest __________________ office for some information, about medicine and so on, and I asked him how to get there.</span> <span id="s1017">He said, "I don't know, but if you want to hop in my cab I'll take you there."</span> <span id="s1018">And I was thinking about it, you know?</span> <span id="s1019">He didn't want to tell me where to go, I was walking, I couldn't afford a bus.</span> <span id="s1020">But he didn't want to tell me where it is.</span> <span id="s1021">But if I pay for the taxi, he would take me.</span> <span id="s1022">There are few things, but it’s a lower class people.</span> <span id="s1023">But he was not hostile.</span> <span id="s1024">He was not unfriendly.</span> <span id="s1025">He was not, he was himself, that's how he was.</span> <span id="s1026">I learned to just ignore those things eventually.</span> <span id="s1027">But the few little things, I was talking in my mind, you know?</span> <span id="s1028">But overall my experience coming to the United States, overall, was nothing but highly positive.</span> <span id="s1029">And I am saying that in a truthful manner, that I don't recall any bitterness.</span> <span id="s1030">I never encountered any rough treatment or anti-Semitic even type of thing.</span> <span id="s1031">Never had it, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: How long did it take to go through the customs?</span> <span id="s1033">Was it a few days one day and . . .?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: No, this was almost a day.</span> <span id="s1035">In fact, early in the morning, I think they started at 6:00 in the morning I think.</span> <span id="s1036">Because I remember they walked us out quite early.</span> <span id="s1037">In the cabin, of course, we were sleeping in hammocks on the ship.</span> <span id="s1038">We didn't sleep, we were just vegetating in those things.</span> <span id="s1039">And they, I think by late afternoon we were all done.</span> <span id="s1040">And they deposited that huge crate that we had and then I remember meeting my wife's Aunt from a distance, dressed in a hat and so on, which was maybe 3:00 or 4:00 PM at that time.</span> <span id="s1041">It took us about six or eight hours maybe, at the most.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: So actually when you got to finally leave there and actually go into the city it was still Thanksgiving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: That's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: It was still the holiday so the streets are probably empty, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: There was nothing, there was nothing on the street, correct.</span> <span id="s1046">The streets were empty.</span> <span id="s1047">The whole port was empty.</span> <span id="s1048">There were some ships here and there but there was no traffic there, no.</span> <span id="s1049">We were not usual immigrants, not because, we are displaced people so we came on government ship, you know, military ship.</span> <span id="s1050">And we found a lot of support from the crew.</span> <span id="s1051">We were crowded, we were so crowded.</span> <span id="s1052">There was no room to sit because we were 1,800 people on 300 or 400 capacity people, you know.</span> <span id="s1053">And we didn't stay long there, of course, we were taken away right away to this hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Were people having any sort of Thanksgiving dinner?</span> <span id="s1055">Did you have that that first night or not?</span> <span id="s1056">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: You mean that night when we, only on the ship.</span> <span id="s1058">This was the day that we arrived, is that what you mean?</span> <span id="s1059">That's when we had the ham, raisins, the sweet things which I, they told us it was because of the holiday.</span> <span id="s1060">Normally we wouldn't get it either.</span> <span id="s1061">And I thought, gee, I wonder what they eat on non-holidays?</span> <span id="s1062">I got so sick from that.</span> <span id="s1063">I love ham, ham I love, but not sweet ham.</span> <span id="s1064">Not with raisins.</span> <span id="s1065">But you know for a man who was hungry so many years, you know?</span> <span id="s1066">Surprising how I distaste the ham with raisins.</span> <span id="s1067">I was not hungry anymore really.</span> <span id="s1068">In Vienna I was not hungry.</span> <span id="s1069">No, we were well fed and our American Joint was supporting us very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So let's go back now, you're in, you go to Buffalo?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: What year is this?</span> <span id="s1073">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: This is 1953.</span> <span id="s1075">Right.</span> <span id="s1076">I worked in the hospital and I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1077">Should I go into practice after internship?</span> <span id="s1078">Should I go to residency?</span> <span id="s1079">Residency was another four years.</span> <span id="s1080">I decided I can't sit.</span> <span id="s1081">First I want to be a plastic surgeon.</span> <span id="s1082">To be a plastic surgeon you have to take four years training and I have to be American born or American graduate of an American school in those days.</span> <span id="s1083">And I was told I would never make it, forget about it.</span> <span id="s1084">So I decide to get a job in the hospital, so I worked in the hospital as a house physician.</span> <span id="s1085">And I was getting nice money, $250.00 a month, that was a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1086">You could buy a suit, pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s1087">My wife could buy a dress, in a cheap store like Marshall's here or TJ Max.</span> <span id="s1088">But it was new.</span> <span id="s1089">We never had new stuff before.</span> <span id="s1090">In Vienna, we're getting clothes handed to us from American Joint.</span> <span id="s1091">Some of it's donated merchandise, you know, but we're happy, lucky to get it.</span> <span id="s1092">There was nice stuff but, and we met a lot of people in the same boat as us.</span> <span id="s1093">Some professional, some not professional.</span> <span id="s1094">Some worked in the factories, some worked in the offices, you know, from Europe.</span> <span id="s1095">So we, since we met people from my country, from Poland, you more or less cling to each other.</span> <span id="s1096">Different city maybe, but we're closer than anybody else.</span> <span id="s1097">And they are about the same age.</span> <span id="s1098">So we had about a ton of friends, a ton.</span> <span id="s1099">Many, many friends from different parts of Poland.</span> <span id="s1100">Some from Vienna even.</span> <span id="s1101">And I met, in Buffalo, a friend of mine from Vienna, who left Vienna, he was a journalist, to the United States as an immigrant, a few years later.</span> <span id="s1102">He didn't know I'll be in Buffalo and he was in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1103">I met him once in a gathering of my friends, and we knew each other from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1104">So we dressed like one family, spoke the same language, although we all spoke English at that time.</span> <span id="s1105">Kids were little, about the same age, they played together.</span> <span id="s1106">The wives had something to do.</span> <span id="s1107">But my wife, like our parents, felt she should stay home with the kids.</span> <span id="s1108">And by that time she was pregnant with my second child, I had a daughter that you met today.</span> <span id="s1109">And she was born in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1110">My son was born in Rochester.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Oh, well let's go back then.</span> <span id="s1112">When was you're son born?</span> <span id="s1113">What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: My son was born in 1952, August 28, 1952.</span> <span id="s1115">I was in Rochester at that time.</span> <span id="s1116">I was an intern.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: And you named him what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: Genisty (ph) Hospital in Rochester, New York, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And what was the name of you're son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Of my son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Gerald David.</span> <span id="s1123">David after my wife's little brother that perished.</span> <span id="s1124">That we think survived the war, now, we just found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Oh really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: We think we found out.</span> <span id="s1127">We're not sure yet.</span> <span id="s1128">We cannot find him yet.</span> <span id="s1129">But we found, _________ and later maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Or, I don't know, we could just talk about it now, because let me just say for the tape here, in you're video interview, you and you're wife, you both tell the stories of how you lost him from this basically this fake resort that the Nazis tricked people to going to and that.</span> <span id="s1131">Now, when you did the video which was two or three years ago, I believe, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: At the time you were both convinced that he had not survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: So now you're saying you've gotten some new news?</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: About a year ago, we went to a friend of ours here from Warsaw who just found her twin brother after fifty plus years.</span> <span id="s1137">Not knowing he survived, by pure accident, she found him.</span> <span id="s1138">So we met him.</span> <span id="s1139">And my wife talked to him and she said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1140">I have a little brother who was, when the war started she was seven, he was at that time nine years old.</span> <span id="s1141">He was born in 1933, her little brother was born in 1933.</span> <span id="s1142">So in 1943 or 1944, __________________, I don't remember exactly now.</span> <span id="s1143">And he was at that time 10 or 11 years old.</span> <span id="s1144">So he perished.</span> <span id="s1145">So anyway, talking to this friend now, he said, why don't you write a letter to such and such an office in Warsaw, Poland?</span> <span id="s1146">They have lists of many people, they survived camps and so on.</span> <span id="s1147">Why don't you do that?</span> <span id="s1148">My wife did.</span> <span id="s1149">Never got a response.</span> <span id="s1150">The man who runs this is an American boy who runs a certain foundation, I think the name is Linder (ph) Foundation in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1151">Who send a list of survivors in this camp that we know he went to.</span> <span id="s1152">And his name, Arian name, not real name, Arian name, is listed as survivor of that camp.</span> <span id="s1153">This list is from dates from 1946.</span> <span id="s1154">The year of birth is the same.</span> <span id="s1155">But the day and month is not clear, that's a copy of a copy of a copy.</span> <span id="s1156">We cannot decode the day and the month, but 1933.</span> <span id="s1157">His name was Roman Kolvolski (ph).</span> <span id="s1158">So we wrote, we put everything in motion right now.</span> <span id="s1159">We wrote to Israel.</span> <span id="s1160">We wrote to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1161">We wrote to England, to Australia, to Switzerland, Austria, Germany, to what they call the villa-goot-mach-home (ph), in case he survived he might be collecting rent from German government.</span> <span id="s1162">So we wrote to Israel, to Avrasham (ph), wrote to Israel, different offices there.</span> <span id="s1163">The Israeli Historical Documentation Office who's Director is a friend of mine from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1164">And when I wrote him about the whole situation, he put every motion he could, the German Consulate is a personal friend, so he is very much assisting him in trying to, Red Cross, International Cross, __________________, you name it, everything that's known to maybe get some help from, we wrote to them.</span> <span id="s1165">As a matter of fact we just dedicated a plague for my parents in our Temple.</span> <span id="s1166">My parents, my sister.</span> <span id="s1167">And we are already reserving a plague for her parents, her brother, when this come about.</span> <span id="s1168">So I eliminated his name from it.</span> <span id="s1169">We only sent for her parents, we know they perished.</span> <span id="s1170">And we still hope maybe we'll find him, but it is a very difficult part now, how to find him?</span> <span id="s1171">He might have changed his name.</span> <span id="s1172">He might be dead by now.</span> <span id="s1173">He could be now sixty-some years old, 1933, he would be 63 years old.</span> <span id="s1174">He could have died, natural causes.</span> <span id="s1175">He could change his name to a different name.</span> <span id="s1176">Maybe he changes religion, does not want to have nothing to do with Judaism.</span> <span id="s1177">I mean, there's very, all these remote possibilities that we don't know.</span> <span id="s1178">But we don't lose hope.</span> <span id="s1179">We do everything we can.</span> <span id="s1180">We will go anyplace.</span> <span id="s1181">My wife doesn't want to go back to Poland, she would go to Poland right now if she would find something.</span> <span id="s1182">So we're just keeping our hands and our hearts open, that maybe he's alive and hopefully, all those years that we wasted not doing nothing about him because, in 1945 we registered in Poland and also they knew where we are and so on, and there was no information.</span> <span id="s1183">The Communists did on purpose, did not provide any communication with people that survived the war.</span> <span id="s1184">They didn't want that, see?</span> <span id="s1185">So all the notes that were left in Poland, in the different offices and so on, I understand they were destroyed by the Communists, you know?</span> <span id="s1186">So nobody will find out that, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: How long ago was it that you saw this list with his name on it?</span> <span id="s1188">Was it this year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: It was about one year.</span> <span id="s1190">We see each other quite often now.</span> <span id="s1191">The twin brother of the young lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Yeah, but you saw this list that showed the brother's name on it.</span> <span id="s1193">How long ago was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Oh, he mailed to us from Warsaw recently, about a month ago or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Oh, just a month ago?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1197">And we started everything about a month ago.</span> <span id="s1198">And my son, through the Internet, he's a computer wizard, found some 11 people from that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1199">And we've called them long distance, some are from New York, some from Annapolis, some are from Michigan, but they never knew him.</span> <span id="s1200">They did not know him.</span> <span id="s1201">They were older people, he was a little boy at that time.</span> <span id="s1202">But it's obvious he survived because his name appear as a registered person in 1946.</span> <span id="s1203">Unless, by sheer coincidence, the same first name, last name, Roman Kolvolski (ph) is identical with his false papers were, not false, they were real papers, but on an Arian name.</span> <span id="s1204">We got it through the Polish underground, for a young boy who died and they never recorded a death.</span> <span id="s1205">So the birth certificate could be used again by Polish underground to save people.</span> <span id="s1206">That's how we got the birth certificate, from my wife's little brother.</span> <span id="s1207">So it's possible that someone else had the same first name, last name.</span> <span id="s1208">The same year of birth?</span> <span id="s1209">That would be such a coincidence.</span> <span id="s1210">So we firmly believe that he's alive.</span> <span id="s1211">Or he was alive anyway, we have to find out.</span> <span id="s1212">So we do the best we can.</span> <span id="s1213">We just got a letter from Sweden, our friend who puts ads in newspapers, and the Jewish organization there, and so far nothing.</span> <span id="s1214">So, so far we see no answers to it yet.</span> <span id="s1215">But we're not losing hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: So that was just a month ago.</span> <span id="s1217">After all this time, all these years, I mean it must make you feel a lot of emotions I would imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: No question about it, no question about it.</span> <span id="s1219">We don't give up hope.</span> <span id="s1220">We live with hope all our lives.</span> <span id="s1221">That's what brought us where we are right now.</span> <span id="s1222">If not hope, of course, probably would take a gun and shoot myself.</span> <span id="s1223">Why everybody was being killed, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Does it make you feel any regret or sadness that maybe he was around all this time?</span> <span id="s1225">You just didn't know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">A: Yes, guilt feelings.</span> <span id="s1227">I feel very guilty, yeah.</span> <span id="s1228">I feel guilty that, but searching my mind, logically thinking, I don't know what I could have done.</span> <span id="s1229">We did leave traces of our life, our names, where we are going to be, where we are and so on.</span> <span id="s1230">And that's all we could have done.</span> <span id="s1231">My wife found her Uncle by accident.</span> <span id="s1232">One of our students was on a train in Austria and sitting on the bench with somebody, they found out, oh, where are you from?</span> <span id="s1233">Oh, I'm from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1234">But you don't speak, you're German is with an accent.</span> <span id="s1235">Says, yes, I'm not Viennese born.</span> <span id="s1236">Said, so what country are you from?</span> <span id="s1237">Poland.</span> <span id="s1238">Oh, I'm from Poland too.</span> <span id="s1239">So, you know, that talking to each other turns out one was a survivor of concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1240">That was __________________ our group.</span> <span id="s1241">So he says, what town are you from?</span> <span id="s1242">So he told him.</span> <span id="s1243">I'm a student.</span> <span id="s1244">What towns are the students from?</span> <span id="s1245">So he said, mentioned several towns that, Warsaw, Lublin, Lublin.</span> <span id="s1246">I had a cousin that use to be in Lublin, then she live in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1247">So the student says, what's her name, do you remember her name?</span> <span id="s1248">He didn't remember her name.</span> <span id="s1249">So he said, I'll tell you, we only have one couple from Lublin.</span> <span id="s1250">Her name is, he mentioned my wife's name.</span> <span id="s1251">He almost fainted.</span> <span id="s1252">It's her cousin.</span> <span id="s1253">My wife found a cousin from Warsaw who survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1254">He was on a train going from Germany, from one town to another town, by accident run into this student who is part of our group of students, and that's how we found out each other.</span> <span id="s1255">And since that time, through him, my wife found out she has an Aunt in New York.</span> <span id="s1256">He knew about the Aunt because his mother was the sister of the Aunt in Europe.</span> <span id="s1257">It was very close, you understand?</span> <span id="s1258">So my wife found out through the cousin that, he's still alive, in New York, of course we are in contact with him, not as much as we should maybe but we are.</span> <span id="s1259">He's very, very ultra, ultra orthodox and we're not as religious so it doesn't fit his philosophy you know, but he was very helpful to us and still a family.</span> <span id="s1260">It's her cousin.</span> <span id="s1261">I'm sure my wife would tell you more details about him in her statements, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Well I wish you luck.</span> <span id="s1263">I hope you're able to . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: We are praying, we hope that we will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">Q: Let's go back to you're story.</span> <span id="s1266">You're first child is born in Rochester in, I forget which year that you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Gerald David Horn.</span> <span id="s1268">Then my daughter was Linda Sue Horn.</span> <span id="s1269">She was born in Buffalo, New York.</span> <span id="s1270">She was born May 13, on Mother's Day at that time, it was Mother's Day, May 13 in 1956.</span> <span id="s1271">So she's, that's 40 years old now.</span> <span id="s1272">Well we slowly gaining ground and creating a family.</span> <span id="s1273">We feel more secure.</span> <span id="s1274">I had a job, I was working in a hospital.</span> <span id="s1275">My wife was a full-time homemaker.</span> <span id="s1276">Two kids now.</span> <span id="s1277">She was three weeks old, she had pneumonia, she was hospitalized, we were scared we would lose her and so on, but things got to be fine.</span> <span id="s1278">One negative aspect of my relationship in America with some of the landlords is when she was born, it was in May, he turned off the heat.</span> <span id="s1279">It was cold in Buffalo.</span> <span id="s1280">Very cold.</span> <span id="s1281">It was very cold, and I come home with a newborn baby.</span> <span id="s1282">She caught a cold.</span> <span id="s1283">And I'm not trying to blame our landlord for it.</span> <span id="s1284">It was cold, the viruses, you know?</span> <span id="s1285">But the temperature was definitely below the normal.</span> <span id="s1286">Normally people use to have their places heated at that time.</span> <span id="s1287">And when I complained, couldn't you heat our apartment with my newborn baby that's just come home, she was a little low weight, he said, no, no.</span> <span id="s1288">I need you're apartment now because my family is coming and we need an apartment so I want you to move out anyway.</span> <span id="s1289">So I thought I'd wait until you're baby maybe gets slightly bigger than I want to approach you on it anyway.</span> <span id="s1290">So I seen there's no point discussing things so I found an apartment not too far, through my friends and so on.</span> <span id="s1291">Very lovely apartment.</span> <span id="s1292">They were American Polish people, not Jewish, that nobody want to take a newborn baby in at that time.</span> <span id="s1293">And they were the only people.</span> <span id="s1294">I was knocking the doors, from door to door.</span> <span id="s1295">They accepted us with a newborn baby.</span> <span id="s1296">Until today, they are just like, my daughter still call them my grandma.</span> <span id="s1297">She's now, for eight years, this lady now, she lost her husband in the meantime.</span> <span id="s1298">We lived downstairs, they lived upstairs.</span> <span id="s1299">Like a family together.</span> <span id="s1300">And they, we worship them, until today, she's a widow now.</span> <span id="s1301">We're trying to assist her a little bit, we help her.</span> <span id="s1302">She remarried but they are up in age, sick and so on.</span> <span id="s1303">So we, they are our dear, not only benefactors, but friends.</span> <span id="s1304">They're on the weddings with the kids, her children, so we are good friends until today.</span> <span id="s1305">As a matter of fact, when Washington D.C. on our testimony for the Museum, we invited by her daughter, this lady from Buffalo, who lives near Washington, her mother's there, and stay with us for a few days.</span> <span id="s1306">She was raising our Linda, my daughter.</span> <span id="s1307">So we are very close with them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1308">So after a few years in Buffalo, three years or so, it was about 1959, 1960, I had to take by Boards, I didn't have a license yet.</span> <span id="s1309">I worked in the hospital, that's all.</span> <span id="s1310">So I was studying and there were two States.</span> <span id="s1311">Not each state approved . . .[End of Side 1 of Tape 2]. . . foreign graduates at that time.</span> <span id="s1312">Don't forget, this was a time after the war.</span> <span id="s1313">American physicians were in the Army and they needed doctors here so they wanted all the doctors in the hospital, because there was no one to serve in the hospital, there were not enough doctors.</span> <span id="s1314">So when I worked in the hospital in Buffalo they didn't want to let me go either.</span> <span id="s1315">But I didn't want to build a future working in the hospital until one day they won't need you no more, I want to be on my own.</span> <span id="s1316">So I had to take, make the license anyway.</span> <span id="s1317">Besides time legally would have changed and I wouldn't get a license to even work in a hospital, which eventually turned out to be so.</span> <span id="s1318">So I decided to quit the hospital.</span> <span id="s1319">I was studying.</span> <span id="s1320">And two states were accepting foreign graduates, which one was Ohio and one was Illinois.</span> <span id="s1321">So I thought, well, let me take a trip to Chicago, take a look.</span> <span id="s1322">I came to Chicago, I fell in love with Chicago.</span> <span id="s1323">I was on Lake Shore.</span> <span id="s1324">I remember staying in a hotel on La Salle Street.</span> <span id="s1325">And I just looked around, a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s1326">Downtown was beautiful.</span> <span id="s1327">State Street was beautiful in those days.</span> <span id="s1328">Different than now.</span> <span id="s1329">And I was given a letter of recommendation by one of my colleagues, a doctor in Buffalo, to one of the doctors in another family, personal friends in Chicago, so I had someone to talk to at least.</span> <span id="s1330">So I called them up and became friends right away.</span> <span id="s1331">Both of them were from Poland too so it made me feel more close at home, more or less.</span> <span id="s1332">One physician was practicing already here.</span> <span id="s1333">The other party, he was a CPA.</span> <span id="s1334">And they introduced me to their pediatrician, an American born, and so I make already a few acquaintences.</span> <span id="s1335">Just being a visitor to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1336">I fell in love with Chicago.</span> <span id="s1337">I said, that's the city I want to.</span> <span id="s1338">I went back home.</span> <span id="s1339">I started studying very hard and in 1959, forgot what month, October I think, I came to Chicago to take my exams, my Board.</span> <span id="s1340">And while taking my exams, I seen somebody from a distance, during the intermission, that I thought I seen a ghost.</span> <span id="s1341">And I screamed spontaneously, not thinking, his first name.</span> <span id="s1342">His name was Bolick (ph).</span> <span id="s1343">"Bolick (ph)?"</span> <span id="s1344">The person jumped, turned around, didn't know who called him because he changed his name for many years already.</span> <span id="s1345">Nobody knew his name, except I did because he was my classmate in Lee-boof (ph), Lemberg when I was taking first and second in medicine.</span> <span id="s1346">We roomed together in dormitory.</span> <span id="s1347">I didn't know he had survived the war.</span> <span id="s1348">When I approached him, he look at me, he did not know who I was.</span> <span id="s1349">And I recognized him right away.</span> <span id="s1350">I said, "Well let me tell you, I won't tell you who I am, but I'll bring some few little facts to maybe wake up you're memory.</span> <span id="s1351">Do you remember City of Lee-boof (ph), Lemberg?"</span> <span id="s1352">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1353">He knew that I was somebody that, I knew him.</span> <span id="s1354">And he was pale like he was going to faint.</span> <span id="s1355">And I was so emotionally upset and I, myself I didn't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s1356">And I wouldn't let him get away from me, I was just hugging him and he hugged me but he didn't know whom he was hugging.</span> <span id="s1357">Finally I told him who I was.</span> <span id="s1358">He couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1359">He didn't recognize me.</span> <span id="s1360">He hugged me and kissed me and so on.</span> <span id="s1361">Turned out he lives in the South someplace, in the South someplace, in the ________ I think, someplace.</span> <span id="s1362">Birmingham, Alabama, that's where it was, yeah.</span> <span id="s1363">And he come in here to take his Board, same as I did.</span> <span id="s1364">Well anyway, I'd like to tell you, he passed the Boards too.</span> <span id="s1365">He moved to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1366">I came back home.</span> <span id="s1367">I gathered my family and I said to them, we are moving to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1368">But before that I have to go back to Chicago, find a place for us.</span> <span id="s1369">So I was introduced to a few other doctors, different hospitals here.</span> <span id="s1370">Edgewater Hospital is one of them.</span> <span id="s1371">Some of them were looking for a partner.</span> <span id="s1372">I had a license, I felt very good.</span> <span id="s1373">I felt very secure.</span> <span id="s1374">That's the most important paper in my life.</span> <span id="s1375">And they, no one wanted to be my partner.</span> <span id="s1376">But I was so naive, I didn't know you need lawyers, write a contract, all those things.</span> <span id="s1377">His word was fine for me, you know?</span> <span id="s1378">And I move my family to this area on the basis of his promise, his word, that's all.</span> <span id="s1379">His office was in the suburb of Chicago, in River Grove.</span> <span id="s1380">He helped me find myself an apartment in Elmwood Park, which was about 10 minutes or so, 15 minute drive from his office and his house.</span> <span id="s1381">Nice, third story apartment, two bedrooms, modern, elegant, very fine.</span> <span id="s1382">He promised me a salary.</span> <span id="s1383">Never heard so much money before, which turned out to be not that much, but to me it was a lot.</span> <span id="s1384">And I sign a contract for six months, only I didn't know what I'm going to do, an option, take another six month.</span> <span id="s1385">And we moved to Chicago.</span> <span id="s1386">I introduced my wife to those friends that I was introduced to by my friends from Buffalo, this CPA and this other doctor.</span> <span id="s1387">And right away the ladies got busy and they introduced other ladies from Poland too, so in no time we knew so many people, had so many friends.</span> <span id="s1388">In the meantime, a new Temple in Emerald Park, actually River Forest, found out that we are newcomers and survivors, they asked us to join them there.</span> <span id="s1389">One was Orthodox, the other one was Reform.</span> <span id="s1390">I didn't feel like joining, further I couldn't afford anything yet.</span> <span id="s1391">They told me not to worry about it, not to, but I didn't want to go for that.</span> <span id="s1392">And some of the people came to us, visited us, living in Emerald Park, now our neighbors.</span> <span id="s1393">Not too many Jewish people lived there, mostly Italian, ___________, but they were very nice to us.</span> <span id="s1394">Everybody was nice.</span> <span id="s1395">And she introduce us and took my wife to the University and to the Museum.</span> <span id="s1396">We lived in Vienna, there was nothing but music and Museums, you know, the whole city is nothing but culture.</span> <span id="s1397">How Nazis could develop in so high a sophisticated society as Austria, people are so intelligent.</span> <span id="s1398">Everybody with a degree.</span> <span id="s1399">There's no bums there.</span> <span id="s1400">Everybody had a degree.</span> <span id="s1401">The guy who was sweeping the city had a University degree.</span> <span id="s1402">I mean, it was not uncommon that a barber had a University degree, but never practiced whatever he was studying.</span> <span id="s1403">Highly intellectual country.</span> <span id="s1404">But vicious.</span> <span id="s1405">They were more vicious, it was vicious Nazis, more than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1406">See?</span> <span id="s1407">But anyway, she introduced us, this lady from the Synagogue, to many people and so on.</span> <span id="s1408">In the meantime, I found out that my associate, that I was suppose to be his partner, did not tell me the whole truth.</span> <span id="s1409">And when I found out from the hospital, some of my colleagues knew Carl, said, "You know, we know you're partner very well.</span> <span id="s1410">Do you have a contract with him?"</span> <span id="s1411">I said, "A contract?</span> <span id="s1412">What for?</span> <span id="s1413">He told me I'm his partner.”</span> <span id="s1414">He look at me like I'm an imbecile.</span> <span id="s1415">He said, "What do you mean he told you?</span> <span id="s1416">How do you know, how long have you known him?"</span> <span id="s1417">"Well, I just met him.”</span> <span id="s1418">"You know what?</span> <span id="s1419">Ask him to sign a contract.”</span> <span id="s1420">So it started to dawn on me, maybe I should do that.</span> <span id="s1421">I talk to my wife.</span> <span id="s1422">"Why should I sign a contract?"</span> <span id="s1423">She said, "Well, we're living in a legal society today.</span> <span id="s1424">Maybe that's the right thing to do.”</span> <span id="s1425">So I approached him.</span> <span id="s1426">In the meantime, he was taking special to residency in anesthesia, I was running the office, the practice.</span> <span id="s1427">Behind my back he tried to sell the practice to somebody.</span> <span id="s1428">He told me if I work for him for two years I can take over his practice.</span> <span id="s1429">I have no money, I couldn't buy nothing.</span> <span id="s1430">I had nothing.</span> <span id="s1431">And the money he promised was good, you know?</span> <span id="s1432">So, I said, "I want to sign a contract.”</span> <span id="s1433">He said, "Look, I don't want to sign a contract", he said to me.</span> <span id="s1434">"Because I might not like you.</span> <span id="s1435">You only work for me, what?</span> <span id="s1436">Two or three months already."</span> <span id="s1437">Maybe, what, two or three months, you already know.</span> <span id="s1438">People like me, I like you're patients, they like me too.</span> <span id="s1439">Your busy, we're busy.</span> <span id="s1440">You don't bother doing night calls no more.</span> <span id="s1441">I do all the night calls.</span> <span id="s1442">That you told the patient over the phone she has flu turned out to be acute gall bladder disease, gall bladder attack, have to wake up at 2:00 in the morning, you operate on the patient at night.</span> <span id="s1443">I do dirty work.</span> <span id="s1444">I deserve a contract now.</span> <span id="s1445">Well I don't know if I like you're work.</span> <span id="s1446">If I don't like you, you'll go the next day.</span> <span id="s1447">I said, you mean you won't give me __________________.</span> <span id="s1448">No, this is something, no.</span> <span id="s1449">There are plenty of guys like you out there, coming from Europe, from South America.</span> <span id="s1450">There are so many refugee doctors, you know?</span> <span id="s1451">So I said, you know what, I have to think it over.</span> <span id="s1452">I don't care what you do, he says.</span> <span id="s1453">You are working for me now, you're being paid.</span> <span id="s1454">And he always paid me on time.</span> <span id="s1455">All of a sudden, one day he got a telephone call from a doctor, are you Dr. Horn?</span> <span id="s1456">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1457">You know, funny, because I understand that you are a physician in practice with Dr. So-and-so.</span> <span id="s1458">I said, yes.</span> <span id="s1459">He said, because he just approached me.</span> <span id="s1460">Are you planning to take over the practice?</span> <span id="s1461">I said, well that's what he told me.</span> <span id="s1462">After he finishes residency on anesthesia, I am running his practice so he will have income.</span> <span id="s1463">He's paying a salary on me, but after these two years I am taking over the practice.</span> <span id="s1464">I don't know, he approached me, he wants to sell the practice to me.</span> <span id="s1465">He want me to buy it.</span> <span id="s1466">I said, he never said nothing to me like this.</span> <span id="s1467">No.</span> <span id="s1468">Why would he do that?</span> <span id="s1469">He promised me the practice.</span> <span id="s1470">I was so naive.</span> <span id="s1471">I couldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1472">I didn't learn those things, the tricks of, in medicine you're not a businessman, we're not businessmen.</span> <span id="s1473">In medicine you wake up in the middle of the night, they need you, you go there.</span> <span id="s1474">If they don't pay, they don't pay.</span> <span id="s1475">So they say, send me a bill, you send a bill, you never collect anyway.</span> <span id="s1476">Most people don't know.</span> <span id="s1477">But this was not the issue here.</span> <span id="s1478">Some poor people, I wouldn't let them down because they cannot pay.</span> <span id="s1479">I mean, this was medicine.</span> <span id="s1480">And he said, you know, I better, don't touch that thing.</span> <span id="s1481">Fine.</span> <span id="s1482">I appreciate it, I won't buy it.</span> <span id="s1483">I want to assure, I won't step on you're toes.</span> <span id="s1484">When he, this doctor came in that evening to the office after his courses in the hospital, and I said to him, you know what?</span> <span id="s1485">I want a signed contract tonight, I said.</span> <span id="s1486">And then he said, what about if I don't?</span> <span id="s1487">Then I'm walking out right now.</span> <span id="s1488">Right now you're walking out?</span> <span id="s1489">What are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1490">He started laughing.</span> <span id="s1491">I said, don't laugh.</span> <span id="s1492">Don't worry about it.</span> <span id="s1493">I survived worse thing than this.</span> <span id="s1494">I'm not worrying about it, I have a license.</span> <span id="s1495">I'll have my own office.</span> <span id="s1496">Ha-ha-ha-ha.</span> <span id="s1497">He started laughing.</span> <span id="s1498">He said, you know you cannot start a practice like this today.</span> <span id="s1499">There are so many doctors coming, you know you're crazy.</span> <span id="s1500">You'll never survive.</span> <span id="s1501">I said, well I won't let you worry about it.</span> <span id="s1502">I worry about myself.</span> <span id="s1503">And I said good-bye.</span> <span id="s1504">Next day, he calls me.</span> <span id="s1505">Aren’t you going to the office?</span> <span id="s1506">I said, no.</span> <span id="s1507">There are people coming in.</span> <span id="s1508">That's too bad.</span> <span id="s1509">Remember what you told me?</span> <span id="s1510">If you don't like me, next day I'm gone.</span> <span id="s1511">No two weeks notice.</span> <span id="s1512">I told you, I don't like you, I'm gone.</span> <span id="s1513">Good-bye.</span> <span id="s1514">My God, this was it.</span> <span id="s1515">I went to the hospital that I was on staff and I told the Director that I am no more an associate of this given doctor.</span> <span id="s1516">He said, oh we know all about it.</span> <span id="s1517">I was surprised less than three months.</span> <span id="s1518">So I said, what should I do then?</span> <span id="s1519">I mean, I would like to open my own practice.</span> <span id="s1520">Yeah, but see if you open your own practice, you have to re-apply to the staff again.</span> <span id="s1521">And you are on your own.</span> <span id="s1522">Before you only were accepted because you are an associate of Dr. so-and-so.</span> <span id="s1523">But I'll have some use for you, see.</span> <span id="s1524">In order to be accepted that will cost you $25,000.00.</span> <span id="s1525">I said, I don't have that kind of money.</span> <span id="s1526">I only worked three months, I barely pay my rent.</span> <span id="s1527">Well, I'm sorry then.</span> <span id="s1528">You cannot be accepted.</span> <span id="s1529">Forget about bothering with application.</span> <span id="s1530">You wouldn't believe it.</span> <span id="s1531">I learned the American reality in medicine from then on.</span> <span id="s1532">I was going from hospital to hospital.</span> <span id="s1533">Like a club, they all wanted the same thing.</span> <span id="s1534">Lutheran General wanted $20,000.00.</span> <span id="s1535">Gottlieb (ph) wanted $20,00.00.</span> <span id="s1536">And __________________ hospital, I won't mention no names, they want no money from me but the Director of the hospital is a physician.</span> <span id="s1537">He said, every patient you admit to this hospital, if you are working the emergency room or you are on call, people come in without a doctor, they call you.</span> <span id="s1538">If you wiggle up to that patient, you pay me half, whatever comes from that patient.</span> <span id="s1539">I said, what?</span> <span id="s1540">I never heard this before.</span> <span id="s1541">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1542">For what?</span> <span id="s1543">Pay you for what?</span> <span id="s1544">Are you going to work with me on that patient?</span> <span id="s1545">No, no, you don't understand.</span> <span id="s1546">We do you a favor.</span> <span id="s1547">You're going to get into a given situation, you'll have to wait for a patient.</span> <span id="s1548">You be patient, right away, you go work the emergency room.</span> <span id="s1549">A patient would come in.</span> <span id="s1550">Whatever comes to me, hospitalize, the fee is going to be $200.00, you pay me $100.00.</span> <span id="s1551">I said, well how am I going to do the taxes?</span> <span id="s1552">I mean, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1553">Why?</span> <span id="s1554">I don't understand it.</span> <span id="s1555">Well, you'll learn fast.</span> <span id="s1556">That's what it is.</span> <span id="s1557">Think it over, let me know.</span> <span id="s1558">I quit.</span> <span id="s1559">What I did, I moved away from the whole area I was before.</span> <span id="s1560">I didn't want no one accusing me of being a competitor, so I worked in a strange street on Harlem Avenue, near between Edison and Belmont.</span> <span id="s1561">It was a brand new medical office.</span> <span id="s1562">I see it empty.</span> <span id="s1563">I knock at the door, walked in.</span> <span id="s1564">The Director was an American dentist, Dr. DeRome (ph) of French ancestry or so.</span> <span id="s1565">I introduced myself.</span> <span id="s1566">I told him the whole story.</span> <span id="s1567">I am a newcomer to Chicago, I don't know a soul here.</span> <span id="s1568">I am not on staff at the hospital anymore.</span> <span id="s1569">I was, I told him, I worked three months for another doctor, which I was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1570">I would like to open an office.</span> <span id="s1571">I have no money to pay for rent.</span> <span id="s1572">Not now.</span> <span id="s1573">I have no patients either.</span> <span id="s1574">And I was wondering, maybe if you listen to my story, maybe you can help me?</span> <span id="s1575">A man I never met before.</span> <span id="s1576">No one introduced me to him, I just knocked at the door.</span> <span id="s1577">He had seven suites in the building.</span> <span id="s1578">A brand new building.</span> <span id="s1579">Only two offices were taken.</span> <span id="s1580">And his was the third.</span> <span id="s1581">There were four vacant.</span> <span id="s1582">What do you want?</span> <span id="s1583">Take a look at the offices.</span> <span id="s1584">Which office do you want?</span> <span id="s1585">I said, well wait a minute.</span> <span id="s1586">We have to make some financial understanding.</span> <span id="s1587">How is it going to be?</span> <span id="s1588">He said, well you told me.</span> <span id="s1589">You don't have any money.</span> <span id="s1590">So I said, well, so what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s1591">Well I will let you work until you can make some money.</span> <span id="s1592">I said, but I don't know how long it will take me.</span> <span id="s1593">I don't have no patients, I don't know anybody.</span> <span id="s1594">If you have no money you're not going to pay me.</span> <span id="s1595">And you be the one to decide what you can pay me.</span> <span id="s1596">I didn't believe what I hear.</span> <span id="s1597">A man I never met before.</span> <span id="s1598">He liked me.</span> <span id="s1599">I liked him right away.</span> <span id="s1600">He was like a father image to me.</span> <span id="s1601">I was young.</span> <span id="s1602">I was 39, this was 1960, I was 40.</span> <span id="s1603">And he was, maybe at that time, maybe 75 or so.</span> <span id="s1604">And I picked out that office.</span> <span id="s1605">And he advised me, I will do it for you.</span> <span id="s1606">The local paper, he put a note with my picture in it.</span> <span id="s1607">A new doctor and the __________________.</span> <span id="s1608">You were allowed no advertisement in those days.</span> <span id="s1609">Now you can advertise.</span> <span id="s1610">Only to introduce you, an introduction type of a thing.</span> <span id="s1611">Family practice, general practitioner and my picture.</span> <span id="s1612">I was suppose to open the office 1st of September.</span> <span id="s1613">The middle of August, after I left the other office, two days later, from the old office I worked from, my other doctor, there was a pharmacist next door to it.</span> <span id="s1614">The Chief Pharmacist, the owner, calls me.</span> <span id="s1615">Dr. Horn, I have many patients from this doctor's office, asking about what happened to you, where are you?</span> <span id="s1616">And I don't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1617">I said, how did you find me there?</span> <span id="s1618">Well, I have my ways.</span> <span id="s1619">I am here, am I?</span> <span id="s1620">I'm talking to you.</span> <span id="s1621">I found you, right?</span> <span id="s1622">I said, yes, you did.</span> <span id="s1623">I read in the paper.</span> <span id="s1624">You put ad in the paper, introductory?</span> <span id="s1625">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1626">So he says, I know where you are.</span> <span id="s1627">But what schedule, can I tell them?</span> <span id="s1628">I said, no, I don't think so because then he will accuse me of taking his patients away.</span> <span id="s1629">Look, but they are not going back to him.</span> <span id="s1630">They told me that.</span> <span id="s1631">They go to a different doctor.</span> <span id="s1632">Might as well to, they like you, they want to come stay with you.</span> <span id="s1633">I said, okay.</span> <span id="s1634">I didn't have no furniture yet.</span> <span id="s1635">I had one chair and my satchel bag.</span> <span id="s1636">That's all I had, one chair.</span> <span id="s1637">And like making house calls, you know, you don't need much, just you're bag.</span> <span id="s1638">Stethoscope, all you're little instruments you got there, you know, percussion hammer and tongue depressor and __________________, okay?</span> <span id="s1639">All those things I had, so I put the patient on the chair and I had my bag on the floor, that's how I started.</span> <span id="s1640">I had a big window there so mostly I looked through the window, looking at the traffic.</span> <span id="s1641">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s1642">The patient paid me.</span> <span id="s1643">I didn't have no stationary, nothing yet.</span> <span id="s1644">That's how it started.</span> <span id="s1645">Well making a long story short, in three months I was so busy I didn't know what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s1646">I was so overworked.</span> <span id="s1647">My colleague doctor, asked me to make __________________ for them, they are too busy making house calls.</span> <span id="s1648">So I'm making __________________ for them.</span> <span id="s1649">I had people pay a nursing homes, so Sundays and Wednesdays on my day off I was making calls at nursing homes.</span> <span id="s1650">Nights, I was delivering babies and at nights I was making house calls and so on.</span> <span id="s1651">People are in wheelchairs, they couldn't come to the office.</span> <span id="s1652">It was nothing urgent, of course.</span> <span id="s1653">I picked my times.</span> <span id="s1654">I will do it Wednesdays or Sundays or at night, you know, when I have time.</span> <span id="s1655">And they were grateful that I come in because their doctor would prescribe over the telephone.</span> <span id="s1656">I was taught never do that.</span> <span id="s1657">You make one mistake you will be regretting it and it was true.</span> <span id="s1658">I felt if they have no money to pay, that's fine.</span> <span id="s1659">But I have to make a house call to see them, to treat them.</span> <span id="s1660">I would not treat them over the phone.</span> <span id="s1661">Even if I knew the people, you don't know what's wrong over the phone, they talk a different story.</span> <span id="s1662">You cannot treat on the symptoms, you have to find out what's wrong with them.</span> <span id="s1663">And after three months, I was so busy, one day, who knocks on my door?</span> <span id="s1664">Uncle Sam.</span> <span id="s1665">IRS.</span> <span id="s1666">They want to see my books.</span> <span id="s1667">What happened?</span> <span id="s1668">I took a trip to Europe for six weeks and on the cruise I never felt how do rich people feel?</span> <span id="s1669">You go on a cruise?</span> <span id="s1670">I drove to New York, I had a new Oldsmobile, convertible.</span> <span id="s1671">I left the car in a parking garage there on a pier, they do this specially.</span> <span id="s1672">I boarded the ship, Gilda France, a new French boat.</span> <span id="s1673">If paradise were something as close as this was then we're in heaven.</span> <span id="s1674">And when I come back, my colleague said, Felix, you know, we thought you were a smart kid.</span> <span id="s1675">But you're stupid.</span> <span id="s1676">You work three months, you took off for six weeks, you destroyed everything you made it.</span> <span id="s1677">American people don't like that.</span> <span id="s1678">That's a __________________ on them.</span> <span id="s1679">I said, wait a minute, I didn't offend nobody.</span> <span id="s1680">I left another doctor, a colleague of mine, in the next building.</span> <span id="s1681">He was willing to see my patients and he didn't have nobody to cover for him so we cover each other now.</span> <span id="s1682">So he said, they are going to my colleague.</span> <span id="s1683">I said, I know __________________.</span> <span id="s1684">Well, I came back, you know what?</span> <span id="s1685">I could not cover all my patients, they call me, I was so busy.</span> <span id="s1686">Uncle Sam went through my books.</span> <span id="s1687">The only thing that cost me is my CPA, my accountant because he costs me $500.00 at a time, you had to take them out for dinner or lunch or something, it costs me $500.00, his time he spend with them going over my books.</span> <span id="s1688">And this only time was checked by IRS since 1950, forty-six years in this country.</span> <span id="s1689">I worked.</span> <span id="s1690">Every penny was accounted to it.</span> <span id="s1691">I am one of the biggest American patriots.</span> <span id="s1692">I am one of, on this block right here that you see, I'm the only European born, American citizen, a real patriot who has flag out.</span> <span id="s1693">And then he'll leave holidays, no.</span> <span id="s1694">But I've got to tell you, I was busy, I practice, you know.</span> <span id="s1695">My life was good to me.</span> <span id="s1696">I'm glad what I got I got on my own.</span> <span id="s1697">I have cherished memories of my wife's family, Uncle and every supportive to us.</span> <span id="s1698">They help me buy my first house.</span> <span id="s1699">They give me $5,000.00 on account of it.</span> <span id="s1700">I didn't want to take the money from them so they give us a loan and they said, listen, if it takes you a year, two, three, five to pay back, fine.</span> <span id="s1701">No interest charged.</span> <span id="s1702">They didn't charge me interest.</span> <span id="s1703">I didn't want it even, but with two kids, you know.</span> <span id="s1704">It was hard with kids to find apartments, so on.</span> <span id="s1705">So I buy a house.</span> <span id="s1706">That's the only house we owned.</span> <span id="s1707">That's the house we bought in 1960.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: This house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: This house, yeah.</span> <span id="s1710">We raised two kids here in this house.</span> <span id="s1711">And we believed that education was of utmost importance.</span> <span id="s1712">All of us, the whole family, even my daughter-in-law, son-in-law, all University graduates.</span> <span id="s1713">My son is a physician, he's a top notch specialist and he's an ophthalmologist, laser specialist.</span> <span id="s1714">My daughter, Northwestern University graduate cum laude.</span> <span id="s1715">Both my kids.</span> <span id="s1716">And my daughter-in-law is a Podiatrist.</span> <span id="s1717">My son-in-law is a Doctor of Philosophy, he's a Director, works for the State, Director of School Systems.</span> <span id="s1718">You know?</span> <span id="s1719">And we have four grandchildren now.</span> <span id="s1720">I'll be married now 54 years December, on the 13th of December, fifty-four years married to the same girl.</span> <span id="s1721">We are very happy, very happy family.</span> <span id="s1722">My kids are my best friends and I know I am their best friend.</span> <span id="s1723">And I achieved what I wanted to.</span> <span id="s1724">The only regret that I have, my parents.</span> <span id="s1725">They never lived to see it, you know?</span> <span id="s1726">That's still the problem.</span> <span id="s1727">And now, of course, hopefully we'll find maybe my wife's little brother.</span> <span id="s1728">We'll look for little brother, __________________ little brother.</span> <span id="s1729">He was with us.</span> <span id="s1730">We feel guilty because we let him go.</span> <span id="s1731">But when the streets, we had nothing, no place to go.</span> <span id="s1732">When you can be shot any minute and find us, anyone moving on the street at dark, you know, they are going to __________________ stop, no arrest.</span> <span id="s1733">They kill you.</span> <span id="s1734">There was no one below us on the street, you know, so we knew.</span> <span id="s1735">And this looked so prime, we wanted to go with him, but they wanted $1,000.00 per person from us.</span> <span id="s1736">We didn't have that money so we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1737">Do you believe that, that doesn't sound real.</span> <span id="s1738">And the only reason, how he went, because the person in charge there, a German SS or somebody, his mistress was my wife's girlfriend from school.</span> <span id="s1739">And she took him with her.</span> <span id="s1740">We knew that Sadie, she goes there.</span> <span id="s1741">We knew that's safe.</span> <span id="s1742">But everybody wanted to get in there.</span> <span id="s1743">Everybody went there.</span> <span id="s1744">If you had money you went there.</span> <span id="s1745">And people who had no money like us, they didn't accept us, so we didn't go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1747">Let's say for the record here that this story and all is in you're video, so if people ever want to go back and get the whole story, you and you're wife both tell it in you're video.</span> <span id="s1748">So I just wanted to put that on the record.</span> <span id="s1749">Let me ask you a couple of things.</span> <span id="s1750">Are you retired now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Well I retired from private practice already ten years, exactly two days ago, on the 15th of August, which was ten years I retired.</span> <span id="s1752">See, I was witnessing the transformation of American medicine since I started to what it is right now.</span> <span id="s1753">And I didn't see eye to eye wants going on.</span> <span id="s1754">And I have to live with that.</span> <span id="s1755">And I don't think I could stomach it.</span> <span id="s1756">I could not understand it.</span> <span id="s1757">I could not live with myself to, I was 26 years in practice, and I want to walk out with my head straight.</span> <span id="s1758">I don't want to lie to my patients.</span> <span id="s1759">If I had to lie to my patients, they cannot be hospitalized, or if they are in the hospital, to be kicked out of the hospital sooner than I would expect to, I had to lie to them, that they are ready to go.</span> <span id="s1760">Because officially, it's not the truth.</span> <span id="s1761">And I felt that sooner or later something is going to happen to them and I said, look, my son is married, he's in practice.</span> <span id="s1762">My daughter is married.</span> <span id="s1763">And so, it's only me and my wife, the two of us.</span> <span id="s1764">We have a home, a little home.</span> <span id="s1765">For the two of us, it's more than enough.</span> <span id="s1766">So, why should I?</span> <span id="s1767">In the meantime, some of my competitors, a young woman, spread the rumor that I want to sell the practice, to create a panic in my patients.</span> <span id="s1768">And I had no intention yet, at that time.</span> <span id="s1769">I was just toying with the idea, but one day a patient called me, he said, Dr. Horn, is it true you're selling you're practice?</span> <span id="s1770">You're quitting?</span> <span id="s1771">I said, who told you that?</span> <span id="s1772">Oh, Kathy, my neighbor goes to Dr. so-and-so and this doctor, a woman doctor, told her.</span> <span id="s1773">I said, no that's not true.</span> <span id="s1774">Let me find out why she say that.</span> <span id="s1775">And I approached this woman doctor and she denied it at first, but finally she admitted it.</span> <span id="s1776">She heard some patient said something, whatever, she wanted to buy my practice.</span> <span id="s1777">So you know, it gave me the idea, maybe it’s the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1778">And that's what crystallized, one night I talked to my wife, I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1779">What do we need it for?</span> <span id="s1780">By the time I get home to eat dinner, 11:00 at night.</span> <span id="s1781">I never see my kids growing up.</span> <span id="s1782">I was too busy.</span> <span id="s1783">I had to, I didn't have nobody else.</span> <span id="s1784">We had no parents, grandparents, nobody to take care of them.</span> <span id="s1785">We had three or four babysitters and my wife was a babysitter all the time because she was a homemaker full time.</span> <span id="s1786">Until the kids grew up, then she went to University also.</span> <span id="s1787">She will tell you her story herself.</span> <span id="s1788">Right here in Chicago, she graduated from the University.</span> <span id="s1789">When the kids were going to school, she asked her Mom, let me see you're grades.</span> <span id="s1790">I thought maybe it’s the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s1791">And I hit the jackpot.</span> <span id="s1792">Why?</span> <span id="s1793">I have heard the hospital.</span> <span id="s1794">I asked them, I'm ready to quit practice here.</span> <span id="s1795">A hospital use to buy practices.</span> <span id="s1796">They want to get the patients.</span> <span id="s1797">I belonged to two hospitals at that time.</span> <span id="s1798">One in Displanes (ph), Catholic Hospital, which always was good in Catholic surroundings.</span> <span id="s1799">And the other one, in City, was old.</span> <span id="s1800">You have to go to Northwest Hospital in the city.</span> <span id="s1801">We should have the best reputation, but resurrection to cover this hospital.</span> <span id="s1802">So I approached the hospital and they want to buy my practice.</span> <span id="s1803">Thinking that by this, there was some restrictions at that time with Media-care, they thought more patients would come and they would fill up the hospital so they can survive.</span> <span id="s1804">Because many hospitals closed up, they couldn't survive.</span> <span id="s1805">So they bought my practice and they sold everything.</span> <span id="s1806">They sold my practice, my equipment, my accounts receivable, my building.</span> <span id="s1807">American Telephone and Wire wanted to buy my clinic too.</span> <span id="s1808">Not for medical purposes, the location was something they needed.</span> <span id="s1809">The size of it's __________________.</span> <span id="s1810">But I said, I cannot sell the physical plan without the interior because all my money is in the records and so on.</span> <span id="s1811">My patients, you know?</span> <span id="s1812">So I didn't sell it to them, but the hospital bought it.</span> <span id="s1813">I did very well, invested some money and so on.</span> <span id="s1814">And I'm more comfortable.</span> <span id="s1815">After two months in being home, not doing nothing, my other hospital in the __________________ found out and I am one of the founders, the Holy Family Hospital in Desplains (ph).</span> <span id="s1816">To this dentist, my benefactor at the office, who, his family lived in Displanes (ph), he said, Dr. Horn, I will send you to the hospital and they will ask you for no money.</span> <span id="s1817">And it was true.</span> <span id="s1818">Jewish Hospital's want money from me.</span> <span id="s1819">They didn't care if I starve or not.</span> <span id="s1820">Catholic Hospital gave me an opportunity.</span> <span id="s1821">I became a step-member, without a penny.</span> <span id="s1822">And I am very, very dedicated to this hospital.</span> <span id="s1823">I've done a lot of free work for the hospital, for the poor.</span> <span id="s1824">Catholic charities.</span> <span id="s1825">Being Jewish, I admit who I am.</span> <span id="s1826">They all know about it.</span> <span id="s1827">Our Chairman of Private Practice, __________________, that's a Jewish doctor and there are not too many Jewish doctors in those days.</span> <span id="s1828">Now there are more.</span> <span id="s1829">I feel good there.</span> <span id="s1830">So I worked at Hospital.</span> <span id="s1831">So they found out.</span> <span id="s1832">They said, Felix, we have a clinic in Wheeling, it belongs to our hospital.</span> <span id="s1833">We lost one of our doctors, just decided to quit.</span> <span id="s1834">And we know you so we don't have to go trial and leave, you want to start tomorrow, you're welcome to.</span> <span id="s1835">Not only this, but we would appreciate if you could help us out.</span> <span id="s1836">I said, I don't know . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">End of Tape 2</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">Tape 3</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">A: . . . if I want to walk-in clinic.</span> <span id="s1840">I was use to my, the loyalty of my patients.</span> <span id="s1841">Walk-in clinic is like a clinic, people walk in with a chip on their shoulder, you don't know who they are, what they want.</span> <span id="s1842">Drug addicts and they want dope and all these things, you know?</span> <span id="s1843">I was not looking for work at this time, not in this stage of the game.</span> <span id="s1844">And now I was comfortable, financially and so on.</span> <span id="s1845">But I was, I missed the contact.</span> <span id="s1846">Human contact.</span> <span id="s1847">I missed it.</span> <span id="s1848">I never told my wife that, but I delivered 4,500 babies in family practice.</span> <span id="s1849">I have babies that grew up, that we were invited recently to their weddings, that I delivered.</span> <span id="s1850">And my mother told me once, Dr. Horn, we use to live with my daughter, she told me that if you ever live long enough and my daughter gets married and if you be invited to the wedding, you'll come.</span> <span id="s1851">Well the moment of truth is here.</span> <span id="s1852">She is getting married and we want you there.</span> <span id="s1853">We were there.</span> <span id="s1854">Let me tell you.</span> <span id="s1855">There's no money paid for the emotions for everything we went through.</span> <span id="s1856">Three hundred people.</span> <span id="s1857">The standing ovations.</span> <span id="s1858">I am met by some patients, friends of my former patients too.</span> <span id="s1859">That you know is worth it.</span> <span id="s1860">All those years and sleepless nights, no food.</span> <span id="s1861">Not food because you can have no time to eat many times.</span> <span id="s1862">And it was, money didn't mean that much.</span> <span id="s1863">But that retribution, that contribution in the human emotions, you know, what I got back for it paid me for everything, everything.</span> <span id="s1864">I am very grateful for that and that's my pay back.</span> <span id="s1865">And I said, that's okay, I'll go to the clinic.</span> <span id="s1866">But you know what?</span> <span id="s1867">I'll maybe work with a chip on my shoulder because I know something about clinics, you know?</span> <span id="s1868">But this is not clinic someplace in the South side here or so, its not in a suburb and so on, and you know what?</span> <span id="s1869">I liked that.</span> <span id="s1870">I liked it, I worked for five years.</span> <span id="s1871">They closed the clinic up for five years, there were five doctors there.</span> <span id="s1872">I recommend some of my colleagues to work there.</span> <span id="s1873">I was the only one they transferred to the Hospital proper, they opened the same thing in the Hospital.</span> <span id="s1874">And they let the other doctors go.</span> <span id="s1875">I'm still working there.</span> <span id="s1876">So I work on a part-time basis for the clinic.</span> <span id="s1877">In the meantime, the hospital needed somebody to do what we call utilization review.</span> <span id="s1878">Which is exactly what I touched up on before, in that we check on patients unjustly hospitalized, unnecessarily.</span> <span id="s1879">Meaning that they could have it done, the treatment, as out-patient.</span> <span id="s1880">X-ray of the stomach, you don't have to be in the hospital to have an x-ray of the stomach, but in old days you were hospitalized because insurance paid only if you were in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1881">Otherwise, they don't pay no x-rays.</span> <span id="s1882">So older people didn't want to go into hospital, that's why insurance companies knew, if this old lady wants to go to the hospital, I mean she's probably sick or she deserves that, right?</span> <span id="s1883">But today is different.</span> <span id="s1884">You might be very sick but as long as you can do it as an out-patient, they do as an out-patient.</span> <span id="s1885">So I am like a medical policeman now.</span> <span id="s1886">I am checking the records of other physicians, looking at the quality care issues.</span> <span id="s1887">Looking if they are justly hospitalized or if they are unnecessarily staying in the hospital after they did this job with their doctor.</span> <span id="s1888">It happens quite often.</span> <span id="s1889">Not to the fault of the hospital or the doctor, fault of the families.</span> <span id="s1890">It’s a big, legal type of a component involved here, that the family is using legal track as a blackmail.</span> <span id="s1891">Three daughters have a mother in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1892">The doctor discharged her, goes to nursing home.</span> <span id="s1893">They cannot decide which nursing home.</span> <span id="s1894">$600.00 a day costs the room.</span> <span id="s1895">She could be in a nursing home already, the hospital will give you 24 hours to decide which home.</span> <span id="s1896">But one says one home, the other one wants the other home.</span> <span id="s1897">Meanwhile it's four days already, nothing done for the patient.</span> <span id="s1898">And Medi-care doesn't pay for the bill because nothing has been done.</span> <span id="s1899">The hospital is loosing money.</span> <span id="s1900">So we enter here, talk to the family.</span> <span id="s1901">Look, we're sorry, you have to take you're mother to, otherwise you are liable for the bill now, from that day on, nothing done for you're mother because you argue which nursing home you want to take.</span> <span id="s1902">What's you're decision?</span> <span id="s1903">The day will come, I know, the girl is going to tell them which nursing home to go to.</span> <span id="s1904">Now you have a choice here.</span> <span id="s1905">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1906">One day her death.</span> <span id="s1907">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1908">We're going to talk to my attorney, talking to my lawyer.</span> <span id="s1909">Say look, I am in a official government position here, this medical position, and I am not afraid of a lawyer.</span> <span id="s1910">I don't do nothing illegal.</span> <span id="s1911">You do something illegal.</span> <span id="s1912">You demand something which doesn't belong to you no more.</span> <span id="s1913">You're spending government's money.</span> <span id="s1914">There are taxpayers money being paid for you're mother, that she could be in a nursing home that costs a fraction of it.</span> <span id="s1915">But Medi-care is going to pay for extra months at least.</span> <span id="s1916">And this kind of a thing, you know, you got a lot of hostility, confrontation type of situations with people.</span> <span id="s1917">But that's part of life.</span> <span id="s1918">I get use to it.</span> <span id="s1919">It's a job and I think I'm doing the right thing.</span> <span id="s1920">I do not like what's going on.</span> <span id="s1921">Even when I do that, doesn't mean I approve it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1923">We can, after we're done with this interview, we can have our own private discussion, the way the health care system is going.</span> <span id="s1924">I want to ask you some other things, just based on you're experience.</span> <span id="s1925">You had two children in the '50's and now they are grown, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1926">And you are, you and you're wife are both survivors of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1927">I'm wondering when and how did you first talk about that with you're children?</span> <span id="s1928">How did it come up?</span> <span id="s1929">How did they learn you're story?</span> <span id="s1930">What, how do you feel that you're relationship with you're children, how did that effect it, if it did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: When we moved to Chicago it was about 1960.</span> <span id="s1932">We moved to Chicago, my son was eight years old at that time.</span> <span id="s1933">We moved to this house.</span> <span id="s1934">He made friends with a little boy across the street, across the alley.</span> <span id="s1935">We don't know, an alley actually, but it use to be an alley there.</span> <span id="s1936">Sunday they were playing together.</span> <span id="s1937">The same age and they are friends until today, all those years.</span> <span id="s1938">One is in a different city right now, but anyway, we were friends.</span> <span id="s1939">We cling to people easily because, I don't know, maybe we are more extrovert.</span> <span id="s1940">Is it because of the war?</span> <span id="s1941">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1942">I constantly say to myself, how would I be if not for the war?</span> <span id="s1943">But one episode stuck to my mind.</span> <span id="s1944">That one Sunday afternoon, maybe 4 or 5 PM, his name was Mickey, the little boy was Mickey.</span> <span id="s1945">His parents, American-Polish decent, American born.</span> <span id="s1946">They were playing.</span> <span id="s1947">All of a sudden, my boy, eight years old, comes and started crying.</span> <span id="s1948">I said, why are you crying?</span> <span id="s1949">What happened?</span> <span id="s1950">Sunday, I was home.</span> <span id="s1951">I play with Mickey.</span> <span id="s1952">So what happened?</span> <span id="s1953">Did he hit you?</span> <span id="s1954">No, he didn't hit me.</span> <span id="s1955">Well, why are you crying?</span> <span id="s1956">Well he had to go away, he says.</span> <span id="s1957">Why are you crying?</span> <span id="s1958">He had to go away, where is he going?</span> <span id="s1959">He's going to his grandpa.</span> <span id="s1960">For dinner.</span> <span id="s1961">His parents, his two sisters and him are going.</span> <span id="s1962">And I want to go to grandpa for dinner too.</span> <span id="s1963">I said, well, you cannot go to his grandpa because you don't know them and they don't know you.</span> <span id="s1964">You don't expect to be invited.</span> <span id="s1965">He was an eight year old kid, pretty smart and understands someone.</span> <span id="s1966">He says, where's my grandpa?</span> <span id="s1967">That's how it started.</span> <span id="s1968">Until then he never asked for it.</span> <span id="s1969">I would never talk to him about it.</span> <span id="s1970">And that's how it started.</span> <span id="s1971">So I told him that we have some pictures of my grandfather and you're grandfather, you're Mom's father.</span> <span id="s1972">And we have pictures of the grandparents, my parents and her parents.</span> <span id="s1973">The only picture I don't have is my sister's.</span> <span id="s1974">Didn't have it.</span> <span id="s1975">So I show him the pictures and he asked what happened.</span> <span id="s1976">He couldn't understand, what mean Nazis and so on.</span> <span id="s1977">But I told him they perished during the war, they were killed by mean people, German people, Nazis, by Nazis.</span> <span id="s1978">He asked what are Nazis?</span> <span id="s1979">So I told him, but he did not comprehend too much of it, you know?</span> <span id="s1980">But he knew they were dead, he knew what death means, being, going to the funerals and so on.</span> <span id="s1981">So he more or less was satisfied for a while only.</span> <span id="s1982">But this was coming up more often than, again, ask the same question, why can't I see my Aunt or my grandma?</span> <span id="s1983">And I said, well, they are not alive no more.</span> <span id="s1984">Where is this, which cemetery are they buried?</span> <span id="s1985">I said, well, there's no cemetery.</span> <span id="s1986">He says, what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1987">How do you be dead and not be buried?</span> <span id="s1988">So how are you going to explain to a youngster like this, you perish and you have no place to worship the grave.</span> <span id="s1989">So I told him that in those days there were mean people in Germany.</span> <span id="s1990">They tried to kill all the Jews and they killed my parents and you're Mom's parents and my sister and they didn't bury them they burned them to ashes.</span> <span id="s1991">And what they made out of ashes were different things, fabrics, and they made soap and so on.</span> <span id="s1992">And he couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s1993">And this would go on for many, a few years until he was maybe, 14, 13 or 14, that's what really penetrated what happened.</span> <span id="s1994">But interesting, since that time, when we made our testimony at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, my son and my daughter all have their own copies.</span> <span id="s1995">We have one.</span> <span id="s1996">My son has three copies.</span> <span id="s1997">My daughter, they had three volumes.</span> <span id="s1998">And they didn't want to talk about it no more.</span> <span id="s1999">But he became such an anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s2000">He just, it's had that influence on him, that injustice was done to his grandparents, that he never met, that he missed in his youth, you know?</span> <span id="s2001">Because the happiness is, if Mom don't want to give it, ask you're grandma.</span> <span id="s2002">There's some, even T-shirts, seeing the writing on the, on that.</span> <span id="s2003">If you're parents are too strict with you, you're grandparents always allow you to do what you want to do.</span> <span id="s2004">And he always felt that he missed something on it, you know, he missed out.</span> <span id="s2005">But then he would never talk about it, he never wanted to touch the subject at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: When did he stop talking about it with you?</span> <span id="s2007">When he was younger or recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s2009">We didn't talk about the subject since he was about 14, 15, I would say.</span> <span id="s2010">He knew all about it, since that time he is quite acquainted, politically orientated with what he knows all about, he knows Holocaust, and he was in Washington.</span> <span id="s2011">And my daughter was recently again with my wife in Holocaust Museum, so they are acquainted.</span> <span id="s2012">He does not want to discuss it.</span> <span id="s2013">He refused to talk about it because he has, he tells me, I said why don't you want to talk about it?</span> <span id="s2014">I, as a victim of the system, I feel strong enough to face up, to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2015">I break down here and there if I talk about some things.</span> <span id="s2016">Mainly if I talk about my parents.</span> <span id="s2017">Unbelievable relationship I had with my parents, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2018">But I think we have the same relationship, with me and my children.</span> <span id="s2019">And he's said, you know Dad, I'll look at those tapes after you have passed away.</span> <span id="s2020">I won't touch them as long as you're with us, I don't want to look at it.</span> <span id="s2021">I want to enjoy every minute of it, at present.</span> <span id="s2022">And all of a sudden, on his own initiative, he elected to have a father/son once a month dinner.</span> <span id="s2023">Father/son only.</span> <span id="s2024">Me and him going after work or some meeting, together, without his family, without my family, only me and him.</span> <span id="s2025">I think what triggered the whole thing is one of my personal friends recently passed away, also a survivor, from Germany, a German Jew.</span> <span id="s2026">And his son is my son's best friends.</span> <span id="s2027">And the trauma that his friend, the son of my friend, went through made my son realize how fragile is life.</span> <span id="s2028">Don't take it for granted.</span> <span id="s2029">We're here today, and don't know how long.</span> <span id="s2030">And he wanted to enjoy my presence, our presence, as long as he lives.</span> <span id="s2031">He doesn't want to tarnish anything with any bad memories, anything, what will come up with the discussions and so on.</span> <span id="s2032">He knows the history.</span> <span id="s2033">He knows the story of our survival.</span> <span id="s2034">He has the tapes in his possession.</span> <span id="s2035">So sooner or later, he is just delaying the truth.</span> <span id="s2036">Although he knows the truth, but he's not ready to face up to it.</span> <span id="s2037">And I am not pushing it.</span> <span id="s2038">I don't know if I am right or wrong, but I think it would be wrong trying to push something that he's not ready to accept right now.</span> <span id="s2039">He knows the truth, he knows that.</span> <span id="s2040">And he knows what he lost in his childhood by missing his grandparents.</span> <span id="s2041">Nobody came back.</span> <span id="s2042">There's no way we can replace it.</span> <span id="s2043">I miss it too.</span> <span id="s2044">More, because it was not my grandparents, I miss my parents.</span> <span id="s2045">I was 17 when I lost them.</span> <span id="s2046">I was not ready for an independent life.</span> <span id="s2047">And he knows that, so he's fortunate, he's older.</span> <span id="s2048">He is now 43, 44.</span> <span id="s2049">He's an adult man.</span> <span id="s2050">But he doesn't want to face up to it.</span> <span id="s2051">And I'm not going to disturb that kind of a status quo.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2053">You know, I've read some in the past, some books of, sort of biographies of Holocaust survivors and families.</span> <span id="s2054">And in some families the situation has resulted in some forms of tension, you know, where the children feel an extra burden towards their parents.</span> <span id="s2055">And in some cases, the parents, because of all they've lost, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: How would you explain this?</span> <span id="s2057">I mean, I am at a loss to understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Well, you know, every family is different and different people react in different ways.</span> <span id="s2059">When people interact, anything can happen really.</span> <span id="s2060">It sounds like, from what you're describing, this is, nothing like this has ever come up here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">A: No, never.</span> <span id="s2062">As a matter of fact, I did expect maybe there would be pity or a little sorrow with what I had to go through.</span> <span id="s2063">My children, our children, consider us heroes.</span> <span id="s2064">And I told them, I'm not a hero.</span> <span id="s2065">Whatever I did to survive was not deliberate.</span> <span id="s2066">It was pure accidental, fate, you name it, whatever you want to.</span> <span id="s2067">I didn't deserve any price for something that I didn't deserve.</span> <span id="s2068">I didn't.</span> <span id="s2069">I'm here, but not because I done something about it.</span> <span id="s2070">Maybe if I used common sense and logic, maybe I wouldn't be here today.</span> <span id="s2071">Maybe it was spontaneous and reflexive, I would say.</span> <span id="s2072">A reflex, you know?</span> <span id="s2073">Jump instead of stand or sit or so, whatever.</span> <span id="s2074">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2075">But my kids always, and my personal friends, American friends, my colleague doctor in the hospital, they are full of admiration for me.</span> <span id="s2076">I still, this disturbs me, I don't know why.</span> <span id="s2077">I didn't do nothing to deserve this thing.</span> <span id="s2078">I am here and I am a very fortunate person.</span> <span id="s2079">I am here because I cherished life.</span> <span id="s2080">My whole family since early, youth will all cherish life and want to make the best out of it.</span> <span id="s2081">We try not to waste our life on ridiculous things.</span> <span id="s2082">On something that my, life is short.</span> <span id="s2083">Or even if its long, its not long enough.</span> <span id="s2084">And if you waste you're time in life and do certain things that you might regret, you cannot turn the clock back again.</span> <span id="s2085">So there was one thing that I got from my parents, from my father, he was a strict disciplinarian.</span> <span id="s2086">And I always respect him for it.</span> <span id="s2087">And I was penalized many times when I was a kid.</span> <span id="s2088">I never held it against him because I always deserved it.</span> <span id="s2089">Whatever I got I deserved it.</span> <span id="s2090">He loved me in his own way and I knew this was love, that's why he disciplined me and so on.</span> <span id="s2091">I never complained.</span> <span id="s2092">I took it like a man.</span> <span id="s2093">And I cried when I was little.</span> <span id="s2094">I cried but I never complained.</span> <span id="s2095">And I think it made me more mature, a little harder person maybe, more understanding of other people.</span> <span id="s2096">It taught me fairness, straightforwardness, honesty.</span> <span id="s2097">And direct, going right directly in front of you.</span> <span id="s2098">I never, I always believe, there's no such a thing, I was taught by my Dad, that you cannot achieve in you're life if you badly wanted to.</span> <span id="s2099">If you badly want to do something in you're life, be something you want to be, you have to make that effort.</span> <span id="s2100">Nobody is going to give it to you.</span> <span id="s2101">You get all assistance, help, etcetera, yes, but you have to do it yourself.</span> <span id="s2102">Don't expect nobody to give it to you.</span> <span id="s2103">And always remember to be responsible for your own actions.</span> <span id="s2104">That's your responsibility, don't blame nobody else for your problems.</span> <span id="s2105">You cook your own dinner, you make your own life.</span> <span id="s2106">You go to sleep the way you make your bed.</span> <span id="s2107">That's what I've always taught him, that's so true.</span> <span id="s2108">I still believe today, that's what I tried to instill in my children, the same type of a thing.</span> <span id="s2109">And I have no regrets.</span> <span id="s2110">I think I am a very fortunate man.</span> <span id="s2111">I am a very happy man.</span> <span id="s2112">I love life.</span> <span id="s2113">I like my people, an extrovert.</span> <span id="s2114">I have countless number of friends, all over the world, and I mean literally.</span> <span id="s2115">Literally, from all over.</span> <span id="s2116">Australia, South America, you name it, Canada, Europe, all over Europe, Sweden, Italy, Spain.</span> <span id="s2117">All over England, we have friends all over Paris, we're going to Paris right now to visit of a young widow, our personal friends.</span> <span id="s2118">I mean, it's just like a sister to me.</span> <span id="s2119">So we create our own families.</span> <span id="s2120">That's sort of like a spontaneous, physiological type of a reflex.</span> <span id="s2121">You don't have a family, you make your own family.</span> <span id="s2122">Many of the kids of our friends call me Uncle Felix.</span> <span id="s2123">Some call me Papa.</span> <span id="s2124">Some grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2125">And I love it.</span> <span id="s2126">That's, my kids call my friends the same way because that's how they grew up here, because there was nobody else.</span> <span id="s2127">We create our own family.</span> <span id="s2128">Not by law, by our physiological needs.</span> <span id="s2129">And that can replace, it didn't replace really, but at least it did done something to replace our lost ones, you know?</span> <span id="s2130">So many of my friends, American born, don't understand it.</span> <span id="s2131">They ask me, my colleague _________, he ask me, Felix, tell me, I'm American born, three or four generation.</span> <span id="s2132">Where did I go wrong?</span> <span id="s2133">I have four sons and nothing but grief.</span> <span id="s2134">I try to do my best and I think I'm a good parent.</span> <span id="s2135">My wife is a good mother, and so on.</span> <span id="s2136">They didn't have to worry about nothing, and so on.</span> <span id="s2137">And nothing but grief.</span> <span id="s2138">Breaking the law, among other things, you know, I won't go into detail, but tell me one thing?</span> <span id="s2139">What is it?</span> <span id="s2140">Where did I go wrong?</span> <span id="s2141">What is it?</span> <span id="s2142">You came here with nothing, with nobody, no language, no family, no money, nobody.</span> <span id="s2143">Look at you're kids, University graduates.</span> <span id="s2144">And, in the meantime there are a few other doctors, other Jewish doctors, also came from Israel and refugees and so on, look at this.</span> <span id="s2145">They are all, the kids are educated, they are not wealthy people at all.</span> <span id="s2146">But, what is it?</span> <span id="s2147">What do you have that we don't have?</span> <span id="s2148">I don't know what to tell them.</span> <span id="s2149">I thought for a moment maybe that's why the anti-Semitism in some countries is, because of that.</span> <span id="s2150">In Germany, the professional is, the Jewish professionals is the lawyers, the bankers, the doctors and so on.</span> <span id="s2151">Musicians, poets, literary.</span> <span id="s2152">I mean, people just, was it jealousy?</span> <span id="s2153">Was it competitiveness?</span> <span id="s2154">What is it?</span> <span id="s2155">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2156">But it appears to be a certain type of a dislike to that person.</span> <span id="s2157">And that because they are different, different because of religion, they're Jews.</span> <span id="s2158">That's probably contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism, out of other factors of course, the economies and so on.</span> <span id="s2159">And historically, of course, you know, what else is new?</span> <span id="s2160">This goes back into time of Jesus, so I told him I don't know what to tell you.</span> <span id="s2161">Maybe I, of course, maybe its from generation to generation.</span> <span id="s2162">I instill my children what I was taught by my parents.</span> <span id="s2163">I don't know where you fail?</span> <span id="s2164">Maybe if I've got the whole life story in front of me in front of you, or you're parents yet, when you grow up, maybe there was something missing there.</span> <span id="s2165">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2166">I am not a psychologist and I don't understand it myself.</span> <span id="s2167">I'm a simple person.</span> <span id="s2168">I am a professional man, in my line of business, I know what I'm doing, and so on.</span> <span id="s2169">But this is beyond my way of thinking.</span> <span id="s2170">I cannot explain it, I'm not a psychologist.</span> <span id="s2171">But there's something there, maybe genetically, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2172">Now we're coming back everyday reading about those genes here and there so who knows?</span> <span id="s2173">Maybe they come to it and drug addicts have some defective gene too, I don't know.</span> <span id="s2174">Coming back now to many Alzheimer's, is not something that you did yourself but its part of our physiology, something breaks down and __________________.</span> <span id="s2175">But as long as it lasts my life is beautiful.</span> <span id="s2176">I am very happy.</span> <span id="s2177">I do my little part, what I can.</span> <span id="s2178">I do go places, Universities, I talk.</span> <span id="s2179">This summer, I spent most of the summer at Aurora University out of Chicago talking to young students about my life story.</span> <span id="s2180">I am not an expert on Holocaust but I am a victim of the Holocaust and I have the right to tell my story if I want to, if someone wants to listen to it.</span> <span id="s2181">I won't force myself on nobody.</span> <span id="s2182">I was invited by the History Department.</span> <span id="s2183">I have faced up to a hostile audience, African-American, most of them.</span> <span id="s2184">Maybe 60 or 70 percent, the rest were white.</span> <span id="s2185">19, 21, 22 years old.</span> <span id="s2186">Who told me why should, one of the young ladies, African-American lady, that upset me, why should I believe your story?</span> <span id="s2187">Because you say so?</span> <span id="s2188">I said, no.</span> <span id="s2189">First of all, no one forced me to come here and I didn't force you to come here either.</span> <span id="s2190">You do believe me or you don't believe me.</span> <span id="s2191">I cannot convince you of it.</span> <span id="s2192">You don't even have a number, she said.</span> <span id="s2193">I said, see it proves how little you know about the Second World War.</span> <span id="s2194">How much you know about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2195">That's why I'm here, to maybe enlighten you a little bit.</span> <span id="s2196">I was never in concentration camp to be there long enough to have a number.</span> <span id="s2197">I was only one night, one concentration camp.</span> <span id="s2198">They took me to work.</span> <span id="s2199">I escape right away, like a rabbit.</span> <span id="s2200">I had no number on it.</span> <span id="s2201">Well, maybe you're lying.</span> <span id="s2202">I said, well the only thing you can take is my word for it.</span> <span id="s2203">If you ask my family tree is very short.</span> <span id="s2204">Because I am the only one alive, the oldest one is me.</span> <span id="s2205">Next is my wife and my children.</span> <span id="s2206">I don't know grandparents.</span> <span id="s2207">My wife has no grandparents.</span> <span id="s2208">No sisters, no brothers.</span> <span id="s2209">Maybe you never had it.</span> <span id="s2210">Well, are you going to deny everything?</span> <span id="s2211">You denied it at the __________________.</span> <span id="s2212">I said, if I will tell you, wait a minute I said, if I would tell you that slavery never existed.</span> <span id="s2213">Now wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2214">Did you live at that time when slavery was there?</span> <span id="s2215">You are only 19 or 20 years old.</span> <span id="s2216">So you didn't live in those days, did you?</span> <span id="s2217">So you expect me to take you're word for it?</span> <span id="s2218">Well, it's in all the books.</span> <span id="s2219">I said, so is the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2220">We have pictures of the General Eisenhower's army, from the concentration camps, the corpses lined up, piled up and so on.</span> <span id="s2221">You think this is . . . Well that's something you say that's a Jewish publication.</span> <span id="s2222">I said, you believe that Jews manufactured all those things?</span> <span id="s2223">You think they would have to do it?</span> <span id="s2224">See?</span> <span id="s2225">You are skeptical?</span> <span id="s2226">I am skeptical too.</span> <span id="s2227">There was never a slavery.</span> <span id="s2228">Oh, no way.</span> <span id="s2229">Sure there was.</span> <span id="s2230">I said, so was Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2231">Take it or leave it.</span> <span id="s2232">But if you listen to Farrakhan all the time, you find out that you're brains is going to brainwashed.</span> <span id="s2233">But if you listen to people like me, not only to me, other people like me, we don't know each other even.</span> <span id="s2234">I would tell a similar story.</span> <span id="s2235">Different in certain ways because each one survived in different ways, different location, different nationality and so on.</span> <span id="s2236">But it is true.</span> <span id="s2237">If you don't want to accept it, I am not here to penalize you, convince you that it’s the truth.</span> <span id="s2238">If I tell me __________________, it is the truth.</span> <span id="s2239">This was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">Q: When was this talk or class?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Aurora University, last summer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: Last summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2244">As a matter of fact, they asked me if I come this summer again but I got more work to do now so I have less time, but her name is, the teacher or the professor's name is Palmer.</span> <span id="s2245">She talked to me.</span> <span id="s2246">What happened is there was an exhibit of a Warsaw ghetto exhibit at University of Aurora.</span> <span id="s2247">I was commissioned by one of the sculptors, which is Cop-sure-a-etchie (ph), a woman from Evison (ph), American-born, who is doing the exhibit on Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2248">Well the debris and breaks and the barb wire and so on.</span> <span id="s2249">And she wanted someone to tell the story of the background of it, the train, the sound of the trains and the cars taking people, the cattle cars taking them to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2250">And if you heard about the Rig-la-baum (ph), a diary in Warsaw?</span> <span id="s2251">He was an activist who was writing day by day occurrences in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2252">And he finally buried all his manuscripts in milk cans, three milk cans.</span> <span id="s2253">Two of them were recovered, one is missing.</span> <span id="s2254">And she wanted me to read from his archive, this story from day to day, what transpired at Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2255">So I ask her, why me?</span> <span id="s2256">You can have any of the theatre people, you know, actors with their diction and so on to do this.</span> <span id="s2257">An exceptional job.</span> <span id="s2258">She said, no.</span> <span id="s2259">I want the authentic thing, you were there.</span> <span id="s2260">And I was in Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2261">You were there.</span> <span id="s2262">You were a witness of it.</span> <span id="s2263">I want you're accent because its authentic.</span> <span id="s2264">I don't want a good voice.</span> <span id="s2265">So she wanted this.</span> <span id="s2266">So I went there.</span> <span id="s2267">So I taped this thing and I had to see it and listen to my own voice then.</span> <span id="s2268">It was really impressive, I say that the whole exhibit.</span> <span id="s2269">And the history class was coming to visit and this Miss Palmer met me there and we talked about it.</span> <span id="s2270">Signed your name, and so on.</span> <span id="s2271">And it says, the title of it, the exhibit, and then voice by Felix Horn, survivor of Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s2272">So she was fascinated with it, she contacted me here and I made several trips there.</span> <span id="s2273">And I told her one more time I will be glad to do it again, but right now . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">Q: I'm curious about that whole encounter you talk about with the young woman who didn't believe the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2275">I'm wondering how, when something like that happens, when that's over, how that makes you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: There were other discussions with other people and very little input from the Black students.</span> <span id="s2277">More input from the white students.</span> <span id="s2278">There was input from a white man who was standing by, joined the whole thing, nothing to do with the school, nothing to do with me, I never met him before.</span> <span id="s2279">Turned out that he was a Polish, not Jewish, victim of Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2280">He was released from one of the, liberated from one of the concentration camps as a Polish laborer.</span> <span id="s2281">He lost his whole family.</span> <span id="s2282">His father was official, some official in Polish government, first one to go.</span> <span id="s2283">The Germans first took the dangerous people, who are people with Army, officers, you know?</span> <span id="s2284">Lawyers and so on.</span> <span id="s2285">Intelligencia (ph), you know?</span> <span id="s2286">And he was there and listening to this whole discussion and he raised his hand.</span> <span id="s2287">I didn't know who the guy was.</span> <span id="s2288">I found out later about his background.</span> <span id="s2289">And he said, I listen to the whole story.</span> <span id="s2290">I don't know this gentleman, pointing at me, but my name is so-and-so and I live now in Aurora.</span> <span id="s2291">I live only few blocks away from the University.</span> <span id="s2292">He introduced him, who he was.</span> <span id="s2293">He was a retired man, he worked at one of the factories there, a factory man.</span> <span id="s2294">And he had a number on the arm and he is missing some of the toes.</span> <span id="s2295">He was beaten in the concentration camp by the Germans, he was not working enough and so on.</span> <span id="s2296">He was beaten and he lost his shoes, well not shoes, they were woolen type of a thing, with a pipe.</span> <span id="s2297">They smashed his toes and then given no medical treatment.</span> <span id="s2298">They became gangrenous and fell off completely.</span> <span id="s2299">And then the inmates treated him a little bit, secretly and so on, he saved the foot actually.</span> <span id="s2300">But he said, I don't know the man from Adam, but you don't have to believe me either.</span> <span id="s2301">Just because I have a number doesn't mean nothing.</span> <span id="s2302">My father didn't have a number.</span> <span id="s2303">He's dead.</span> <span id="s2304">By the Germans, by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2305">My brother didn't have a number, he was shot by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s2306">You will see his corpse, you say well he died natural death?</span> <span id="s2307">Or somebody robbed him maybe?</span> <span id="s2308">Well, that's not true.</span> <span id="s2309">But no one is going to force you to believe it.</span> <span id="s2310">If you don't want to believe it you never will believe it.</span> <span id="s2311">But the day will come, you'll find out, it is the truth.</span> <span id="s2312">Just like Dr. Horn said about the slavery.</span> <span id="s2313">We all know it was true.</span> <span id="s2314">There was slavery, of course there was.</span> <span id="s2315">But see, amazing that you who didn't live in the days of slavery insist there was slavery.</span> <span id="s2316">And here you're confronting a person who lived through the Holocaust, my contemporary, right?</span> <span id="s2317">He don't believe me, that I am there.</span> <span id="s2318">And this was a dilemma.</span> <span id="s2319">And I don't know how much I convince . . . [End of Side 1 of Tape 3]. . . her of course, but I think the teacher, the professor, Palmer, was very impressed with this.</span> <span id="s2320">She called me many times.</span> <span id="s2321">She was very impressed.</span> <span id="s2322">Just because she had __________________ type of a confrontation.</span> <span id="s2323">A person was there.</span> <span id="s2324">Which was, eventually, the younger people when they look at the videos and that's all.</span> <span id="s2325">Look at our faces, our voices.</span> <span id="s2326">But they'll be computers or so, but they are not human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">Q: Let me ask you one thing, I was just thinking about where we are.</span> <span id="s2328">You're in Lincolnwood, which is as far as I know a few blocks from Skokie, basically?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: A lot of Jewish people here and a lot of Holocaust survivors here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2332">The first march against the Nazis was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: Well I was going to bring that up.</span> <span id="s2334">In the late 1970's when the Nazis were trying to march here, you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2336">Correct.</span> <span id="s2337">I was here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">A: I didn't face up to it.</span> <span id="s2340">We didn't know nothing about it until later.</span> <span id="s2341">As a matter of fact, the leader of this Nazi was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2342">You know about that I'm sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">Q: Well you know, I'm not from this area, so I didn't know.</span> <span id="s2344">I think I remember this vaguely that he is like part Jewish or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Part Jewish, right.</span> <span id="s2346">His father was Jewish, not his mother.</span> <span id="s2347">According to the Jewish laws, if the mother is not Jewish you're not Jewish.</span> <span id="s2348">But there was a passport of his father, passport, he went to Israel then, it was in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2349">I mean, it was Palestine at that time, it was a Hebrew in English.</span> <span id="s2350">And __________________ his faith was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2351">So his father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s2352">He was very antagonistic, that leader of the Nazi, when people found out his father was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s2354">So my question is, I mean, here you are living in this area.</span> <span id="s2355">It's, by then it is 30-some years after the war.</span> <span id="s2356">You've made this whole life.</span> <span id="s2357">You had these horrible early experiences.</span> <span id="s2358">Here you are in a suburb of Chicago and you have these people parading around in Nazi uniforms and whatever.</span> <span id="s2359">I'm just curious what that must have stirred up, even if just the memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">A: Yes, no question about it.</span> <span id="s2361">At first, I couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s2362">I was aware of it.</span> <span id="s2363">In Canada there is an anti-hate law.</span> <span id="s2364">I couldn't understand why we don't have that kind of a law in this country.</span> <span id="s2365">That freedom of speech, that's fine.</span> <span id="s2366">That's a beautiful thing.</span> <span id="s2367">But there has to be a limit to freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s2368">If you have freedom of speech, well, it can lead to hate, lead to crime.</span> <span id="s2369">Like burning the churches right now, the black churches.</span> <span id="s2370">I don't want that freedom of speech if people can face up to me and hate me and talk to me in derogatory remarks and so on and being the same thing, what I remember now as younger.</span> <span id="s2371">I feel, that's the country I came for?</span> <span id="s2372">To me this is, until today this is very hard to swallow.</span> <span id="s2373">I understand it but it's hard to swallow.</span> <span id="s2374">Because Canada, it matters too, they do have an anti-crime, anti-hate law.</span> <span id="s2375">Even Germany, the birth of National Socialism, has anti-crime.</span> <span id="s2376">We have, this guy I forgot his name, it starts with "L", American, printing the Neo-Nazi literature, here.</span> <span id="s2377">He can do it freely without any punishment.</span> <span id="s2378">Bring it to Germany, he is arrested over there for breaking the law.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">Other: Hello?</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Hi.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: And to me this is beyond understanding.</span> <span id="s2382">Until today, I am not in total agreement with the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2383">I don't know what to do about it.</span> <span id="s2384">But I feel that freedom of speech is very important, yes, but not to __________________ the situation.</span> <span id="s2385">By leading to total chaos and __________________.</span> <span id="s2386">Of course, you have a right to do those things.</span> <span id="s2387">By the right gives you the right providing you do things that doesn't hurt nobody else.</span> <span id="s2388">You're right to express yourself, yes.</span> <span id="s2389">Peacefully.</span> <span id="s2390">Not to kill someone, not to cause a riot or something like this.</span> <span id="s2391">Marching, you can peacefully pass through or convince legislators to pass laws that you believe in and maybe I don't, if you can go through that, that is the way, that's all right, that's fine.</span> <span id="s2392">But to hate, slander and so on, or a Neo-Nazi march, I don't believe that they deserve that privilege.</span> <span id="s2393">I mean, freedom of speech.</span> <span id="s2394">I feel that we are reaching, that America living today is not the same country that I came to.</span> <span id="s2395">It's different.</span> <span id="s2396">And I guess I need to get use to it but I'm not talking about the crime now, that things were not present at that time, drugs and so on.</span> <span id="s2397">I'm talking about the political innovations and change of climates and so on.</span> <span id="s2398">And I feel those things, people are misinterpreting the Constitution.</span> <span id="s2399">They use the Constitution for their own personal beliefs and they bend the Constitution they way they want to.</span> <span id="s2400">They convince our lawmakers of bending it too.</span> <span id="s2401">Talking about separation of church and state and so on.</span> <span id="s2402">But people now try to bend it and so on because they live in the country where the Pilgrims and so on what to escape execution and so on.</span> <span id="s2403">So they do understand, that's why we have this separation, because where they came from there was no separation, that's why they had to leave the country.</span> <span id="s2404">They were persecuted.</span> <span id="s2405">Here in this country we don't support the working, believe what you want to believe, as long as you don't go and kill somebody, don't hurt somebody else.</span> <span id="s2406">You can believe whatever you want to as long as you do no harm to somebody else.</span> <span id="s2407">To children particularly.</span> <span id="s2408">Even if you teach or preach certain dogmas, that's hurting the children.</span> <span id="s2409">I feel that our Constitution is abused by a certain group of people.</span> <span id="s2410">And you will find always those groups of people who find people who fund it and the money talks, you know?</span> <span id="s2411">Who really have a purpose in the whole thing, quietly and so on.</span> <span id="s2412">And they undermine our Democracy.</span> <span id="s2413">I'm worrying about it.</span> <span id="s2414">I am.</span> <span id="s2415">I worry about my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2416">How safe are they in this country now?</span> <span id="s2417">And will they be as safe as I was when I was a kid?</span> <span id="s2418">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2419">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s2420">Even my daughter, wanting to be a veterinarian, and I was told not in certain terms.</span> <span id="s2421">If you're not a farmer who donate money to the vet school and if you are not a born American, forget about it.</span> <span id="s2422">And then they didn't want to tell me if you're a Jew, just don't bother.</span> <span id="s2423">See?</span> <span id="s2424">But this was the life, true life was in those days.</span> <span id="s2425">But not that our government, our country believed in and promoted it.</span> <span id="s2426">But the people did.</span> <span id="s2427">I was amazed with the amount of anti-Semitism in this country.</span> <span id="s2428">Amazed how much.</span> <span id="s2429">This little village, before my arrival here and right after the Second World War, there were signs on the front lawn, dogs and Jews not permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: When you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: When I came here, right.</span> <span id="s2432">The owner of Lincolnwood (ph) was a German.</span> <span id="s2433">He owned huge farms, multi-millionaire.</span> <span id="s2434">He died of course.</span> <span id="s2435">His park is, Prussels, the park is named after him.</span> <span id="s2436">He subdivided, blah, blah, blah and so on.</span> <span id="s2437">There were no Jews here before.</span> <span id="s2438">_____________ was the first, where Jews were there, before Lincolnwood (ph) became.</span> <span id="s2439">But slowly, use to making in-roads and some of the gentlepeople didn't like some Jews so they started selling their houses.</span> <span id="s2440">So the Jews were buying it.</span> <span id="s2441">So like the Jews living in Rogers Park, going to the suburbs, you know?</span> <span id="s2442">Different minorities comes in.</span> <span id="s2443">And that's what, I understand, I was not here at that time.</span> <span id="s2444">I never seen that sign but I was told by my colleagues, Jewish doctors, who never could live here.</span> <span id="s2445">They told me, no one wanted to sell them a house or a plot to build anything.</span> <span id="s2446">They were unwelcome.</span> <span id="s2447">There were a lot of churches, there was never a Synagogue here.</span> <span id="s2448">Now we have some.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: I want to go back and ask you one thing.</span> <span id="s2450">You told me the story about when you're son was playing with the neighbor kid and then came in and he was about eight or so then.</span> <span id="s2451">And that's the first time the subject came up.</span> <span id="s2452">I'm just curious, that you and you're wife are both survivors.</span> <span id="s2453">You're here, you're having kids.</span> <span id="s2454">Did you ever have any discussion about how you would handle this subject with you're children?</span> <span id="s2455">Because, you must have thought it was, it had to come up at some time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: Yes, it did.</span> <span id="s2457">Of course, I imagine I did in a minor way, but I don't remember in detail.</span> <span id="s2458">But I know one thing.</span> <span id="s2459">It came up once when they were older, when we got some invitation to some symposium on children of survivors, something like this.</span> <span id="s2460">They had to undergo counseling, through psychological evaluations, and so on.</span> <span id="s2461">I never found that need in my family.</span> <span id="s2462">I never, not that I am blind to it, I am open to any kind of a consultation or if there is need to it.</span> <span id="s2463">I never felt my kids were deprived of any security, love, affection, ect.</span> <span id="s2464">Just because what we went through?</span> <span id="s2465">We never, we didn't dwell on this maybe.</span> <span id="s2466">Maybe in the very early, formative ages of our children we didn't want to hurt them.</span> <span id="s2467">And this was a cruel thing and we wanted to spare them to those things.</span> <span id="s2468">We felt that maybe in time when they are more mature and more responsible and more secure then we can have a dialogue on this thing.</span> <span id="s2469">But, interesting enough, when they became more mature they were not open to this kind of discussion at all.</span> <span id="s2470">They, my son don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2471">And I try for many times to approach him and so on.</span> <span id="s2472">And he said that I know you're story, I know everything.</span> <span id="s2473">It hurts me inside.</span> <span id="s2474">I don't want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s2475">But he's a very well balanced person.</span> <span id="s2476">He is not, outward he is not, or psychologically, a handicapped person, emotional or otherwise.</span> <span id="s2477">He is secure.</span> <span id="s2478">He is responsible.</span> <span id="s2479">He is very well known physician and consultant, you know?</span> <span id="s2480">He has a secure family.</span> <span id="s2481">He has two lovely little girls, daughters.</span> <span id="s2482">He married a gentile girl who is of German extraction.</span> <span id="s2483">I don't know how many generations, three or four generations, so, but he made it clear.</span> <span id="s2484">He fell in love with her, she fell in love with him.</span> <span id="s2485">As much as hurts him, he will never hurt his parents and marry a gentile, German girl unless she converts.</span> <span id="s2486">She said, look, it's not my fault I was born of German extraction.</span> <span id="s2487">Which is true.</span> <span id="s2488">But her parents and grandparents and great-grandparents born in this country, Americans.</span> <span id="s2489">The German is only by the name, name was Griner, which is a German name.</span> <span id="s2490">It could be a Jewish name too.</span> <span id="s2491">The fact that I am not Jewish is not my fault either.</span> <span id="s2492">But this they are, they are people too.</span> <span id="s2493">But I am not a religious person.</span> <span id="s2494">If this will make you happy.</span> <span id="s2495">And she converted.</span> <span id="s2496">She is more Jewish than my wife.</span> <span id="s2497">Friday she lights candles.</span> <span id="s2498">Kids go to synagogue, to temple.</span> <span id="s2499">We join synagogue because of my kids.</span> <span id="s2500">To same synagogue.</span> <span id="s2501">They joined but they waited four years to be accepted.</span> <span id="s2502">It cost a lot of money, like an introduction there because there was such a waiting list.</span> <span id="s2503">And that synagogue, they want to belong.</span> <span id="s2504">One day we got a call from the Rabbi, Dr. Horn?</span> <span id="s2505">Yes?</span> <span id="s2506">You're son is a member of our congregation now.</span> <span id="s2507">We would like to meet you.</span> <span id="s2508">I said, will you want us to be a member?</span> <span id="s2509">He said, well, we'll talk about that.</span> <span id="s2510">We want to meet you in person first, want to know you're story.</span> <span id="s2511">I would like to listen to you first.</span> <span id="s2512">And we set up a date and we met in his office there, in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s2513">He roughly just got our story and so on.</span> <span id="s2514">He said he would be more than pleased if we would join the congregation.</span> <span id="s2515">I said, first thing I cannot afford that money that my son paid you.</span> <span id="s2516">I am retired, I said, and I . . . Money is not the issue here, he said.</span> <span id="s2517">You don't have to pay nothing, he said.</span> <span id="s2518">I want you to be in the congregation, you're son is in the congregation with.</span> <span id="s2519">So we belong there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2520">Q: How about with you're daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">A: My daughter-in-law or my daughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">Q: No, you're daughter.</span> <span id="s2523">And you told me the story of what happened with you're son and how the whole subject of the Holocaust came up and how it's gone with you're son.</span> <span id="s2524">You haven't mentioned you're daughter.</span> <span id="s2525">How is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">A: She is more open to it, we talked many times.</span> <span id="s2527">My daughter, she went to Israel more than once, twice or three times already.</span> <span id="s2528">She wants to go through it again.</span> <span id="s2529">She is more digging into the past than my son.</span> <span id="s2530">She is different person, totally different.</span> <span id="s2531">She doesn't dwell on it though.</span> <span id="s2532">No, she doesn't.</span> <span id="s2533">But she is, she grabs whatever little she get from the history, from us, the parents, grandparents, so on.</span> <span id="s2534">She wants part of it, you know?</span> <span id="s2535">She is clinging to it.</span> <span id="s2536">But she is very secure too.</span> <span id="s2537">She doesn't dwell on it, she doesn't talk about it all the time and so on.</span> <span id="s2538">Among friends and so on, they all know she's proud of who she is, daughter of survivors.</span> <span id="s2539">And she's not embarrassed.</span> <span id="s2540">Because I know some of my friends children are embarrassed about their parents being survivors.</span> <span id="s2541">That's sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: They are embarrassed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: Embarrassed that their parents are survivors.</span> <span id="s2544">They are poor, they were poor, no families.</span> <span id="s2545">Because their friends are rich and American-born and so on.</span> <span id="s2546">It's a social level type of a thing.</span> <span id="s2547">They are like a lower kind of people.</span> <span id="s2548">But this was not with our kids.</span> <span id="s2549">No, I never, they always stood their ground and as I say, I feel that we are very well leveled families and my kids had no need for it.</span> <span id="s2550">But someday, I am sure, after I die, I am sure my son is going to keep his promise.</span> <span id="s2551">He is going to look into it in details.</span> <span id="s2552">The only thing I might say, yeah, but it would be better if you do it now while I am alive.</span> <span id="s2553">You can get some questions, you're not going to talk to the tape.</span> <span id="s2554">The tape won't be talking to you.</span> <span id="s2555">You have to listen to the tape, that's the only thing you get.</span> <span id="s2556">Information.</span> <span id="s2557">But with no dialogue.</span> <span id="s2558">Here, you've got you're father still alive.</span> <span id="s2559">But he doesn't, he said, Dad, I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s2560">I'm sorry, I cannot face up to it.</span> <span id="s2561">He wishes he could take away from me the hurt and he cannot do that, no how.</span> <span id="s2562">How can you do it?</span> <span id="s2563">Not talking about it?</span> <span id="s2564">That's what he thinks, by not talking, it is minimizing my hurting.</span> <span id="s2565">I don't dwell on it either.</span> <span id="s2566">I went back to Poland, I went back to my High School.</span> <span id="s2567">I was the only Jew in a Catholic High School.</span> <span id="s2568">I play violin in church choir in Poland.</span> <span id="s2569">And some Polish people, all the known facts about Poles during the war, what they did against the Jews.</span> <span id="s2570">I won't repeat it because they were the willing executioners of Hitler.</span> <span id="s2571">But they saved my life and my wife's life.</span> <span id="s2572">They got me out of Warsaw ghetto, Polish people.</span> <span id="s2573">Underground, Polish underground.</span> <span id="s2574">For money, of course.</span> <span id="s2575">It turned out to be no money, we buried, you know the story from the tape.</span> <span id="s2576">We had a buried treasure and it turned out to be someone robbed it.</span> <span id="s2577">Anyway, Polish people help us survive.</span> <span id="s2578">And they definitely helped me.</span> <span id="s2579">Totally unselfish, with any profit, no profit, nothing.</span> <span id="s2580">So I am very, I have to be fair to it.</span> <span id="s2581">And I went to Poland, I wanted to see my High School.</span> <span id="s2582">I was treated beautifully when I was a kid there.</span> <span id="s2583">I remember when, it was the most beautiful years of my life.</span> <span id="s2584">My parents and my school.</span> <span id="s2585">And my High School still stands.</span> <span id="s2586">And I found the book with my picture in it, in the High School.</span> <span id="s2587">I didn't know their fiftieth reunion, I didn't know they know I was surviving and, so I had the guts to go back and I went to the concentration, Majdanek, where my parents perished.</span> <span id="s2588">I had to go there because they were there, but that's all.</span> <span id="s2589">There's no trace left of nothing.</span> <span id="s2590">I went to other concentration camp, Auschwitz, etcetera.</span> <span id="s2591">We went to the former ghetto area and Warsaw where some Jewish people sell remnants, old, a few of them left over yet now.</span> <span id="s2592">Pitiful sight.</span> <span id="s2593">And my wife cannot face up to it.</span> <span id="s2594">She cannot do it.</span> <span id="s2595">She hates them so much, what they did to the Jews.</span> <span id="s2596">She doesn't want no part, she doesn't want to listen or speak Polish.</span> <span id="s2597">She doesn't want to read Polish books.</span> <span id="s2598">She doesn't want to look at Polish movies.</span> <span id="s2599">She doesn't want to go to Polish restaurants and so on.</span> <span id="s2600">You know, she is obsessed with it.</span> <span id="s2601">I am too, but I reflect different on those things.</span> <span id="s2602">I may be stronger than she is.</span> <span id="s2603">I can control my emotions.</span> <span id="s2604">I can go, maybe serve my purpose, because it brings back memory and no one can give it to me, I cannot buy it.</span> <span id="s2605">I go there and I grab it.</span> <span id="s2606">And I made that 3,000 or 4,000 mile trip for that only thing, to sit on old bench I was sitting on as a student.</span> <span id="s2607">I am an emotional person and I may be, I have compassion for those days.</span> <span id="s2608">Because those were my happy days.</span> <span id="s2609">And I am willing to do it again now because probably this will be my last trip.</span> <span id="s2610">And some of my friends, Jewish friends from the same town wants to go with me because our wives don't want to.</span> <span id="s2611">But it depends, some people go to a psychiatrist, they have medication.</span> <span id="s2612">They have the release of their turbulence and I get a release by doing what I am doing.</span> <span id="s2613">And this gives me peace of mind.</span> <span id="s2614">As much of peace you can get.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: When did you go back to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: About 16 years ago.</span> <span id="s2617">The only time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">Q: So, 1980?</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">A: Yeah, 1979 or 1980, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s2620">I think 1980, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: Just before a lot of things started to change there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Communists were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: And I felt very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2625">Very uncomfortable with the passport and the border, on the airport, they opened my passport, looked at my picture, it was empty.</span> <span id="s2626">It was a new passport.</span> <span id="s2627">They are looking for Israeli stamps.</span> <span id="s2628">They were, oh, they were, if you weren't from Israel they wouldn't let you in.</span> <span id="s2629">You know, the stamped visa.</span> <span id="s2630">So I made sure I got a new passport.</span> <span id="s2631">Clean, nothing there.</span> <span id="s2632">And the guard didn't say a word, just look at me, look at the empty pages.</span> <span id="s2633">My picture, empty pages.</span> <span id="s2634">He _______ the pages through, empty, blank, blank, blank.</span> <span id="s2635">He look at me, he look at this line of people behind me, maybe fifteen minutes like this, standing and waiting.</span> <span id="s2636">And I was getting a little uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s2637">Because I heard nasty things about the Communists in those days.</span> <span id="s2638">Didn't say nothing.</span> <span id="s2639">Gave me a stamp.</span> <span id="s2640">Without saying a word, pointed out to go through and I'm in Poland.</span> <span id="s2641">But it was not the most comfortable feeling I had.</span> <span id="s2642">Now is different.</span> <span id="s2643">Now they have so-called Democracy, but in today, Jews and Poles, I just got it today.</span> <span id="s2644">I read an article, Hungary, Romania, Estonia, giving back Jewish property to owners.</span> <span id="s2645">Poland, not even ___________.</span> <span id="s2646">Don't even prepare a bill or law to return the Jewish property to them.</span> <span id="s2647">So they grabbed what the Germans took away, robbery, and they keep it.</span> <span id="s2648">See, Poland.</span> <span id="s2649">So there's many things that I've got to be proud about being born in Poland, but things got, I am not a Pollack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: And you're planning to go back again, you say, with you're family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: Wonderful time.</span> <span id="s2652">That's going to be my last trip.</span> <span id="s2653">I go alone even, I go.</span> <span id="s2654">I will go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2655">Q: Are you going to go to the same places that you did the last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s2657">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2658">I have a drive to go.</span> <span id="s2659">You know when I went to the High School and the orderly there opened the class, it was during summer vacation and the classes were not open.</span> <span id="s2660">The secretary was there and so on and they called the guy with the keys to open the room that I, you know I closed my eyes.</span> <span id="s2661">I sit down.</span> <span id="s2662">I opened my eyes.</span> <span id="s2663">I thought I turned to 1935.</span> <span id="s2664">Sixty years.</span> <span id="s2665">This were the days, 1935 I was in school.</span> <span id="s2666">The same benches.</span> <span id="s2667">The same class, the same room.</span> <span id="s2668">Just like I never missed it, I never left.</span> <span id="s2669">And the guy with the keys, the orderly, the janitor, standing with respect outside, closed the door a little and let me sit and meditate on the bench that I sat on as a student.</span> <span id="s2670">He understood it very well.</span> <span id="s2671">And he said, didn't disturb me.</span> <span id="s2672">And when I left I gave him $10.00.</span> <span id="s2673">He didn't want to take any money from me.</span> <span id="s2674">He said, it would be sacrilegious, he said.</span> <span id="s2675">He knows how I feel.</span> <span id="s2676">He knows, he knew my story, you know, Jewish and so on.</span> <span id="s2677">I was the last graduate before the war, then the school was closed.</span> <span id="s2678">And there was only, when the war end, when the war started, there were only two Jews in my class, my school.</span> <span id="s2679">I was one and another Jew who lives in Chicago right now, found him after the war, he survived the war in Russia.</span> <span id="s2680">He was in my High School.</span> <span id="s2681">The only second Jew.</span> <span id="s2682">And in those days, there was nothing but school, education.</span> <span id="s2683">Where you get it, is it Jesuit school, other school, you get the education.</span> <span id="s2684">And this was a drive, there was such a healthy competition.</span> <span id="s2685">The cousins, everybody had to outdo the other one.</span> <span id="s2686">I played violin, I was painting, so my cousin was doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s2687">We tried to out do each other.</span> <span id="s2688">It was such a healthy thing.</span> <span id="s2689">There was nothing else to do in those days.</span> <span id="s2690">There was no fun like the kids have today and going to different places, things, parks, if you go to park they beat the hell out of you.</span> <span id="s2691">If you were Jewish and went to the park, the students, University students, beat the Jews in the park.</span> <span id="s2692">They let the Jews in.</span> <span id="s2693">Oh, I was beaten up many times.</span> <span id="s2694">But not by my colleagues.</span> <span id="s2695">My colleagues, I was their Jew.</span> <span id="s2696">Their Jew.</span> <span id="s2697">No one had the right to touch me.</span> <span id="s2698">I was their Jew, they loved me, they treated me, they saved my life.</span> <span id="s2699">They helped me with the false papers during the war.</span> <span id="s2700">They helped me.</span> <span id="s2701">With the risk of their own life.</span> <span id="s2702">There was a Gestapo walked in the room, who was sitting there.</span> <span id="s2703">He was a shoemaker.</span> <span id="s2704">I took my shoe off, he said, here, give me a shoe, he put a nail in my heel.</span> <span id="s2705">And the guy said, these here are two Jews running?</span> <span id="s2706">And the lady said, what Jews?</span> <span id="s2707">There are no more Jews here.</span> <span id="s2708">What Jews?</span> <span id="s2709">Jews are gone.</span> <span id="s2710">So he left.</span> <span id="s2711">It was the mother of my classmate from that High School.</span> <span id="s2712">They saved my life.</span> <span id="s2713">That's one episode only.</span> <span id="s2714">And there are many of them, I didn't describe all of them.</span> <span id="s2715">Because I cannot do in three hours or four hours of testimony, to give you all the details.</span> <span id="s2716">They were righteous gentiles, yes, they risked their life and I question, are we Jews, would we be ready to make that sacrifice, to threaten you're life to save another Pole?</span> <span id="s2717">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2718">I ask myself the same question, could I do that?</span> <span id="s2719">Somebody would say, oh, they are dumb Pollacks, that's why they did it.</span> <span id="s2720">Because smart people would not do it.</span> <span id="s2721">But that's wrong to say that.</span> <span id="s2722">There are many intelligent people who done it, because that's the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s2723">There are certain rules in life.</span> <span id="s2724">Is it a right ________ or is it a belief?</span> <span id="s2725">Is it a religion, maybe?</span> <span id="s2726">Whatever.</span> <span id="s2727">What is the right thing to do, what is the wrong thing to do?</span> <span id="s2728">They done what they believed was the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s2729">And I cannot knock them, those people deserve their place rightfully in history.</span> <span id="s2730">That's why I cannot generalize all the Poles.</span> <span id="s2731">But obviously Hitler knew where to build those concentration camps because he found a lot of helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2733">And who to make guard too.</span> <span id="s2734">You've mentioned Ukrainians a lot in you're video tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2736">Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2737">Q: We've spent a good time, we've actually been talking now for almost three hours and I want to thank you for you're time.</span> <span id="s2738">And before we turn the machines off, any last thing you want to add or anything you want to say that hasn't come up or that you want to expand upon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">A: It was not a very happy note.</span> <span id="s2740">I don't need the world to learn anything from the Second World War, from the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2741">Learn nothing.</span> <span id="s2742">And history repeats itself.</span> <span id="s2743">However said it before was right.</span> <span id="s2744">It is going to repeat itself.</span> <span id="s2745">I'm from, start from old ages, middle ages, same thing right now.</span> <span id="s2746">When Eichmann asked Hitler at the _________ Conference in 1942 in Germany, before the Final Solution, when Hitler outlined the plan, what he wanted to do with the Jews, he was agreeable but he said one question, to Hitler.</span> <span id="s2747">I think I mentioned that in my testimony too.</span> <span id="s2748">Do you know anything about the Armenian Holocaust?</span> <span id="s2749">And Eichmann said, no.</span> <span id="s2750">See?</span> <span id="s2751">Here you are.</span> <span id="s2752">There was Armenian Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2753">Turks annihilating Armenian people in 1905, I think.</span> <span id="s2754">1905, 1915 yeah.</span> <span id="s2755">Kids were never taught in school about, they were not in Turkey.</span> <span id="s2756">But in Germany, in Poland, I was never taught that.</span> <span id="s2757">I just found out about it when I heard this thing.</span> <span id="s2758">You know what?</span> <span id="s2759">After the Second World War, after Holocaust, fifty years, seventy-five years, people forget about it and they will not like to discuss it no more.</span> <span id="s2760">And I am reaching that point now, I see that.</span> <span id="s2761">Letters to the editors, I see people saying, we know, Holocaust, Holocaust, Schmol-o-caust, enough, enough, enough.</span> <span id="s2762">How much longer are you going to talk about it?</span> <span id="s2763">Well, I hate to say that, from the lower class of people, not very intelligent people, would write that kind of a letter to an editor, you know?</span> <span id="s2764">But they resent, non-Jews dwell on this kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2765">And they don't want Jews to dwell on it either.</span> <span id="s2766">But they don't understand the pain inflicted by that.</span> <span id="s2767">How can you forget that?</span> <span id="s2768">As, who said it?</span> <span id="s2769">Viselle (ph)?</span> <span id="s2770">Forgive?</span> <span id="s2771">Yes.</span> <span id="s2772">Forget?</span> <span id="s2773">Never.</span> <span id="s2774">True.</span> <span id="s2775">You might forgive, I never forgive.</span> <span id="s2776">I won't forgive, I won't forgive.</span> <span id="s2777">But what does it mean, I won't forgive?</span> <span id="s2778">So I pay my own choices, I don't want to associate with German people and so on.</span> <span id="s2779">There are innocent German now, you youngsters today, it's not their fault.</span> <span id="s2780">They are not, because they are grandchildren of the perpetrators.</span> <span id="s2781">But to children I might forgive, little children.</span> <span id="s2782">My generation Germans I won't forgive because they are willing witnesses and participant in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2783">Do you read the book by, what's his name?</span> <span id="s2784">Lucy?</span> <span id="s2785">Lucy?</span> <span id="s2786">I have the book upstairs.</span> <span id="s2787">I have it upstairs.</span> <span id="s2788">By Galahan (ph) is the name, I forgot his name.</span> <span id="s2789">Hitler's Willing Executioners.</span> <span id="s2790">Proving that all German participate, willingly or unwillingly.</span> <span id="s2791">Getting support, getting fur coats, getting radios.</span> <span id="s2792">They knew it belonged to somebody, they knew from whom.</span> <span id="s2793">By not being anti-Jews, but they are accepting those things, they are participant in it, they were quiet about it, they were peaceful.</span> <span id="s2794">So, it is so true.</span> <span id="s2795">I agree.</span> <span id="s2796">I read the book.</span> <span id="s2797">Very difficult book for me to read.</span> <span id="s2798">Difficult because it's the professor from Harvard who is the writer, a highly intelligent man and psychologist.</span> <span id="s2799">And I had to read it like a science book, not a novel.</span> <span id="s2800">It's hard to digest it you know?</span> <span id="s2801">But it's so true.</span> <span id="s2802">So I believe today the people didn't learn nothing.</span> <span id="s2803">It is repeating itself right now, this moment.</span> <span id="s2804">And it's going to repeat itself again.</span> <span id="s2805">One stops, another country starts murdering their own people.</span> <span id="s2806">Is it Rwanda?</span> <span id="s2807">Is it Bosnia?</span> <span id="s2808">Is it in Libya?</span> <span id="s2809">Or is it in South Arabia now?</span> <span id="s2810">I mean, wherever you turn around you will find the same thing.</span> <span id="s2811">Know it's going to happen again.</span> <span id="s2812">And that's rather depressing fact that I have to learn to live with it.</span> <span id="s2813">The only, maybe positive out of it is that my life is going to end soon and I probably won't be witness to another Holocaust maybe.</span> <span id="s2814">But I worry about my children and my grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2815">That's what I worry about, yes.</span> <span id="s2816">I am rather pessimistic.</span> <span id="s2817">I am an extrovert, I am.</span> <span id="s2818">And basically I am a person with hope and so on, and in this respect I am rather pessimistic.</span> <span id="s2819">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: It's surprising actually given so much of what you're story has been like, especially since coming over here.</span> <span id="s2821">And you've said yourself, in many ways, you've had very good fortune and you've had a very good life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">A: I still have a good life.</span> <span id="s2823">That's not this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2824">Q: But it's interesting that you're final conclusions are so pessimistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: I am a little influenced maybe by the newsletters I get from the different organizations, Jewish organizations, with pictures.</span> <span id="s2826">What's going on now.</span> <span id="s2827">Certainly I was not aware of it, even now, the degree of anti-Semitism in this country is frightening.</span> <span id="s2828">It is frightening.</span> <span id="s2829">If I listen to all this, what I read.</span> <span id="s2830">Granted, maybe some of the organizations, they try to influence the readers by getting more donations, by, you know?</span> <span id="s2831">Send us more money to defend our cause and so on.</span> <span id="s2832">But the fact is, there are still very many anti-Semitic type of a thing . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">End of Tape 3.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">Tape 4</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: . . . publications.</span> <span id="s2836">You can find it everywhere.</span> <span id="s2837">And that's what disturbs me.</span> <span id="s2838">Not that I stopped being an optimist, no.</span> <span id="s2839">But I am a little on the pessimistic for the future generation of my children and so on.</span> <span id="s2840">And I don't like what I see right now with the ultra-rightness and the church trying to turn to politics as one, introducing the Prior to the school, I am definitely against it.</span> <span id="s2841">I feel the beginning of the problem, you know?</span> <span id="s2842">I am not a blind person and I came from there, where this was there.</span> <span id="s2843">And they want to do something that I came from.</span> <span id="s2844">And it is going to lead only to another catastrophe, sooner or later.</span> <span id="s2845">It's going to be the Blacks, or the Jews, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2846">Q: Well thanks again for spending all this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">A: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s2848">Thank you for you're time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Conclusion of Interview.</span></p></body></html>
