was at that time Czarist Russia.</span> <span id="s16">Q: Jerry, can you tell me something about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Well, uh I..</span> <span id="s18">.</span> <span id="s19">my father was born same town.</span> <span id="s20">My mother was born in the same town and I had uh two sisters and two brothers.</span> <span id="s21">My father was a uh I don't know if you know what it means...kind of a muscue (ph)...it was a modern, self-taught Hebrew scholar.</span> <span id="s22">He also had like myself had the affinity for languages, uh nat...nat...natural ability I should say, and he, before the war, before the 1st World War, he used to teach uh the Polish children of Polish nobility who lived in the Ukraine, were the the owners of the large estates, the Poles, and he used to teach their children Polish.</span> <span id="s23">Self-taught...himself...taught himself Polish and German, and he also was a Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s24">In those days it was a very rare thing to teach modern Hebrew, because most of Jewish education was the , religious schools.</span> <span id="s25">He was one of the first to pioneer, taught modern Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Well I grew up...uh when I was born...I was born during the sec...1st World War, in 1915...the war was...the the front was standing in our town for about a year so Sov...the Czarist Russia and Germans.</span> <span id="s28">That sector, that section of the of the front, it was manned by the Austrians and it so happened that Hungarians...the Austra-Hungarian empire so there were lots of Hungarians there too, and Germans.</span> <span id="s29">Uh when I was about five months old they evacuated us to the rear, the Germans did.</span> <span id="s30">The...at that time it was the Hungarian, the Austria-Hungarian army, and we were uh from 1915, beginning of 1916, we were about forty, fifty kilometers in the rear on this of the of the front.</span> <span id="s31">There uh in 1917 my brother was born and in 1918 when the war ended, we came back to our town.</span> <span id="s32">Uh the town was almost uh totally demolished and there was nothing to do there, so my father moved to the nearest town which was called Povorsk (ph).</span> <span id="s33">Uh the Polish government was just established.</span> <span id="s34">Poland became independent in 1918 and my father knowing Polish got a job as the mana...office manager in the Polish uh county county seat.</span> <span id="s35">That way he worked for a couple of years till the Poles started settling that that part of the country, because there were no Poles, very few Poles there, and they got a lot of Polish-speaking Poles and my father was fired.</span> <span id="s36">Uh this was about 1920.</span> <span id="s37">At that time the new Soviet army occupied, advanced all the way to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s38">They went by us and uh it was a very difficult time because there was also many Ukrainian uh independence groups trying to establish an independent Ukraine, and among them were many bands of anti- Semitic uh armies.</span> <span id="s39">There was Batura (ph), and there was Bela and there were many others and whoever went by uh the Jews were their victims.</span> <span id="s40">The pogroms there were...you know...uh but somehow we survived and in 1920 the Soviets were pushed backed from Warsaw...the the Poles call it to this day the miracle of the , and uh we became, Poland became a normal so-called democratic country.</span> <span id="s41">It turned out afterwards it was not democratic for everybody but was semi-democratic, and we lived there until 1939.</span> <span id="s42">Uh in the beginning it was not as bad a country as being built.</span> <span id="s43">Uh my father went into business.</span> <span id="s44">He was not a good businessman (laughter) (cough).</span> <span id="s45">He supplemented his income by doing some bookkeeping and writing petitions to the Polish courts in Polish because the majority of the population were Ukrainians, of course, and Jews where we lived and they needed somebody to...there were a few Polish people that knew Polish, so he used to supplement his income by writing petitions to the to the courts or any other Polish authorities.</span> <span id="s46">I grew up uh in this town till about...when my father lost his job before that he he went...he became a teacher in the neighboring town where I, we, where I was where I was born, and for several...for about a year or so I stayed.</span> <span id="s47">I was three years old and I already started learning something and my father was a stickler for for education.</span> <span id="s48">And uh I stayed there for a year or two.</span> <span id="s49">I missed my...it was only twelve kilometers away but it might have been (laughter) you know the the moon.</span> <span id="s50">That's that's while, you know, didn't have any cars or we went by train which then you had to walk six kilometers or went by horse and wagon, so it was tough and I missed my family though my father was there.</span> <span id="s51">One day I remember my father went for , went home, and he left me there and my...and and he took by horse and went to the nearest railroad station which was about six kilometers away and I I was probably four or five years old and I ran after the realize it that he sneaked out I guess.</span> <span id="s52">He didn't want...it was expensive to go by train, see, but he didn't realize...to this day I remember it.</span> <span id="s53">I I resented it very much, and I ran after him into the forest.</span> <span id="s54">They had to go through a big forest.</span> <span id="s55">There were wolves in the forest but he...I was yelling, you know, and and he he heard me and he turned back and he took me with him.</span> <span id="s56">(Laughter) So I grew up in that town.</span> <span id="s57">Then my father went to as I told you before, and he didn't do badly.</span> <span id="s58">It was...he had a uh military garrison.</span> <span id="s59">The the the terrain around our town was swampy and and lot lots of forests, lots of woods and it was used for training the Polish army, so we used to do business with the Polish army.</span> <span id="s60">Uh my father used to have a uh beer parlor like, you know, which Poles used to come and drink.</span> <span id="s61">He also had a kind of a so-called department store-like which was probably twelve by twelve (laughter), but it had everything and we used to make a living from the...the Ukrainian peasants used to come and buy from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Uh later on it was very difficult because in 1936 I think, died, the leader of Poland who established a semi-dictatorship and since then the life for Jews in Poland was very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: we've talked a lot about Poland.</span> <span id="s64">I would like to know about you as a young boy growing up.</span> <span id="s65">What kind of schools did you go, what.....?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, I went, as I told you before, first of all my father taught me.</span> <span id="s67">Later on there were others.</span> <span id="s68">When he went to business, there were other teachers.</span> <span id="s69">One of them particular influenced my life very greatly.</span> <span id="s70">His name was Moshi .</span> <span id="s71">He was a modern Hebrew teacher.</span> <span id="s72">He taught me everything, you know, all...my my rounded education all in Hebrew, so I learned Hebrew quite well.</span> <span id="s73">Uh but it was compulsa...this was...this was schools were not recognized by the Polish government.</span> <span id="s74">They were uh...we, we ourselves organized them.</span> <span id="s75">You know, we used to hire our teacher and this was a small town, probably about forty Jewish families, so we we were compelled to to attend the Polish grammar school, which in our town went only to the fourth grade.</span> <span id="s76">In bigger cities it went to the seventh grade.</span> <span id="s77">And and and I was very advanced for that kind of education, you see, except in Polish, which I learned, but I mean uh math and all the other subjects I learned already when I was five years old.</span> <span id="s78">I had to learn , so I I....I went up through the fourth grade and later on my parents enrolled me into a uh gymnasium which is high school.</span> <span id="s79">Uh it was operated by the network of Hebrew schools, Zionist Hebrew...Hebrew language teaching Hebrew uh teaching Hebrew in , which is uh about thirty kilometers from my town, and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s80">And again I stayed with a family which was uh very crowded.</span> <span id="s81">They had two rooms with four kids and I was with them and my uh mother used to send me every week uh freshly baked , pastry and butter and all this stuff and I managed by myself as so.</span> <span id="s82">I entered...I took an exam and entered the third class.</span> <span id="s83">This was a uh...well, this was high school up to the eighth...you graduated uh matriculated uh in eight eight classes.</span> <span id="s84">I entered in the third, but they were very expensive and at that time my father's business went down and he could not afford to pay and after a year my younger brother was ready to go to school.</span> <span id="s85">He wanted him to get a little bit of education, so I was...I went home and my younger brother, second brother, went to school.</span> <span id="s86">So my formal education ended there.</span> <span id="s87">I still had the same teacher we had before for about a year and a half, till about my thirteenth year, thirteen, fourteen years old and that was it.</span> <span id="s88">That that's where my formal education ended.</span> <span id="s89">I tried of course all the time to upgrade my education.</span> <span id="s90">I I taught myself.</span> <span id="s91">I read a lot and this teacher helped me a great deal.</span> <span id="s92">Uh at that time it was a very difficult...what do when you are fourteen or fifteen?</span> <span id="s93">And we had some, I had friends...well, my age probably we had a group of about ten kids, boys and girls, and we organized a uh group.</span> <span id="s94">Originally it was , a leftist Zionist organization.</span> <span id="s95">Later on the majority thought that this was too too leftist for them, and we organized a , which was the revisionist group and then uh there was nothing to do in this town, so at age sixteen I decided to go to a kibbutz and go to Israel.</span> <span id="s96">So we went but at that time it was the most famous kibbutz in Poland called .</span> <span id="s97">It was a stone quarry where we worked.</span> <span id="s98">Uh not enough to eat, lots of work and I stayed there for a few months and then one of my friends tried to leave and he went home and while going home he stopped in my town.</span> <span id="s99">He lived a little further and he told my parents about the conditions in this kibbutz, very difficult.</span> <span id="s100">So they decided that I should come home.</span> <span id="s101">So they wrote me a letter where my mother is very sick (laughter) and I should come home.</span> <span id="s102">I came home, of course.</span> <span id="s103">Thank God she was not sick and I didn't go back.</span> <span id="s104">Besides you had to wait...it was not so much the hard work and the lack of food, but you might have to wait two years, three years, before you get a certificate, you know, to go to...it was then Palestine.</span> <span id="s105">So what do you do?</span> <span id="s106">Nothing.</span> <span id="s107">There was nothing to do in this little town, so my parents decided to send me to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s108">My mother had a sister in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s109">So I went there and my uncle had a little shop but I wasn't interested too much in it.</span> <span id="s110">I don't know why and I couldn't get established so I went to Lodz (ph).</span> <span id="s111">Lodz was the industrial capital of Poland.</span> <span id="s112">Had a great textile industry and Jews were uh dominated the small textile businesses, uh manufacturing sweaters, uh socks, uh gloves, these kind of...the large textile mills, even though some of them were owned by Jews, had no Jewish employees.</span> <span id="s113">They had non-Jewish employees.</span> <span id="s114">It was so- called which was owned by a Jew named Cohen (ph) who was, by the way, a Hasid (ph), a very religious Jew and there was who built great factories for Polish people, but for the Jews he built a hospital, for Jews that could not work.</span> <span id="s115">There was strong unions there, Polish nationalist unions, even socialist unions were very much against Jews.</span> <span id="s116">So it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s117">I went to school there for a few months and I learned making sweaters, and I used to stay there for a few months, earn enough to get a ticket to go home (laughter) for this...you know the season was uh summer.</span> <span id="s118">Middle summer and late fall and then there was no work.</span> <span id="s119">These were small...people that lived in one room or two rooms and had a..</span> <span id="s120">.</span> <span id="s121">two or three machines, hand-operated sweater making machines.</span> <span id="s122">That's what I did for a few years and uh this was known...you know what means?</span> <span id="s123">And that's the way life was till 1939.</span> <span id="s124">I came home in '38 and stayed till 1939.</span> <span id="s125">In 1930...by went from , from the extreme right to a leftist organization called the AntiªFascist Front.</span> <span id="s126">I didn't know at that time that it was dominated by the , the communist youth organization.</span> <span id="s127">Later on the Communist Party in Poland was uh dissolved by Stalin but this group...the the uh the Communist Youth Organization was instructed to infiltrate other organizations, regardless right or left.</span> <span id="s128">I didn't....was not exactly uh you know, convinced of communism because I was still, I still had Zionist inclinations.</span> <span id="s129">I couldn't understand why Hebrew language which was near and dear to me should be banned, which was banned by the Communist Party.</span> <span id="s130">Uh many other things which I could not understand of course at that time.</span> <span id="s131">I understand it now.</span> <span id="s132">And uh so I joined that group till I find out that they were...this was just a uh arm of the Communist Youth movement so I left them but I had some idea about the Communist uh Marxism, Communism, Leninism, so forth, the way it was then...you know, it changed.</span> <span id="s133">Especially lately.</span> <span id="s134">When I came home and in 1939 when the Soviet Union occupied this part of Poland...the Germans occupied the other part of Poland...I uh became active in the local the uh well cultural Communist uh leadership of the town.</span> <span id="s135">I got ...as a as a result of this I got the job as the manager of the village store and it lasted till 1941 when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: The Soviet occupation was difficult.</span> <span id="s138">We didn't feel it so much in our town because there were no no bourgeois, no no people that were sent away but there were Poles that lived around, settlers.</span> <span id="s139">They were not native to this part of the country, but Poland settled them there after 1918, 1920.</span> <span id="s140">These were participants in the Polish war for independence, in the 1st World War, and they awarded...they gave them parcels of land to to work and there were they were called colonies.</span> <span id="s141">They were not called villages.</span> <span id="s142">They were called Polish colonies and one night they called me and , cold...it was a very cold winter in 1939-40.</span> <span id="s143">They called us to the village uh , well the the uh the local the local the local authorities and uh I saw a lot of wagons there.</span> <span id="s144">There was not even a yet.</span> <span id="s145">This was still still uh privately owned.</span> <span id="s146">They called them all .</span> <span id="s147">They were sitting there was a some people from the NKBD in charge of this and they told us...uh first of all they screened everyone of us and said can you, can you spend the night, can you spend the morning and so forth, and when they came to me I told them I can't...I have to be in the morning in the store because I have to distribute bread and there was...aga...again a military garrison there which we supplied with bread, their families would buy bread, and I had to be there in the morning.</span> <span id="s148">I I smelled there was something wrong there.</span> <span id="s149">I didn't know what.</span> <span id="s150">In the morning when I woke up I saw hundreds of wagons taking away these Polish families from all around, from the whole region, uh loading them into into uh freight cars.</span> <span id="s151">Uh they had, these freight cars had little stoves to heat...not like the German.</span> <span id="s152">By by the way, I think that Hitler learned from Stalin how to how to do these things.</span> <span id="s153">Of course he improved on it using German technology and German, you know, but originally it was tough.</span> <span id="s154">And in one night they re-settled hundreds of families in our region, Poles, and sent them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s155">Also some of the former Communist leaders were arrested and you know, it was kind of uh the same thing I think that is going on Israel.</span> <span id="s156">They they...( ) I know, but but there is there is a common thread there.</span> <span id="s157">Uh whoever had some grudge against somebody else, they denounced them and they were taken away.</span> <span id="s158">I know a very good friend of mine was...a Ukrainian, not a Jew, Ukrainian...leader of the , spent probably about four or five years in Polish jails for being a Communist.</span> <span id="s159">The Communist Party was illegal in Poland, and he was sent away to Siberia, together with these Poles, the same night.</span> <span id="s160">But we didn't have...there weren't very many rich Jews in town.</span> <span id="s161">sent away, most of...in the big cities they sent away all these rich Jews...(laughter) you know, a small manufacturers, small store owners, they sent him away, doing him a favor by the way because most of them survived.</span> <span id="s162">Most of them survived.</span> <span id="s163">Some died from hunger, starvation but some survived, so it was not as...I had it very well, you know, I I had a good job.</span> <span id="s164">I had no problems, you know.</span> <span id="s165">Whatever came in I could have...the the...there wasn't much available but there was bread, you see, and there was sugar.</span> <span id="s166">Sugar was a luxury item, but the little I got, you know, first of all I my family.</span> <span id="s167">My father worked as the uh accountant at the regional uh group in the same organization...the uh cooperatives, village cooperatives, and my brother came from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s168">My brother was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s169">When I when I left, he came to Warsaw and he somehow got established with my uncle.</span> <span id="s170">He managed his business.</span> <span id="s171">This uncle of mine in Warsaw didn't speak Polish.</span> <span id="s172">He was born in Poland.</span> <span id="s173">You know, for for hundreds of years....he lived in Poland but he did not speak Polish.</span> <span id="s174">He spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s175">And my brother managed his business.</span> <span id="s176">He was manufacturing uh locks for women's pocketbooks, and he kept the books and delivered the shop here.</span> <span id="s177">He employed about four or five people there, but when the war...when the Germans occupied, he left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s178">There were, you know, thousands and thousands who left Poland, crossed the River Bork (ph), and came the German or Soviet authorities.</span> <span id="s179">So uh it was difficult but it was bearable to live.</span> <span id="s180">To us it was...I even believed some of their slogans, see, about uh rights of minorities, because the left persecuted the Jews, Jews couldn't a job.</span> <span id="s181">In Poland it was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">And the Polish uh from 1920 till 1939 uh there wasn't a single Jewish policeman, not a single Jewish railroad man, not a single Jewish uh letter carrier or street sweeper.</span> <span id="s183">All government jobs were closed to Jews.</span> <span id="s184">And here the Soviet Union came in and to calling somebody a dirty, you know, Jew or kike (ph)...it was fifteen years in Siberia.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">This was Stalinism, and so so uh it was kind of...we didn't realize then what was going on in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s186">Of course there were millions already sent away.</span> <span id="s187">Millions dying.</span> <span id="s188">There was there was cannibalism.</span> <span id="s189">But we didn't know that... to us this was ideal.</span> <span id="s190">It took us some time.</span> <span id="s191">In 1941, when the war started between...the the Germans...the the...Hitler's forces attacked the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s192">We were about uh forty kilometers from the border.</span> <span id="s193">I was mobilized into the Soviet army.</span> <span id="s194">I was too old already to go in the regular army...I was called to reserve training, for about four or six weeks .</span> <span id="s195">I was already at that time twenty-six.</span> <span id="s196">They took me for a few weeks into a unit which watched enemy war...uh enemy aircraft, in training, of course, because nobody expected a war.</span> <span id="s197">This was about the middle of June, June 10th or 12th, somewhere along there .</span> <span id="s198">I was stationed at the same in town.</span> <span id="s199">These people would go home for meals and uh one day, on June 22nd, I happened to be on watch in a tall tower.</span> <span id="s200">I was standing there with binoculars watching for enemy craft, and sure enough I saw enemy craft...I saw the German Mescherschmidts (ph).</span> <span id="s201">They were flying on their way back from Kiev.</span> <span id="s202">They had already bombed Kiev, the last city in the Ukraine, and on the way back they dropped a few bombs in our...at the railroad station, not aiming at anything, just to create a little bit of panic.</span> <span id="s203">And when I called the center to tell them ...it was an old fashioned field telephone...you crank it...and I called that this wasn't the uh headquarters.</span> <span id="s204">It was here, and I called them and told them that I think I saw (laughter) I saw enemy craft and that they bombed our railroad station.</span> <span id="s205">(Laughter) He says is that so.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">.</span> <span id="s207">They knew already , and so he asked me what kind of it was and I told him.</span> <span id="s208">He said well, we were attacked by the Fascists and this is war.</span> <span id="s209">We saw a few more...within the next few days we saw a few more uh German aircraft flying over our town.</span> <span id="s210">They didn't do any damage bombs, but within a week or so we could hear artillery...uh noise of artillery shells, in the distance of about twenty or thirty kilometers, and that meant that was retreat.</span> <span id="s211">So with my unit...uh I went home to say goodbye.</span> <span id="s212">We didn't know how long it will last, heroic Red army will not let uh the occupy.</span> <span id="s213">It just, you know, happened in the beginning they didn't expect it was, you know, we'll get it back.</span> <span id="s214">No question about it.</span> <span id="s215">We will be in Berlin probably within...the same the same thought was in '39.</span> <span id="s216">I I..</span> <span id="s217">.</span> <span id="s218">a funny thing...in the Polish...I was also mobilized in the Polish Army doing the same thing.</span> <span id="s219">It was not the army, but it was like a national guard...uh we watched for for German planes and .</span> <span id="s220">They never occupied until then.</span> <span id="s221">So we retreated, and we kept retreating and the further east we went, the further east the Germans were.</span> <span id="s222">They they put...they dropped parachute drops ahead of us.</span> <span id="s223">Great panic.</span> <span id="s224">Small groups.</span> <span id="s225">Uh the Russians were not prepared war.</span> <span id="s226">They told, you know, they they killed the great generals and others killed , so they were without a uh higher uh staff of skilled officers.</span> <span id="s227">They had to train new ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">They were unprepared and we thought that this was an army that cannot be defeated but they didn't have to fight uh Poland.</span> <span id="s229">Poland was of course done in seventeen days.</span> <span id="s230">And we saw these big tanks, the the all the equipment they had, which we did not see in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s231">Of course we didn't realize what the German army had, so the further we went the further they advanced, till finally we came to a town where we we couldn't go any further, but somehow we got out and we came to Kiev (ph), and in Kiev they assigned me and a few others to to another unit.</span> <span id="s232">It was a uh machine gun unit in in bunkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">The...about twenty, thirty kilometers from Kiev.</span> <span id="s234">It was called the Kiev defense line all along heavily built cement uh blocks cement un cement bunkers with machine guns in them, and they they had a garrison of about ten thousand people in it, with a commissioned officer and non-commissioned officers.</span> <span id="s235">We were supposed to .</span> <span id="s236">It was camouflaged with a barn, so when they looked from the other side, they saw the barn.</span> <span id="s237">The Germans were just across the river, about half a mile away, so then they saw us...and they're not supposed to see us.</span> <span id="s238">We had trenches built from the barn but one day they uh a few artillery shells they demolished the barn.</span> <span id="s239">There was the bunker (laughter) in its full glory standing.</span> <span id="s240">And uh we stayed there for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s241">I happened to be elected the uh the editor of the unit newspaper.</span> <span id="s242">The Soviet Union has every every every establishment uh the commercial or military uh etiquette, used to have a war paper, paper that was, you know, the praise those who did good work and criticize those who did bad work, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s243">I didn't know in the beginning what it was, so I wrote articles about the glorious Soviet army and Stalin and so on.</span> <span id="s244">Finally, they called me and told me this, this is not...Pravda will take care of that.</span> <span id="s245">You write who in the unit learned to shoot better than , who has been falling asleep on the...one day I did fall asleep, but .</span> <span id="s246">Uh so they...every so often I used to be called to conferences that the , the political uh comman.</span> <span id="s247">.</span> <span id="s248">the political officer of the units, which was in, near Kiev.</span> <span id="s249">One day they called me in.</span> <span id="s250">They told me to take my rifle, whatever I had...I didn't have much...and report to the headquarters of this...it was a..</span> <span id="s251">.</span> <span id="s252">called...it was the nineteen, twenty-ninth uh independent battalion, machine gun battalion, to report to headquarters in the rear and I did report there and they took me in to a place there and there I found some uh neighboring...uh one fellow I knew which was not , was a Jewish fellow from a town near us and I found there many others, Jews and Ukrainians who were from the so- called western Ukraine, that were born, or lived...not just born...lived in in the Soviet...the territory that was Poland before the war, and they took us on the front, with the purpose of putting us in work battalion, because they trust us.</span> <span id="s253">.</span> <span id="s254">The irony of the thing was was that the native Ukrainian soldiers that lived around the Ukraine, they deserted by the thousands.</span> <span id="s255">We did not, especially Jews, because we knew where we going to desert.</span> <span id="s256">You know, if we fall into German hands we'll be dead, so we stayed to the last man, and we came uh...they took us on the front and again we were in Kiev and within two days that territory was occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s257">We were in...uh it was September I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">September '41.</span> <span id="s259">We were in Kiev and two days later the Germans came in and and happened by that time.</span> <span id="s260">They didn't stay long.</span> <span id="s261">Right away they organized the Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s262">There there was no lack of collaborators, and they killed a hundred thousand people.</span> <span id="s263">I left two days before then with the work battalion.</span> <span id="s264">And we we we traveled thousands, hundreds of thousands of people...there were uh Jews, Ukrainians, uh Poles and Germans, Soviet Germans.</span> <span id="s265">Germans that lived in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s266">Uh one...the the commander of my group was a German.</span> <span id="s267">I still remember his name...Weiss (ph).</span> <span id="s268">He was an officer in the Red Army, taken to the front.</span> <span id="s269">Not trust-worthy, and I was the only one in the unit that had a pocket watch, and he asked...he found out that I had a watch and he asked me for the watch because he had to know when to stop to food, you know.</span> <span id="s270">There was no no and I lost my watch because we came to a place where the Germans bombed us and we we disintegrated.</span> <span id="s271">Everyone just ran wherever he could, and my friend Weiss with my watch disappeared.</span> <span id="s272">He probably surrendered.</span> <span id="s273">Till we came uh we came to a place and I made a friend.</span> <span id="s274">One Jewish boy from a town not far from us and we stuck together.</span> <span id="s275">Just tried to find somebody to be together.</span> <span id="s276">Then we joined...we joined a group...no.</span> <span id="s277">We came we came to a town in the .</span> <span id="s278">I'll never forget the name of the town.</span> <span id="s279">The town's name was .</span> <span id="s280">And there we closed.</span> <span id="s281">We couldn't go any further, and it was Rosh Hashanna.</span> <span id="s282">Never forget that date...it was 19...still 1941, and we came to a place in this town and the Germans were all around us and they started shooting and we were hiding in a field of uh...what do you call it... what the plant is called...they are tall stocks like....yeah...and we were heading there, hiding there, and there were uh people fell.</span> <span id="s283">They...probably half of us fell...before they were killed.</span> <span id="s284">And there was a lot of Jewish soldiers fell work battalions who came from our section of the country, western Ukraine, Jews.</span> <span id="s285">And some of them had...they were allegedly had prayer books and they sat in the trenches and prayed.</span> <span id="s286">I I saw some trucks with wounded soldiers and I I don't know what happened to me...my friend who is now...I don't know if he is still alive in New York...he got got sick...he got Parkinson's disease but I saw but at that time he was sitting and I tried to help this wounded soldier get on the trucks .</span> <span id="s287">He reminded me of my .</span> <span id="s288">All of a sudden you I don't think of it as just stupid, but I I tried to help other people.</span> <span id="s289">This trait remains with me to this day, and at that time...the next morning...at night the Germans didn't fight...and the next morning we decided, tried to decide what to do.</span> <span id="s290">Then we saw a group of uh Soviet sailors...not the sea sailors...they had a group...they had a unit of uh river sailors, marching in formation, trying to get out of town.</span> <span id="s291">The only way...it seemed there was a big swamp which the Germans did not control, and they walked right into this swamp and I and my friend followed.</span> <span id="s292">When the Germans saw people in the swamp they started shooting from uh artillery shells you know, makes a uh big hole and it explodes uh not...what you call this...straight ahead... not because if you lie down you can, you know, even if it goes near you uh you're still safe, but uh most of the explosions are killed , especially in the water, so there were lots of people killed there.</span> <span id="s293">One thing I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s294">When I when I was walking through this swamp I suffered before...I didn't have a I didn't have a spoon.</span> <span id="s295">I lost my spoon.</span> <span id="s296">A soldier without a spoon because they used to give us to feed us with a big kind of...well... a container with soup for ten people, and if you had a spoon, you ate.</span> <span id="s297">It not you had to wait till somebody gives you his spoon after he ate, but by now it was gone.</span> <span id="s298">And while walking I saw a spoon...these were wooden spoons.</span> <span id="s299">The Russian still use them...a wooden spoons...floating you know, on the water.</span> <span id="s300">I picked up the spoon.</span> <span id="s301">I was happy.</span> <span id="s302">I didn't care , but then I mean I couldn't .</span> <span id="s303">Picked up that spoon.</span> <span id="s304">I had it for a long time, and when we crossed that swamp, there was a river and this friend of mine he's you know a good swimmer.</span> <span id="s305">I was not so good.</span> <span id="s306">we uh we used to have these things around our feet in the army to , you know, to wrap them all around your feet.</span> <span id="s307">And I had a pair.</span> <span id="s308">We put them together and uh put out, all our clothes...outer clothes...uh great coats wrapped.</span> <span id="s309">We had some food and cigarettes and uh he swam over and then he pulled me over with this here and we came on the other side and there we landed in a village....</span> <span id="s310">The minute we we we crossed, we swam over that river, I decided to have a cigarette.</span> <span id="s311">Not food but a cigarette, smoke it, and I took a puff and at this....</span> <span id="s312">I wouldn't be there, I probably would have stayed there, but he , and he survived.</span> <span id="s313">So we went to the village and the village was burning so we used the fire to dry our clothes and uh the next morning...then we went to a uh big barn and we slept in the hay till the next morning.</span> <span id="s314">The next morning we went down and we saw thousands of Russian soldiers, without without officers, without...not organized units.</span> <span id="s315">All, every everybody and quickly there were a few officers and we decided that if we encountered some Germans, we'll fight.</span> <span id="s316">We had we had a one rifle between us and some grenades and they gave us when we was in that town.</span> <span id="s317">Gave us back our .</span> <span id="s318">We decided to fight if we saw a small group of Germans.</span> <span id="s319">If not we will scatter and hid and there were again these tall uh ...I can't remember the name of that uh place and uh and sure enough when we were talking organizing there's one truck with Germans, German soldiers, that they...machine guns on it, and they're already leading a procession of prisoners of war and they motioned to us to come to surrender and the majority did.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">The majority surrendered.</span> <span id="s321">We, being Jewish, knew that this means certain death, so we headed out to the field.</span> <span id="s322">This friend of mine but then a small uh armored car came, and they circled that because they didn't drive into the .</span> <span id="s323">They were afraid to drive in the field, but they circled it and whoever got up...and there were a lot of us still hidden...whoever got up and surrendered, they shot.</span> <span id="s324">They didn't take any more prisoners.</span> <span id="s325">We did not .</span> <span id="s326">They circled it and left, left the place.</span> <span id="s327">We got out and then we found a few more Russian...Soviet officers and we joined them and we were a welcomed addition to their group because by knowing Yiddish...I speak a little German too and I understand German quite well...uh they, they used to send us out uh scouting whenever we came to a village.</span> <span id="s328">So we traveled for about six weeks...the real uh German forces...uh at night we would sleep somewhere .</span> <span id="s329">Of course first we had to find out if they are friendly or unfriendly Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s330">They, they knew, these officers knew where and uh at night, at night we we walked.</span> <span id="s331">In the daytime we would stay in the villages.</span> <span id="s332">One uh...in every village we approached they used to send us to find out if German .</span> <span id="s333">One night we came to a little village and we came to...at the outskirts of the village there was a house and we knocked on the window and a woman came out, a peasant woman, and she grabbed us like this...you've gotten .</span> <span id="s334">And she came out and she says, the house is full of Germans.</span> <span id="s335">They are soldiers.</span> <span id="s336">The whole village is full of Germans already.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">This...where's their guard.</span> <span id="s338">He is sitting there over this rifle asleep.</span> <span id="s339">So of course we could have uh thrown a grenade in there and killed them all, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s340">The family would have been killed, and besides the whole village was full of Germans.</span> <span id="s341">They would (laughter) capture us in no time.</span> <span id="s342">So we slowly retreated and stayed in the forest till we went all around and came to the next town.</span> <span id="s343">And we were like this we traveled for about I suppose about six weeks, till the one point we crossed a a point where the uh town where the that changed hands several times the last few days, and we crossed a little river there and we came out and this was...I still remember...I I remember the date because it was uh the Russian revolution date, of the Russian...November 7th.</span> <span id="s344">We crossed and we we found the Russian sentry standing sleeping so we woke him up but and he told us where the headquarters are.</span> <span id="s345">We came there, and there they took us and sent us again to work battalions.</span> <span id="s346">That's a whole long story.</span> <span id="s347">Took us...they took us to uh Stalingrad, Stalingrad uh and we dug anti...anti-tank ditches.</span> <span id="s348">It was already winter.</span> <span id="s349">Uh the ground was frozen probably six feet and there was six feet cover of snow and we cleared the snow, dug the ditches.</span> <span id="s350">The the Germans never crossed them.</span> <span id="s351">They went all around.</span> <span id="s352">Was a waste of time.</span> <span id="s353">Uh with very little food.</span> <span id="s354">We stayed in peasants' houses worked together all the time.</span> <span id="s355">We stayed there for a few months till spring and in the spring they took us to another town and there they were building a railroad between...uh started between...on the other side of the , from , from the Caspian Sea, all the way past...I can't remember now the name of the city.</span> <span id="s356">Four hundred kilometers of railroad.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">There was no railroad on the other side of the Balkan.</span> <span id="s358">The Germans already occupied the territory, uh the west side.</span> <span id="s359">This was the eastern side of the Balkan.</span> <span id="s360">And then they built a railroad and this was administered by the MKBD, the uh prison authorities.</span> <span id="s361">And the workers were prisoners.</span> <span id="s362">We were not.</span> <span id="s363">We were work battalions but under their jurisdiction.</span> <span id="s364">So my friend and I were picked to guard headquarters, which was a very cushey job.</span> <span id="s365">rifle watch this would be free in the village not too many men, mostly women, but you got some food .</span> <span id="s366">Then one day there was a quarrel between the MKBD and the military uh don't make the by building that railroad and we stayed guards.</span> <span id="s367">.</span> <span id="s368">This was a very difficult job because it was all done by hand.</span> <span id="s369">Uh the territory there, the the topography, it's flat so we had to dig, you know, on the side of the road there and make a..</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">how do you call it when you make a railroad...a trestle...the the high mountain like...all by hand, yes, we did it by hand.</span> <span id="s372">There was one of the uh KPDB colonels used to come and inspect it.</span> <span id="s373">Happened to be Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">His name was and I I remember the name because it was in Hebrew, it was the name of , White Russian uh shirt, navy blue pants with shiny boots and he used to .</span> <span id="s375">And .</span> <span id="s376">And he used to the rations the prisoners get, so if if you made the norm...it was twelve cubic feet, whatever you had to by wheelbarrow build it all the way up.</span> <span id="s377">You got...there were three kinds of soup and a little bit of bread.</span> <span id="s378">If you made the norm, you got the one that had more...it was mostly millet (ph) soup, potato soup.</span> <span id="s379">If you made less, you got the second one or the third.</span> <span id="s380">Also made and couldn't work, you lost your...you had no strength, so I was there for about two months till we finished.</span> <span id="s381">survive and never , somewhere in the middle, but I survived.</span> <span id="s382">And then uh when we finished, they sent us to the front.</span> <span id="s383">And the front was Stalingrad, so we were across Stalingrad and on the other side of the , training in a forest.</span> <span id="s384">Training to join the forces Stalingrad.</span> <span id="s385">This was a .</span> <span id="s386">And we were there for about four, six weeks and then they decided to send us to the front.</span> <span id="s387">We were we were not in uniforms even yet.</span> <span id="s388">We had old uniforms, torn .</span> <span id="s389">uniforms ready for the front.</span> <span id="s390">We have to go through a political uh examination and then what they called it...a Soviet , a special, special division.</span> <span id="s391">But they had KBD examine you...are you worthy of dying for the , and when they came to me I had I had a cap .</span> <span id="s392">Veterans wear these kind of caps.</span> <span id="s393">In uh the Soviet Union they have red uh red on it, and this, all the officers wore that.</span> <span id="s394">I lost mine and the surrounding and once we found a a store of caps, of these and there was officers...all of the wore it, so I took one.</span> <span id="s395">I I wore it.</span> <span id="s396">Took a look at this and says are you an officer.</span> <span id="s397">I says no, I'm not an officer.</span> <span id="s398">So were did you get this cap?</span> <span id="s399">So I tell him I was surrounded by the German .</span> <span id="s400">That was it.</span> <span id="s401">So they took all those who were surrounded by Germans, and again those who they seemed uh they deemed not worthy or not trustworthy and the sent us away to the Euro (ph) Mountains.</span> <span id="s402">Uh part way by foot we walked and then by trains till we came...I think it was ...I can't remember the name...but I think it's Euro Mountains.</span> <span id="s403">It it was early fall but there was already snow and a thick pine forest in tents, and they said they were...they dig out of a a uh hole in the ground, put a tent over it, put a little uh wood-burning stove which had to be fed twenty-four hours a day.</span> <span id="s404">There was no shortage of wood around there, so we used to sit and you know feed that stove and sit around the thing to keep warm.</span> <span id="s405">And we stayed there for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s406">It was administered KBD, surrounded by barbed wire and that was it.</span> <span id="s407">We didn't know what's happening to us.</span> <span id="s408">After a few weeks they put us and took us under guard already, under guard, to the railroad station and they put us in...they used to call them the wagons.</span> <span id="s409">was the uh Minister of the Interior under the czarist the czarists uh government.</span> <span id="s410">And he designed these prisoners, these prisoner's uh wagons.</span> <span id="s411">They were like from the outside you saw passenger uh train un you know, railroad wagon, but inside it was the bars, specially designed for prisoners.</span> <span id="s412">Even though each car, each uh section was supposed to hold four or eight prisoners, they put sixteen and uh they gave us rations of about two hundred grams of uh dry bread used to get about ten grams of sugar, .</span> <span id="s413">And for two weeks we were in that train.</span> <span id="s414">Hungry, dirty...uh the guards were KBD.</span> <span id="s415">It so happened the guards used to have their own little kitchen where they cooked the soup and the bread, and so they ate, and they used to walk by our our uh compartment, our uh wagon, with that pail of soup, you know, go crazy.</span> <span id="s416">Very hungry and smell that soup.</span> <span id="s417">I I never, never had such a heavenly aroma.</span> <span id="s418">So we uh we .</span> <span id="s419">They were nice.</span> <span id="s420">They were all Georgian people, just guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">.</span> <span id="s422">We came out.</span> <span id="s423">It was a uh to the place where we was supposed to be, the coal mines near Moscow, and when we got out of the cars we couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s424">cramped and hungry.</span> <span id="s425">Slowly, gradually we started walking around and they took us to the barracks internees.</span> <span id="s426">We came in there.</span> <span id="s427">They didn't feed us for a day.</span> <span id="s428">The whole didn't have any food for us.</span> <span id="s429">Then we came there and we saw, all of a sudden we saw a group coming in from the shift that worked, all black, rags.</span> <span id="s430">dust.</span> <span id="s431">Sure enough they feed us about midnight.</span> <span id="s432">By morning we went to work in the coal mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: We're going to stop and change tapes......</span> <span id="s434">End of tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s436">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: We're back.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, the next day we went to the coal mines.</span> <span id="s439">I don't the size of the brigade, twenty, thirty people in a shift.</span> <span id="s440">We worked eight hours, three shifts, twenty-four hours.</span> <span id="s441">Uh coal mines are very difficult to work in.</span> <span id="s442">Uh we used to get a ration of bread which was about what the army used to get, which was not bad.</span> <span id="s443">six hundred grams.</span> <span id="s444">It reached twelve hundred grams.</span> <span id="s445">One kilogram to which was the highest ration of bread that anybody in the Soviet Union...more than the army.</span> <span id="s446">The armies get seven, eight hundred, but this was hard, physical labor.</span> <span id="s447">Eight hours of it.</span> <span id="s448">And we worked seven days a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">We uh...in the beginning it was hard to get used to the situation.</span> <span id="s450">We slept on on boards, just like in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s451">Later on we got uh straw mattresses, but in the beginning there was nothing.</span> <span id="s452">I had a great coat from the army which was already not much warmth in and in this we worked and in this slept and in this we walked...any...everything.</span> <span id="s453">There are no no change of clothes.</span> <span id="s454">Uh once a week there was a bath.</span> <span id="s455">Uh Russian baths are...they give you uh little wooden pails and there's hot water and cold water.</span> <span id="s456">You fill it.</span> <span id="s457">You're lucky if it doesn't leak and you wash yourself and you can shave...there there's a barber that shaves you, and uh you know, from the whole week coal dust your face was black and when they shaved you and all of a sudden (laughter) white here and black all around.</span> <span id="s458">You couldn't wash it (laughter) that much in one.....</span> <span id="s459">you got rid rid of it, and uh we stayed there for about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s460">Uh the worst thing was in the...if you worked in the winter...we came there in the winter.</span> <span id="s461">The first winter was something horrible.</span> <span id="s462">Uh this is near Mos... this is near Moscow but a hundred kilometers from Moscow.</span> <span id="s463">It was called the sub-Mos...Moscow uh uh coal fields.</span> <span id="s464">They dig uh the soft coal, not the good uh quality coal.</span> <span id="s465">And uh when they used to call you...they used to call us out by brigades and I was lucky to get in the first brigade.</span> <span id="s466">I was the first one to call, so if you worked in the first shift, which was from eight till four, they woke you up at five in the morning.</span> <span id="s467">By six some used to wash up, some .</span> <span id="s468">We had the long uh troughs, uh sinks-like with with cold water, no warm water.</span> <span id="s469">I somehow tried to use my fingers as a toothbrush and brush my teeth and wash my face.</span> <span id="s470">(Laughter) That didn't help much.</span> <span id="s471">There was no soap, and then get your bread ration uh bread ration and then you go to the uh cafeteria and you get your soup and you eat and about a half an hour later they called you to go to work.</span> <span id="s472">And you come out and you have to go one by one across the...they they the guard sitting in a little enclosure and they called your last name and you have to answer with your first name and your father's name.</span> <span id="s473">And if they found that somebody stole something from the camp...what to steal I don't know...uh, you know, they keep somebody so you stand and wait.</span> <span id="s474">They just take about an hour before the whole shift would be called.</span> <span id="s475">There was ten, ten uh brigades or so, and we used to stand and wait from the first one.</span> <span id="s476">It was horribly cold...forty below zero, and across the street there was a large, a large uh baking factory, a bakery, which was hugh and the smell of the fresh bread...it could drive you nuts.</span> <span id="s477">It was the worst thing...and the guards used to stand around you in sheep...sheepskin uh coats with the kelp (ph) boots and dogs... .</span> <span id="s478">We were standing shivering and the dogs...you got if you turned right or left they jumped you.</span> <span id="s479">Was the worst thing.</span> <span id="s480">And then we stand in fours and they take you into the coal mine.</span> <span id="s481">One day a a wagon with bread, a horse-drawn wagon, turned over.</span> <span id="s482">It was on the road to the uh to the mine.</span> <span id="s483">And, you know, it was snow, and it turned over.</span> <span id="s484">I don't remember if it was a sleigh or or or a wagon, but it was like a box, you know, for delivery.</span> <span id="s485">It turned over...a few hundred loaves of bread and it disappeared in two minutes.</span> <span id="s486">(Laughter) I I couldn't get any but a friend of mine...if you lived there, very, you know, very close to each other, regardless.</span> <span id="s487">I was the only Jew.</span> <span id="s488">Later on I saw another Jew, and there were three...then I found out there were three more Jews toward another part...but that bread disappeared.</span> <span id="s489">He gave me a piece of that bread and and we stood at the mine and worked and the norm was twelve uh tons in eight hours.</span> <span id="s490">Uh I was...I used to dig the coal.</span> <span id="s491">Later on we we got uh some explosives to explode it before we dig it, and I had girls load it on the conveyer belt, metal conveyor belt.</span> <span id="s492">That was it.</span> <span id="s493">So we stayed there for about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s494">Then again, after Stalingrad they started taking uh German prisoners.</span> <span id="s495">They needed the place for them.</span> <span id="s496">They let us free.</span> <span id="s497">But not to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">You had to stay and work in the mine as a free coal miner.</span> <span id="s499">By the way, the coal miners are the elite of Soviet workers, you know.</span> <span id="s500">They get the highest uh pay...at that time we didn't...the highest pay.</span> <span id="s501">They have access to cars now and at that time it was...we had access to a higher ration of bread.</span> <span id="s502">Then they transferred us to another mine, a few kilometers away, and there we were free already.</span> <span id="s503">Again, we we lived in barracks but I mean no no guards.</span> <span id="s504">It was like uh workers' quarters.</span> <span id="s505">And there it was a little easier.</span> <span id="s506">You know, a lot of girls and young men...you know, it was...uh I have some good memories of that time, even though we always hungry a little bit, a little bit...not too bad and we used to get...if you made the norm used to get a hundred grams of vodka or a hundred grams of uh uh pork, and I used to...(laughter)...suck with the skin on it.</span> <span id="s507">To the last drop, delicious.</span> <span id="s508">I think I couldn't touch it...we ate it.</span> <span id="s509">And we had enough...well, not enough...always hungry a little bit.</span> <span id="s510">We had two meals a day, the bread...and and I never had, I have...a lot to eat and I never could save up my bread for an extra meal.</span> <span id="s511">I had to finish it from the beginning to the end, but we ate in a in a cafeteria.</span> <span id="s512">They served us meals there.</span> <span id="s513">Uh this lasted till '45.</span> <span id="s514">The war ended and we celebrated.</span> <span id="s515">We got beer.</span> <span id="s516">We had...there was another camp near us, next to ours, which was the same as we had before.</span> <span id="s517">Guarded, but they...up to...they had to be there to sleep in the camp, but I mean they had freedom to move around uh after work, and to work they went by themselves, without guards, you know.</span> <span id="s518">This was this was Soviet Germans, not German prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s519">They were Soviet Germans.</span> <span id="s520">Some of them didn't even know German.</span> <span id="s521">They came from they, a lot of them from the Vulga (ph), near the Vulga.</span> <span id="s522">There was a German uh autonomic region which had...I I happened to walk by by the way through my wanderings I happened to go by there when they were resettled, in 1941, when the war started.</span> <span id="s523">The .</span> <span id="s524">There were about a million and a half of them.</span> <span id="s525">They were resettled.</span> <span id="s526">Never came back.</span> <span id="s527">And I saw the difference between their villages and the the Russian villages.</span> <span id="s528">They were laid off, even streets were laid out, you know.</span> <span id="s529">Each one named Karl Marx Straussen (ph), uh Straussen and so on and so on and they had each house was the same, with an oven to bake bread on the outside, with wide streets, not paved but beautifully laid out.</span> <span id="s530">They had autonomy.</span> <span id="s531">They had schools taught in German.</span> <span id="s532">I met these people in in in the coal mine, in the next coal mine, so they...and and and we celebrated the end of the war.</span> <span id="s533">It was May 5th I think it ended, Russian date .</span> <span id="s534">And we picked a fight with these Germans and I got a black eye.</span> <span id="s535">I got drunk, got beer.</span> <span id="s536">Didn't see beer, you know, for ages.</span> <span id="s537">(Laughter) But we we got drunk.</span> <span id="s538">Some of them were our very good friends.</span> <span id="s539">There wasn't only the Germans but there were others who they didn't know...there was a fellow there who was of Finnish extraction, a a Moscovite (ph).</span> <span id="s540">Very nice fellow.</span> <span id="s541">He was an engineer I think.</span> <span id="s542">He was...he used to fix the conveyor belts in the mine.</span> <span id="s543">.</span> <span id="s544">Eric was his first name.</span> <span id="s545">I met his mother while I was in Moscow later on and we were very very good friends.</span> <span id="s546">Then one day I was sitting in the mine.</span> <span id="s547">Uh we used to be...we used to welcome if the conveyor belt would break, you see.</span> <span id="s548">Then you couldn't work.</span> <span id="s549">You had to sit down.</span> <span id="s550">It was the (laughter) it was in the fall, and I was sitting there on a pile of coal uh waiting till they fix it, and all of a sudden I heard something .</span> <span id="s551">(Laughter) It was...(pause)...I get even emotional now about it.</span> <span id="s552">He was uh...I walked over to the corner, the next corridor and there's a fellow sitting on the uh...we used to call them coates (ph)...it was a the little wagon on the rails, you know...it was a narrow gauge rail and they delivered the uh lumber to keep these you know...you use lumber in mines for holding up the the roof.</span> <span id="s553">Usually it is dry pine but during the war anything will do, so we had very heavy...and they used to deliver it with that wagon and it was not closed but it has four posts, four posts loaded to bring it.</span> <span id="s554">We used to laugh at them because this was the easy work, see.</span> <span id="s555">We were in the mine and they delivered and go back.</span> <span id="s556">And uh we are sitting down resting...I knew him, I saw him with the Germans from the German camp.</span> <span id="s557">says who are you?</span> <span id="s558">Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s559">I said of course.</span> <span id="s560">So they they they didn't know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s561">They...it's a Romanian Jew.</span> <span id="s562">A Romanian Jew.</span> <span id="s563">And they didn't know what to do with him and they put him in the in the uh camp with the Germans, so he had it both ways.</span> <span id="s564">The Germans used to call him dirty Jew, and to the Russians, to the Russians he was a dirty German.</span> <span id="s565">(Laughter) So he was in the middle.</span> <span id="s566">So we had a talk and wished him a happy New Year.</span> <span id="s567">We didn't know it.</span> <span id="s568">We didn't know then when any holiday is.</span> <span id="s569">But this, even now I talk about this.</span> <span id="s570">You'll forgive me.</span> <span id="s571">(Pause) Good old days.</span> <span id="s572">So anyway, we worked there till '45 and the Poles and the Soviets agreed to let all those Jews and Poles who were, lived in Poland in 1939 to leave the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s573">I applied and it took me a whole year before they gave me permission to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Wherever there were uh great concentrations of Jews there was no problem.</span> <span id="s575">They put them in trains, you know, and sent them to Poland.</span> <span id="s576">But wherever there was one or two, you had to go to the NKBD and they tried to dissuade you.</span> <span id="s577">What you going to do?</span> <span id="s578">What you going to Poland?</span> <span id="s579">You are a Jew.</span> <span id="s580">They hate Jews.</span> <span id="s581">Say well now there are People's Republic of Poland...they are like communists.</span> <span id="s582">They said they'll never be good communists.</span> <span id="s583">(Laughter) Sure enough, sure enough.</span> <span id="s584">So...but in '46...I forgot there was another Jew.</span> <span id="s585">The director, the director of the mine was a Jew.</span> <span id="s586">The Russians (laughter) couldn't understand how come you are working in the mine.</span> <span id="s587">Why don't you....so but we didn't have much in common because we didn't have any social .</span> <span id="s588">One day I came in and he was taking a haircut and I was waiting for a haircut.</span> <span id="s589">And he wrote down...in Russian everything you have to write down a statement, you know, whatever you want, so one day I wrote down I wanted to go to the army.</span> <span id="s590">But the war was not finished yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">And I wrote that I already found out that my family perished.</span> <span id="s592">I got a letter when I was in the first mine.</span> <span id="s593">I..</span> <span id="s594">.</span> <span id="s595">when the front approached my town, uh they were probably fifty to a hundred miles uh kilometers away...I wrote a letter to my home town, to whoever may...whoever, you know, uh got it and the and the local Soviet there, they'll know who I am.</span> <span id="s596">They'll know the family, because it was a small town.</span> <span id="s597">I figured whoever will get it, I will find out something.</span> <span id="s598">So I wrote and the town was not yet liberated, but the next town east was liberated, and a friend of mine worked in the post office.</span> <span id="s599">There were already established post offices and he worked in the post office and he intercepted that letter.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">And he wrote to my brother who was already, who was in the partisans and he told me about .</span> <span id="s601">In 19...when when the Germans occupied our town in 1941 uh there was a uh big oil dump in our town that the Soviets built and when they retreated in 1941, from '39 to '41 they built it...in '41 when the Germans occupied it, they exploded it and a lot of this...it was aviation oil, aviation uh fuel...uh leaked into the soil, sandy soil, so they used the Jews to squeeze out that oil, that fuel from from the soil and turn it over to the Germans.</span> <span id="s602">Now the Jews had the opportunity to steal some of it and trade it with the peasants for food, so for a year they lived not bad.</span> <span id="s603">Although here and there they would kill a Jew or beat up...my brother was beaten up, my father was beaten up, but it was not so bad.</span> <span id="s604">They didn't know what's going on in the whole world, or the next town even, but there was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s605">They could move and they lived not bad with this, you know, relatively not bad.</span> <span id="s606">Uh 1940, until 19...till 1942, for a whole year and then in '42 uh they heard rumors that the nearby city of , which had a population of about twenty thousand Jews, was burned in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s607">And other towns, here and there somebody will escape and you know, word gets around, so a group of young people decided to leave the town and to go into the forest.</span> <span id="s608">They knew that something will happen.</span> <span id="s609">So they made some make-shift arms...uh board uh which uh spring that would fire a bullet if you could find one.</span> <span id="s610">Probably would kill you first, and uh they prepared to escape, a few youngsters, probably about twenty of them between the age of twelve, fourteen to twenty-four.</span> <span id="s611">My brother...my brother was...a friend of mine went into that came and and I got him settled in my town and he then couldn't escape.</span> <span id="s612">So they organized a group to go to the forest, uh get some arms so they can go to the peasants and terrorize them into giving them some food, , get some food and about...over twenty left.</span> <span id="s613">Half of them survived.</span> <span id="s614">Among them were my two brothers.</span> <span id="s615">They left the night before the ghetto was destroyed.</span> <span id="s616">They...there was no ghetto till that day.</span> <span id="s617">It was a week before Rosh Hashannah, in 1942, when they decided to kill the Jewish population in this the Ukraine, so they surrounded the town with Ukrainian police.</span> <span id="s618">Nobody out, nobody in.</span> <span id="s619">They brought in all the gypsies they could find into this ghetto.</span> <span id="s620">Uh they brought in all the Jews that lived in little villages, one family, two families they brought.</span> <span id="s621">Some they killed right there, but the majority they brought and put into this town and they knew already that something is happening, so the night before before it happened...it was on a Friday, twenty-three days a week before Rosh Hasshannan.</span> <span id="s622">Uh my friend...friend of mine who lives in Israel told me this story...came to urge my brothers to join them.</span> <span id="s623">They planned it before, but they couldn't leave the family and they felt you know they are abandoning the...my two sisters.</span> <span id="s624">One of my sisters was called to white-wash the ceiling in the railroad which was a big, tall you know, high ceiling and she fell and broke her leg so she couldn't even move.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">And my father, when he tried to convince them not to let let us...we are young...maybe we will survive somehow.</span> <span id="s626">So my mother went and two of my brothers...we also had a cousin that came from Warsaw, to the next guard a peasant of our village that she knew...you knew, you know everybody.</span> <span id="s627">And she gave him some uh warm clothes that we still have left, you know, fur-lined jackets...not not mink but sheepskin uh and he he let them through.</span> <span id="s628">He let them through.</span> <span id="s629">He could have uh he could have killed them all.</span> <span id="s630">Now take away everything and that's it, but he didn't do it.</span> <span id="s631">So these boys left.</span> <span id="s632">My mother went back home.</span> <span id="s633">Uh they went out...they had a point in the forest where to meet and my mother went back, of course, and the next day they rounded them all up, shot them to exploded .</span> <span id="s634">Uh my brothers left and went to the forest and went to terrorize some peasants, got some food and organized a partisan group to fight the Germans, with what, how I don't know.</span> <span id="s635">Uh a little bit later some escaped Soviet prisoners of war joined them and a lot of...all the people came.</span> <span id="s636">It was a civilian camp.</span> <span id="s637">And some of them uh craftsmen, you know, uh blacksmiths, uh uh they built, built stoves and uh stone masons, uh tailors...because there were a lot of Jews in the little towns did these things, you know, most of them.</span> <span id="s638">Some had a small trade see, and they they were needed, you know, because they built uh the stoves and the the uh they called it, uh they dug a hole and lined it with wood and slept in it.</span> <span id="s639">And they accumulated some stores of food and they were ready to do some damage to the Germans.</span> <span id="s640">The uh this territory where we lived had some unexploded artillery shells from the 1st World War yet, and the young kids, twelve, fourteen years old...some of them survived ...used to take out the explosives from there, put in a detonator and make a mine to put under the railroad lines where the Germans shipped, you know, war supplies and and troops to the front, but it was way back already behind the German lines, so they used to uh...they got in touch with Soviet, you know, Soviet army.</span> <span id="s641">They dropped by parachute more arms and they were uh really an effective fighting force.</span> <span id="s642">Uh my old...my younger brother...I was the oldest...one day they they had their own uh spy network among the peasants.</span> <span id="s643">They found out they're going to be attacked by the Germans.</span> <span id="s644">Uh sure enough within a short time they were attacked, but before before...but they really were attacked they decided to move the camp deeper into the forest.</span> <span id="s645">They had to forge a river and uh but they had some stores of food and didn't want to abandon it, so they left some guards to guard it and among them was my brother.</span> <span id="s646">Uh so when they came with this force attacked...the force consisted of Germans, lots of troops...Russian, the Ukrainian police, my brother was standing guard and when he saw it was too late already .</span> <span id="s647">To do anything he shot in the air and the others that were were supposed to replace him...there were about five sets of them boys...one of them was my cousin...my brother was away already at the new camp, the other brother... .</span> <span id="s648">Some were wounded but the majority survived the attack.</span> <span id="s649">They moved further and got stronger, stronger, stronger.</span> <span id="s650">German troop movements .</span> <span id="s651">That's a story though that not many people know about but this Ukrainian uh Ukrainian police forest, very thick forest and the swamps.</span> <span id="s652">There were thousands and thousands of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">So uh I I thought you might be interested...(yes)...in this story because very little is taught uh uh is taught or talked or written about uh Jewish resistance.</span> <span id="s654">.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I received a letter...this was in the middle...we were, I was still in the camp under guard.</span> <span id="s657">I received a letter from my brother.</span> <span id="s658">Uh I am in .</span> <span id="s659">This is a city in the Ukraine and uh I find that he is OK, and so not to worry about fact.</span> <span id="s660">Later I received a letter from my friend, the one that intercepted my letter, his brother...I received a letter describing in detail what happened.</span> <span id="s661">So they were not far away.</span> <span id="s662">(Pause - crying) Funny thing...at that time I did not cry.</span> <span id="s663">Nothing.</span> <span id="s664">They uh...anyway uh this was...I I was in touch with my brother for a while.</span> <span id="s665">Later on I got a letter from...he left.</span> <span id="s666">He is somewhere.</span> <span id="s667">Couldn't tell me where.</span> <span id="s668">Left for Poland and later on for Italy and he says uh...(pause)...I didn't meet him until 1946 in Italy, so I didn't get any more from him.</span> <span id="s669">I didn't hear any more.</span> <span id="s670">He sent me some money.</span> <span id="s671">You know, he was in in Rome...he joined...he was guarding an MKBD village, a farm.</span> <span id="s672">They put him...as a former partisan he was still armed and they put him to guard this, and while guarding this this farm there was some group in these former partisans who started dealing in the black market.</span> <span id="s673">They were going to arrest him, so he escaped.</span> <span id="s674">He didn't do it, but some of his uh friends did it, so he escaped and he went to where again they put him in the army and a friend of his and then they sent him, they sent him to Poland escorting a group of Polish deserters from the Polish army, so he took a group to Warsaw, turned them over, came back, and then they sent him the next, second time.</span> <span id="s675">Second time we knew already the Brichah (ph) is working in Poland and he and his...there were two of them, two boys.</span> <span id="s676">One of them still lives in New York...they left...turned over...they did not leave these prisoners...(laughter)...you know, they turned them over to the proper authorities and then disappeared.</span> <span id="s677">From there they went to Romania and from Romania they went somehow to Italy.</span> <span id="s678">So he was in Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: I was in in still in the mine.</span> <span id="s681">In 1946 I got my permission to leave.</span> <span id="s682">I'll never forget that day.</span> <span id="s683">I was walking...you know uh everyone of us has a little bit of uh superstition, like cat crosses your way, a peasant with empty pails going to the for water...that's a very bad sign, but full pails is a very good sign.</span> <span id="s684">That's an old Ukrainian proverb, and living among them you acquire these uh traits, and when I was walking...I, they called me about five times during that year trying to dissuade me not to go.</span> <span id="s685">My uh...what was my argument I I lost my family.</span> <span id="s686">I don't know...uh maybe somebody survived.</span> <span id="s687">Maybe somebody is in Poland.</span> <span id="s688">I wanted...I want to try to find them.</span> <span id="s689">Nothing against the Soviet uh Union because Poland now is also a republic, you know, you are the same people, so finally I came in and I was walking through the mines of the district uh town...was about eight kilometers, and I come into the town.</span> <span id="s690">It was uh April already or March...things were</span></p> <p><span id="s691">melting (laughter) path.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">.</span> <span id="s693">I came in and there is a woman with two empty pails crossing my that's it.</span> <span id="s694">I'll never get home.</span> <span id="s695">I come into there, come into the office and there's a city dressed woman sitting there with a stack of papers with pictures on it that I could read it, you know, in Russian and in Polish, and the uh captain or major says well Slivka, what do you think?</span> <span id="s696">Still don't want to change your mind?</span> <span id="s697">Still want to go to Poland?</span> <span id="s698">I don't know what to answer.</span> <span id="s699">I say if possible I would like to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">OK.</span> <span id="s701">Pulls out my paper.</span> <span id="s702">I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s703">(Laughter) I I felt like I was in a..</span> <span id="s704">.</span> <span id="s705">after all, where am I going?</span> <span id="s706">I am going to Poland with...nobody there.</span> <span id="s707">I didn't know where, what do to think, where to go, but get out of this this .</span> <span id="s708">So I went back to my and I had to do all the formalities, get myself off the roster of the army, (laughter).</span> <span id="s709">I wasn't in the army for years.</span> <span id="s710">Uh I went to this uh director and asked him for at least a little clothes.</span> <span id="s711">He gave me a little jacket to put on and I uh went uh I have a pair of uh canvas boots.</span> <span id="s712">They have an army pants dyed blue and I had this uh shirt and I have a pair of underwear with long and I had this hat and with that I went to Moscow.</span> <span id="s713">I come to Moscow and there was a union of Polish patriots.</span> <span id="s714">So now since I'm going to Poland, I'm a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s715">All of a sudden I'm I'm a Pole.</span> <span id="s716">(laughter) I was...I was telling the story when I come to Israel because they call us Anglo-Saxons.</span> <span id="s717">(Laughter) When I lived in Poland I was a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s718">In Russia I was a dirty Polish Jew.</span> <span id="s719">And then I come to America (laughter) I am Russian.</span> <span id="s720">When I go to Israel I am Anglo-Saxon.</span> <span id="s721">(Laughter) Anyway now I am a Pole, see, and I go into the a union of Polish patriots.</span> <span id="s722">Was organized by a Polish writer by the name of .</span> <span id="s723">I knew her from...very liberal Polish writer.</span> <span id="s724">She was socialist.</span> <span id="s725">And they give me there a piece of Ivory soap and they give me a can of uh uh...what do you call that ...not concentrated...the uh...anyway it's not the thick one, the other one, and they give me a piece of flannel cloth.</span> <span id="s726">What for I don't know, but it was worth something on the black market, you know.</span> <span id="s727">And they gave me a pair of ski pants.</span> <span id="s728">(Laughter) Ski pants.</span> <span id="s729">That's what they had.</span> <span id="s730">Ski pants.</span> <span id="s731">So everything was worth anything there in Poland or in Russia you couldn't get any.</span> <span id="s732">So I thanked them and then I went to the Polish uh consulate and they ordered a railway ticket, railroad ticket for me in a sleeper, no less, to Warsaw, to Poland.</span> <span id="s733">So I went to the uh to pick up the tourist, in touriste (ph) to pick up my ticket and the...I paid them.</span> <span id="s734">They gave me the money to pay for it and I'm ready to go.</span> <span id="s735">I came to the train.</span> <span id="s736">There in Russia every every uh railroad car has a woman, a so-called leader, the the guide there, and she takes a look at me and says you doesn't belong here.</span> <span id="s737">(Laughter) I show her I have a ticket.</span> <span id="s738">She let me in and we were in a in a compartment of four of us.</span> <span id="s739">There was a Russian woman who worked with the occupation forces in Germany and there was a major, air force major who taught Polish pilots.</span> <span id="s740">There was a Polish-Russian Polish young lieutenant who spoke bad, very bad Polish.</span> <span id="s741">He was born in Russia and myself and uh we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s742">They participated...I got some bread which they didn't have.</span> <span id="s743">The fellow, the major, got his ration at the next station there.</span> <span id="s744">We played cards together and had the opportunity for the first time to speak Polish with this Polish officer you know in many years and we wound up, we went through brisk, fresh Polish and uh we crossed over the border through the uh customs, check my suitcase.</span> <span id="s745">It was a wooden suitcase I had a and uh we were in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s746">changed trains.</span> <span id="s747">At the gate we changed you know.</span> <span id="s748">you had to go to town.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Uh I traveled all night and I know the which train to take and I came to Lodz and in Lodz there was Jewish life, Jewish committee.</span> <span id="s750">They gave me some clothes, and there was a place...they used to call it Misery Hotel.</span> <span id="s751">.</span> <span id="s752">It was a former ghetto.</span> <span id="s753">It used to be the the workshops where they had set up wooden beds, straw mattresses, DDT.</span> <span id="s754">They came in there and they sprayed you with DDT and you used to get a portion of bread and bean soup.</span> <span id="s755">It was delicious.</span> <span id="s756">White bread, bread, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Was excellent.</span> <span id="s758">But you couldn't stay there more than a week or two at the most because people were coming all the time from Russia, from concentration camps, all over.</span> <span id="s759">And I knew Lodz, Lodz the city, and I had many friends there before the war but who knows where or what.</span> <span id="s760">Lodz was more beautiful than ...Lodz was like a city.</span> <span id="s761">Uh it was no industrial city and there was big buildings, not too clean, but they cleaned it up before the war.</span> <span id="s762">Poland had a..</span> <span id="s763">.</span> <span id="s764">while while they were threatened by war they had to call an action urbaniza...urbanization (ph)...to make the cities and towns look great.</span> <span id="s765">They had to paint them.</span> <span id="s766">They had to clean them, so even the the the the streetcars in in Lodz had that drab green color on it before the war, were painted two colors and they looked pretty except the .</span> <span id="s767">the ghetto because it was all destroyed .</span> <span id="s768">After the Jewish left, the Poles uh tore out all the good...the the doors and the windows for kindling wood and uh ninety percent of those were destroyed except so it was a very the depressing picture.</span> <span id="s769">The rest of the city was not touched, except .</span> <span id="s770">And this was in the ghetto where we stayed, so what do you do?</span> <span id="s771">Uh one day I was standing and a fellow comes over and we an old friend of my, before the war, and he told me about a few more survivors that were in hiding or in camps.</span> <span id="s772">I met a former girlfriend of mine there.</span> <span id="s773">I knew .</span> <span id="s774">She was married already so... uh but it was....</span> <span id="s775">I tried to meet people, but what to do you do, so I entered a kibbutz.</span> <span id="s776">There were several kibbutz even in Poland in Warsaw all set up.</span> <span id="s777">Uh Jewish life was restored, you know, to whatever could be done.</span> <span id="s778">There were schools already, but not too many kids, but there were schools.</span> <span id="s779">And kibbutz seemed the so I and I entered it and when I came there they asked do you speak Hebrew and I said yes.</span> <span id="s780">They start speaking to me.</span> <span id="s781">I understand every word...I couldn't say a word for so many years you know.</span> <span id="s782">So anyway I stayed and lived in this kibbutz for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s783">I was elected to the leadership of the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s784">I was the treasurer the uh....I .</span> <span id="s785">In all my work I'm always treasurer, never president.</span> <span id="s786">(laughter) So I uh...there was enough to eat but enough bread.</span> <span id="s787">was supplied by the Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s788">After a couple of months we were on our way.</span> <span id="s789">.</span> <span id="s790">We crossed the border from Poland to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s791">Usually the the Czechs let us in, no problem, but before before and uh but the Poles, we had to bribe the guards so it so happened that night we crossed there were new guards.</span> <span id="s792">bribe before, bribe again, and we got through.</span> <span id="s793">We got to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s794">We were in Prague.</span> <span id="s795">We were in Brataslavia (ph) and uh crossing...we had to cross through uh Soviet Soviet-occupied territory.</span> <span id="s796">There were the four zones in Austria.</span> <span id="s797">The French, uh British, American, Russian.</span> <span id="s798">We were forbidden to speak Yiddish or Russian.</span> <span id="s799">No Polish.</span> <span id="s800">cross the Russian zone.</span> <span id="s801">So we...we were allowed to speak Hebrew, but if you did...I did and a few others did and I heard Czechs uh commenting funny kind of people don't speak .</span> <span id="s802">Alright.</span> <span id="s803">They don't understand our language.</span> <span id="s804">In our language, usually you know naturally a person will speak in his own language, even if you don't understand it.</span> <span id="s805">But they don't speak at all.</span> <span id="s806">What kind...can't understand this kind of people.</span> <span id="s807">We already had documents of Greek Jews uh Greeks uh Turkish...all kinds of names and we came to Austria and the , to cover a beautiful villa in the French, French zone.</span> <span id="s808">One bad thing was there was no food.</span> <span id="s809">Very little food.</span> <span id="s810">We used to get black bread for five people I think everyday.</span> <span id="s811">.</span> <span id="s812">I was in charge of food for...there was probably six to eight hundred people there and I would keep...our group was in charge of the .</span> <span id="s813">I</span></p> <p><span id="s814">I..</span> <span id="s815">.</span> <span id="s816">we had...I remember used to get a little meat and cook a soup for everybody, and some of the people that cooked, the cooks, .</span> <span id="s817">Everybody was hungry.</span> <span id="s818">I I just couldn't...I uh ate what everybody else ate.</span> <span id="s819">I could take some bread there was some milk for children, pregnant women.</span> <span id="s820">Pregnant women were transported through the uh Jewish Brigade of the British Army, dressed in British uniforms.</span> <span id="s821">(Laughter) They they did a marvelous job.</span> <span id="s822">Brichah was .</span> <span id="s823">A friend of mine worked in it.</span> <span id="s824">He's in Israel now.</span> <span id="s825">.</span> <span id="s826">And uh you found yourself there and while there I got...the Joint Distribution Committee gave...delivered to me a telegram from my brother that had been waiting there for months.</span> <span id="s827">He was in Italy.</span> <span id="s828">He knew I would (laughter) have to wind up somewhere there, so he he addressed it to me and through the my name on the list, I got this telegram, with his address.</span> <span id="s829">Uh we...the the group...all of a sudden, all all the crossing points were closed from from Austria to Italy.</span> <span id="s830">They they...the police and the French authorities...I used to have a warm feeling for French...not since then.</span> <span id="s831">So they decided they'll try...they most obvious of the .</span> <span id="s832">Maybe Hungarian guards.</span> <span id="s833">So they sent a group to try it, between twenty and thirty people...I was in this group...and sure enough we took them on a train uh on a truck uh with an Israeli British soldier.</span> <span id="s834">He had some money to transfer there...which he threw away when we we were caught.</span> <span id="s835">We were caught by the Austrian border guards under the British, you know, command and they arrested us and put us in jail there and beat us up...not too much...a little bit.</span> <span id="s836">Not so much the Austrians.</span> <span id="s837">And the next morning they took us to Innsbruck.</span> <span id="s838">Beautiful city.</span> <span id="s839">And they...by rail, the railroad station, and they told us to go into a train.</span> <span id="s840">They'll send us to a camp, uh DP camp.</span> <span id="s841">We didn't know where.</span> <span id="s842">We didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s843">We wanted to go to our camp.</span> <span id="s844">So they trained a machine gun on us and says, if you don't go, I'll kill you.</span> <span id="s845">We didn't know whether he was bluffing or not, but .</span> <span id="s846">While standing there the the Austrians around us beat us up.</span> <span id="s847">the would come from the side and hit us from the side.</span> <span id="s848">you know, people that were waiting for trains after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Anyway we stood for about an hour.</span> <span id="s850">Finally they presented don't worry.</span> <span id="s851">We'll get you out, so they us sent us to a camp with Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s852">Uh there was a little bit...there was no .</span> <span id="s853">He did not...they did not say anything.</span> <span id="s854">He did not say anything.</span> <span id="s855">We, you know...hello...goodby.</span> <span id="s856">We got our the next day there.</span> <span id="s857">We could leave individually.</span> <span id="s858">We could get out.</span> <span id="s859">Was no...there was a guard at the the...but not...they didn't prevent us from leaving so I and another fellow went to our main camp which was about fifty kilometers away.</span> <span id="s860">We told them our situation.</span> <span id="s861">Here we are.</span> <span id="s862">Within a week or so a truck came with again another Israeli brigade soldier uh with orders to release us.</span> <span id="s863">How kosher these orders were I don't know, but he talked to the Austrian an American.</span> <span id="s864">She says but your English is...she spoke English, he spoke English...your English sounds British.</span> <span id="s865">He says, well, he says...gave her a story and they took us and that same evening across the border again with a group of probably about six hundred Jews....women, men, some children .</span> <span id="s866">I was assigned the rear guard to make sure nobody was left.</span> <span id="s867">We went through the Alps, all night long and in the morning we found ourself in Italy and in Italy we had to be very careful because the Italians catch you, it's jail.</span> <span id="s868">The Italian jails are .</span> <span id="s869">Turkish jails are the worst in Europe.</span> <span id="s870">So they uh...we stayed in two hunting camps, small little enclosures, and all day long without food after crossing the Alps and at at night the trucks came again from British army trucks with officers in this already uniforms and they have ID papers for all of us with new names.</span> <span id="s871">It was a group that's Italian, you know, DP camp, kibbutz.</span> <span id="s872">Uh two, three, you know, went to see the Alps .</span> <span id="s873">And everything was fine.</span> <span id="s874">The Italians at that time, if you showed them something in English you could go anywhere you wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">And they took us to....in the middle of the kibbutz we were already was already in Italy, already in a camp, in a villa near .</span> <span id="s876">And they brought us to to Milan and there for the first time I saw grapes in ten years probably.</span> <span id="s877">They gave me some money.</span> <span id="s878">I went to buy of grapes and they took us...there was a place in in Milan .</span> <span id="s879">There was a synagogue on the second floor and there was a kosher restaurant there and they took us in for a meal.</span> <span id="s880">We had apple butter served, meat and soup and bread, like like a normal resta...(laughter)...the first time in many years.</span> <span id="s881">Funny thing.</span> <span id="s882">I came to Portland.</span> <span id="s883">I met a fellow whose father owned that restaurant.</span> <span id="s884">So it was uh and we stayed there a couple of days.</span> <span id="s885">Then I met some friends who knew my brother through the partisans and but I went to my kibbutz and a few days uh a few weeks later uh a friend of my brother who used to uh travel between Milan and my brother was in near Bari (ph) the south, so at least.</span> <span id="s886">.</span> <span id="s887">they used to do business.</span> <span id="s888">They came and took me and brought me to my brother.</span> <span id="s889">We decided to not to part.</span> <span id="s890">I left my kibbutz.</span> <span id="s891">I got a few letters from them.</span> <span id="s892">I was deserting actually (laughter) but I I decided to go wherever, wherever we go together.</span> <span id="s893">So I registered.</span> <span id="s894">In this camp we were in the...in a place near called .</span> <span id="s895">Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s896">And then we moved to Bari to a transient camp which was internment camp during the war for German, Austrian and and Yugoslavian Jews under Mussolini, and there we stayed for about two years.</span> <span id="s897">In 1948 I got I got my visa to go to the United State and uh on June 19th, 1948, I arrived in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Came to Boston.</span> <span id="s900">My uh my cousin, my aunt lived in , Rhode Island and her son lived in Boston, Brighton (ph).</span> <span id="s901">So uh I came.</span> <span id="s902">It was a Saturday that day, and my cousin came to pick me up at the boat.</span> <span id="s903">I came by boat, ship...it was called ...was two two ships I guess anyway.</span> <span id="s904">He picked me up and took me into a friend of his in Brookline and the lady told me how to use the faucet with cold and hot water.</span> <span id="s905">She said this is hot water really (laughter) because we come from after all from Russia, and then she told me what a a telephone means.</span> <span id="s906">She says you can talk all over the United States on this thing here .</span> <span id="s907">And we stayed there until afternoon because my my uh my cousin had his father-in-law living with him...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: .</span> <span id="s909">We're almost out of time.</span> <span id="s910">Can you just tell us when you moved from New York to Boston.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Well I came to Boston.</span> <span id="s912">I uh came to...then I..</span> <span id="s913">.</span> <span id="s914">it was '48...it was very difficult trying to find a job.</span> <span id="s915">I found a job in , Rhode Island and I worked a few months then lost it.</span> <span id="s916">It was through kind of a till degree was done.</span> <span id="s917">Then I got a job in Hyde Park near Boston and at that time I decided to get an education, so I went to Bentley (ph) College for three years.</span> <span id="s918">Graduated and then got a job in Portland, Maine.</span> <span id="s919">In Portland I worked for thirteen years and developed a practice of my own.</span> <span id="s920">Our second daughter was born.</span> <span id="s921">I got married in the meantime in Boston.</span> <span id="s922">Uh met my wife on a blind date and we uh came in 1953...our daughter was just born and a year later, a year and a half later my other daughter was born and we lived there till now.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q:</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Uh it's very difficult.</span> <span id="s925">It it affected everyone of us differently.</span> <span id="s926">I I I did not loose trust in people.</span> <span id="s927">I still believe...I still trust people and and it it developed me a sense of uh responsibility for other people.</span> <span id="s928">I I have to do something for...I have to help.</span> <span id="s929">If I find people that were in the same situation that I am and I am in a little better situation, I I feel it's my oppor....my my my uh my...I am obliged to help that.</span> <span id="s930">I I don't know how to describe it but it's it's a kind of obsession.</span> <span

some mixed feelings, but I I had to prove to myself that here I am preaching tolerance, preaching uh you know, nondiscrim...preaching against prejudice.</span> <span id="s933">I cannot be prejudiced against them.</span> <span id="s934">These people who don't know anything about it and I had to force myself to work with them, and it's quite rewarding.</span> <span id="s935">You can't you can't imagine the rewarding feeling when you come in, they call you to the middle of the night to a hospital and there's a young couple with a little child who cannot breathe, and they cannot tell them what's wrong, and you come in and help them and the doctor gives them a needle and the kid smiles and the parents don't know how to thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">That's great reward.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s938">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #2 Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
