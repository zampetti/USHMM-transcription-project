id="s4">I am Anthony Di Iorio of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s5">I am in the home of Mr. George Brieger, New York City and I’m here on behalf of the US Holocaust Museum to interview George about the experience of his father and uncle during the Holocaust in Hungary.</span> <span id="s6">Good evening George.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Hi, how are you.</span> <span id="s8">My father Anno Brieger was born in Nyathalas near Hungary on 1925.</span> <span id="s9">He lived most of his childhood in Nyireghaza which was the city of the region, the bigger city.</span> <span id="s10">Although his grandmother, that’s his father’s mother lived, continued to live there, in Nyathalas.</span> <span id="s11">They would sometimes take vacations there.</span> <span id="s12">And the distance between the two cities was about, I don’t know, a couple of miles but to get from Nyireghaza to Nyathalas is a big trip and it took half a day on horse and buggy.</span> <span id="s13">And it would be a big deal when all the kids would get to go on the carriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And that’s how everybody traveled in those days, horse and buggy?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Right.</span> <span id="s16">And my father’s grandmother was a renown baker in Nyathalas and everyone called her Toni, Jews and gentiles alike</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Toni.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Toni.</span> <span id="s20">You know what her last name was?</span> <span id="s21">This would be your father’s mother’s mother.</span> <span id="s22">Father’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: So I don’t -- let’s see.</span> <span id="s24">It may have been -- I know that she was a descendent of a great Rabbi thirteen generations before, whose name was Aschach Rabbi’s name thirteen generations back and they were Cohanites.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: This is a very religious family.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Yes, quite religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: And your father’s family, your father’s mother and family?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: They were quite orthodox.</span> <span id="s29">In fact my father’s father, my grandfather, was very instrumental in the synagogues there, orthodox synagogues, there were three synagogues, two synagogues in Nyireghaza, the orthodox and the -- something called status quo, sort of like conservative, this conservative synagogue was the bigger one in terms of numbers of people.</span> <span id="s30">And my father attended the school attached to the orthodox synagogue when he was young, then later, when he was I guess elementary, middle school he attended the larger Jewish school there in the morning.</span> <span id="s31">And in the afternoon he attended Yeshiva in the or attached to the orthodox synagogue in Nyireghaza.</span> <span id="s32">And he would tell me that they used to -- they would get into fights with the gentile children on the way home.</span> <span id="s33">There would be a whole thing where they would --</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Your father and…</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My father and his classmates from Jewish school would be attacked by the gentile children on their way home and it would be a big deal how to get home without getting into a fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: These fights were quite common?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: It seemed that it happened from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Did anyone ever get hurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I don’t think, not that my father told me so I guess they couldn’t have been too serious at least for my father and his immediate friends.</span> <span id="s40">And he was, my father was actually a very good student in, especially in the Yeshiva and he was, he gave a big speech on his barmirzvah in the synagogue and he went to the Yeshiva in Munkatch which is now part of Russia.</span> <span id="s41">It’s part of that ---</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Right, the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Right, the Ukraine, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So he actually left home –</span></p> <p><span id="s45">\</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Left home when he was thirteen at the barmitzvah and he went and attended Yeshiva in Munkatch and he excelled, he was one of the top guys in the ---, according to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s47">He sat next to the Rabbi in the Sabbath for the meals and that was like the big deal and he’d tell me the stories about the ____.</span> <span id="s48">The Yeshiva didn’t have dormitories.</span> <span id="s49">They would have private Jewish families they would put them up with and the people who could afford it were supposed to give some money, some money to these families because you know to support them, cause they would give them two meals a day, these families would.</span> <span id="s50">And his family was pretty well off.</span> <span id="s51">My grandfather was pretty well off.</span> <span id="s52">They had an iron store, a hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: So your father’s father had an iron…</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: A hardware, hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Hardware store.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: And it was pretty lucrative.</span> <span id="s57">He was one of the better off people in the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: What was your grandfather’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Brieger.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: No, the first name.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Adolph, believe it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Adolph.</span> <span id="s63">And his wife would be Toni or would that have been ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: No that would be, his mother, his mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: So Adolph’s mother was Toni?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s67">Adolph’s wife, my father’s mother died in childbirth, on her third child.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: So your father’s mother died …</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: My father’s mother died during childbirth on her -- I’m not sure which child it was -- it may have been the third or the fifth.</span> <span id="s70">There were six siblings altogether including my father eventually but the last one was from the second wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: So Adolph remarried and had one more…</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: One more child, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: That would be the sixth.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: The sixth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: So your father had four brothers and sisters and one half-brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, I believe so.</span> <span id="s77">One of them was a sister, all the other ones were brothers.</span> <span id="s78">I’m not sure if the sister was the one that was half or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: So a total of six -- one girl, five boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Yeah, my father being the oldest.</span> <span id="s81">My father’s mother, natural mother’s maiden name was Deutsch.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Adolph’s first wife’s maiden name was Deutsch.</span> <span id="s83">But you don’t remember her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: No.</span> <span id="s85">They were also from the Munkatch area, maybe not Munkatch proper but that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Near Matermush?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, I think that’s south.</span> <span id="s88">Munkatch is toward the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: Okay, as I remember looking at one of the photos, Grandfather Deutsch lived in Transylvania.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Right, that’s my mother’s.</span> <span id="s91">That’s my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s92">I think it’s a coincidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: So there’s two Deutsch’s in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s96">Now I’m beginning to follow.</span> <span id="s97">Your father’s father’s first wife was named Deutsch and there’s also a Deutsch on your mother’s side of the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: Right.</span> <span id="s99">My mother is Deutsch, maiden name.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s101">So your father’s family was relatively well off and could afford to send him to Munkatch and help pay…</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Right and he got packages from time to time with preserves or what have you.</span> <span id="s103">I don’t know stuff like that, that was the big deal and he would sometimes give to the more needy children, you know give them a sandwich or whatever cause some of them, the ones that were poor were really poor.</span> <span id="s104">Like my father in his youth had two shoes, one for weekday and one for the Sabbath.</span> <span id="s105">That was a big deal because the poor children had just one pair of shoes for the Sabbath and during the weekday they would just go barefoot.</span> <span id="s106">You know we’re talking poverty here.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q; Yeah, how long was your father in Munkatch?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: He was there until he was about seventeen or eighteen although I think there may have been some other Yeshiva in there as well, some other towns but I think he was away for a total of four or five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Now the time that he was going there this territory passed from Czechoslovakia to Hungary.</span> <span id="s110">Did he tell any stories about the Hungarians taking over?</span> <span id="s111">Now he was, of course.</span> <span id="s112">A Hungarian citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: This territory was separated from Hungary at the end of World War I and then taken back right around the time that your father went up there.</span> <span id="s115">Now you’re not aware of any connection between his going to Munkatch (he would have been over thirteen years of age) that would be late 1938, early 1939 which is when the Hungarians march in.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: And he’s there for how many years?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Four or five.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Four or five years.</span> <span id="s120">So he’s separated from the rest of the family for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, he would visit obviously and stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Yeah, but I mean he’s living apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yeah, although he did tell me that the people in the area spoke many languages.</span> <span id="s124">My father didn’t speak Czech, did not.</span> <span id="s125">But many of the, like for example, the typical Jew would speak Yiddish, Hungarian, because that was the dominant culture so to speak.</span> <span id="s126">And then either Ukrainian or Czech.</span> <span id="s127">And of course he would read Hebrew because that was the prayer language.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: So your father’s family, going back home now, when they were growing up, were they speaking both Yiddish and Hungarian?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: Yes but they would speak Hungarian in the house.</span> <span id="s130">That was their first language.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Hungarian speaking but they all knew Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: They all knew Yiddish fluently, like a mother tongue.</span> <span id="s133">And they read Hebrew and they studied in Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Your father did.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, and so did all the other children.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: But he especially in the Yeshiva training.</span> <span id="s137">Any other languages/</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Well later on he studied German.</span> <span id="s139">What happened was, I’m not sure what year but I think he was around seventeen and eighteen he came back and they thought he should learn a trade because they thought that trouble was coming and they knew that the hardware store is going to be taken away or something, not by the Germans because there weren’t Germans yet, but just the rise of anti-Semitism and the Kolneilash.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: The Arrow Cross</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: The Arrow Cross, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: The Hungarian fascists.</span> <span id="s143">Hungarian Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: So he learned to be a tailor and he also learned German because that was the lingua franca of the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: So he started to study German and tailoring.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Right, sort of like vocational school.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: Did he actually go to a formal school?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: This is a school, a school he went to in Hungary</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: You don’t know which…?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: This would have been when he was about eighteen you say.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s153">I know that he was very excelled in German, in language and the Hungarian German teacher never gave him (one was the best grade, sort of like the A. Grades from one to five, one being the highest, five being the lowest)…and he would never get a one, he would only got a two.</span> <span id="s154">And one time he asked her how come I don’t get a one I did the best paper in the class?</span> <span id="s155">She said to Jews I don’t give ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Now originally did anyone plan on him becoming a Rabbi considering all the studying that he was…</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: He was sort of being groomed for some sort of professional role or maybe taking over the hardware store, I’m not sure but it was clear that he was going to be the studier of the family.</span> <span id="s158">But I don’t think a Rabbi as such was considered.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Now Adolph, did he lose the hardware store?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, yes, sure the Nazis took it away when they took power.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: The Hungarian Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s163">There were a series of laws passed.</span> <span id="s164">First there were quotas imposed on what Jews can and can’t do in terms of university admissions or ownership of property and then there were sort of numerous closes which means they couldn’t attend university at all; they couldn’t have any property other than personal property.</span> <span id="s165">So they were taken away and there was a ghetto created in Nyireghaza and then…</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: But not in Najhalaas.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: I don’t know about Najhalaas.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: It would be too small probably but there’s a ghetto in 1944 in Nyireghaza.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I don’t know if it’s 1944 but it’s some time in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Your father has returned by then?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A; Oh, yeah, yeah, he was already back because when the trouble started he moved back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: So he leaves Munkatch, he studies at a vocational school somewhere in Hungary and then he leaves that school to come back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Well I think that school was home or near home already, the vocational school was.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Okay, so the family is together?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: The family is together, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Including your uncle Julah?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s178">My grandfather was very big on the family being together in the time of crisis and you’ll see that later on also.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q; What was your uncle Julah doing there in these years before we go ahead?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: You don’t know whether he was going to school or planning on a trade?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: No, Okay, so back to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Right.</span> <span id="s185">The ghetto was in the area that my father lived in because my father lived in the Jewish community area where all the other Jews lived so I don’t think they had to move but they did have other people moving in with them.</span> <span id="s186">The people from not just Nyireghaza but the whole area because Nyireghaza was sort of the local capital there.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Even Nadjhalaas perhaps?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: Perhaps -- from the villages were brought in and they were shoved into the ghetto including my father’s house.</span> <span id="s189">My father’s house was relatively comfortable because again they were pretty well off.</span> <span id="s190">And they were moved in there and it was pretty uncomfortable because there were many people per room.</span> <span id="s191">There were several families living in one room.</span> <span id="s192">And then I think the last year 1944 is when the deportation started so all the Jews began to be rounded up and they were put on the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s193">They weren’t told where they’re going.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: By Hungarians or by Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I think it was mostly Hungarians.</span> <span id="s196">The Germans didn’t have the manpower to do all this stuff.</span> <span id="s197">What they had to do was: first they had to take all their personal belongings and mail it to this address that was given to them.</span> <span id="s198">They were told that thats’s where they’re going to this camp.</span> <span id="s199">It’s a Hungarian address.</span> <span id="s200">So they had to package everything and mailed everything to this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: To a Hungarian address to an assumed destination.</span> <span id="s202">This was their assumed destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Assumed destination.</span> <span id="s204">My father said that the address was a phony address.</span> <span id="s205">They never really read the address.</span> <span id="s206">It was just put on a thing and it was all taken and used by the Nazis or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Did he know that at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: So they actually mailed -- the entire family, your father, his father, everyone sent…</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Whatever possessions they had -- clothing or whatever had to be sent to this stuff.</span> <span id="s211">They also buried, illegally of course, buried some stuff.</span> <span id="s212">One of the things that were buried was my father’s sort of tools of the trade, his sewing kit, his threads, because threads were ---apparently threads were very hard to come by because the economy, everything was geared toward the war so civilians couldn’t come by thread -- you know spools of thread I’m talking about --` so my father took like a box of thread, different colors, needles and what have you and buried it under the chicken coop.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Did he actually have a sewing machine?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I don’t think do.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: So they had some notice.</span> <span id="s216">When they were told before they’re actually deported they were given what?</span> <span id="s217">A couple of days or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: I don’t know how long it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Did all this happen, mail and everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: No, it had to be more than one day.</span> <span id="s221">It must have been a couple of weeks, I guess.</span> <span id="s222">They were told they were being relocated.</span> <span id="s223">They weren’t told they were being shipped off to north.</span> <span id="s224">They were just told they’re going to a different area.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: So they were burying things because they didn’t want to give them up, so they couldn’t carry them and they were hoping to return some day?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s227">And of course I guess they believed the story that they were being fed but they all had doubts also.</span> <span id="s228">They certainly didn’t trust the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s229">And so right, like you said they had hopes of coming back one day and digging up stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Did your family ever tell you what his father and mother and other family members were thinking or saying during these days?</span> <span id="s231">Anybody doing anything that stands out in your mind besides burying things?</span> <span id="s232">Did anyone try to hide, anyone try to get away?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Actually I think that there was some sort of paper that my father acquired.</span> <span id="s234">I think it was my father who acquired it.</span> <span id="s235">Somebody in the family acquired it, some sort of forged paper that said that he was Hungarian, not Jewish which would have allowed him to leave the ghetto and move away.</span> <span id="s236">But my grandfather wanted the family to stick together.</span> <span id="s237">He felt the best chance of getting through this was just to stick together.</span> <span id="s238">So they gave the paper to I think a cousin.</span> <span id="s239">Actually it was a passport, a Hungarian passport.</span> <span id="s240">They gave it to my cousin.</span> <span id="s241">Actually this cousin is still alive today.</span> <span id="s242">I’ll get back to him after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s244">That’s not Frank, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: So your father actually had a passport which he could have used but his father Adolph persuaded him to give it to his cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: The person who survived, did he survive because of the passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: I guess partly.</span> <span id="s250">He wasn’t deported so to that extent he was spared a whole -- he sort of increased his chances of survival.</span> <span id="s251">We know it’s just a question of increasing your chances.</span> <span id="s252">You couldn’t be really certain that you would survive one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did your father and his family realize at this point that their lives were in fact in danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: I don’t think they understood the magnitude of the danger.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: They were thinking of their property being stolen, being relocated and so forth but did anyone suspect that whole villages, whole communities would in fact be killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s257">The whole death camp was certainly nothing that was known to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Did anyone hear anything about massacres that had taken place before either in Russia or in Poland by word of mouth, did anyone hear of Hungarian soldiers in Russia returning?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s260">I think that there were some sort of prophets of doom that would come by, Jawotinski I think</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: He had died</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: He had died but earlier had come and warned people but he didn’t have first-hand information.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">Q: No, I’m talking about ’42, ’43, ’44.</span> <span id="s264">You know people are being killed by the millions in Russia, in Poland.</span> <span id="s265">They’re Hungarian soldiers in Russia.</span> <span id="s266">There are Hungarian Jews who were being sent to work forced labor in Russia.</span> <span id="s267">No one was coming back and telling stories?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: I don’t think so, not that my father knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: So we got your father’s family getting ready for resettlement.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Resettlement, right.</span> <span id="s271">So finally they were getting on the train and the one story he told me that there was this old couple who had this jar of honey with them.</span> <span id="s272">Honey was something valuable because it lasted, it didn’t spoil and so that was something that they could take with them.</span> <span id="s273">On the process of getting on the train they dropped the jar and the jar spilled and all the honey was spilling on the floor and so my father described how eager they were just to scoop it up, what was there to scoop it up with their hands and just put it back and put the honey back in the jar and how futile the attempt was because the honey would be taken away only a few hours later.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: But nobody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: But nobody knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did they have any food?</span> <span id="s277">First of all the whole family got on the train together still?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: I know my mother who wife was -- certainly the three of them, my father, my father’s brother Jussi by his father.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So Adolph, Yena and Jussi.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Right, and also my grandmother, that’s Adolph’s wife and also her baby, the youngest kid because she was just a baby then.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Did they have any food with them?</span> <span id="s282">Did he ever tell you what it was like getting into this train?</span> <span id="s283">First of all did they know it was going to be a cattle car until they actually saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: I don’t think they knew anything.</span> <span id="s285">They were just given orders.</span> <span id="s286">The cattle car -- there’s barely enough room to stand in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s287">You didn’t have enough room for packages.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: You had said they mailed their belongings already</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Right.</span> <span id="s290">They had already mailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: So did they have anything with them?</span> <span id="s292">Food?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I don’t think they had any food with them, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Just get into this car, no food, no belongings.</span> <span id="s295">What was it like being in there?</span> <span id="s296">Had he ever described the inside of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: I’m not sure about this particular journey but late on in cattle cars in general it was very crowded.</span> <span id="s298">One particular time, I’m skipping ahead a few months, but they were being shipped from one place to the other in cattle cars after they were in………</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: To Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: All the prisoners had a little sort of like a cup, like a metal cup and this cup was used for everything from getting the soup rations to getting any water if you could find some and also in the cattle cars on this particular journey they were on for several days at a time there was no room to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s301">So what the prisoners would do is they would -- the ones that weren’t standing near the side -- they would sort of use this cup and then just get rid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Use it as a portable toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Portable toilet, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: And then throw it out of the cattle car?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Throw it out or even in the cattle car, just get rid of it somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: The first trip from Hungary to Auschwitz comes as a shock.</span> <span id="s307">No one could imagine this condition.</span> <span id="s308">You have no toilet, no food, no belongings.</span> <span id="s309">How long did that trip take?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s311">I don’t know how long the trip was.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: He never did tell you what it is like being in that -- tell you what people were saying?</span> <span id="s313">Here he is with his mother, his father, couple of brothers not knowing where they’re going to end up -- any stories about what they were thinking, what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: No, not that I can remember.</span> <span id="s315">The anticipation -- I don’t have any information about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And with nothing to drink, nothing to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s318">So they finally got to Auschwitz or the first camp.</span> <span id="s319">I think it was Auschwitz, sort of like the big camp that everyone sort of checked in through.</span> <span id="s320">And they got off the cattle cars and they saw these Polish Jews who were inmates or prisoners, I don’t know what to call them with the uniforms, with the stripes.</span> <span id="s321">These guys would sort of have a few whispers as they walked by because they weren’t allowed to talk to each other but the Polish prisoners who were there for years because the Poles had to go to the camps before -- would tell them about -- they would say things like, make believe you’re healthy because that way you would be steered toward, what was it, the right as opposed to the left or whatever it was, whatever their options were.</span> <span id="s322">The other reason that if they made believe that they’re sick then they wouldn’t have to work hard or something.</span> <span id="s323">They would go to the hospital or something.</span> <span id="s324">That was counter-intuitive to make the….</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: That’s right, you don’t assume that because you’re sick you’re going to be killed.</span> <span id="s326">Any other suggestions they were getting?</span> <span id="s327">Make believe you’re healthy and of course how healthy can you be after the train ride like the one you just described.</span> <span id="s328">Any others?</span> <span id="s329">How about age?</span> <span id="s330">Did they talk about age?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: They didn’t have a lot of time to talk obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: What about children?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: There’s nothing to do about children I suppose.</span> <span id="s334">But the Hungarian Jews, they communicated in Yiddish, thought that the ???</span> <span id="s335">was arranged, that these people in the camps because there are some mental problems because after years in the camp they were so dehumanized and the remarks were so outlandish that they thought there was something wrong here.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: There was.</span> <span id="s337">That’s an interesting observation.</span> <span id="s338">Here they’re getting tips, what we would call tips, right?</span> <span id="s339">Helpful hints -- and yet as they hear this it’s so difficult to believe that they actually suspect that the messengers are deranged, crazy.</span> <span id="s340">And yet what else did they see when they got there?</span> <span id="s341">Were these people deranged?</span> <span id="s342">What did your father see when he got out of that car?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: He saw the sign that “Work Makes You Free” and he saw there was a building that you went into to strip and get rid of all the clothing.</span> <span id="s344">They gave you the prison clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: He didn’t see any dead people?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: No, this is up front.</span> <span id="s347">The cattle cars come in.</span> <span id="s348">It looks like a factory or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Well it was.</span> <span id="s350">How about -- I mean those who’ve been there recall the smell.</span> <span id="s351">Was there anything about the smell?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: I think the smell started later because at this point they weren’t burning the bodies yet.</span> <span id="s353">That only started when they were running out of time, the Germans thought they were running out of time.</span> <span id="s354">This point they still had time to bury the bodies after the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s355">Or at least there weren’t as many crematoria or they weren’t going at full speed.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: So your father, is he separated from the rest of the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: He was separated from all but the three.</span> <span id="s358">That is, my father’s father, my father and his brother -- next to the youngest brother -- stayed together the whole time until much later.</span> <span id="s359">I’ll get to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: So Adolph, Yeno are separated…</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: …are together, separated from the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Yeah, are separated, -- the rest meaning the mother and the child.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: I think the rest of the children were there, too.</span> <span id="s364">And of course they found out a few days later that they were all killed because the children and the mother went straight to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: They didn’t know that until….</span> <span id="s366">?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: Until much later when they got a feel for the rhythm of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Okay so together they get stripped?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: They get stripped, they get showered.</span> <span id="s370">Believe it or not they get showered, they get their haircuts and they have to give up their shoes and they get their uniforms.</span> <span id="s371">They’re tattooed I think.</span> <span id="s372">Actually I have a very interesting story about that.</span> <span id="s373">My father’s number was A3166 and his brother’s must have been A3066 were very close by but what I am saying is my birthday is April 30, 1966 so there’s something very eerie about that.</span> <span id="s374">I know it’s just coincidence to you but to me there’s something -- well anyway…</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: They’re still together.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: They’re still together and so they go into the camp.</span> <span id="s377">They were given these -- the first meal that they got was the soup that was very thick, liquidy -- very thick greenish -- it was thick greenish soup that nobody knew what it was made of or what it was.</span> <span id="s378">My father’s father, my grandfather and my father’s brother didn’t want to eat it because it tasted horrible.</span> <span id="s379">It didn’t taste like food at all, it tasted like cooked tree leaves or something.</span> <span id="s380">But my father said to them that we better eat them now because if we get this today we get the same thing tomorrow, it’s not going to be better.</span> <span id="s381">If we don’t survive we have to eat it.</span> <span id="s382">That was the theme throughout.</span> <span id="s383">My father was into survival.</span> <span id="s384">My father said take what we get and you can’t be picky because you’re not going to survive.</span> <span id="s385">And so I guess they ate it or they forced themselves to eat it.</span> <span id="s386">And that was it.</span> <span id="s387">Every day they got a bowl of soup, this thick greenish soup and not much else.</span> <span id="s388">Once in a while in the beginning -- things got progressively worse as it went on -- in the beginning they also got bread in the beginning, sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: When did they arrive in Auschwitz, did he ever tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: I guess it was sometime in ’44.</span> <span id="s391">It was the fall of ’44, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Or spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: The spring, that could have been it.</span> <span id="s394">He was there for a year, all the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Altogether a year because the war ends in the spring of ’45 so the spring of ’44 one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How long was he in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I don’t know -- a couple of months, maybe several months.</span> <span id="s399">I don’t know exactly how long.</span> <span id="s400">I can’t name the camps that he was in.</span> <span id="s401">I know he was in Auschwitz; I know he was in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s402">I don’t have all the camps off-hand or how long he was in each.</span> <span id="s403">Jussi, my father’s youngest brother was very good at getting things.</span> <span id="s404">My father described that one time they would -- the truck with the bread would come by and they would load the bread into the kitchen and the way it would work is that the guy on the truck would throw the bread -- like big 3 kilo loaves of bread -- to the guy by the kitchen.</span> <span id="s405">He would catch it and he would just….</span> <span id="s406">And so my father’s brother Jussi was very quick.</span> <span id="s407">He snuck up underneath the truck -- again this was all the beginning when there was still so much food --he snuck up underneath the truck and between like sort of the truck and the place where the other guy stood and as the guy picked up the bread to throw it.</span> <span id="s408">The guy threw it; immediately turned back to pick up the next piece and the other guy was still sort of still bending up from the previous throw and so he jumped up and caught it and he went back underneath the truck and he ran like hell because if you get caught for that that’s shot on sight.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Or hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Or hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: So he could steal bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: He could steal bread.</span> <span id="s413">This is very risky.</span> <span id="s414">It’s the sort of thing you risk it…</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: I know and it’s very hard to hide a 3 kilo loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: What they do was they went to the bathroom and they ate two thirds of it right away and they saved one third of it for my grandfather.</span> <span id="s417">The idea was to hide the evidence and eating quickly.</span> <span id="s418">There are two reasons why you have to eat it quickly.</span> <span id="s419">Number one you have to hide the evidence.</span> <span id="s420">Number two things always get either stolen or lost or if you work hard it gets damaged or stolen.</span> <span id="s421">Prisoners would steal whatever they can get their hands on.</span> <span id="s422">So my father’s father said always whatever you get in rations eat it right away.</span> <span id="s423">Don’t try to save it or ration whatever for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: It sounds like your father and your uncle found it difficult to trust other prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yeah, there’s another little story that bears on that point.</span> <span id="s426">It’s a very dehumanizing experience and you got to the point where you care about your own personal survival and nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Not someone else’s survival?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Not someone else’s survival.</span> <span id="s429">The three of them were together.</span> <span id="s430">That was an exception but other than that…</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So it’s the three musketeers….</span> <span id="s432">.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Against the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Against the world and other prisoners are part of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Were there other people from your father’s town with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Occasionally they would have people from that town but as the time went by people would either drop dead or they would be dispersed so there were less and less people that he knew personally.</span> <span id="s438">Occasionally he would bump into people he thought he knew.</span> <span id="s439">One time he was walking by near the perimeter of the camp and there were these guard towers.</span> <span id="s440">And the guard yelled down at him in Hungarian because a Hungarian Nazi and he looked up, you know pleasantly surprised and he threw down, the guard threw down a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s441">So he figured wow, Hungarian, there’s some people love me up there.</span> <span id="s442">He tore the piece of bread apart and the bread was full of little needles, little you know the kind of needles you have in your shirt when it’s new.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Pins.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: Little pins.</span> <span id="s445">So if he would have bit into it he could have damaged his mouth.</span> <span id="s446">So much for the Hungarian Nazis.</span> <span id="s447">Another story was that my father, Jussi again stole beets.</span> <span id="s448">And that was another hot commodity.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: He’s developing a pattern here.</span> <span id="s450">Stole beets.</span> <span id="s451">Where did he find beets?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Near the kitchen.</span> <span id="s453">They would sneak into the kitchen.</span> <span id="s454">Again these were all capital crimes.</span> <span id="s455">The three of them ate so many beets that for days their stool was red.</span> <span id="s456">That’s all they ate was beets.</span> <span id="s457">Another story about my uncle Jussi -- this I think is later.</span> <span id="s458">One of the camps -- they were building something.</span> <span id="s459">I think it was a glass factory that was being built.</span> <span id="s460">This was toward the end of the thing so I’m skipping ahead a few months because the allies would bomb it.</span> <span id="s461">They had the three shifts -- the Americans during the day and the Russians at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: The British at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: The British at night, right.</span> <span id="s464">So the factory was being built; they never finished because whatever they built is knocked down by the bombers.</span> <span id="s465">They kept bombing this thing</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: This was you say near Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Or Dora?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Dora is one of the things, one of the camps.</span> <span id="s470">It may have been Dora.</span> <span id="s471">I know Dora was one of the camps my father was in.</span> <span id="s472">and so there was a little wheelbarrow that the prisoner has to push up on this little wooden plank at an angle.</span> <span id="s473">So they had to sort of run up to get enough momentum to get the wheelbarrow full of cement up on the plank and they would only fill the wheelbarrow half way up because you couldn’t get enough momentum to push it all the way up the steep little plank.</span> <span id="s474">And so the Kapo who was a prisoner who turned, became one of them, especially picked out bully types, came by and he said how come you’re only filling the wheelbarrow half way because you get more productive if you fill it fully so one of the prisoners explained that we can’t because we can’t push it up the plank that way.</span> <span id="s475">So he said let me try.</span> <span id="s476">So he had the thing filled up.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: The Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: He personally had his own wheelbarrow filled up and he…</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: You’re talking about the Kapo?</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: The Kapo, right and he tried to push it up.</span> <span id="s481">He couldn’t because it was too heavy.</span> <span id="s482">And bear in mind that the Kapo was in better shape than the other prisoners because he got more rations.</span> <span id="s483">And so he got steaming mad.</span> <span id="s484">He was very upset because not only was he shown wrong but he was also…</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Shown weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Shown weak, right.</span> <span id="s487">And so Jussi loaded the thing completely, the wheelbarrow completely and he went up -- just then he went up and he succeeded in going up the plank.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Jussi?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: The same one that the Kapo couldn’t push?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: The same one that the Kapo couldn’t push.</span> <span id="s492">So the Kapo was very pleased.</span> <span id="s493">He gave him extra rations that day.</span> <span id="s494">So these were little tricks that kept them alive.</span> <span id="s495">There was one particularly long journey that they had to go on.</span> <span id="s496">They had to keep moving east because the British were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: This was east from Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s498">Remember we started in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: We skipped a couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: From Auschwitz we go west.</span> <span id="s501">Now do you have any knowledge of your father’s leaving Auschwitz because that’s the first step?</span> <span id="s502">We’ve got to get him out of Auschwitz before we get him to the other camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Right.</span> <span id="s504">One of them was the cattle cars.</span> <span id="s505">In the beginning they still had cattle cars.</span> <span id="s506">Later on they begin to march on foot because again the German war effort required the trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And they were falling apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Falling apart.</span> <span id="s509">So I guess I’m sure the first time or two they still had the cattle cars and they were stuck on the train for a couple of days.</span> <span id="s510">They didn’t have any…</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: The three of them together still?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: I believe so, I believe so.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: How is your Grandpa holding up?</span> <span id="s514">I mean he’s got to be a good deal older to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s516">He was hanging in there at this point still.</span> <span id="s517">And the way they would get water they would stick those little cups I told you about and they would take-- I guess they had a string around the waist to keep their pants up -- and they tied that around the cup, one end of the cup, one string around the cup and they would hang it out the little holes in the cattle cars so they’d scoop some of the snow that was adjacent to the train as it went by so that was the refreshment.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So they were being moved around in the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Right.</span> <span id="s520">What happened to my grandfather was that they were being relocated at one point and they had to march on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">(End of Side One)</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: So we were talking about your family is being marched from one camp to another and you were going to tell me something about your grandfather who is too weak or feeling weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: His legs were giving out and he felt he couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s524">So the two boys, my father and Jussi gathered around him.</span> <span id="s525">They didn’t want to leave without him so my grandfather told them to go and they still wouldn’t go because they didn’t want to abandon him so he commanded them, you know like invoked biblical thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother and he commanded them to go.</span> <span id="s526">And so they left.</span> <span id="s527">My father later learned that this camp -- the Germans of course were going to kill everybody, destroy the camp because they had to destroy evidence but this camp apparently was liberated by the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: The camp that they were leaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: Right and my grandfather was liberated by the Russians it seemed, later my father learned because the Germans didn’t have time to shoot the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: But you don’t know the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And you don’t know when this happened, this separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: No, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Time of the year?</span> <span id="s535">Nothing in your father’s stories that reveal the season.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, not that I can think of.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: But it wasn’t Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: I don’t think it was Auschwitz, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: And it certainly wouldn’t be Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Okay, so your grandfather was liberated by the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Right, right and my father later learned that he was taken to Siberia but he never came back.</span> <span id="s543">The Russians treated the Jews as prisoners -- there were freezing conditions in Siberia and he apparently died in Siberia.</span> <span id="s544">I don’t have any detailed knowledge on what happened to him because my father only heard through sort of people who came back from Siberia and it was sketchy.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: So your father and your uncle are marching…</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: But had they stayed in that camp they would have been liberated by the Russians and the Russian camp would probably be better than the death camp so it would have been a better deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Why was your father able to stay?</span> <span id="s548">I mean there’s stories too of the Germans shooting people who couldn’t march.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Right, I guess they didn’t have -- my grandfather -- I guess didn’t have time to shoot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: But your father and your uncle were forced literally at gunpoint?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: To march?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Yeah, I mean at one point it sounds like your grandfather commands them to march but at any point are they being forced marched by Germans/</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: I don’t think….</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Would they have been free to stay if they had?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: I see what you’re saying.</span> <span id="s556">If they had pretended that they were sick and couldn’t march then they -- the Germans weren’t going to go around sending around doctors checking everybody so I guess if they were pretending they were sick they could have stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: But did they realize that your grandfather would in fact survive that way?</span> <span id="s558">I mean very often the Germans would kill people who were too sick to move</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Right and I guess they sort of expected that because their attitude of not wanting to abandon him shows that, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: That’s why I’m asking these questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Right, I think they figured that he’d be killed but nothing was certain.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Nothing was logical.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Nothing was logical, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: So how about this march that your father and your uncle….</span> <span id="s565">.</span> <span id="s566">?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Now here’s the big march what happened.</span> <span id="s568">First everyone was give relatively big loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s569">Again my father’s philosophy was not to save it but just to eat it right away for fear of getting lost or stolen.</span> <span id="s570">And they’ll be marched and it was a long march without food….</span> <span id="s571">.</span> <span id="s572">you had to march I think like eight or four in a row and if you fell behind then you’ll be shot because there was a German truck behind you.</span> <span id="s573">And see if you slow down --- but they didn’t give you time to sleep so what happened was they would sleep, sort of sleep as they marched and so like lean on each other or something as they continued to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: How long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: I think it was a three day trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: Three days without sleeping?</span> <span id="s577">No rest?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Without sleeping, yes.</span> <span id="s579">At one point they came across a marsh near the side of the road and they were so thirsty that the people started running for the water and the Germans started shooting because they didn’t tolerate the lack of discipline.</span> <span id="s580">My father didn’t run because he knew that despite like his natural urge, almost irresistible urge for water and for rest he kept going.</span> <span id="s581">And this is something else that happened.</span> <span id="s582">This sort of thing ?</span> <span id="s583">repeated later.</span> <span id="s584">At one point they were given a chance for a hot shower.</span> <span id="s585">There was a big room full of hot showers and the people would be there for a few minutes but then they had to come out, after about two minutes or so.</span> <span id="s586">And some people were so -- you know enjoyed the shower so much that they just wouldn’t come out.</span> <span id="s587">The Germans would come in there with like with sticks and start beating them and they still -- you know people would just collapse under the shower rather than walk out because they were so deprived of any sort of physical comfort.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: And this felt good.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Right and this felt good.</span> <span id="s590">My father tells me that he wished that once more in his life he can get a full meal of baked potatoes and then he can die, you know like his last wish but to feel satisfied with a stomach full of baked potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: So where did they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: They went to another camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: You don’t know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: I don’t know the name, some landmarks along the way.</span> <span id="s595">One time one of the prisoners took with him a pair of phylacterites (tfillin).</span> <span id="s596">He put it in his shoes.</span> <span id="s597">He snuck into the barracks at night.</span> <span id="s598">And so the people who were religious which I guess were most of them, I don’t know, a lot of them stayed up all night putting on the phylacterites, just putting it on quickly and taking it off, just for a second because they weren’t given an opportunity to pray.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Where had they come from?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: One of the prisoners snuck it in his shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: All of this time they had -- or was this a new prisoner?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: This was a new prisoner who snuck it in and it disappeared or something after a while.</span> <span id="s603">It wasn’t like an ongoing thing.</span> <span id="s604">Also later on toward the end he used to stay out of the barracks and stay outside because the barracks were too crowded.</span> <span id="s605">If you stayed outside and caught you’d be shot but it was still worth once in a while because I think there were about four people in the bed or something.</span> <span id="s606">So what he did was he’d hide under the dead bodies so he could have a -- stay out you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Yet you don’t know which camp this was?</span> <span id="s608">Probably Bergen-Belsen from my guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And he was never caught sleeping outdoors?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: No, I guess he wasn’t.</span> <span id="s612">After time went on toward the end all they had -- their sole task -- they didn’t have to work any more ???</span> <span id="s613">enter the factors -- their sole task was to pull the dead bodies and pull them into this big grave.</span> <span id="s614">So they would have this little stick with a little thing, hook, at the end and they would put the stick like underneath the dead bodies -- I mean they weren’t necessarily dead, you didn’t know, you thought they were dead but you didn’t have time to check their pulse or anything -- you put it underneath their chin and you pull that stick with the thing at the end and you pull the bodies that way into this big grave.</span> <span id="s615">You [indistinct] hide the evidence because the Germans were running out of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: So prisoners like your father were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Right, for months he did this.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Your father and your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s620">My uncle was getting very weak by this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Anything else?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: A few more things.</span> <span id="s623">When they were liberated…</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: This was at Bergen-Belsen?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: You know the British liberated them.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s627">Do you know the time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: The time of the year, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Spring, ’45, April.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s631">So they came around with loudspeakers and it was announced in several languages that here we are to come to liberate you.</span> <span id="s632">My father was semi-conscious at this point.</span> <span id="s633">He was laying on the floor and he didn’t really understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s634">He really didn’t understand what liberation meant.</span> <span id="s635">So they -- the British came around with these sort of paramedics who would check who was still alive and they thought my father was dead because he was in horrible shape, emaciate and what have you.</span> <span id="s636">And my father sort of unconscious let out a sigh.</span> <span id="s637">He wasn’t conscious of what was going on but I guess deep inside he had to let other people know that he was still alive because they were about to pull him away with the other dead bodies.</span> <span id="s638">So that’s how he was saved and he was put in the same --they were put in beds.</span> <span id="s639">There were two people per bed at this point because the British didn’t have enough rations.</span> <span id="s640">And all the British had was these cans of lard that they had -- given to the prisoners.</span> <span id="s641">It was awful.</span> <span id="s642">Imagine swallowing lard without any other food or anything.</span> <span id="s643">So you had to like just swallow it because again my father would just eat anything to survive.</span> <span id="s644">My father informed the people that he had a brother, Jussi and that they should bring him to him.</span> <span id="s645">So the next night they were together.</span> <span id="s646">They were in the same bed They slept head to foot.</span> <span id="s647">And Jussi couldn’t swallow the lard because he was too malnourished or he just couldn’t do it physically but he just couldn’t swallow the lard.</span> <span id="s648">Had he been able to swallow the lard or had there been proper medical attention at this point he still could have been saved because -- Jussi still could have been saved because the --you --- he wasn’t like -- he was still conscious and he was still relatively speaking okay.</span> <span id="s649">And so like the next night my father woke up, the next morning and Jussi didn’t move and that’s when my father -- I think he had a major, a major I won’t call it a nervous breakdown but he had a major sort of you know a major depression for several days or several weeks because this was the last member of the family, the last connection with reality that was still there for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: When ---I’m still trying to follow the chronology described.</span> <span id="s651">How many days after liberation did he die?</span> <span id="s652">You have them liberated.</span> <span id="s653">The British come in and then…</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: Within two or three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: The second day your father asked the British if he could bunk with your uncle and then another day and your uncle dies?</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: Right, right so it would have to be the first three or four days or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: So you’d say two or three days later.</span> <span id="s658">The other thing I keep wondering about is the lard itself.</span> <span id="s659">I mean of all the things to be eating…</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Well this is surplus.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Yeah, I know.</span> <span id="s662">I’m saying their stomachs and their bodies weren’t used to very rich food.</span> <span id="s663">If it hadn’t been lard, if it had been something more modest like just bread or a turnip or something it might not have done as much damage.</span> <span id="s664">There were thousands of people who died after liberation because they couldn’t handle the food that the British gave them.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yeah, yeah, the British were clearly under prepared for this thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Yeah, yeah, so your uncle Jussi dies in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s667">Your father recovers.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Right.</span> <span id="s669">Actually when they were liberated what happened was they went into these showers and this sort of chemical was dumped on them to sort of delouse them.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: DDT probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: And because they just had lice and what -- all these different parasites.</span> <span id="s672">Then he gets taken to Sweden.</span> <span id="s673">He was there for two year.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Your father went to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s676">This rich benefactor donated his personal yacht to be used for the transportation of the prisoners to Sweden and my father tells me that they, like they -- there was this fake like leather seats and stuff.</span> <span id="s677">The prisoners tore the leather seats.</span> <span id="s678">And they just went berserk I’m not sure if it was envy or anger or just not being able to deal with luxury and they just tore the leather seats -- or ……(indistinct) have something for themselves so they tore the thing.</span> <span id="s679">My father had TB from his experience and he was there for six months and he recovered.</span> <span id="s680">The doctors didn’t think that he would but he recovered from the TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Where was he for six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: In Sweden, a Swedish clinic.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: But he’s in Sweden for two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yeah, but for six months he was…</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: In a clinic for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Yeah, right, and he couldn’t, he couldn’t --- he was very sick.</span> <span id="s687">For the first I don’t know how many months he couldn’t move, he couldn’t get off the bed and he started learning Swedish.</span> <span id="s688">He sort of spoke -- he spoke German from before -- and he was able to get a German-Swedish dictionary and he got Swedish newspapers and he sort of taught himself Swedish.</span> <span id="s689">That was one of the other languages he spoke.</span> <span id="s690">He also spoke French.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Did he ever go back to his home- town after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Right, yeah, I’m getting to that.</span> <span id="s693">After two years or during his stay in Sweden he got in touch with his cousins who were in Nyireghaza and he opened up the hardware store again because again there was a period before communism after the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Two years, okay so he wasn’t sure because I think he – this is sort of like apocryphal but I think one of the nurses he got really friendly with.</span> <span id="s696">I’m not sure what the love interest, whatever was.</span> <span id="s697">He rode around on a bicycle and he was very impressed by the socialist, or I’m not sure it was socialist but (indistinct) friendly ---- the outlook.</span> <span id="s698">One of the things --- that if they found a piece of clothing on the street that was lost the Swedish would like instead of keeping it for themselves they would take it and they put it on a tree or something or hang it someplace where it was visible so if these people returned, a person returned to look for it they would find it, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s699">He was very impressed with that.</span> <span id="s700">And also just the generosity that here was a clinic for free.</span> <span id="s701">He wasn’t a taxpayer or anything.</span> <span id="s702">And the general treatment by the Swedes.</span> <span id="s703">So then he -- but he decided to go back to his cousins in Nyireghaza.</span> <span id="s704">These cousins are now here in New York.</span> <span id="s705">They left Hungary later, before my father but after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: By any chance is one of these cousins the holder of your father’s passport?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s708">Mitsu was the…yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: So your father returns….</span> <span id="s710">.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Father returns and then let’s see and then they got the hardware store going and then the communists come.</span> <span id="s712">Hardware store goes again.</span> <span id="s713">Hardware store is taken away again.</span> <span id="s714">He goes to work in a hardware store as an employee.</span> <span id="s715">He marries my mother who’s home is Budapest.</span> <span id="s716">She was vacationing near Nyireghaza.</span> <span id="s717">She’s from Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: She meets your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Meets my father and then later they get a license to open a private wire fence making shop.</span> <span id="s720">In Hungary you’re allowed little enterprises like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Where was the Shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Nyireghaza.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: So your mother leaves Budapest to live there with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: She must have really loved him.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Actually she’ll tell you about this but her conditions were really bad.</span> <span id="s727">She was an orphan after the war living with a great-aunt that was very mean to the three children and her conditions were really -- compared to his….</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Okay, I understand.</span> <span id="s729">But I mean normally a person doesn’t leave Budapest to go to this little town in the boonies.</span> <span id="s730">So when do they come to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: 1977.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: So late?</span> <span id="s733">So they lived in Hungary until 1977.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Right.</span> <span id="s735">I was born there.</span> <span id="s736">I was born in Hungary.</span> <span id="s737">I was ten years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: 1977 so they saw a lot.</span> <span id="s739">They saw Maj they saw Kadar.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: That’s right and he went through communism, he went through fascism, he went through all these great twentieth century theories.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: And there was no looking back when they came here?</span> <span id="s742">They never returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: They never returned, no.</span> <span id="s744">Actually they intended to go to Israel all the while but then my sister married an American and she moved here.</span> <span id="s745">That’s why they came to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: When did they marry by the way?</span> <span id="s747">Did they marry in the -- it must have been the late forties.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: Fifty-three I think.</span> <span id="s749">Uh, uh check that.</span> <span id="s750">Let me think.</span> <span id="s751">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s752">My sister was born in ’53, I think.</span> <span id="s753">Let me think.</span> <span id="s754">I was born in ’66 and she’s twelve years older than I am so she must have been born in ’54 and I think that they were married three years when she was born so I think they got married in ’51.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: ’51.</span> <span id="s756">I’ll put ’50, ’51.</span> <span id="s757">Your mother will know, I’m sure.</span> <span id="s758">She’ll know the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: Yeah, she will.</span> <span id="s760">And then they came back.</span> <span id="s761">Oh, I have to go back.</span> <span id="s762">When they came back, before they came back he asked -- the Hungarians had moved into his house and so he wanted it back but they wouldn’t give it back to him.</span> <span id="s763">There were certain pieces of furniture that he wanted back and I think there were a few things that he got back but there was a whole lengthy process.</span> <span id="s764">See the Hungarian courts at some point were very favorable to the Jewish claims because they knew that the fascists are out and…</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And Jews could not be considered I imagine as being fascists or pro-fascist.</span> <span id="s766">They were safely anti-fascist.</span> <span id="s767">And you couldn’t say the same about other Hungarians.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: Right and if you were perceived -- if the court or to the judge was being pro the people who took ??</span> <span id="s769">the fascists you may be.</span> <span id="s770">.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: You may be accused of pro-fascism.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Right.</span> <span id="s773">Again this was the time when the communists, wasn’t communists but saw the communists were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: They were coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Yeah and the communists weren’t too fond of the fascists either.</span> <span id="s776">So that’s why he was able to get some of his furniture.</span> <span id="s777">He found some of the stuff that was hidden like he found his box of thread and stuff</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Did anyone from his family survive besides him?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: No.</span> <span id="s780">His five siblings and his parents died.</span> <span id="s781">He was the only survivor except for these cousins but they were not immediate family.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: But in the immediate family everyone died.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Grandparents, parents and siblings.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Right.</span> <span id="s786">One little quick story my father told me that one particular Jew he came back and he, how was it, he demanded -- he demanded his property and he got into a fight with the Hungarian, the non-Jewish Hungarian owner.</span> <span id="s787">So he got into a fight and the Jewish guy slapped him so the Hungarian guy sued him for battery or something so they went to court.</span> <span id="s788">Again the court was sort of reluctant to award a lot of money so they fined him a relatively small fine, fined the Jew a relatively small fine so the Jew took out twice, twice the fine that was assessed, gave it to the judge and slapped the Hungarian again.</span> <span id="s789">He said it was worth it.</span> <span id="s790">Do you have any particular questions?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: It seems that you’ve covered I mean everything that you would be able to remember.</span> <span id="s792">Obviously you weren’t there.</span> <span id="s793">It would be nice to know the camps.</span> <span id="s794">Fortunately I do have your father’s summary.</span> <span id="s795">That’s why I was able to put camps in your mouth so to speak.</span> <span id="s796">I know that he was in Dora and he was at Bergen-Belsen and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Where is this from?</span> <span id="s798">What are you reading here?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: This is from the American gathering, the registry, the one (??)</span> <span id="s800">had all the photos on?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh, Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: And I think after we’ve finished with the tapes if you would I would ask you to name your father’s other brothers and sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: I don’t know their names.</span> <span id="s804">I just know Jussi.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Your mother might know.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Actually there’s a cousin that might know actually.</span> <span id="s807">We have a cousin who with his help….</span> <span id="s808">[indistinct]</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: That’s it really.</span> <span id="s810">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And I look forward to talking to your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s815">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
