that you came to Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3">FELA WARSCHAU: Our camp was labor camp, was, the outs-, on the outskirts of Hamburg.</span> <span id="s4">Every day we were coming into the city by train, and working on the streets, cleaning [clears throat] the rubble from the bombs that fell.</span> <span id="s5">It was the end of 19, almost the end of March 1945 when the fliers came almost constantly, there was very little respite from the bombing, and we knew that liberation is at the door but if we would be alive to see that, no one knew.</span> <span id="s6">And sure enough, Germ- the Germany Hitler was so determined to destroy the Jewish people that every time the allies came closer, they evacuated us deeper into Germany.</span> <span id="s7">This is what happened to us.</span> <span id="s8">We were taken on a train again, and after several hours of travel, we found ourselves in Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s9">Bergen Belsen, it was something I have never seen in all the years that I have been a prisoner in the ghettos, at home, and in the camps.</span> <span id="s10">At the time when we arrived, everything was in disarray.</span> <span id="s11">They did not burn the bodies anymore.</span> <span id="s12">They were stapled up like cord wood on the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">It was unusual warm for this time of year.</span> <span id="s14">And the smell from the bodies was terrible.</span> <span id="s15">We were assigned into a barrack just a bare floor.</span> <span id="s16">Nothing anymore.</span> <span id="s17">There was a skeleton crew only of SS people, and the camps were guarded by volunteers mostly, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Hungarians, and they were wearing white arm bands of surrender.</span> <span id="s18">But that did not stop them from shooting at us if we came close to the barbed wire and tried a hold of that piece of color abbey, all these big piles that were laying outside of the barbed wire, and supposed to have been the food, but they Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s20">2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU Page

id="s23">The water was turned off.</span> <span id="s24">It was chaos.</span> <span id="s25">We did not work anymore.</span> <span id="s26">You just walked around and people just dropped dead in front of you.</span> <span id="s27">And you were so dehu manized you just walked over these people and kept on going not knowing what are we doing here, what is going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s28">Typhoid fever doesn't carry, and lice.</span> <span id="s29">I always tell everybody that if you sit on the ground, they could almost carry you away, so many and so huge they were.</span> <span id="s30">My sister and I and two more friends, we always kept together, supporting ourselves.</span> <span id="s31">Whatever we could find to eat or even with moral support, giving each other courage.</span> <span id="s32">So we had a little piece of bread that we got for the journey.</span> <span id="s33">This was gone.</span> <span id="s34">By some miracle, my sister found a potato and we were sharing this one potato, a slice every day.</span> <span id="s35">You try to find someone you knew, very seldom, but one day we found a woman from my hometown.</span> <span id="s36">She looked exceptionally good, and she said to us, I hope I live long enough to survive and see that I'm a free person.</span> <span id="s37">Looking at her, I thought oh, sure, you will.</span> <span id="s38">Next day she was dead.</span> <span id="s39">She was swollen from all the hunger.</span> <span id="s40">We just walked around like zombies, every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Going back into the barrack, laying down, coming out, water, like I said was turned off.</span> <span id="s42">People that were so thirsty went to the place where the latrine supposedly was and licked the sweat from the walls there.</span> <span id="s43">I don't remember doing that, I just remember sharing this potato like uh, see-through slice each one of us got.</span> <span id="s44">Four of us sharing that.</span> <span id="s45">But we got weaker every day because there was nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s46">Finally, the last day when we had nothing, I could barely drag myself.</span> <span id="s47">I said to my sister I'm going into the barrack and I'm going to lie down and just die in there.</span> <span id="s48">I do not want to die and people should just step over me like Working

id="s51">They followed me.</span> <span id="s52">We all lied down there and just almost said goodbye to life.</span> <span id="s53">One of our friends, she was even younger than I was, the youngest.</span> <span id="s54">She was always searching, trying to find a way.</span> <span id="s55">So she said she has to take the last look outside and see what's going on.</span> <span id="s56">When she came back she said to me, there's something funny going out there.</span> <span id="s57">People are running all over the place and, it's unusual.</span> <span id="s58">It's not what usually happen.</span> <span id="s59">And I told her to just lay down and die in peace.</span> <span id="s60">She must be hallucinating.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">She insisted, so my sister walked out with her.</span> <span id="s62">When my sister came back, I don't know with what strength she came back, grabbed me by my arm, and she says, get up, get up, guess what, everybody's running, and the gates are open, there's a man sitting, is it a tank or whatever, we couldn't distinguish at that time one thing from the other.</span> <span id="s63">He is speaking through a loudspeaker, his words are being translated, I think we were liberated.</span> <span id="s64">When I got up and walked outside, my eyes couldn't comprehend, it just didn't register.</span> <span id="s65">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s66">I couldn't believe this was really true, so I said to my sister that she has to grab me by my arm and do something physical so I realize that I am really alive and we were liberated.</span> <span id="s67">It was the English army that liberated us.</span> <span id="s68">And the way I understand is that they really didn't come to liberate this camp, they were just going, passing by, somewhere else, and they were attracted by the stench and wanted to investigate and see what's going on there.</span> <span id="s69">This is what they found.</span> <span id="s70">People, all over, laying, strewn, live corpses, dead corpses, because they did not even bury before we came, they were just laying around.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">They didn't bury them in the pits, they didn't burn them, just dead bodies all over the place.</span> <span id="s72">It was, for them, unbelievable.</span> <span id="s73">They distributed food, pieces of bread, and they

id="s75">2/9/95 Int FELA WARSCHAU Page 4 realize what they have found.</span> <span id="s76">It was heartbreaking to see the sum of these living corpses being handed a piece of bread and at the same time, dying, on the day of their liberation because they were so starved, so far gone, that even this piece of bread didn't help them anymore.</span> <span id="s77">I got some food with my sister, we just stood there hugging each other and just crying and, it was a moment that I think I'll never forget in my life.</span> <span id="s78">Just walking around and trying to make the best of it.</span> <span id="s79">They, the English tried to instill some normalcy in that camp.</span> <span id="s80">They um, naturally, weeded out the sick people right away because there was a lot of people with typhoid fever.</span> <span id="s81">And they did not have any hospitals, not enough medication, so they had makeshift hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">What was make- just a plain barrack.</span> <span id="s83">After Belsen were the wooden camps, where we were.</span> <span id="s84">Bergen was farther, the brick buildings, and this is where they took the sick people.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">There, people were laying on plain mattresses on the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">The only one they did attend to was the ones they thought they would survive.</span> <span id="s87">The severe cases, they didn't even bother much because they didn't have enough medication.</span> <span id="s88">My sister got very ill, and she was taken to one of these places.</span> <span id="s89">After I found her, I didn't even know where she was, she told me that the doctor made the rounds and he said, we won't bother with her because she will not survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">If she survives this night, which is the crisis, then we'll give her some medication.</span> <span id="s91">She said, I did not sleep all night.</span> <span id="s92">If I die, I wanted to die with my eyes open.</span> <span id="s93">But in the morning, I was still alive, and when the doctor came, he said to her, oh you're still alive, now we are going to treat you.</span> <span id="s94">I had a slight case of typhoid fever, with me they didn't bother at all.</span> <span id="s95">Also, they tried to bring some normalcy into our lives.</span> <span id="s96">They did disinfect

and so many people to a room, and they gave us food and tried to treat us.</span> <span id="s100">This was it.</span> <span id="s101">Every day, there were posted lists from different liberated camps, telling of the survivors.</span> <span id="s102">We always run eagerly to see if anyone from our family had survived.</span> <span id="s103">We never found anyone.</span> <span id="s104">My friend, the youngest one, was so inquisitive, she got a message from two</span></p> <p><span id="s105">brothers that were...</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SWB: We have to reload</span></p> <p><span

id="s109">FELA WARSCHAU: It was noisy.</span> <span id="s110">It was loud.</span> <span id="s111">It's like joyous shouts from people that could still raise their voices, but most of them, the sick, were silent.</span> <span id="s112">Some of them had tears, you know, looking back, you remember more being asked, you remember more, people with tears in their eyes, just like we did, cry, from happiness, that it was such a long dream, all we dreamed about and what kept us going in the camps was if maybe, if maybe by some miracle we would survive, how happy we would be, um, that it shouldn't be a dream, it should be a reality and we lived to see this moment.</span> <span id="s113">What kept us also going is, was the thought of after liberation, that we also would be able to meet our relatives, our family, which we were parted from.</span> <span id="s114">The people, what they fed us, is soup and bread, to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Working transcript: not spell

know my husband told me that he was liberated by the Russians and they gave them a lot of food and people ate too fast and some of them died because their stomachs couldn't digest the food, it was to the point that your system didn't work right after being so starved.</span> <span id="s119">So I suppose maybe they were more cautious.</span> <span id="s120">There wasn't a lot of food.</span> <span id="s121">It was a moderation which was just right.</span> <span id="s122">Um, the changes with burning the barracks and disinfecting us, first of all we had the clothes, which we were wore there, which was full of disease and lice, we had to go through showers, then some powder.</span> <span id="s123">I- I couldn't tell you what it was, but I know, disinfected with a powder.</span> <span id="s124">They gave us different clothes, also.</span> <span id="s125">And then we were transported to the other brick buildings.</span> <span id="s126">We were assigned so many people to a room, and there were bunk beds there.</span> <span id="s127">We shared the room with other people.</span> <span id="s128">We were weak enough to get along with everybody, we were all happy just to be alive, and be liberated.</span> <span id="s129">But you see, um, reading the lists from other camps, from the survivors, that lived through this, we did not find anybody which, at this point, what kept me going was all this, and I was fine but when I didn't find anybody this is the time we almost, I caved in.</span> <span id="s130">I only lived with that hope that I will meet my family.</span> <span id="s131">I had such a wonderful home life, such loving parents, and I had two brothers, and besides that, I don't count the rest of the family like uncles and aunts and cousins, I think it was almost close to sixty people our rel- we had such a big relation.</span> <span id="s132">And none of us survived to the end, it was my sister and I, and two cousins that survived all this.</span> <span id="s133">So you see, I was desperate after being liberated, knowing that no one had survived, he met a man that he knew from large ghetto.</span> <span id="s134">He was in the line behind my father and my two brothers.</span> <span id="s135">And when we met him after liberation, he told us Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Wentworth

you really hit it yourself.</span> <span id="s139">You have to be so convinced that no one is alive that even he told us, we still hoped, maybe it isn't so, maybe by some miracle they did survive.</span> <span id="s140">But it didn't happen that way.</span> <span id="s141">So you see we were in a displaced camp, you just didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s142">Like I said my friend got a message two brothers of hers survived and they were on the American zone.</span> <span id="s143">They wanted her to come there.</span> <span id="s144">They would come and pick her up.</span> <span id="s145">Well she persuaded us to travel with them, since we had nothing here, what did we have to lose.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Their main argument was, maybe by chance you will find someone there.</span> <span id="s147">Maybe they weren't on the list and you will find someone.</span> <span id="s148">So we traveled with them.</span> <span id="s149">Not having any money, we traveled on freight trains, on coal wagons.</span> <span id="s150">There was only one time when we got in into a passenger train.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">The conductor didn't even come over and ask us for any money because he could see who we were and he just made a wide turn around us.</span> <span id="s152">We didn't have any money to give him anyway.</span> <span id="s153">So we arrived on the American zone in Feldafing.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">It was a camp about, I would say by train an hour away from Munich.</span> <span id="s155">And it was, um, the Americans were administering this camp, and of course they um, asked the survivors to form their own administration, like offices that if you have grievances even an infirmary was there, and a doctor, [clears throat] that was, excuse me, a survivor.</span> <span id="s156">He was the head of this infirmary.</span> <span id="s157">They also opened up kitchens and who didn't want to eat in the kitchen got supplies and you could, if you could manage in the rooms that you got, it was also brick buildings which supposedly housed before a Hitler unit[?]</span> <span id="s158">there.</span> <span id="s159">So this is where we were housed in.</span> <span id="s160">Also, several people in one room, all the four of us were in a basement room, and another girl which we didn't know at that Working

to this room.</span> <span id="s163">But we got along very well.</span> <span id="s164">There were bunk beds and there were just like one counter, and to keep a couple dishes if you could organize this, and whatever you possessed was shoved underneath the bunk beds.</span> <span id="s165">And in the middle of the room we had like a pot- belly stove, if you could manage to get food and cook, that's what we did on that pot-belly stove.</span> <span id="s166">The same thing there, no one was there, um, people in Feldafing were from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s167">It wasn't only from Poland.</span> <span id="s168">We had Hungarian Jews, Rumanian Jews, Czech Jews, and also Greek Jews in this camp.</span> <span id="s169">Every one just walking around and trying to mingle and find someone.</span> <span id="s170">Like I said, we never did.</span> <span id="s171">But what the Americans also did, is organize art schools, they brought in films, they brought in um, organized our people the survivors that were musicians and also traveling from other camps they were giving concerts and believe it or not even dances, for those that were well enough to attend all this.</span> <span id="s172">And also a Jewish, our own police force, to police that it would be safe, you know, from other intruders.</span> <span id="s173">They kept us busy.</span> <span id="s174">But the problem was, there was no future in being there.</span> <span id="s175">Where do we go from there?</span> <span id="s176">You see, to Poland, we didn't want to go back.</span> <span id="s177">It was Communist, first of all.</span> <span id="s178">I knew I had nothing to look for there and to tell you the truth maybe, I know the Polish people resent that very much, but I remember slurs and them being very anti Semitic, so I just had no, I didn't feel that I wanted to live there again.</span> <span id="s179">That wasn't what I wanted.</span> <span id="s180">Of course, we didn't want to stay in Germany, too much Jewish blood spilled there, so where do we go from there, you know?</span> <span id="s181">I, and meanwhile, I, en-, I signed up for [clears throat] art courses, it was um, like a

give, to comfort one another.</span> <span id="s189">And this is why we did get married.</span> <span id="s190">I got married in 1946.</span> <span id="s191">I met this man that was originally from

in one of the buildings afterwards in a different.</span> <span id="s195">Another couple, the same room, we divided the room with some wooden boards to be separated and have our own privacy, okay.</span> <span id="s196">And my husband worked as a policeman, and I went to the art school.</span> <span id="s197">This is how we spend our time, trying to figure out where do we go from here?</span> <span id="s198">To tell you the truth, I wasn't very strong.</span> <span id="s199">I did not regain my strength after the war.</span> <span id="s200">Some people did, and I felt that the rough journey to illegal Palestine, I could- n't take that.</span> <span id="s201">I wanted to go somewhere where I could recuperate, but where.</span> <span id="s202">You see, the problem was the

<span id="s216">Now look, when the shoe is on the other foot, what you look like, and how you react to a situation like that.</span> <span id="s217">Because, this is what they kept on telling

id="s260">Like when he marched in, in the, middle road in Hamburg to work, lined up in five, being guarded by these SS men, some of these people really didn't know who we were.</span> <span id="s261">One time I remember a wo- a woman walking up to this SS man, and saying who are these women?</span> <span id="s262">Why are they dressed like that?</span> <span id="s263">And you know what their answer was?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">That we were young prostitutes.</span> <span id="s265">And we are, we were being punished, put in our camp, because we're not supposed to do that.</span> <span id="s266">Can you imagine [laughs] something like that all five-hundred of us Jewish women being prostitutes so we were put in camps for punishment.</span> <span id="s267">You, this is.</span> <span id="s268">And I do not know why the German population did not question some of them, did not question.</span> <span id="s269">Is it really true what they are telling me?</span> <span id="s270">It seems they did whatever told, like a mechanical man or a mechanical woman.</span> <span id="s271">This is what the Nazis say, this is what Hitler says and it has to be true.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">It has to be, because he says it.</span> <span id="s273">He was almost like a god- like creature to them.</span> <span id="s274">So you see, maybe there were some people, maybe there was a underground, but not enough of them.</span> <span id="s275">Not enough of them to make a difference, because if there would be enough, it would have made a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">They would not abide by a regime like that almost for twelve</span></p> <p><span id="s277">years I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">SWB: Now, let's go to the beginning, how long before you went to Feldafing, did you stay in Bergen Belsen as a DP</span></p> <p><span id="s279">camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">FELA WARSCHAU: I think we stayed maybe two months.</span> <span id="s281">I um really don't remember the dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">SWB: Okay, tell me, before you left Bergen Belsen after you were out of the hospital situation, tell me what it was like

couple of months.</span> <span id="s285">Were you locked in...?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">FELA WARSCHAU: No, we were free to move around.</span> <span id="s287">We were free to visit other prisoners in, in Bergen Belsen.</span> <span id="s288">The doors were open.</span> <span id="s289">You could come and go as you please.</span> <span id="s290">Even venture out to different cities if you felt like it.</span> <span id="s291">That's why people traveled, and some people did venture into the city.</span> <span id="s292">I don't know what they were looking for, but they did.</span> <span id="s293">Those that stayed there, after a while, what they told us, they got more food and they just did like every camp try employ the people by some kind of a trade or whatever, make it close to normal, and believe it or not, even in Feldafing, they developed like a trade thing with the German population.</span> <span id="s294">It was like a in- unwilling partner.</span> <span id="s295">Because there were certain things you did get in the displaced camps.</span> <span id="s296">But it wasn't enough what you needed.</span> <span id="s297">Again, we did not have any money to go and buy anything.</span> <span id="s298">Let's say every month we got a care package.</span> <span id="s299">But every month and this care package was always the same thing.</span> <span id="s300">I mean, it was wonderful food, but you got a big bag like powdered milk, a huge bag dried eggs, and how much can you eat it through the month.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">So you see, you took this stuff and sort of trade it in, with the German population for something that you wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">We had no money to deal any other way.</span> <span id="s303">And they just loved what we did.</span> <span id="s304">It was like I said, a very unwilling partnership doing this.</span> <span id="s305">We could not stay all our lives isolated there since we were there,

was about I would say, close to mile and a half from the camp, and they converted a hotel into a hospital, it was called a, the hotel the Kaiser and Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s315">And was a golf course there, very big golf, golf course around there.</span> <span id="s316">People came from all over.</span> <span id="s317">And Feldafing was sort of in-between you traveled by train, you could go the other way to Garmusch, which was a famous ski resort in Germany, so there was a lot of traffic going, uh, I would say the second or the third station going towards Munich was Starnberg.</span> <span id="s318">... Starnberg you see is very famous, people come there to stay in summer and to go skiing and boating.</span> <span id="s319">All around there, the places were very familiar to, in Germany, people knew about these places.</span> <span id="s320">But very few people remember Feldafing.</span> <span id="s321">It's an odd name.</span> <span id="s322">So we left, in Feldafing, and my husband worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">They were guarding, like there was a gate in the front, like a little house for them to be in there, you know like a policeman's guard house.</span> <span id="s324">Trucks were coming in and out with food, they were being checked, you know, who they were and all that and just to keep order in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">SWB: Okay, now we have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">[CAMERA RELOAD]</span></p> <p><span id="s327">[CR#4] SWB: Okay, now we're rolling again, do you, was there a difference between the American

me, it seems like, because they found us, and they had to do it, it was a job, but I don't think there was any special warmth or any connection, personal feelings, you know.</span> <span id="s332">Like sometimes you feel the people sympathize with you, maybe single ones, but in, all-in-all it didn't come across to me like that.</span> <span id="s333">But once I was in the American zone in Feldafing, you know the Military Police, they came in a lot to the camp because they had connections with this local police, the survivors.</span> <span id="s334">They always came in to this, their office there.</span> <span id="s335">For what reason I don't know, I never asked, but they were, there was a big camaraderie, it was, they didn't make any difference, to them, like you were an equal with them and there was great warmth that come, that came through.</span> <span id="s336">Even if we didn't understand the English.</span> <span id="s337">One day one of them came in, I remember this, because my husband told me that.</span> <span id="s338">He came in on a jeep, and he parked it.</span> <span id="s339">He went into the office and then he motioned to my husband, he should come and bring the jeep around.</span> <span id="s340">Naturally, coming from here, and thinking he is a policeman, he knows how to drive this car, this jeep, or drive at all.</span> <span id="s341">Well he said I took this key and I kept on fiddling back and forth, and I brought him the jeep and he said this is how I learned how to drive [laughs], see they were so, you know, it's something that you felt close to a person when they do things like that.</span> <span id="s342">But I think the English were more distant.</span> <span id="s343">They meant it good but we didn't understand at</span></p> <p><span id="s344">that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">SWB: Did you witness reunions of survivors, people who found each other who had survived and didn't know...</span></p> <p><span

sister and I didn't find anybody, and our two other friends had found someone.</span> <span id="s350">We were overjoyed for them, but at the same time sad for ourselves, knowing that there was nothing to hope for anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">SWB: What about visits to the camp by Eisenhower, do you</span></p> <p><span id="s352">remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">FELA WARSCHAU: He was there.</span> <span id="s354">He was in Feldafing one time, I couldn't tell you exactly when, I know he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">SWB: And what about Ben-Gurion, did he come?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">FELA WARSCHAU: I don't remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">SWB: Tell me about how the Jewish population in Feldafing organized itself and what kind of culture they did and did they make a newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">FELA WARSCHAU: There really was no newspaper but there were meetings.</span> <span id="s359">Like I said, there were socials.</span> <span id="s360">There were dances, the organized dances, there were survivors that played the instruments before the war.</span> <span id="s361">Where they got the instruments I will never know.</span> <span id="s362">But they organized dances, the Americans also brought in films.</span> <span id="s363">It was like a great big building and they run films for us for free there.</span> <span id="s364">And also amateur theater.</span> <span id="s365">Also survivors that traveled from camp to camp in our own, from our camp, that performed little skits to entertain us, and like I said, I don't know if I told you that, one time they had a skit with that organ grinder, two people, one of them, uh, portrayed Hitler, and the other one, I don't if it was Goebbels or Goehring or Working

going around and begging people, they were all gone and they need a few, I, you probably don't understand Yiddish or do you.</span> <span id="s368">No.</span> <span id="s369">Well anyway, there was a little, I remember a few words in Yiddish, how they were singing this.</span> <span id="s370">And to the end they say, we are so poor now and broke, give us a few pennies.</span> <span id="s371">And we all roared, and everybody threw their pennies on the stage, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">SWB: Tell me that story again as if you hadn't told it to me.</span> <span id="s373">Say the lines in Yiddish and then translate them.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">FELA WARSCHAU: There were amateur theaters.</span> <span id="s375">They performing all kind of skits.</span> <span id="s376">One of them was, well there was another one about people needing to go to Palestine, you know it was like little propaganda, and this one was two organ grinders, going around and begging for money.</span> <span id="s377">And they were singing, the song was like [Yiddish words], that means our luck has run out, and we all we do is grind this organ and they beg people for some money to support ourselves.</span> <span id="s378">I will never forget that skit because it was like throwing these pennies in face of these two performers, it gave us satisfaction, you know, you don't understand, you probably don't understand the feeling we had at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Thinking that we could sit here, free, and make fun out of them, that's what it was.</span></p> <p><span

know they had some kind of organization, um, I think the bunt they were called, and they marched at certain holidays, with flags through the camp, in the camp, you know, observing this holiday.</span>

this wasn't my top priority at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">SWB: What about children, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">FELA WARSCHAU: We had no children in the beginning.</span> <span id="s391">Only the people that got married there in the camp after a while had children.</span> <span id="s392">I also had a daughter there, and she was born in the year of 1949.</span> <span id="s393">So, uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s394">SWB: I need you to tell me the skit story once more, because the second time you didn't tell me it was Hitler and Goehring who were the characters.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">FELA WARSCHAU: So you had this skit, two organ grinders.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">One in the image of Hitler, and one, I don't remember if it was Goehring or Goebbels.</span> <span id="s397">And they came out on the stage, grinding this organ, and singing that song [Yiddish words], and we just roared, you know, it was uplifting that we could make fun out of them, on the other side of the coin we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">It was unbelievable at that time.</span> <span id="s399">Being for so long, shut up.</span> <span

happened.</span> <span id="s416">And there's nothing, nowhere to turn, so it was very hard for me to take, I got real emotional.</span> <span id="s417">Somehow she thought she has to pull together because someone has to do something.</span> <span id="s418">So it was a comfort to know that she was so strong at that time.</span> <span id="s419">But after a while it came out that I was the
