I was hired to another company and I never made it because the war broke out.</span> <span id="s956">And...in the place where I worked, they did want me to run the books.</span></p> <p><span

what’s going on there, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s961">So I was so disgusted, so, I mean, I spent so much time, you know?</span> <span id="s962">I spent 50% of my wages I spent for schooling, to pay the tuition.</span> <span id="s963">And...here I don’t know, I am graduated.</span> <span id="s964">I have a good report card, and I don’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s965">So I went to the professor, to the director from the school.</span> <span id="s966">And there was no telephones that time.</span> <span id="s967">You know, you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s968">So, when you go there, you always, in order to make sure he is home you go during dinner time.</span> <span id="s969">[laughs] So, that’s what I figured out.</span> <span id="s970">If I go during dinner, I’m sure he will be home, because it was a long way to go to.</span> <span id="s971">And I came there and he was eating dinner.</span> <span id="s972">And then I came in, and he saw right away.</span> <span id="s973">He says, “You are troubled.</span> <span id="s974">What’s wrong?”</span> <span id="s975">So, I told him.</span> <span id="s976">And he says, “Sit down.”</span> <span id="s977">And he told his wife to give me a cup of tea.</span> <span id="s978">“Sit down,” he says slowly.</span> <span id="s979">So I told him my, “I don’t know from nothing.</span> <span id="s980">And you always told me I am so good.”</span> <span id="s981">So, he picked up a fork and a knife, he picked up, you know?</span> <span id="s982">He says to me, “You see, this is a fork and this is a knife.</span> <span id="s983">We are not here to take care of the fork and knife.</span> <span id="s984">The fork and knife were invented for our convenience.</span> <span id="s985">We’re not for the convenience of the fork and knife.</span> <span id="s986">But they are for our convenience.”</span> <span id="s987">I say, “What does that to do with me?”</span> <span id="s988">He says, so he says, “You know the whole system of bookkeeping,” he says.</span> <span id="s989">“Never mind what the guy did there with it.</span> <span id="s990">You adjust it to your own convenience.</span> <span id="s991">You’re not to, for the convenience to the fork,” he says.</span> <span id="s992">“You’re not for the convenience for the books what they, somebody else wants it.</span> <span id="s993">You set up a system the way you want it.”</span> <span id="s994">And when he told me that, so you know, a couple of months later he came to find out.</span> <span id="s995">[laughs] I set up the system and, he says, “You know...how the system works,” he says.</span> <span id="s996">“And if you go deeply, if you go from the beginning,” he says, “you will follow his too because you know the,” he says, “there is one way how the bookkeeping goes.”</span> <span id="s997">You see, but in Poland it was actually two ways, what they used to call there now double entry and the Americanka entry.</span> <span id="s998">The Americanka entry is what we do now.</span> <span id="s999">In Poland it used to be, some people used to have there now double entry.</span> <span id="s1000">And I learned both ways.</span></p>

1982, with Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s1041">We were talking, Mr. Adler, about your finding out about what was happening in the rest of Europe, in the late ‘30s, and whether or not you felt that this was going to influence Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">MA: Well, the Polish government assured us that they’re strong and that they’re not afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">JF: Were you afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">MA: We were afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">JF: Did you think at any time of the possibility of leaving Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">MA: How could you?</span> <span id="s1047">We, I was thinking many times, and everybody, who could leave, left.</span> <span id="s1048">Palestine didn’t let you in.</span> <span id="s1049">My brother had a chance.</span> <span id="s1050">He left for Palestine and took quite a couple years.</span> <span id="s1051">He was on hachsharah.</span> <span id="s1052">You know what a hachsharah is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">JF: Describe it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">MA: If a young man or girl did want to leave for Palestine through an organization, they had to go into a camp, and to get used to the, to prepare them to the life in Palestine.</span> <span id="s1055">And at the same time they taught them how to fight too, because there always was, the Jews were always, you know, attacked by the Arabs.</span> <span id="s1056">And he was for two years in a hachsharah on and off.</span> <span id="s1057">And after, if you qualify, if you, see, there were a certain, a limited, a kind of certificate what they used to call.</span> <span id="s1058">The English government gave out so many thousands, not much was it.</span> <span id="s1059">I don’t remember how many thousand a year.</span> <span id="s1060">And so they, the people who qualified, they got the certificate and they could emigrate.</span> <span id="s1061">And my brother was one of them.</span> <span id="s1062">And he left in 19-, just in time when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s1063">My other brother left for Germany in 1927, before Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s1064">When Hitler came to power, he sent them back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">JF: He sent him back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">MA: And, that’s right.</span> <span id="s1067">And when he came to Poland, there was a, right on the border, a town.</span> <span id="s1068">It’s called Zbonszyn.</span> <span id="s1069">He dumped a lot of Polish Jews there.</span> <span id="s1070">Little did he know...that he did him a big favor, Hitler did.</span> <span id="s1071">And when he came to Zbonszyn, my brother, and he didn’t want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1072">He hated Poland more than Germany.</span> <span id="s1073">So he smuggled his way back to Germany, and from Germany to Belgium and France and he, well, he couldn’t stay there because he came illegally.</span> <span id="s1074">And finally in 1938—or in ‘37 was it?</span> <span id="s1075">I don’t remember which year; it doesn’t, or earlier, no, in ‘36 I think was it—the relief organization sent him to Brazil.</span> <span id="s1076">He found out that Brazil needed farmers, so he says, “I’m a farmer.”</span> <span id="s1077">[laughs] He went to Brazil and he was in Brazil till my other brother who is here in this country, Felix, he brought him over in 1941, he brought him over here.</span> <span id="s1078">And when he came here, he joined the army right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">JF: There was no chance for you to get out, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">MA: No, I, mother, maybe I would have a chance, but I didn’t try because I didn’t want to do it to mother.</span> <span

big mistake that time.</span> <span id="s1095">The biggest mistake they made, when Hitler, before Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia, he talked in Poland to attack the Sudeten part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1096">And Poland took it.</span> <span id="s1097">And after Poland took Sudeten, Hitler says he wants all of Poland.</span> <span id="s1098">And in September 1st, 1939, he marched in.</span> <span id="s1099">And Krakow wasn’t far from the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">JF: What happened in Krakow with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">MA: First of all they bombed Krakow right in the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">JF: Where were you when the bombing started?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">MA: In Krakow.</span> <span id="s1104">There were shelters.</span> <span id="s1105">We run to the shelters and that was on a Friday.</span> <span id="s1106">And on Tuesday I left Krakow.</span> <span id="s1107">I had a sister there, a sister and two

brother-in-law told me, he says, “How can anybody advise you what to do?</span> <span id="s1114">You have to use your own with this.”</span> <span id="s1115">So I said to him, “What would you do if you would be in my situation?”</span> <span id="s1116">And he says, “If I would be single, with no wife or children attached to me, and I have a mother somewhere, I would go to unite with my mother.”</span> <span id="s1117">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1118">And I walked all the way.</span> <span id="s1119">And, which on the way the Polacks, even the war was going on, they were robbing us blind, beating us.</span> <span id="s1120">We had to be afraid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">JF: The Poles?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">MA: The Poles, yeah.</span></p>

<span id="s1133">There was an organization, what they call them, Endeks.</span> <span id="s1134">[National Democrats] And they were awful, they were open antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1135">They didn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s1136">They just beat up Jews wherever they could.</span> <span id="s1137">And they were trying to push us and a lot of priests belonged to this organization and a lot of, especially the...student body from the universities, which there weren’t much Jews anyhow there.</span> <span id="s1138">They were the rulers of this organization.</span> <span id="s1139">And they were very antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1140">And we had...pardon me, and we had a lot of trouble on the way from them, but I finally, I left, Tuesday I left Krakow and Saturday afternoon I arrived to my hometown.</span> <span id="s1141">And when I came in my hometown, I, the whole town, there was no Polish authority more in the town.</span> <span id="s1142">Everybody did what they want.</span> <span id="s1143">The Polacks went...robbing everybody.</span> <span id="s1144">If somebody left, you know, people run away, so they busted open their houses and robbed them out.</span></p> <p><span

the stores open, you know.</span> <span id="s1170">They were already being robbed, everything tooken out, the Polacks.</span> <span id="s1171">And when I came to our house, the, it was locked all over.</span> <span id="s1172">So I say, “It isn’t robbed out.</span> <span id="s1173">Must be somebody there.”</span> <span id="s1174">So, I knock on the door.</span> <span id="s1175">Yeah, when I came, I had, I came with a boyfriend what he was from the same town.</span> <span id="s1176">And we lived in Krakow both.</span> <span id="s1177">We were both in Krakow and we were both from the same town.</span> <span id="s1178">So, we walked all the way home.</span> <span id="s1179">Now when we came, I lived in one side of the town and he lived in the other side.</span> <span id="s1180">So we decided we will go—I go home and he go home.</span> <span id="s1181">But we didn’t know either one family who survived, who is left.</span> <span id="s1182">So we...agreed so.</span> <span id="s1183">If his parents, if he, if one of the parents is left, we both stay with his parents.</span> <span id="s1184">And if not, we will find out later what to do.</span> <span id="s1185">But meantime, I am going home, and if my parents are home, I stay home.</span> <span id="s1186">If my parents are not home, I wait near my home.</span> <span id="s1187">If my mother is not home, I wait near my home.</span> <span id="s1188">And he will came to me either way, even if his parents are there or not, he will came to my house.</span> <span id="s1189">So I knock on the door and nobody answers.</span> <span id="s1190">Nobody answers.</span> <span id="s1191">I had a sack, you know, a sack with a string, this.</span> <span id="s1192">So I took it off and put this on the steps from my house.</span> <span id="s1193">And I was thinking, “Oh, I will wait for my boyfriend till he comes.”</span> <span id="s1194">In the meantime I hear somebody is, walks in the house.</span> <span id="s1195">Well so as I was sitting there I got so, I was thinking, who?</span> <span id="s1196">Maybe somebody took it over.</span> <span id="s1197">And I see they are slowly open, trying to open the door.</span> <span id="s1198">And I see that’s my mother.</span> <span id="s1199">She said later because usually when the goyim captain, they, here was a gentle, maybe some other friend needed something, somebody.</span> <span id="s1200">So she came to open up.</span> <span id="s1201">And I find out mother was home still.</span> <span id="s1202">And she said, “Everybody run away.</span> <span id="s1203">What to do?”</span> <span id="s1204">I say, “No, well, the worst thing if you leave home, that’s the worst thing what can happen to a place.”</span> <span id="s1205">And I saw, I was walking from Krakow and I saw what happened.</span> <span id="s1206">I say not to go.</span> <span id="s1207">And we stayed and later my boyfriend came and his parents were home too.</span> <span

loose.</span> <span id="s1211">They first thing, as soon as they came in, they didn’t open the door.</span> <span id="s1212">They knocked the doors open.</span> <span id="s1213">And, “All the men out.”</span> <span id="s1214">Just the men.</span> <span id="s1215">They took all the men out in the market square.</span> <span id="s1216">And they didn’t make any distinguish Jews or not Jews.</span> <span id="s1217">Man is man.</span> <span id="s1218">And with all the gentiles, everything.</span> <span id="s1219">And later—it took a couple hours till they round up the whole town—and after they rounded up, they say, “Who is not a Jew shall leave.”</span> <span id="s1220">So, all the gentiles start going in the side.</span> <span id="s1221">So later they said to the gentiles, “Anything you want from the Jews, take.”</span> <span id="s1222">So they took off from the jackets from us, if you wore a good jacket.</span> <span id="s1223">Even the shirt they left you.</span> <span id="s1224">And the Polacks, they listened.</span> <span id="s1225">They took away everything.</span> <span id="s1226">They left you without nothing.</span> <span id="s1227">And in the meantime the whole town is on fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">JF: They set the entire town on fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">MA: On fire, most of the town.</span> <span id="s1230">Not the

id="s1233">Yeah, they said to give away all the watches that is.</span> <span id="s1234">So a guy, later a Polack took from him the pants.</span> <span id="s1235">He likes the pants so he finds a watch there.</span> <span id="s1236">So they shot him because he didn’t give the watch.</span> <span id="s1237">But anyhow, it was like around 12:00 or 1:00 at night was it they came with a tank and

priority.</span> <span id="s2161">The...secretary of the party was a Jew.</span> <span id="s2162">The secretary of the party is one of the biggest jobs there.</span> <span id="s2163">And there

burial.</span> <span id="s2185">So, they promised her.</span> <span id="s2186">Next day, this younger woman came, and she died.</span> <span id="s2187">They took her and gave her a Jewish burial and her son, he didn’t say who he is, what he is.</span> <span id="s2188">Her son was there.</span> <span id="s2189">And he said a beautiful kaddish, and he shed a tear.</span> <span id="s2190">He was to

id="s2199">MA: Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2200">They sent him away.</span> <span id="s2201">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s2202">Meantime, when we were in the this, you know, when the war started, when Hitler attacked Russia, it was very critical and we were very mistreated.</span> <span id="s2203">And we had a guy who was in charge of us.</span> <span id="s2204">Came a new guy.</span> <span

<p><span id="s2208">JF: This was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">MA: That was in 1942 already.</span> <span id="s2210">In 1942 already.</span> <span id="s2211">He says, “A war goes on!”</span> <span id="s2212">And what can you do?</span> <span id="s2213">Just suffer.</span> <span id="s2214">Meantime, a ration guy comes, a Russian native.</span> <span id="s2215">And he says, “Why don’t you write a letter to Moscow?</span> <span id="s2216">I’m sure Moscow wouldn’t...they wouldn’t be too happy to see what they do to you people.</span> <span id="s2217">Why don’t you write a letter?”</span> <span id="s2218">And he helped us write the letter, a complaint letter to Moscow, and he knew the address where to write.</span> <span id="s2219">And it took about six months, and we got an answer.</span> <span id="s2220">And they said that they sent out a man to investigate the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2221">And it took another couple of weeks, and the man came.</span> <span id="s2222">And you know who the man came?</span> <span id="s2223">The same guy!</span> <span id="s2224">[laughs] You see, they sent him away, and he became bigger!</span> <span id="s2225">He became

nothing.</span> <span id="s2239">Oh no, oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">JF: None of that information got to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">MA: No, no, no, no, not, but, you see, you see, now, in 19-, we were taken in 1940, right?</span> <span id="s2242">Into Siberia.</span> <span id="s2243">In 1941 the Germans attacked Russia.</span> <span id="s2244">And in 1942 they were near Stalingrad already I think.</span> <span id="s2245">And by 1942 the tensions against us eased a little because they find out we’re not, you see, as long as they were...in a treatment with the Germans, you know, they treated us, like the Germans wanted, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">JF: I see.</span> <span id="s2247">So when the Germans invaded, you became allies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">MA: We became, that was...one of the happiest days in our life.</span> <span id="s2249">You see, it’s funny, but that’s the way it was.</span> <span id="s2250">Because we knew that Germany will not influence them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">JF: Did you find out about the Einsatzgruppen, the German units that were coming in and killing the Jews in the Russian, the front lines in the Russian areas?</span> <span id="s2252">You didn’t hear about any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">MA: No, no.</span> <span id="s2254">We didn’t know nothing.</span> <span id="s2255">I’ll tell you when we find out.</span> <span id="s2256">So...in 194-, the end of 1942, they already, it formed, a Polish government formed that time, in exile, with the general underseer, the head of the government.</span> <span id="s2257">And they eased, I think, on us, very easy.</span> <span id="s2258">We were not any more prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">JF: The Russians saw you differently at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">MA: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s2261">You see...</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">JF: Starting in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">MA: No, it took a year for the, yeah, till a Polish government settled, found.</span> <span id="s2264">And in the end of 1942, around in the end, you see, we could, if we would leave the villages to go to the main city to, where they were, you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">JF: You could travel between cities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">MA: Yeah, not, and but that’s how far you could travel, that’s all.</span> <span id="s2267">Farther you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s2268">You could go there.</span> <span id="s2269">And so me, and a niece of my...my sister’s daughter, we got out from the village on foot.</span> <span id="s2270">It was about 180 kilometer was it.</span> <span id="s2271">It was still winter at that time.</span> <span id="s2272">It was still snow.</span> <span id="s2273">It was, you know when that was, could be, in Jewish is it, when...about a month before Purim.</span> <span id="s2274">It was...I guess in February.</span> <span id="s2275">You see, only in the winter you can travel.</span> <span id="s2276">In the summer you cannot travel there.</span> <span id="s2277">Because there was no highways.</span> <span id="s2278">There was no...that was the reason we never drive south in the woods, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">JF: The ice was easier to travel on than the mud.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">MA: And the ice, you see, the river became the highway.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">JF: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">MA: You can, on the river you traveled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">JF: You could walk on the river?</span> <span id="s2284">Or you would...</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">MA: Trains are going on the river, what with tractors, they walk on there, she says.</span> <span id="s2286">Tractors!</span> <span id="s2287">That’s the main highway in the winter.</span> <span id="s2288">You see, we here, when a snow falls down, everything gets paralyzed.</span> <span id="s2289">Over there, when the snow stops, everything gets paralyzed in summer time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">JF: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">MA: And when they, once the snow falls and everything gets frozen, everything becomes alive again.</span> <span id="s2292">The horses, in the summer time they let them loose because they have no use for them.</span> <span id="s2293">They get, and once the snow falls down they came back by themselves because they cannot find food in the woods.</span> <span id="s2294">So...we got on our way and we came to Bodaybo.</span> <span id="s2295">And I got a job, I right away find a job as a stevedore there.</span> <span id="s2296">And later...and the niece became, and we got a little room there.</span> <span id="s2297">And anyhow, you see, again, you could do it.</span> <span id="s2298">You know, here, you cannot do all things like this.</span> <span id="s2299">Because if you came in a terrible, where you go.</span> <span id="s2300">Over there, to any Jew, you walk in there, they put you up and they... Now let me tell you something.</span> <span id="s2301">I had a brother-in-law what he was in Korea.</span> <span id="s2302">And he was in the Korean War.</span> <span id="s2303">I mean, one was in the Korean War anyhow.</span> <span id="s2304">But he was sent from the Washington an advisor to the Korean government for two years.</span> <span id="s2305">He set up the...federal reserve system there.</span> <span id="s2306">He’s on economics.</span> <span id="s2307">He works for the government.</span> <span id="s2308">And he was there two years.</span> <span id="s2309">And while he was there I married his sister, you know.</span> <span id="s2310">And I got married here.</span> <span id="s2311">And when he came back, he has two more brothers and two sisters.</span> <span id="s2312">And he decided he wants to stay with me.</span> <span id="s2313">I was happy.</span> <span id="s2314">Yeah, I didn’t, I wasn’t so furnished, the house wasn’t so big here.</span> <span id="s2315">I didn’t have such, I didn’t live here at that time.</span> <span id="s2316">It was a smaller house.</span> <span id="s2317">So...I didn’t have a house...a room for him.</span> <span id="s2318">So we took the double mattress, you know, took off and put this in the living room on the floor, and they slept on the mattress.</span> <span id="s2319">So, we were sitting and talking, and he says, “You will wonder why I want to stay with you and not with my brothers and my sisters,” he says.</span> <span id="s2320">“They are American-born,” he says, “they didn’t got through what we,” he says.</span> <span id="s2321">“I got through in Korea,” he says.</span> <span id="s2322">“I can’t imagine what you got through,” he says.</span> <span id="s2323">“To you it doesn’t mean nothing I took the mattress.”</span> <span id="s2324">To him it would be I hadn’t got a separate room for you, you know what I mean?”</span> <span id="s2325">So that’s the Russian people.</span> <span id="s2326">As long as they had a piece of floor, you didn’t have to know him.</span> <span id="s2327">You, I mean, if he was a goy or a yid or a this, they put you up anywhere.</span> <span id="s2328">So that’s the reason I didn’t, whether I came the first house, I walked in and they treated me like a guest, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">JF: Let me ask you a question, before we get to your move here, which was in late 1942.</span> <span id="s2330">Were you able to practice any of your religious tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">MA: No.</span> <span id="s2332">No,

you in jail.</span> <span id="s2336">Especially it was a rabbi there.</span> <span id="s2337">The rabbi from Lanset, oh, he got, they tortured him practically.</span> <span id="s2338">And later they sent him away.</span> <span id="s2339">I don’t know where, we don’t know where he wind up even.</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">JF: They tortured him for trying to practice Judaism in, while he was in Russia?</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">MA: Yeah, yeah, they, for some reason they find out he was a rabbi too.</span> <span id="s2342">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2343">And they caught him davening [praying].</span> <span id="s2344">Yeah, no, you wasn’t allowed.</span> <span id="s2345">And now...</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">JF: So you couldn’t even do it in secret?</span></p> <p><span

id="s2351">In secret you can do everything in Russia.</span> <span id="s2352">You see, when you do something wrong, when you get caught doing something wrong, they don’t say you did something wrong.</span> <span id="s2353">They say, “He got caught.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">JF: Were you able to get a minyan [group of 10 men necessary to conduct public prayers] together

But at the time, let’s wait for that.</span> <span id="s2362">At the time when you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">MA: No, you couldn’t get a minyan.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">JF: In these

worked in the coal mine.</span> <span id="s2735">And the coal mine was, you had to give up so many tons, a guy has to dig up so many tons a day.</span> <span id="s2736">So many tons, that’s a normal day’s work.</span> <span id="s2737">That’s where you get paid so much.</span> <span id="s2738">He dug up four times as much as the...which is called 400%.</span> <span id="s2739">That’s was the highest what he did.</span> <span id="s2740">And every good worker who works on 400% in any kind of work, it’s called a stakhanovite.</span> <span id="s2741">Now I was a stevedore, and the stevedore, we had to give up so many tons a day from the ship.</span> <span id="s2742">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2743">And I usually worked, my brigade worked on 400%, which we used a little, a

if we came up from the ship here and we have to, here was, the scale was here, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2751">So I always put up here a piece of junk here.</span> <span id="s2752">So we had to go around.</span> <span id="s2753">But you didn’t have to go around but it was written out you have to go around.</span> <span id="s2754">And always manage to put a step, so from this five ton

id="s2846">[laughs] Listen to it!</span> <span id="s2847">So, I build the chimneys.</span> <span id="s2848">Not only chimneys, only anybody who needed to fix, you know, stuff.</span> <span id="s2849">So I had a guy who worked with me.</span> <span id="s2850">So it was already cold, the winter, right?</span> <span id="s2851">And I builded a chimney in the office.</span> <span id="s2852">And not in this office.</span> <span id="s2853">In the office from the, where the tractors there, the shop from the tractors are.</span> <span id="s2854">Because this was a agriculture, a farm actually.</span> <span id="s2855">So I had to build a new chimney there.</span> <span id="s2856">So I told him to give me wood.</span> <span id="s2857">Wood was very scarce.</span> <span id="s2858">That was not Siberia.</span> <span id="s2859">You see, here was no wood at all.</span> <span id="s2860">To give me wood, to warm up the water and to mix that cement, because with the cold water it just got frozen and so he says, “What else would you want?</span> <span id="s2861">You must be kidding!”</span> <span id="s2862">he says to me.</span> <span id="s2863">I talked to him and he says, “You are here to build a chimney and build it,” he says.</span> <span id="s2864">“And that’s all what I know.”</span> <span id="s2865">And I talked it over with the guy with me.</span> <span id="s2866">He says, “Let’s build him a chimney.”</span> <span id="s2867">So we didn’t use even mortar.</span> <span id="s2868">We used snow and water.</span> <span id="s2869">And it got frozen right away, you know?</span> <span id="s2870">It got frozen right away.</span> <span id="s2871">We built a, it was so, it was a pleasure.</span> <span id="s2872">It got frozen right away.</span> <span id="s2873">And we builded this.</span> <span id="s2874">So all what we needed him to assign us that we built it so we will get paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">JF: What happened during the thaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2876">MA: One second.</span> <span id="s2877">So we, he signed us.</span> <span id="s2878">In the meantime, they made a fire there, and my partner says to me, “Let’s go out quick from there.”</span> <span id="s2879">We go out and stay and watch and see that no smoke goes out from there.</span> <span id="s2880">And we’re watching the smoke.</span> <span id="s2881">We see it thick settles a little bit and later the whole thing falls down!</span> <span id="s2882">[laughs] So, they called me in.</span> <span id="s2883">So I told them the story.</span> <span

even insulated.</span> <span id="s2896">And you know how we had to do?</span> <span id="s2897">We had to cover the houses with snow all in the beginning.</span> <span id="s2898">But you had to do it with the first snow when it comes out.</span> <span id="s2899">Because the first snow was a little wet, and it got frozen, it was a insulation.</span> <span id="s2900">And if you waited, you had to evacuate it, the shack.</span> <span id="s2901">Because later when the snow falls down, the wind blew it away, it was crisp, you know, and they didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">JF: Drier.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">MA: Yeah, and over there again we had winters awful winds.</span> <span id="s2904">The winds, if a wind started, a wind could take, could last about five, six day

to arrest him.</span> <span id="s3799">We hide him.</span> <span id="s3800">We did hide him eight days.</span> <span id="s3801">We hid him in Ulm.</span> <span id="s3802">And later we sent him to

<p><span id="s3819">MA: No, no.</span> <span id="s3820">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">JF: It was the captain who they sought.</span></p> <p><span id="s3822">MA: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s3823">That’s right.</span> <span id="s3824">They, wanted, what I knew, what they were on the [unclear].</span> <span id="s3825">A matter of fact the one who lives next door to me, their daughter was on the Exodus.</span> <span id="s3826">They weren’t, no, they weren’t in danger at all.</span> <span id="s3827">And after ‘48, when they won the war, so it was a legal thing.</span> <span id="s3828">You could register to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s3829">So listen to it.</span> <span id="s3830">So now a camp was, in the, not in the shtatishe, but...I also belonged, you see, I worked in the shtatishe, the shtatishe committee didn’t have actually people.</span> <span id="s3831">Only we ruled all the seven camps.</span> <span id="s3832">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s3833">But every camp had his own government and we elected every year new people, you know, who to be in charge.</span> <span id="s3834">So there was a guy there, a teacher.</span> <span id="s3835">And he was a very greedy guy.</span> <span id="s3836">And he did run for this.</span> <span id="s3837">And I saw that he will not make a good representative.</span> <span id="s3838">You know, I was against him.</span> <span id="s3839">I didn’t run against him.</span> <span id="s3840">But I supported somebody else.</span> <span id="s3841">So, he took it very serious and he was a very sore—he didn’t win—he was a very sore loser.</span> <span id="s3842">Later, when the Jewish State became a State and we formed a committee to, you know, to, about the emigration, he was the secretary of the emigration.</span> <span id="s3843">When my papers came up, he put them on the bottom.</span> <span id="s3844">I was already ready.</span> <span id="s3845">I already had, I was thinking for sure, because I was the one from the first one to be registered.</span> <span id="s3846">And my brother wrote me that he has quarters for me.</span> <span id="s3847">He has an apartment for me.</span> <span id="s3848">And so I had a cousin.</span> <span id="s3849">He lives now in Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s3850">And he lived in Kassel.</span> <span id="s3851">That’s near Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s3852">So, I find out, the General Consul, his name was Fingerwood [phonetic] that time, from the Israeli Consul who is in München, he is, I knew him from before, he was with me in the yeshiva!</span> <span id="s3853">[laughing]</span></p> <p><span id="s3854">JF: So you went to him...</span></p> <p><span id="s3855">MA: So, I was thinking I will go to Munich and tell them the whole story and maybe he can do something about it.</span> <span id="s3856">So, the bus who went to Munich came from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s3857">You know, the same bus came from Frankfurt, stopped in Munich and...</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">JF: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">MA: When I sit, want sit down on the bus, my cousin from Frankfurt comes out.</span> <span id="s3860">He says, “Where are you going?”</span> <span id="s3861">I says, “I’m going to Frankfurt.”</span> <span id="s3862">He says, “I came to see you!”</span> <span id="s3863">He says, “Now you’re going away!”</span> <span id="s3864">O.K., I exchanged him a ticket.</span> <span id="s3865">The ticket could be any day, you know.</span> <span id="s3866">Over there you bought a ticket it can be any day.</span> <span id="s3867">So I took him home and we start talking and he says, “Why don’t you go to America?”</span> <span id="s3868">He says, “You see, it doesn’t work,” he says.</span> <span id="s3869">“Maybe your destiny is America.”</span> <span id="s3870">He said, “Don’t fight this.</span> <span id="s3871">He doesn’t want to let you go; maybe it’s for your own good.”</span> <span id="s3872">And you know, I’m not superstitious, but when it comes to big, that’s a big decision I think.</span> <span id="s3873">So I was thinking maybe he’s right and here are my two brothers, they’re begging me to come.</span> <span id="s3874">So I wrote to my brother in Palestine, in Israel, “Sorry.</span> <span id="s3875">I’m going to America.”</span> <span id="s3876">And I wrote to my brother and he sent me right away papers.</span> <span id="s3877">Not only sent me papers.</span> <span id="s3878">When I came I had an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s3879">JF: Here to Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span

hard to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s3884">JF: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your experiences during those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s3885">MA: Well, I had a very bad time when my wife died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3886">JF: Your wife died here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3887">MA: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3888">JF: You had gone through a great deal

id="s3892">And my se-, later, after three years, I remarried.</span> <span id="s3893">And that was even harder yet, when she died.</span> <span id="s3894">She was a wonderful girl.</span> <span id="s3895">She took care of the children like they were her own.</span> <span id="s3896">And of course my brothers were a big comfort, both times.</span></p> <p><span id="s3897">JF: And when you...came here, you started the market that you had in West Philadelphia?</span></p> <p><span id="s3898">MA: No, when I came first I worked for my brother in Chester.</span> <span id="s3899">He had a store in Chester.</span> <span id="s3900">You see, he had, he was a story.</span> <span id="s3901">He was a sergeant in the army.</span> <span id="s3902">And he trained me like I would be in the army!</span> <span id="s3903">[laughs] He took it serious.</span> <span id="s3904">He’s a very serious guy.</span> <span id="s3905">And of course like a brother, like a good brother, you know.</span> <span id="s3906">First of all, he didn’t let me read no Polish paper, no Russian paper, no Jewish paper.</span> <span id="s3907">He start me off with the Bulletin.</span> <span id="s3908">He says, “You live here.</span> <span id="s3909">You have to learn English.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3910">JF: So you learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3911">MA: I learned English.</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">JF: And gradually after that you got the small grocery store in...</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">MA: After three years—I worked with him three years—he says, “You can run a store by yourself.</span> <span id="s3914">And both brothers got together.</span> <span id="s3915">And they gave me the money and we started the store.</span> <span id="s3916">And I started the store.</span> <span id="s3917">I’ll never forget this one incident, in West Philadelphia, 50th and Brown.</span> <span id="s3918">I needed a new cooler, for soda, cooler.</span> <span id="s3919">So Pepsi-Cola sold that time coolers.</span> <span id="s3920">And I made the arrangements because I remember $200.</span> <span id="s3921">I didn’t have the $200.</span> <span id="s3922">In beginning, you know, you start off a store.</span> <span id="s3923">[unclear] [chuckles].</span> <span id="s3924">The first day I took in 20 some dollars.</span> <span id="s3925">The first week something like $180 a week I took in, you know?</span> <span id="s3926">I had a big competition, a big store across the street.</span> <span id="s3927">But anyhow, my brother comes and visits me and, yeah, and so I applied for credit to pay out.</span> <span id="s3928">That is, I paid him $20 down and would pay out.</span> <span id="s3929">So, I got; later, so they checked my credit.</span> <span id="s3930">I didn’t have credit nowhere because I always I bought something I paid cash.</span> <span id="s3931">I didn’t have any charge cards nowhere no.</span> <span id="s3932">So they sent me back the no check and, “Sorry, no credit.”</span> <span id="s3933">So my brother comes and we’re sitting and talking and he sees a letter from the First Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s3934">He says, “What do you deal with the First Pennsylvania?”</span> <span id="s3935">I say, “No,” I show it to him, “it’s just a letter.”</span> <span id="s3936">He says, “Oh bunch of son of a..</span> <span id="s3937">.”</span> <span id="s3938">He says, took out $200, pay in cash for a soda machine!</span> <span id="s3939">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s3940">JF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3941">MA: But anyhow, later when I..</span> <span id="s3942">.</span> <span id="s3943">got together some money I paid him up.</span> <span id="s3944">This brother, he took from me right away the money.</span> <span id="s3945">Every time I got a couple of dollars I give him.</span> <span id="s3946">The other brother I knew he is an accountant.</span> <span id="s3947">I knew I will have, he will not want to take it, and I didn’t want his.</span> <span id="s3948">So, we got together the money.</span> <span id="s3949">I remember it was a guy Harry Fein.</span> <span id="s3950">He supplied us with meat.</span> <span id="s3951">So I took every week and I paid him every week.</span> <span id="s3952">So later I knew the brother supposed to come and I owed him $1,000 and I was thinking I have to get a, I had already about now six, seven hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s3953">So I was thinking I owe this Harry Fein $200 and Louie Pinchas $100, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s3954">So if I pay him next week, I will be able to pay the brother the $1,000 Sunday.</span> <span id="s3955">So when this Harry Fein and so, that was Thursday.</span> <span id="s3956">I told him, “Harry, will that be all right if I will not pay you this week?</span> <span id="s3957">I’ll pay you next week.”</span> <span id="s3958">He says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s3959">The first thing he says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s3960">So I told him, “Because so and so, I want to pay the brother.”</span> <span id="s3961">He says, “For crying out loud!”</span> <span id="s3962">He knocks on the block, on the butcher block.</span> <span id="s3963">He says, “If you needed more, why don’t you tell me!?</span> <span id="s3964">And if you owe somebody, pay it!”</span> <span id="s3965">And he runs out.</span> <span id="s3966">He didn’t say nothing.</span> <span id="s3967">He runs out.</span> <span id="s3968">I didn’t know what to make out of it.</span> <span id="s3969">And so he runs out.</span> <span id="s3970">He says, “Whom else you will not pay?”</span> <span id="s3971">I say, “Louie Pinchas.”</span> <span id="s3972">“How much do you owe him?”</span> <span id="s3973">I say, “Over $100.”</span> <span id="s3974">And he doesn’t say nothing and he runs again, keeps on running.</span> <span id="s3975">And he lived not far.</span> <span id="s3976">He lived here on the K apartments, you know, in Wynnefield.</span> <span id="s3977">And he comes back, in a half an hour he comes back with a check, with his wife’s name signed, Sylvia Fein, $350.</span> <span id="s3978">He says, “Here.</span> <span id="s3979">You needed money?</span> <span id="s3980">Here is $350.</span> <span id="s3981">And if you owe somebody, pay him!”</span> <span id="s3982">He says, “And when you have, I don’t ask you when to pay me back.</span> <span id="s3983">Anytime when you have, pay me back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3984">JF: Aw, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s3985">MA: You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s3986">You have an experience like this.</span> <span id="s3987">You change.</span> <span id="s3988">If somebody does you something wrong sometimes, you know, that makes up for it.</span> <span id="s3989">Now, another experience I got when we were in Chester, and so the first week, they, when I came to Chester, they, I didn’t work.</span> <span id="s3990">They took me around to this cousin, this cousin, this cousin.</span> <span id="s3991">And they bought the kids things and this.</span> <span id="s3992">And the apartment was furnished, everything, including a refrigerator, and everything!</span> <span id="s3993">I’m telling you, including flowers on the table!</span> <span id="s3994">And later, what else to buy us?</span> <span id="s3995">So, my wife says to me, “You know, with two children, I could use,” at that time, the first time they came out with a wringer washing machines, you know?</span> <span id="s3996">“But I will not tell them.</span> <span id="s3997">I want to buy it from my own money,” she says.</span> <span id="s3998">“I want to have a feeling out of my own.”</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">JF: The feeling, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">MA: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4001">O.K., after the week I went to work and I got paid.</span> <span id="s4002">I got $50 a week, which I could make a living from it.</span> <span id="s4003">And I paid $15 a week rent.</span> <span id="s4004">And I still saved, managed to save $5 from the $50, and the cooperation in shul.</span> <span id="s4005">And they, it was right after Rosh Hashanah, you know, right after I came around September here, in this country.</span> <span id="s4006">And I paid them every week $5 and they kept them.</span> <span id="s4007">They paid me interest.</span> <span id="s4008">And before, later when I got saved up $95, because they advertised, a wringer washing machine they advertised $95.</span> <span id="s4009">All the stores.</span> <span id="s4010">All the appliance stores, furniture stores in Chester.</span> <span id="s4011">So I got saved up $95.</span> <span id="s4012">I took it out.</span> <span id="s4013">And we took my wife and the two children and we walked downtown in Chester.</span> <span id="s4014">We go to one store.</span> <span id="s4015">A wringer washing machine, $95 here.</span> <span id="s4016">So, how many months you want to pay?</span> <span id="s4017">I say, “I want to pay cash.”</span> <span id="s4018">They didn’t want to sell it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s4019">JF: [chuckles] You were in America now!</span></p> <p><span id="s4020">MA: I didn’t realize what America is!</span> <span id="s4021">I went to another store, and they didn’t want to sell it.</span> <span id="s4022">And later I find out there is another store, Morton’s.</span> <span id="s4023">Morton’s Appliance.</span> <span id="s4024">I went there.</span> <span id="s4025">And that was the third store, the last store.</span> <span id="s4026">And I start arguing and I talked with Yiddish there.</span> <span id="s4027">And my English was very bad that time.</span> <span id="s4028">And I, [Yiddish], “My money is not good for you?</span> <span id="s4029">I’ll pay cash!”</span> <span id="s4030">And I couldn’t understand why I have to charge it.</span> <span id="s4031">So, and I was thinking might as well I be charge.</span> <span id="s4032">You know?</span> <span id="s4033">So I, the guy comes out from the office.</span> <span id="s4034">He says, “Where is the greenhorn here?”</span> <span id="s4035">He heard my language.</span> <span id="s4036">He says, “What’s the matter, greenhorn?”</span> <span id="s4037">So I told to him, “They don’t want to take my money.”</span> <span id="s4038">He says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s4039">So I told him the story.</span> <span id="s4040">He says, “Come here.</span> <span id="s4041">Which washing machine you want?”</span></p> <p><span id="s4042">JF: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4043">MA: And he did.</span> <span id="s4044">I talked to him and I said, “Oh, you give me the best.</span> <span id="s4045">I don’t know which one.”</span> <span id="s4046">He says, “Take this.”</span> <span id="s4047">And it was, I think a Maytag was it.</span> <span id="s4048">And he says, “That’s all?”</span> <span id="s4049">“Yeah.”</span> <span id="s4050">“You have the $95?”</span> <span id="s4051">He took from me the $95.</span> <span id="s4052">He took $5 back.</span> <span id="s4053">He got me, “Here, here, here is...start saving again,” he says.</span></p> <p><span id="s4054">JF: Oh, wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s4055">MA: He...told the driver to take me.</span> <span id="s4056">He says, “Here, leave everything,” he says.</span> <span id="s4057">“I don’t care.</span> <span id="s4058">Take them home.”</span> <span id="s4059">He took us, me and the wife and the children.</span> <span id="s4060">He took us home and...</span></p> <p><span id="s4061">JF: Oh, that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s4062">MA: So, so that’s yidn, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s4063">JF: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4064">MA: You know, the Talmud says, “Yisroel af alpi shechata Yisroel hu.”</span> <span id="s4065">That’s mean, “A Jew, even if he sins, he’s a sinner, he’s still a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4066">JF: Mr. Adler, thank you.</span> <span id="s4067">Thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s4068">MA: Can I make you lunch?</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL FOR MYER ADLER INTERVIEW BY TELEPHONE, FEBRUARY 14, 1983 - WITH JOSEY FISHER On Tape 4, side 2 of his interview, Mr. Adler refers to a DP camp of children in Ulm, Germany where he found his 2 nephews and niece.</span></p> <p><span id="s4070">The name of this camp was Bleidorn.</span> <span id="s4071">It was one of seven DP camps in Ulm.</span> <span id="s4072">Mr. Adler was in Sedan Kasserne also in Ulm.</span> <span id="s4073">This camp, to Mr. Adler’s knowledge had about 300 children up to the age of 14, most of them orphans and most of whom went to Israel eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s4074">Mr. Adler’s niece and nephews were not orphans.</span> <span id="s4075">They were with him in Russian and returned with him and their parents to Poland.</span> <span id="s4076">It was difficult to leave Poland, however, and a Zionist group, probably under the Haganah, arranged to transport the children across the Polish border - safer for both the children and their parents who also had to cross illegally.</span> <span id="s4077">They were taken to a transit camp in Prague, again only for children (Mr. Adler does not know the name) and then taken to Bleidorn where they were taught Hebrew and prepared for Israel.</span> <span id="s4078">The childrens’ parents (Mr. Adler’s sister and brother-in-law) left Poland 2 months after their children, together with 2 older daughters and went to Paris.</span> <span id="s4079">Their oldest son went to a youth camp in Frankfurt under the Agunah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4080">After 2 years, the children were reunited with their parents in Paris, with Mr. Adler’s help, and the whole family went to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s4081">Poland invaded Teschen not Sudeten.</span></p> <p><span id="s4082">Stalin had already broken relations with the Polish Government-in-Exile and was by 1943 planning a Communist regime in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s4083">The name of the DP camp for children was Bleidorn.</span></p> <p><span id="s4084">MYER ADLER [1-1- PAGE 10] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive MYER ADLER [2-1- PAGE 41] From the
