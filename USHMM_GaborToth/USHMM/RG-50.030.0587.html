United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s14">And I will start with trying to lay the groundwork, trying to find out the world – a little bit about the world you were born into.</span> <span id="s15">Can you tell me where you were born, when, your name, your parents’ names, and we’ll go from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Okay, I was born in Regensburg, Germany, which is up the Danube from Straubing, where my family lived, probably because they had better medical care there than in Straubing, so it happened there.</span> <span id="s17">My name f – w – at that time was Manfred Firnbacher, but when I came to United States and I got my citizenship paper, I did not like the Germanic name of Manfred, so I had it legally changed to Frederick, and I took the middle name of Stephen, which is in honor of my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s19">What year were you born?</span> <span id="s20">What’s the date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: May 19, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: Do you have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: You were an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Was yours a large family?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: On my father’s side, my father had four brothers and four sisters, and some of them weren’t living any more when I was born, and I was the youngest of about oh, seven, eight grandchildren.</span> <span id="s28">That’s on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s29">On my mother’s side, my mother had a sister and a brother.</span> <span id="s30">Brother who had a PhD.</span> <span id="s31">in chemistry from the University of Heidelberg, but due to the situation in Germany, he couldn’t get a job there.</span> <span id="s32">So he emigrated to Holland, and he worked for Organon, which is the big pharmaceutical company there.</span> <span id="s33">And he was part of the earl – original research for the conjugated estrogens.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s35">Could you spell the name of that research company so that we can –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Organon, o-r-g-a-n-o-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Organon, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: And they’re in – located in a place called Oss, o-s-s, in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: What was – what was your father’s profession, or what – how did he make a living?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: My father was a cattle and horse dealer.</span> <span id="s41">He would buy cattle from farmers, resell it to other farmers.</span> <span id="s42">He’d buy cattle to be slaughtered.</span> <span id="s43">As far as the horses went, he would go every year at the German-Belgium border, where they had a type of horse like the Clydesdale, heavy work horses.</span> <span id="s44">He would buy them as colts, transport them to Bavaria and then resell them to farmers, who raised them.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Tell – can you tell me – th-this is just pure coincidence.</span> <span id="s46">This morning we had an interview with somebody whose father was also in the cattle market business.</span> <span id="s47">Was this a fai – was this an area of activity that there were more Jews than in other areas, or was this just a pure coincidence that we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: I think was – that I – I don’t know for a fact, but I think a lot of Jews, for instance, our family, my father and his father were – worked together.</span> <span id="s49">An uncle by the name of Solomon Firnbacher also was in the cattle and horse business in Regensburg, which is a little way up the da – Danube.</span> <span id="s50">There were more Firnbachers in the cattle and horse business, and they more or less worked together.</span> <span id="s51">And I was told that they had the largest cattle business in Bavaria.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s53">Okay, okay, so that – it gives us a little bit of sense of the wider context.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: I don’t know how true it is about the size of it, but that’s what I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s56">And your mother, was she involved in her – your dad’s business as well, or wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well no, she was just a regular housewife.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: And the funny thing is, her father was in the horse business.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Her name – her name is Ida Luchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: How do – i-d-a is her first –</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: I-d-a, and last name l-u-c-h-s.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: L-u-c-h-s.</span> <span id="s65">And your father’s first name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Maier.</span> <span id="s67">M-a-i-e-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Maier Firnbacher, okay.</span> <span id="s69">Would you say that your family was a well-to-do family?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: Well, as a child I wouldn’t know that much about finance then, but we were pretty well off, I would think.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you have nannies, did you have servants at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: Did you have housekeepers and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s76">What are some of your earliest memories from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Well, my mother was from a village in Buttenwiessen which was also in Bavaria, which was a good distance away, and we used to go to Buttenwiessen frequently.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: Buttenwiessen?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s80">It’s b-u-t-t-e-n-w-i-e-s-s-e-n.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Was it a fun thing for a child to do when you went to Buttenwiessen?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Well, I never got there after I was four years old because my grandfather died and Grandma came to live with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Ah, I see.</span> <span id="s84">So it was – it was something that happened only in those first four years of your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: And what memories do you have of Buttenwiessen?</span> <span id="s87">A: My cousin and I, who – who was – he was a year and a half older, we went with my grandfather to – one time while he was out selling a horse or something, and there was a very steep place there, which is made out of concrete and we use it like a slide and we slid down.</span> <span id="s88">I – they did something that they considered impossible, I got home in leather pants.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: So you – did you wear lederhosen?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: That is a very – I mean, that’s quite an achievement, cause those are tough pieces of leather there.</span> <span id="s92">Any other memories from that time, of your grandfather –</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Well, I re – I remember the first Seders I went to.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Mm-hm, what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: They were just a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Well, tell somebody who’s not Jewish a little bit about Seders in Germany at that time, cause I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Well – well, the family came together and there was a lot of singing, lot of good food, and we went through the whole Haggadah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: A-And that is a prayer?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: The Haggadah is the prayer book that they use for the Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s101">Okay, thank you.</span> <span id="s102">And is thi – was this something that was very traditional?</span> <span id="s103">Was your family a very religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah, we were brought up Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s106">Okay.</span> <span id="s107">And wa – was that something that almost all Jews in smaller cities and towns would – would observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Well, I don’t know about – cause I was just a little one, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s111">In Straubing we had one synagogue an it was Orthodox and Buttenwiessen was one synagogue and that was Orthodox.</span> <span id="s112">In fact, Buttenwiessen at the turn of the century, that’s back in 1900, was about 70 percent Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Did you have any contact with Gentile Germans at all?</span> <span id="s114">Do you remember, from ger –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh yeah, when – when I was in school, in the first grade, I was entered into the – well, it was called the Protestant school.</span> <span id="s116">I was entered there and there were just two of us in the class, two Jewish children.</span> <span id="s117">The other one was a girl who – who I happen to know cause we grew up together, we were the same age.</span> <span id="s118">And I had the lovely experience of being expelled from school in the first grade because I hit a Nazi child and I was too dangerous to be left with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Oh dear, and you were how old?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: And di-did you know the full reasons why this was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Well, yeah, th-the wa – w-we – we knew that, being Jewish that we were just being hit upon and it just so happened this child was about three years older than me and a foot taller, and he started picking on me.</span> <span id="s123">So my dad being in the cattle and horse business, I ran into the house, got a horsewhip and hit him once with it.</span> <span id="s124">And there is a picture of me with the horsewhip way up on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Oh, we will take a look at that photograph later.</span> <span id="s126">And – and that was enough to make that happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: And that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: And I was out of school, my par – parents protested and what does a kid know, and after six weeks, after a lot of red tape going through the – with the – with the German government, the – I finally was allowed to go back to school.</span> <span id="s130">And at the end of the year, all the Jewish kids were expelled from the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: So this would have been 1935 - ’36?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Thirty si – 30 s – either ’36 or ’37.</span> <span id="s133">I started school in ’36, so I don’t know what was –</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Yeah, probably –</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: – after new year, probably ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Was that – is that your most vivid memory of coming – you know, sort of like head on into Nazism and you know, when you experience it, or did you have other things that –</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Well, you could walk down the street – I mean, my parents ar – I w – I was – they let me go on the streets by myself and I’d see German storm troopers, SS men, SA men walking on the streets, and I – I was just a kid, so they didn’t know who I was, so I just walked everywhere, I – other things that I remember is, when I was expelled – after we were all expelled from school we had an older man who had been a schoolteacher in his younger years, this time he was the top man of the synagogue, he – we didn’t have a rabbi, it wasn’t a large enough congregation to have a rabbi, but he led all the services, he taught the children Hebrew in Hebrew school, and since he’d been a teacher, the parents all got together and said, you’ve got to teach these children.</span> <span id="s138">And from the second grade on I was in a one room schoolhouse til later.</span> <span id="s139">Now, other things I remember when I was in that school.</span> <span id="s140">One day the door was kicked open, German storm trooper at the door, class dismissed.</span> <span id="s141">Didn’t say anything, everybody go home.</span> <span id="s142">And I went home along the street.</span> <span id="s143">Half an hour after I was home we saw the troops going through the street for the anschluss in Austria.</span> <span id="s144">We were right near the border there.</span> <span id="s145">German troops just coming through the city, just truckload after truckload.</span> <span id="s146">And I guess they were going in the railroad station too, the trains were heading all for Austria.</span> <span id="s147">And by the next day we saw them coming back already, cause they had taken all of Austria so raptly.</span> <span id="s148">Then I remember another time, I was downtown in the – in Straubing and I saw a bunch of tanks coming, loads of – one tank after another, must have been hundreds of them, and they were heading for the Sudetenland, for the anschluss there.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: For the Czechoslovakian –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: For the Czechoslovakian.</span> <span id="s151">So I saw both of those invasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s153">Oh my goodness, because yes, they were on the way, wa – wa – where you lived –</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: Right, we were right in the corner –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: – in Bavaria, you were there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: – where Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany came together, we lived right in that little corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And were people in the town saying yes, we’re going to – Austria will now be part of us, is that –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, not so much they ev – when they were down there they looked rather scared, like going into battle, not knowing what’s going to happen.</span> <span id="s159">The next day when they were coming back, or next few days, they were rather jubilant.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: Did – do you – did you notice, or did your parents talk about neighbors or your father’s business being affected in – in all of – you know, in all of what was happening at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Well, he was – with the Nuremburg laws, I guess it was, Jews weren’t allowed to have businesses any more, so he just had to stop.</span> <span id="s162">That was it, he had to just get rid of all the cattle and horses he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: So how did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Well, I guess they had means with which to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: So was probably savings.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Just what would have been saved up, and nothing.</span> <span id="s168">Di-Did you – okay.</span> <span id="s169">Did – did you notice – I mean, you were a young child at the time, but children feel things –</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: – very often.</span> <span id="s172">Did you notice something happening in your parents’ demeanor towards one another, towards you –</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: No, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: – to the outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: No, they – they just more or less indoctrinated me to be careful when I go in the street and not to mingle too much with – with the other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Were there other incidents from other kids, aside from that one – one boy –</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Well, that’s the only one that I really know about.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Mm-hm, that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s181">Did you ever have any other German – did you have German friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: My parents had some German friends, but as times went on they – they didn’t have that much to do with them.</span> <span id="s183">More or less stayed with the Jewish people who were in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What else can you tell us about what happened afterwards?</span> <span id="s185">After you were in the school, how long did that school exist?</span> <span id="s186">Was that at some point also closed down or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Well, Crystal Night, that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s188">Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue, and where – there was one room in there, schoolroom, which they used before for Hebrew school, was that got to be our classroom, and of course with the – everybody having been arrested and being sent to Dachau, there was no more school, and that was it, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Is that what happened afterwards is that not only was the building broken into, but those who were involved were sent to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: Yeah, all th – all the men and the ne – well, on Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue, they tried to break into our house, but the door was so strong they couldn’t break in, and one of the neighbors across the street hollered out of his window, let those people alone, they haven’t done anything to you, or something of that nature, and they went away.</span> <span id="s191">And in the morning, they – the police came to arrest my father, to put him under protective custody, and three days later he was in Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s193">Did you see them arrest him?</span> <span id="s194">Did you see –</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: I was upstairs and I just heard – heard them downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: That must have been terrifying for a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: It was terrifying.</span> <span id="s198">And my mother had nerve enough to go every day up to the police station as long as he was there.</span> <span id="s199">They allowed her to visit – well, n-not to actually visit him, to bring him things like warm clothing and stuff like that, and they passed that on to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: And how long was he in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Three weeks.</span> <span id="s202">And that – he would have gotten out after four weeks anyhow, because all veterans from World War I were released from Dachau at that time.</span> <span id="s203">But my mother had heard that somebody went to the Gestapo and asked for their husband to be released, next day he came in.</span> <span id="s204">So Mother said, well, what can I lose?</span> <span id="s205">So she took the train to Regensburg, asked for his release and couple of days later, here he was at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Did he look changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: Well, he looked gaunt and they took the clothing and everything away from them, put them in these uniforms like you s-see from the prisoners in Auschwitz and everywhere.</span> <span id="s208">And it was cold of winter and they had on something about the warmth of a pajama.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">Q: Yeah, of course, I mean, because Kristallnacht was in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: And – and – and it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And it was very cold in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s214">Did he talk about what had gone on in Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Well he di – said some of the things like when they – they taunted them when they got off the buses there.</span> <span id="s216">They had hoses and stuff and they swung at them and they made them run here and there and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Your language at home I take it, was only German.</span> <span id="s218">Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, that’s all we could speak, because that – that was our native tongue.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s221">No Yiddish, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: No.</span> <span id="s224">Wh-What – did things change in your house after your father came home, as far as how they were thinking of what to do, where to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Well, we already had our visas and everything to come to the United States, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: So they’d already planned.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: – we – we – everything had been planned.</span> <span id="s228">He got home in early December of ’38, and we had our appointment with the American consulate in January, first week in January.</span> <span id="s229">And we went to Stuttgart to the consulate and of course somebody, on purpose I guess, instead of putting the date 1939 on one of the papers, ’38, so that slowed everything down, my father had to go back and forth.</span> <span id="s230">So they used to come by every other day just about to pick up your passport and take it away from you.</span> <span id="s231">So there would be no chance of them getting our passport, we didn’t come home from Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s232">We went from there to Augsburg, stayed with relatives over the weekend, and first thing on Monday morning, my dad took the train to Straubing, went to get the date changed on that paper, went from there to Stuttgart, got – saw the American consulate, got everything straight, picked us up late at night in Augsburg, we took th – in the night, the train back to Straubing.</span> <span id="s233">And the next train that left for Holland, we were on it to get out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So you didn’t waste any time –</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: – after he came back from Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: My – my uncle, who had become ill and he was an invalid, and he couldn’t get around any more, so my mother’s sister lived with him, she was divorced.</span> <span id="s238">And she and her son lived in Holland and took care of my uncle so we had a place where to stay til they shipped – because ba – my dad already had tickets before even Crystal Night, for us to leave Germany on January 28th of 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: And did you know – being a child, did you know of all these plans?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Okay, so they – they were talking about that at home, there was already we’re not staying here, even before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s242">You know, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well, to get out of Germany, you just couldn’t say we’re gonna leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">A: You had to have paperwork, and the – the United States had a quota, how many people from each country that they would accept.</span> <span id="s246">So it was like getting a number in the delicatessen counter, you had to have a number, in the order of your number, you were called to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s247">And we knew that it was January sixth that we were to appear there.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: And that wasn’t yet certain that you would be able to go when you appeared there, or was it?</span> <span id="s249">It was a more f – more or less a formality.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: It was va – well, we had to pass phy – physical exam, they weren’t going to take just anybody to come to United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: And were y – was your family able – yo-you – you left everything, then.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: We were allowed to take, I think it was 250 marks, German money.</span> <span id="s253">Or was it – then two fi – I think it was 250 marks per person, that’s all the money we were allowed to take with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Were you able to take any other items?</span> <span id="s255">Did you take any toys?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Oh yeah, in – once we knew that we were leaving, in fact, before we even went to the consulate, we had a big van – it’s like – like they were years ahead, it was like the – today the containers that they – ships things, we were able to take all of our furniture and stuff with us.</span> <span id="s257">But, they had to be inspected by the German government.</span> <span id="s258">They put a value on every item, and you had to pay a tax of that amount to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: For your own stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: For your – for your own stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: And so did you pretty much leave an empty house?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, my grandmother was still there.</span> <span id="s263">She – she wasn’t with us, so she was there in the apartment.</span> <span id="s264">And as the different apartments vacated, my grandmother was able to go to Holland and then stay with her daughter, she was able to do that.</span> <span id="s265">In fact, she was in Holland when the Germans invaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: What happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: Well, she died in Sobibor.</span> <span id="s268">I think it’s Sobi – I’m not sure whether Sobibor or Mauthausen, one of those two.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: And the large family of your – I think you’ve talked about your father having come from a very large family.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Well, his brother, who was younger than he was a physician.</span> <span id="s271">He didn’t say a word to anybody, all of a sudden we got word he was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s272">From Switzerland he went on to then Palestine, there was no Israel yet.</span> <span id="s273">And he practiced medicine in – in Israel.</span> <span id="s274">And he – he p – he lived through the war.</span> <span id="s275">In fact, after his wife passed away, he went back to Germany, and he was an official in the German government in the medical section, with an office in Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Oh my, how unusual.</span> <span id="s277">There was – I know of many people who – many – I knew a few people who did go back, who –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, but this was quite a bit after the war.</span> <span id="s279">He didn't got back immediately, he went back a long time after, in the 50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: And his sisters, three of them who were still living, and they succumbed in the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: I see, so they were still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: They were still in Straubing.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Straubi – well, one was in Regensburg and one was in Landshut and one was in Straubing.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you, bit by bit, learn of the fates of each single one?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well, th-they looked after the war, and it took time til we got them.</span> <span id="s288">Now, in the articles that I gave to –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Suzy [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: – Suzy, there’s a lot of paperwork in there from letters that were written, and where – where the people ended up.</span> <span id="s291">And we got notices through the Red Cross from the family in Holland where they were, and what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So your uncle who was in Holland stayed there, he didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: No, he – he passed away before the war, he was sickly and after we left, he went downhill real fast, and in fact we were in the United States only about two months when my mother got word that he passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s295">And your si – her sister who was taking care of him –</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: She ended up in Auschwitz, she and her son.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s298">So when you were leaving your grandmother and when you were leaving your extended family, there had been nobody else in the family aside from this one uncle who had had plans or – or talk of also trying to get out, or they just didn’t have the way of doing it, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Well, the lot of them didn’t, they had to have, first of all an affidavit, someone to sponsor them to come to United States.</span> <span id="s300">And a lot of people even if they didn’t have that yet, they got themselves a number, and a lot of them did have the affidavits, but the war broke out –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: So they were caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: – before – they were caught in there before they had a chance – before the number came up.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: So you left Germany when you were hold old then, nine years –</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: Eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: Eight, eight.</span> <span id="s306">And what are the memories that you have when you cr – crossed into Holland?</span> <span id="s307">Did you feel in – like you were – was it like from one world to another world?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Well, it was very unusual.</span> <span id="s309">As we were go – the train was going toward the border, German SS men came through, they were inspecting people and hoping that they wouldn’t call you out.</span> <span id="s310">And we saw them passing by our compartment and they seemed to bypass us.</span> <span id="s311">All of sudden we heard the con – the conductors going through speaking Dutch.</span> <span id="s312">They’d been at the border, the Germans were gone, the Dutch were in, and we opened the window and we spit out the Swiss – the end of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: Fitting.</span> <span id="s314">And tell me now about the Torah story that you were talking about.</span> <span id="s315">What was that, how does it – what was the beginning of it, how did it develop –</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s317">On Crystal Night they broke into the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: It was a bunch of thugs.</span> <span id="s320">They came and ransacked the place.</span> <span id="s321">They couldn’t burn it because it was in a residential area and they couldn’t get permission from the fire department to burn the synagogue down.</span> <span id="s322">So they ransacked everything and I did see the results of it, and I’ve never seen such a mess of total destruction, like a bomb had hit the place.</span> <span id="s323">And when wi – they – they came in, just about destroyed everything.</span> <span id="s324">When my father came back from Dachau, he had – we had – we were ready to leave Germany, we were ready to pack everything.</span> <span id="s325">And on the list of items we were permitted to take out was the Torah.</span> <span id="s326">So he went to the Gestapo and he showed them papers where he was, could he get his Torah back?</span> <span id="s327">The Torah –</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: This was the synagogue’s Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: That was his Torah, it was af –</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Oh, it’s his Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: – i-it was – it was in – our family’s Torah.</span> <span id="s332">That was written by my great-grandfather, which is another story.</span> <span id="s333">And anyway –</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: We’ll hear that then, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Anyway, he went there to get the Torahs, he was – there was jus – he was told.</span> <span id="s336">And when he got there, there was a room that had Torahs and prayer books, all kind of religious material just laying in a big heap.</span> <span id="s337">Well, he picked up his Torah and he saw all these others there, being desecrated through – the Torah’s supposed to be – always be standing up.</span> <span id="s338">So he took all the Torahs and stood them up.</span> <span id="s339">And he saw a box there, so he took one Torah, he put it into this box, and he took the silverware that was there, the breastplate, the – the silver hand and the crown and he put all that into the box, and he closed the box up.</span> <span id="s340">Well, I am not sure, but the – when they found this Torah after the war, there in the box with all that, it had to be the Torah my father had put in there, cause what probably happened, I surmise that they came – the Gestapo came by to pick up all these items, and there’s this box there, they didn’t look in it, and it was left.</span> <span id="s341">And somebody probably would say, oh my God, there’s Torahs here.</span> <span id="s342">If they catch me with this, they’re going to cut my head off, send me a concentration camp or do something.</span> <span id="s343">So they headed for the war, and after the war was over, they discreetly brought it back and just left it there.</span> <span id="s344">And I have a hunch that’s what happened, but from what they said the Torah – th-the box looked like – of what my father had – the story he’d always told, I put the two – t-t-two together and it had to be that.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: And when was it discovered?</span> <span id="s346">Was it like returned right after the war, or se –</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: After –</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: – or several years later or decades late –</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Shortly after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: So cer – shortly after the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: – it just appeared in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: It appeared in the – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: – where the synagogue was.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: – no, in the si – in the police station.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Oh, in the police station.</span> <span id="s357">It appeared there.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: That’s where it disappeared from.</span> <span id="s359">That’s where my father, when he went to pick up his Torah –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: That’s where he found it, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: And he put it into the box.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: And so I – I just put two and two together, but the fact that my dad mentioned it so often –</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Talked about it so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: And yes, I mean, it – it – it makes sense that – that – that’s an educated hypothesis, that –</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: But in the film you don’t get that, because they didn’t ask me about it, I had no idea that’s how the film was going to end up, cause they just asked me about our Torah, the story of it, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: And when you’re talking now, you’re talking about a film that was made by German television people.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: That was for German tel – this Wolfgang Bergman was the producer, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: And the point of his film was the story of this –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Of the missing Torah – well, the story – what had happened to this Torah, where’d they find it from.</span> <span id="s372">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Let’s – let’s poi – [break] You can turn us back on.</span> <span id="s374">So, can you tell me a little bit about the point of the film?</span> <span id="s375">It was to find out what happened, this mystery of the hidden Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Whe-Where did it come from.</span> <span id="s377">They had interviewed a lot of German people about Crystal Night there, and it – they – they had – th-this film was made a-actually after the war, in 1989, so much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: And you’ve got the – the film there, so you can go through it and see it, it’s all in German.</span> <span id="s380">And anyway, you want to know the story about the Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: Well, my great-grandfather, Moses Firnbacher, was in the United States, and he hit gold in the goldrush in ninet – 1849.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: And he took his belongings, his riches from the goldrush, brought it back to Germany, to Gossmannsdorf where the family lived, and like any other young man, he got married there, started a business, and he had children of his own, and the oldest was my grandfather, Joseph Firnbacher.</span> <span id="s385">And for his Bar Mitzvah he wanted to have a Torah written.</span> <span id="s386">Since he’d gotten all this gold, he had wealth.</span> <span id="s387">So he had a Torah written, and they brought the Torah scribe, a sofer into the house, and he lived with them for a whole year, and every week he wrote that week’s portion for the Torah, til it was finished, for my grandfather’s Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s388">And this, when they moved to Straubing, my grandfather went there, I guess, for greener pastures or exactly what I don’t know.</span> <span id="s389">I wasn’t around yet then.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: And they went to Straubing, the Torah came with them and then my father was Bar Mitzvahed from it and it belonged to the family and when we left Germany, we – we brought it with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s393">So it’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Then I was Bar Mitvahed out of it and our son was.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s396">And where is it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: It’s at Ohr Kodish in – in Chevy Chase.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: In your synagogue there?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">A: Mm-hm</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: That’s not just any old Torah.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: That is – that is quite a special one.</span> <span id="s403">And did your father have difficulties in – when he had to go through bureaucra – bureaucracy, pay for it, go through the German police and so on, but wer – did they know what they were giving up, or they didn’t care?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Oh, they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s405">[phone ringing]</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Okay, they can call again, okay?</span> <span id="s407">So let’s go.</span> <span id="s408">So yes, I was asking about any complications in getting the Torah out of your fa – of your father dealing with the – the Nazi officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: No, he just – he just went there, he showed the paper, this is it, it’s got the approval, bingo.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And they could – and they –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: They made a phone call, the police station released the Torah to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: And then, the thing is this.</span> <span id="s414">Here he is, it’s a snowy, wintry day, my father is carrying a Torah through the streets of Nazi Germany to ki – bring it to our house, whi – it was a brave thing.</span> <span id="s415">But I have a hunch that half the – not more than half, 90 percent of the people wouldn’t have even known what he was carrying.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Did your parents, since you – you were a child at the time, and it’s real – a lot of the questions that I’d have would be the kind that a child wouldn’t know the answers to, but did your parents talk about neighbors who’d changed their attitudes, or changed their behavior towards your family?</span> <span id="s417">Or were the Gentiles around pretty much the same they had always been?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Some of them were the same.</span> <span id="s419">Some of them th-they’re real Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: And more or less, watch out.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: And yo – and your parents would let you – would let you know that this one you have to be careful with –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: – this one you have to be careful with.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: But they let me go freely, even a-as a seven and eight year old.</span> <span id="s426">I would wander around the city cause I – well, na – the section where we lived.</span> <span id="s427">I didn’t go all over town, but in section where we lived, I walked around freely.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Was it a pretty residential area where you lived?</span> <span id="s429">A: I won’t say it was pretty, it was just typical houses there.</span> <span id="s430">In fact, our house, we – we weren’t that far from the railroad lines.</span> <span id="s431">And when the allies bombed over there, our house was hit.</span> <span id="s432">And it – they took the same bricks that were get – from the house.</span> <span id="s433">It was three stories high, and they had enough bricks to rebuild it two stories.</span> <span id="s434">And when Betsy saw it when she was with me in Germany, it’s not a pretty house.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s436">But then that house that –</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: Th-That – that was in Buttenwiessen, that was – that’s not the one –</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: That’s your grandfather’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: That’s my grandfather’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: That was confiscated by the Nazis, my grandmother had to sign it over, and after the war, we did get some restitution for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s443">When did you stop speaking German?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I always spoke German in – I mean, when my parents passed away, I didn’t have anybody to speak German to any more.</span> <span id="s445">But I went to s – American conversation school in, I think it was Webster School, here in D.C., 10th and Eight Street, northwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: So you moved to Washington when you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s448">And I learned little bit there, and they got my father a job on a chicken farm in Virginia, which that was a horror.</span> <span id="s449">Anyway, they put me into the public school there in a little place called Midlothian.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: I’ve heard of Midlothian.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: It’s outside of Richmond.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I went to school there.</span> <span id="s454">I didn’t know what was coming up, but I was s-starting to learn English, and – and then –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: What were yo – what were your first impressions when – did you sail into New York harbor, or to Baltimore –</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yeah, we di – no, we sai – we – we landed in Hoboken, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: That’s where Holland American line had their pier at that time.</span> <span id="s459">But we saw the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s460">And we always had heard how warm it gets in America in the summertime.</span> <span id="s461">Of course, this was February, I didn’t realize it snowed here in the winter.</span> <span id="s462">And we arrived in a snowstorm.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: And we were picked up by a nephew of my father, a first cousin of mine.</span> <span id="s465">And he and another relative, they picked us up, they took us into New York City, and they showed me the wa – the Empire State Building, the biggest building in the world, I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s466">I kept looking up.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Well, I remember – I’m from Boston, and I had been to New York a couple of times before, when I was, you know, growing up.</span> <span id="s468">But a friend of mine convinced me to move there when I was a young adult.</span> <span id="s469">And for the first three days I felt like, oh, these are such statues, they’re so big and I’m so little, you know.</span> <span id="s470">And I never thought I could fee – have that feeling, cause I’m a city kid, you know, and you’re used to tall buildings.</span> <span id="s471">But New York has that, you know, effect on people.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Well, they – they put us on the train that afternoon for Washington, because we had an affidavit from people who lived in Washington.</span> <span id="s473">We stayed with them at first, then we lived in rooming houses and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So it was a little tough to begin with.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Had your father been able to get any of his capital out, any – any sa –</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: No.</span> <span id="s479">So it was only the 250 marks.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Per person, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Per person.</span> <span id="s482">That is tough.</span> <span id="s483">That is very tough.</span> <span id="s484">So you didn’t forget German, in other words.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: No.</span> <span id="s486">Well, we spoke it at home, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Even in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Cause some people – some people either refused to, or they were in an environment which didn’t encourage it.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Well, we spoke less and less when we went out, because when the war started, lot of people didn’t like the Germans, so we tried to speak English when we went out.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: During the war, what do you remember of your parents’ demeanor?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: Well, they’re –</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I – they must have been concerned ab –</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: Well, they’re very concerned about the relative that are still over there, not hearing anything.</span> <span id="s495">At first we got mail from them, but it was all censored.</span> <span id="s496">You’d see letters with something blacked out, or cut out.</span> <span id="s497">Every piece of mail we got was censored, even before they’re at war with the United States.</span> <span id="s498">Because you have the period from 1939 to ’41 when the British and the Frenchman [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s500">When was the first time that you learned of the fates of your – of your family, of your larger extended fa –</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: Well, as – as word got through, it was difficult to find the – my parents would write to everywhere – to everybody everywhere, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Was it only after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: After the war.</span> <span id="s504">You couldn’t find out anything during the war.</span> <span id="s505">We tried to send mail through the Red Cross, but wasn’t much luck there.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: When did you go back?</span> <span id="s507">Cause you mentioned before that you went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: I went back to Germany when I’m in – in the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: I was over there from 1954 into ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: That’s pretty early, considering.</span> <span id="s512">You know, ma – considering that many people didn’t – didn’t go back, if at all, in the 70s or the 80s, or to see the places they had been to.</span> <span id="s513">Did you go back to Straubing when you were in the military?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s515">When a – when I was in the army, I didn’t want to go to Korea, and it just so happens that I knew a few people in personnel at Fort Benning, Georgia, and I mentioned to them if they ever have a levy for somebody with my MOS, which is a pharmacist’s MOS, I would be very happy to go to Germany, yeah, I just did not want to go to Korea.</span> <span id="s516">So before I knew it, here I had orders to go to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And where were you based?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I was – first we arrived in Bremerhaven, and from there we were shipped down to Zweibrucken, where all the troops were disseminated all over Germany.</span> <span id="s519">Now, Zweibrucken was very interesting.</span> <span id="s520">They had us take our patches off of our uniforms so they couldn’t tell where we came from in the United States because it – it was still the height of the Cold War.</span> <span id="s521">So a – I was hoping I would be sent to Frankfurt where the general hospital, I was hoping to be stationed there.</span> <span id="s522">I think it was the 97th general hospital, I’m not sure any more the number.</span> <span id="s523">And lo and behold the orders came down, 97th general hospital, Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s524">I was so happy because Frankfurt was the center, I knew I could travel all over Germany once I got there.</span> <span id="s525">We got to there, said we have no need for pharmacists here.</span> <span id="s526">If you want to stay here, you – we can put you in the motor pool.</span> <span id="s527">Well, being a young pharmacist just out of school, I’m not going to get my fingernails dirty in the motor pool.</span> <span id="s528">So I was – we were transferred to triple seven nine, which was a outfit of nothing but medical specialists.</span> <span id="s529">And from there we were assigned, and I ended up in a place – I was sent to Würzburg.</span> <span id="s530">And, funny thing, that’s very close to where that Torah that my dad brought over was written.</span> <span id="s531">Anyway, when we got to Würzburg we’re told – we were there cause that was just the headquarters, and I was sent to a place called Wildflecken.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: And is that in Bavaria too?</span> <span id="s533">A: It’s in the Rhine valley.</span> <span id="s534">We were – I was stationed seven miles from east Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: It was in the middle of nowhere.</span> <span id="s537">Nobody in Germany knew where Wildflecken was.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: I’ve been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: You’ve been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: I’ve been there.</span> <span id="s541">I’ve been there.</span> <span id="s542">I know exactly where you’re speaking –</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: They took – after the war, they put up a lot of the displaced persons up there, and the place was covered like a forest, because the Germans had secret installations there, were testing, I believe there, buzz bombs that they were shooting over into England.</span> <span id="s544">They were testing them there, they had – there was a secret – it was a secret base for the Germans, nobody had heard of Wildflecken.</span> <span id="s545">Where – where are you stationed?</span> <span id="s546">Wildflecken.</span> <span id="s547">Never heard of it, where is it.</span> <span id="s548">And anyway, when they got these displaced person there, they chopped all the trees down, they used them for fire – firewood.</span> <span id="s549">And where we were stationed, we were in – I was in the dispensary, and w-we – it was like SS headquar – officers’ quarters.</span> <span id="s550">So we w – as – here I was a PFC when I got there, that’s private first class.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: Had a private room, not – not like military barracks, it – we – we –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: – ba – we had – had German civilians who worked for us.</span> <span id="s555">I – I was training at – I – I more or less re-did the entire pharmacy department there, because it hadn’t had a – anybody who was a licensed pharmacist there, this – this German was a druggist, as the German call it, in other words, sells toothpaste and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: And I – I taught him stuff, and as a result that –</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: That Wildflecken has a pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How interesting.</span> <span id="s561">Now, when you were there, did you go back to Straubing?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: Did you go to Buttenwiessen?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Well, the first trip I made – well, actually, I got there in September, so it was right before the Jewish holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: So I was not very popular, when soon as I got there I es – I wanted to go for the holidays, where do you go?</span> <span id="s567">I’m new there.</span> <span id="s568">So I was told that Würzburg was the closest place, so I got a three day pass for the – Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s569">And then for when Yom Kippur came, I went back there.</span> <span id="s570">But they saw that – cause I told them, I’m taking off for this [indecipherable] Christmas I – I’ll do all that sort of stuff.</span> <span id="s571">So I – so I – th-they realized that it was religious reason, not that I was goofing off.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: So my first trip I did was to Munich for another reason, because my grandmother had a very good friend who survived the Holocaust, and she was in the home for the aged in Munich.</span> <span id="s574">And so I go to visit her, what can I take a woman who is in her 80s, what can I bring her?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: I’m thinking, I’m thinking.</span> <span id="s577">Guess what I came up with?</span> <span id="s578">Cigarettes.</span> <span id="s579">She could – with cigarettes she could get anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Of course, of course, of course.</span> <span id="s581">So you bring an 80 year old packs of cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Brought her a carton of cigarettes.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Greatest present.</span> <span id="s585">She was so appreciative.</span> <span id="s586">Well, once my mother found out that this woman was living, we’d send her packages.</span> <span id="s587">So when the packages went over they were plundered before she got them.</span> <span id="s588">So I got the great idea, I’m going to write on the outside of the package, gift parcel.</span> <span id="s589">The word g-i-f-t gift is the German word for poison.</span> <span id="s590">And every package went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s592">But – but, you know, how mean.</span> <span id="s593">You know, a parcel goes to an old woman in a nursing home –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: – and it – and it’s pulled apart and si – you know, stolen –</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: – before she even gets – you know, before it gets to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: And w-we – we sent her stuff like soap, toothpaste, stuff like that, which they couldn’t get.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: I mean, you couldn’t send – we could send some canned goods, but you couldn’t send anything else because if you – it would perish by the time it would get there.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: So, your first trip was to Munich.</span> <span id="s602">During that same three day pass, did you make it down to Straubing?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No, I went to Buttenwiessen where my –</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: – through – I went along with troo – the railroad ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: So Buttenwiessen, I decided to stop there in the morning.</span> <span id="s608">In fact, I got off the train in Donauwerth, which was where the train went, the train didn't go to Buttenwiessen.</span> <span id="s609">So I got out of there and had lunch, and I got a cab driver there, standing at the railroad station.</span> <span id="s610">How much you charge me to take me to Buttenwiessen and bring me back?</span> <span id="s611">Twenty-five marks.</span> <span id="s612">Fine.</span> <span id="s613">I say, I’m going to have lunch and then I want you to take me to Buttenwiessen.</span> <span id="s614">I get to Buttenwiessen, the first thing I ask, where do we find the Bürgermeister?</span> <span id="s615">The – the mayor.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: So we found him.</span> <span id="s618">They’re all farmers.</span> <span id="s619">In fact, in those days he probably – he probably couldn’t even sign his name.</span> <span id="s620">They weren’t that educated.</span> <span id="s621">So I said, I’d like to see my grandfather’s house, which way, and I’d like to go to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s622">Got to the cemetery, I had a picture of my grandfather’s tombstone, so I knew what it looked like.</span> <span id="s623">I found the tombstone, everything on it was erased.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: I went in – my mother said, when you go in the door to the cemetery, you turn right and it’s the third grave.</span> <span id="s626">It wasn’t there, I found it somewhere else.</span> <span id="s627">They had taken all the tombstones out, they had plundered them, they were going to reuse them.</span> <span id="s628">And they took the names [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s629">When war ended, they brought them back, the one they still had, just put them anywhere.</span> <span id="s630">So that was the story there.</span> <span id="s631">So I told them where I wanted the tombstone, I wanted it re-engraved, and of course I wrote my dad and he sent them a very nice letter.</span> <span id="s632">I should say not so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I should say not so nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Nis – yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: And tha-that took care of that.</span> <span id="s637">Then from there I went – stopped in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s638">I just wanted to see the house that my uncle had, he was in New York, and I just – it was on the Bahnhofstrasse, so it’s right down the street from the railroad station.</span> <span id="s639">I just stopped long enough to find the place, to see what it looked like, take a picture of it and depart and then from there I went to Munich and I spent the weekend there and then I had to get back to base.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: So you – but the impression I get is that you looked at buildings and s – graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Did you meet people?</span> <span id="s643">Did you see any people who knew you, who knew your –</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Well, in Buttenwiessen, the word got around so fast that I – that I was in town, the whole town was there when I got back to where the cab was.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: And war – what happened to your mother, your aunt?</span> <span id="s647">Wanted to know what – what happened to everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: How did you feel wi-with these – with this kind of curiosity?</span> <span id="s649">Did it feel strange?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s651">I mean, here I was surrounded by everybud – by 30 - 40 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: And yo – and yet, 10 years earlier, or 12 years earlier, you wouldn’t have known which one of those you could trust, if any.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Well, I didn’t know who most of them were, but I got the Bürgermeister’s name, and etcetera, etcetera, and my mother remembered him as a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Did you ever go back to Straubing at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Well, next time I had a three d – the next pass I had was only a two day pass, so I just went to Nuremberg, cause I wanted to see the Christmas set-up, cause it’s very famous there, the old city in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s656">So I went there in December, and in January I went to Straubing.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: And how did – I mean, cause Straubing you have real memories of –</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: – you know, more than Buttenwiessen.</span> <span id="s660">What was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Well, I was on the train as the train pulled into town.</span> <span id="s662">I recognized the post office, and they had like two railroad stations now, one for the G.I.s and one for the Germans.</span> <span id="s663">And from there I walked somewhere to find a hotel, and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s664">When I signed my last name the – the cle – the desk clerk there recognized the last name.</span> <span id="s665">He said, you any relation to so and so?</span> <span id="s666">I says yes, that was my grandfather.</span> <span id="s667">And while I was in Straubing, I also went to visit the synagogue there, the cemetery, our old house, my uncle’s house.</span> <span id="s668">And my father had a lawyer already in Germany who was handling a lot of his papers, I went to visit him.</span> <span id="s669">And that was about it for my visit in Straubing.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So, no people – it wasn’t like the whole village gathered once they found out –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, no, Straubing’s a little – s – Buttenwiessen was a village, Straubing was a t –</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: A town.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: – a real city with 40,000 people in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Yeah, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: So anyway, in Straubing I got reprimanded by the MPs; it was snowing and I had – unless you were a paratrooper, you weren’t allowed to blouse your boots.</span> <span id="s676">And I didn’t want to get the bottom of my trousers wet in the snow, so I had bloused my boots, in other words so the boots would be showing.</span> <span id="s677">So they made me undo the boots and said, don’t do that again.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Why would that even matter?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Because I’m not a paratrooper, that’s military –</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: And all par – I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Only a paratrooper in those days was allowed to blouse his boots.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Did you ever meet people afterwards in Straubing who knew your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Well, my mother wa – had a certain brand of sweaters she liked, Blyla(ph) was the manufacturer.</span> <span id="s684">So s-she said I could go to one of the department stores, which had been Jewish before, Salinger’s(ph), and I went in there to buy a sweater for her.</span> <span id="s685">She knew the size, the German sizes.</span> <span id="s686">Went in there and the girl who waited on me says, I went to school with you.</span> <span id="s687">See, cause my – we had a nametag on the – on the uniform, so she knew right away –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: So during that very, very short time that you were in the public school, she remembered you from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: I didn’t remember her.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Yeah, isn’t that interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Well, the word got around there too, I guess, that I was in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s693">Tell me about this article by Julius Streicher, that appeared in Der Stürmer.</span> <span id="s694">How is it that your father or your grandfather – this is from 1927, so this –</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: That’s before I was born, so I –</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Before you were born.</span> <span id="s697">But how did they get in his crosshairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s699">I got – this was given to me by the gentleman, this Wolfgang Bergman who took the b – he brought

riches.</span> <span id="s718">Well, there are other articles about other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s720">But the same sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: They’re all the same type of thing, which I thought might be of interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Yes, it is, yes it is, and it’s – so even before your birth, there is already this atmosphere –</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: That’s before the Nazis were even in, that’s before –</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s725">That’s before ’33.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s728">And it’s from Der Stürmer.</span> <span id="s729">Thank you for – for sharing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: I think they ha – get more use out of it at the Holocaust Museum than I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Was this the only time that you were back in Straubing?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, we were back – that’s in – I went over in 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: So, it was 40 years difference –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: – between the first time and the second time.</span> <span id="s736">What did you notice from the second time that was different from the first?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, it was more – like it’s in United States, I mean, it was more modernistic, it was – I mean, the people were speaking German.</span> <span id="s738">We noticed something which I’d never noticed before, McDonald’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: I know.</span> <span id="s741">We – right, Betsy, McDonald’s?</span> <span id="s742">We found a

Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Well, what I did, I wrote to them in Straubing that – I wrote to the Jewish synagogue.</span> <span id="s747">I didn’t know what their title was or anything, I just, Jewish congregation of Straubing, to the head of it, and I got an answer back from them, and they – we told them th – what day we would be in Straubing.</span> <span id="s748">And we got there on that date, they met us there.</span> <span id="s749">We met a couple of people who – from the synagogue there.</span> <span id="s750">We went to the synagogue, we saw it was rebuilt just like it was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: It – it – it was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: And the first time you went back, was one of your questions how many Jews might have survived and come back to Straubing?</span> <span id="s754">Did you know about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Well, the – well, that we knew right after the war cause my father wrote to the Bürgermeister or whoe – whoever was in charge right after the war.</span> <span id="s756">There was one who’d been heavily wounded in World War I who survived.</span> <span id="s757">I think it was just two.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Just two.</span> <span id="s759">Just two.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: And when – when I was there, we went to the cemetery again, we wa – saw our old house.</span> <span id="s761">There was also a memorial there for the – the prisoners who the Germans were holding, who they were marching from Flossenbürg to Dachau.</span> <span id="s762">In fact, the best man at our wedding, I didn’t know it, he was liberated right near Straubing, and he was in that group that was being marched through Germany, and he was released in Cham, c-h-a-m, is the name of the place.</span> <span id="s763">And he told me about ther – anyway, they had built a memorial to these people.</span> <span id="s764">They wouldn’t allow them to give them food, or wouldn’t let them have water.</span> <span id="s765">The people in town came by to help them, and the SS just told the people, get out, leave these people alone.</span> <span id="s766">And a lot of them died there, and there was a memorial which is a water fountain, and had the word water written on it in all different languages, wasser, mayim(ph).</span> <span id="s767">In fact, I av – took pictures of it, I – I’ve got videos that I took when we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: That sounds like a fitting memorial.</span> <span id="s769">And yes – and Flossenbürg wasn’t that far from Wildflecken, if I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: That I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s772">It’s – it’s – it’s also in that sort of corner, forgotten corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: Oh, Wildflecken, I always said I [indecipherable] the battle of the Mickey Mouse, that’s where I got my medals.</span> <span id="s774">The story there was the Mickey Mouse was in, and on payday the troops were down there and get drunk.</span> <span id="s775">And we were in the m – in the medical corps, we ran the dispensary.</span> <span id="s776">And when the troops were drunk and the MPs would call us up, we’ve got another one who’s hurt down here.</span> <span id="s777">They’d throw bottles at each other, and we’d pick them up and they’d bring them up to the dispensary for us to sew them up.</span> <span id="s778">And so I said I earned my medals in the battle of Mickey Mouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s780">Well, better than in real battles.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: So you ended up being there for two years, yes?</span> <span id="s783">1954 – ’55 –</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: No, in – in – I was in Wildflecken only for about three-quarters of a year.</span> <span id="s785">I went over in September of ’54 and I left in May of ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: So about a year and a half total.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: No, about three-quarters of a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: Oh, excuse me, that’s right, that’s right –</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: ’54 to ’55.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: – that’s right.</span> <span id="s791">And – and was that your service then, that was your full service –</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Well, I was in United States, I was – I was at Fort Benning before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Ah, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: Af – that was after base – basic training at Camp Pickett, then it was Fort Benning.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s796">And I’ve missed a part in here, and that was, after you’re in Midlothian and you go to school, how you finished school, where did you go to college, what did you study and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: I – well, like I always joke around and say I went through school, in the front door and out the back.</span> <span id="s798">When we came back here, I went to Bankcroft School for the fourth grade, and then we moved to a bigger apartment and I went to John Quincy Adams.</span> <span id="s799">And from there I went to –</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Was that in D.C., excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Then I went to Powell Junior High School and from there I went to Central High School.</span> <span id="s804">And from there I went to G.W., I started out, I was going to be a pre-med, but when I saw du – they had quota system getting into school, and the expenses and everything, I got my Associate of Arts degree and then went on to pharmacy school.</span> <span id="s805">Went through pharmacy school in three years at G.W. and got my Bachelor of Science in pharmacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Can you tell me what kind of quota system?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: They would – they had limited the number of Jews that they were accepting to medical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Here, in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: A friend of mine applied to 30 schools, got ref – turned down by all of them.</span> <span id="s812">I never applied to medical school.</span> <span id="s813">The following year he applied again, and – to the same schools, and the 30th one, Howard University accepted him.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s815">You know, one heard of things like that over in Europe, but not over here in the United States.</span> <span id="s816">So, you finished pharmacy school.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: And you had finished before your army service, your military service?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Well, the funny thing is, the pharmacy school – my father tried to get restitution from – for missing schooling etcetera in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: And when they found out I was a pharmacist, it takes eight years in Germany, and only five here.</span> <span id="s822">It was three and a – four and a half years actually, the number of credits.</span> <span id="s823">And so you got out sooner than you would have in Germany, so they rejected me, I never got any restitution.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: My goodness.</span> <span id="s825">But on that question in general, was there restitution made to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: My – yeah, my –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: For –</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: – father – my father got quite a bit back.</span> <span id="s829">I won’t say a lot, but he got some satisfaction.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: From – for his business, lost business?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Lost business – well, I – I didn’t mingle in those things, so wa – I was just a kid.</span> <span id="s832">But his business, the properties he owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s834">So some of it was done at that time.</span> <span id="s835">Maybe it was a i – maybe it was a little more streamlined for people who came from Germany, than from those who would have come from Poland or from the Czech Republic.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: Probably was, because that was already in the east zone, that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: – under Russian control.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Yeah, and – and the – the records are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: The records are there to show –</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Well, they’re immaculate at keeping records, rec-recording everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s844">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: 1957.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: So, after you came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Well, I didn’t – actually, Betsy and I, we didn’t even go with each other before I ca – was in the service.</span> <span id="s850">But when I was at G.W., I remember having seen her in the student union.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: And – and so you got to know each other after you came back from the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s853">Yeah, we met the – A2: I didn’t know his army experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s855">And do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: Yeah, we have one son, Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Does he know your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s860">What would you say – when did your parents die?</span> <span id="s861">When did they pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: My mother passed away at a y – rather young age, she died in 1968.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Yes, it is a rather a young age.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: And my father died in 1988.</span> <span id="s865">My dad lived to be 95.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s867">What – what – what do you think they passed onto you as a legacy?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: Well, just to work hard and do the best you can, and make something of yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: How did – or how did they respond to everything that had happened, and how did they come to grips with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Well, my mother was very, very bitter toward the Germans.</span> <span id="s871">Extremely bitter.</span> <span id="s872">My father was also, but I don’t think he had to the same degree as my mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Did she feel betrayed by her own people in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: She was – well, she felt betrayed by the Germans, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: But she didn’t count them as her own people?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Man-many people had, you see, that’s why I phrased it like that, many people had felt that they had assimilated, they had fought in a war, World War I, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Well, my father got – had the Iron Cross, and he had the Bavarian Service Cross.</span> <span id="s879">In fact, I – they’re at the Holocaust Museum, I – that was among the items I gave them.</span> <span id="s880">And I put the – that together with the postcard he sent us from Dachau saying that that was his thanks from the fatherland for his service in World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Well, that’s enough to make you bitter.</span> <span id="s882">Is there anything else you’d like to add, that we haven’t talked about, that you think is important for people to know in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Well, the – the important thing is to keep faith and do the best you can, and like some things in Germany, I – y-you can’t – just can’t forgive, it’s just something that they did to you.</span> <span id="s884">And like when I went to Germany, all the other G.I.s, they were going out with German girls, I wouldn’t go out with any of them, I didn’t want to have anything to do with anybody, for tho – for those reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: Was your religion – was your religious belief stronger afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Not –</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Did it get shaken [indecipherable] change?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Not – it doesn – wasn’t necessarily stronger, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: No.</span> <span id="s890">But there are some people also, I know, who lost their religious belief after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: Yeah, that’s some people, but a – no, I’m ver – very – I’m – I’m not – I’m not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s892">We go to Conservative services.</span> <span id="s893">We – we don’t eat pork products, things like that.</span> <span id="s894">But – but we – we believe that we’re Jewish, but we’re not fanatically Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: My – my point of this is that a lot of people who have been through some of the Holocaust experiences lost their faith in God as a result.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: No.</span> <span id="s898">That – well, those were two separate things for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Right.</span> <span id="s900">Like, I’m very active here with the Jewish residents of Leisure World.</span> <span id="s901">Last – last week on Rosh Hashanah, I did the Haftorah.</span> <span id="s902">I’m getting ti – now I’m – soon as Yom Kippur is over, I start getting things together, I’ll be doing the Crystal Night program here, Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s903">And I run – I’ve run that, now this’ll be my eighth year that I’m running – running it.</span> <span id="s904">I think it’s ti – I should have taken my sabbatical this year.</span> <span id="s905">Then Passover I – they found somebody who knows how to lead a Seder, so I led the Seder for over 200 people this last year.</span> <span id="s906">That’s the fourth time I’ve led it, but this year, the biggest crowd they ever had for their second Seder.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s908">Well, this is again, a question that I asked before, are Seders generally traditionally celebrated within a circle, a small circle, a family circle, or a community one?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: This is a community one.</span> <span id="s910">Most everybody goes with their family on the first night, so on the second night –</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: – we have – we have here what they call second Seder.</span> <span id="s913">I’ve run the show for the last four years.</span> <span id="s914">I’ve done a lot of things to liven it up.</span> <span id="s915">I’ve gone on the internet and gotten parodies for f-famous songs, which a – which are funny, like Clementine –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: – songs like that.</span> <span id="s918">Like we started off the Seder, there’s this tune, if There’s No Business Like Show Business, and started off, there’s no Seder like our Seder.</span> <span id="s919">When we go back after the meal to finish off the second half of the Seder, I started off, instead of Take Me Back to the Ballgame, take me back to the Seder.</span> <span id="s920">And I’ve put in about a half a dozen or more songs, and they enjoy that.</span> <span id="s921">I have them printed up, the song sheets, and they’re at all the tables, and they sing along.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: We – a person needs a master of ceremonies like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: So I-I’ve – I’ve livened it up quite a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: And they enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s926">Th-The – and it’s also a very fast Seder.</span> <span id="s927">Some people have Seders that run til 11 o’clock, 12 o’clock at night, they drag everything out.</span> <span id="s928">Mine is, they wouldn’t – didn’t believe me, I said, I’ll have you eating dinner within 30 minutes.</span> <span id="s929">And we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: And you did.</span> <span id="s931">What would you want the people of Straubing to know about your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">A: I really don’t care.</span> <span id="s933">We were there, we sent them a few things and – for their synagogue, they – like a little museum, whatever they wanted to build, I sent them some things and I never heard much from them, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: It – it’s changed.</span> <span id="s936">Straubing was originally, it was German Jews.</span> <span id="s937">After the war it was Polish Jews, and now it’s all Russian Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Yeah, yeah, different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Not those who have roots for centuries, or at least generations, yeah.</span> <span id="s941">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Thank you very much for talking to us today again, after our first interview in March.</span> <span id="s944">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memur – Memorial Museum interview with Fred Firnbacher on September 16th, 2010.</span> <span id="s945">Thanks a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: – you wanted to go, but you were going to ask me a question, so we’ll go that – it’s a one room schoolhouse, there were about six or eight of us, each one of us a different grade, and he taught us all, and I think we learned more there than we would have in public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s949">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Here – here’s another thing with the other one from 50 dollar fine – 50 mark fine, right there, you see 300 thir –</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: That had to do also with that – that other piece of paper right here.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Cause these will someday be destroyed, you’re more than welcome to have all these.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Okay, so in essence, at this point, your father doesn’t have any business any more.</span> <span id="s956">You are being – I-I – I’m – I say homeschooled, but in a –</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: Private school.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: No-Not a traditional, right, school situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: What about friends that you had had at school, or friends that were not Jewish, that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: I didn’t have many.</span> <span id="s962">They didn’t want to associate with me, I didn’t want to associ – well, I wasn’t allowed to associate with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: You had Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I had a few, but the trouble was they were all girls.</span> <span id="s965">I had no boys to grow up with except a cousin who was about eight or 10 years older.</span> <span id="s966">He still is living, he is in – he is in Philadelphia now, and he used to kick a football around with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Ball – other words, soccer ball.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: So your parents, they had siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: How many siblings did each of them have?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: My mother had two, one brother and one sister.</span> <span id="s973">The brother and sister were living in Holland.</span> <span id="s974">They – the brother was a PhD.</span> <span id="s975">in chemistry, he graduated from Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s976">He couldn’t get a job in Germany because he was Jewish, so he went to Holland and he worked for Organon, big pharmaceutical company in Oss.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: That’s o-s-s, in Holland.</span> <span id="s979">And he became paralyzed, I don’t know what disease cause I was so little then.</span> <span id="s980">But anyway, he was in a wheelchair, and my aunt, she’s been divorced, and she had a son, they – she went there to take care of him, and so she lived with her brother in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: And did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No.</span> <span id="s983">When we left Germany, til our ship would leave, as soon as we had our papers to get out, we left on the very next train for Holland, and we stayed with them, and he could see the time was getting – he’d never see his sister again.</span> <span id="s984">So he went downhill, and about a month after we left Holland, he died.</span> <span id="s985">And the aunt and her son, they went – they met their end in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s986">In fact, I’ve got their –</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Their Red Cross letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s989">[pause]</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: I’m just – sorry, I just paused to write.</span> <span

<p><span id="s999">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1000">And he also had siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Q: Brother, sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: He – well, there were actually nine of them originally, but I knew three of his sisters.</span> <span id="s1004">There was a fourth one who died when I was real little, so that took care of them.</span> <span id="s1005">One brother was – he had just gone across the border into Switzerland in oh, about 1936 or ’37.</span> <span id="s1006">And the others, they weren’t living any more when the – his other brothers I don’t remember, I never knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: Hang on one sec.</span> <span id="s1008">I don’t know if I was allowed to do that, but okay.</span> <span id="s1009">So the – you had – your father was one of nine children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Your grandparents, were they still alive before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: My – on my father’s side, my grandfather died in 1938, the year bef – year before we left, and my grandmother died in Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: Your grandfather died in 1938 from what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: Probably heart disease, the – th – didn’t know the terms exactly in those days, what different things were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: And what about your mother’s parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: My grandfather there, he died in 1934.</span> <span id="s1017">That was, I think, before insulin was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Uh-huh, of diabetes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: He di – well, not – he was stung by a bee, and something or other, the – he was allergic, and the diabetes and everything tha – he had a reaction, and he didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s1020">And my grandmother died in Sobibor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: So she went to Westerbork and then to Sobibor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: And did you have cours –</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Well, she – she went to – she went to Holland.</span> <span id="s1025">Well she’s – she was still in Straubing when we were there.</span> <span id="s1026">She couldn’t get a visa, she went back and forth, spent half a year with us, half a year with her other daughter in Holland, back and forth, and when the war broke out, she was in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: And included in the materials, did you bring some correspondence from your grandmother before she was deported to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: I don’t think I have any correspondence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1030">So, tell me, your father, it’s around Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: I’m jumping ahead, but around Kristallnacht – at this point, before Kristallnacht, before November of 1938, did your parents start to get their affairs in orders to get out?</span> <span id="s1033">Had they already signed for a quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: We – we had – we had relatives over here.</span> <span id="s1035">In fact, in the family over here there was – there was the Luchs family – are you – are you a native Washingtonian?</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No?</span> <span id="s1038">Cause there used to be a st – a real estate company here, Shannon and Luchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: And the Luchs family was a very large family, and about half of them came to the United States way back, and a lot of them came at later dates, and the offsprings etcetera.</span> <span id="s1041">There was a Rabbi Luchs in Davenport, Iowa, and he saw to it that everybody in the family had to give some sort of affidavit to try to get the people out.</span> <span id="s1042">And that’s how we got out, and what happened was, in Germany the American consulate of course had a quota, so we got a number, just like you go to the delicatessen –</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: – when you would go in, there’s the number that we had to go to the consulate in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: So you had this in July of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: But it hadn’t come up before Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: What happened on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Well, Kristallnacht, well, along with this – well, we went to the hotel that we were staying at before we went to the American consulate in Stuttgart, this was in our hotel room, in other words since – since you’re not an Aryan, you’re expected to eat your meals in the room, you can’t go into the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Dining room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: So I thought that would be of interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s1054">So, do you remember this trip to the consulate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1056">I remember one thing, my parents were so worried that we wouldn’t get out, cause I had a terrible cough, and it’s – they thought maybe the doctors might reject me because I had this cough that the – I might have bronchitis or something.</span> <span id="s1057">So when we were there, everything was in order except for one thing.</span> <span id="s1058">My father doesn’t know whether it was an accident or whether they did it on purpose, they put the year, it was just after the first of the year, it was in January, instead of putting the date 1939, they put 1938.</span> <span id="s1059">And so they wouldn’t give us our papers to come out.</span> <span id="s1060">So, we didn’t want to get to stop, because they always would come by and pick up our passports, then we had a hard time getting the passports back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: So my dad left us with – my mother and me with relatives in Augsburg.</span> <span id="s1063">We stayed there the int – this is on Friday, so we stayed there all weekend.</span> <span id="s1064">When Dad took the first train Monday morning to Straubing, never went to our house, went straight to the authorities, wherever he had to go to get this corrected.</span> <span id="s1065">Then he got the next train to Stuttgart, went to the consulate, got the papers, came back and picked this up at – in Augsburg, we went back to Straubing that night, and we got everything in order, we th – all the packing, the – everything had been packed already anyway, to get our luggage and everything, to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s1066">And the ne – the very first train out that was – head for Holland, we were on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">Q: And this was when, exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A: The – about well – here, the passports.</span> <span id="s1069">This is my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So this is stamped November of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Well, that’s when she got the passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">A: We got the traveling – January 11th we arrived [indecipherable] Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1075">In 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: So, let’s back – back up to November of 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: It – well, they – they had plundered the synagogue then, everything there that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: What do – what do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: What do I – well, I remember, cause I saw the synagogue afterwards –</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: – what they had done to it.</span> <span id="s1085">They had plundered all that.</span> <span id="s1086">In the morning – well, in the middle of the night that night, they came and tried to break into our house.</span> <span id="s1087">Being small, I never heard a thing.</span> <span id="s1088">I slept through the whole thing.</span> <span id="s1089">In the morning when I woke up, I heard the doorbell ringing downstairs.</span> <span id="s1090">They weren’t able to break into the house, the door was too strong.</span> <span id="s1091">The police were there to arrest my dad, and took him to the jailhouse in Straubing, and after a couple of days he was shipped off to Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: And tell me about your mother, what happened with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: Well, I wa –</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: How was her demeanor, was she frantic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, of course she was frantic, and she didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1096">She went to the police station, and she found a very sympathetic policeman there, and she was able to give him warm clothe – underclothing and stuff, so that he could stay warm, it was wintertime.</span> <span id="s1097">And she went up there every day, she brought something for him every day, this is on – on – and on the third day –</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: Until he was shipped out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: – on the third day he says, they’re gone, he says.</span> <span id="s1100">They asked where to, he says he wasn’t sure, but he thinks it’s Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: And at this point he’s sending letters, por – postcards, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No, it was a little bit different.</span> <span id="s1103">He wou – he knew we’re allowed to send postcards after e-every so often.</span> <span id="s1104">And this is the thing that he sent.</span> <span id="s1105">Now the – what I reme – would – thought would be an ironic thing is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Oh, he’s a World War I veteran.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: He’s a world – World War I veteran.</span> <span id="s1108">He had the Iron Cross.</span> <span id="s1109">This is the Bavarian, some sort of cross there fr – Bavarian.</span> <span id="s1110">And in here are –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: This is the fifth Bavarian, some kind of division, I guess, in the name of His Majesty, the German Kaiser, that my father got the Iron Cross, second class, whatever that means, and so on.</span> <span id="s1113">That’s – that’s the authentic papers that he got the Iron Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: And so he got this in 1917; one of these in 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1116">But you know, the Iron Cross –</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: – that was 19 seven – that’s this one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: And one of them he got in 1934, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1121">And this right here is His Majesty the King, that would be the Kaiser – no, it’s 17 – November 1916th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: I – this is a German script, which I can’t read any more.</span> <span id="s1124">That he got the – the military fatinzkreuzter(ph).</span> <span id="s1125">Some kind of a cross, that’s the third class with honors, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1126">And that’s for the other one, and then he can – received another award, which I don’t know anything about, and I don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: In 1934 they wa – across the board, it – under Hitler, issued th-the Black Cross, this Black Cross.</span> <span id="s1128">So he must have gotten this one in 19 si –</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: No, he got this one 1916 –</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: – and then this one 1917.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: – cause this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: That’s something else, I don’t know what that’s for, but I just found that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Okay, because this is – this usually comes with this.</span> <span id="s1135">Usually it was awarded in 1934 with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1137">Anyway – cause it’s right –</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: So, is it – it’s ironic –</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: – it says right there.</span> <span id="s1140">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1141">And that’s why it’s ironic, that’s why I said this will make a nice exhibit, for he fought for this country, and this is his thanks that he received.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: And do you think he would have been treated differently if he hadn’t fought at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1144">What happened was, they had – my mother heard somebody had gone to the Gestapo and asked – this can go with that also –</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: They had – they had asked if their husband could be released.</span> <span id="s1147">And because she had nerve enough to go to the Gestapo, they released them.</span> <span id="s1148">So my mother said, well, I’m going to go to the Gestapo, too.</span> <span id="s1149">She took the train to Regensburg, went to the Gestapo, and a couple days later, my dad walks in the door.</span> <span id="s1150">And he said that when he left Dachau, cause he had – always had money with him, he – a lot of the others who didn’t have money couldn’t buy things, he left money, almost all the money he had, he just kept enough so he could get home, he gave it to different people, and he got letters later on thanking him for it.</span> <span id="s1151">And as it turned out, a week after he came home, they would have released him anyway cause they released all war veterans the following week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1153">So at this point, what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: This has to do with the – th-the – with the medals, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1156">Oh right, Ehrenkreuz.</span> <span id="s1157">So he was released and then you – this is when you got newspapers together –</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: Well, we couldn’t g – we couldn’t go anywhere til we could go to the consulate in Stuttgart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: He came home the first week in December – second – first, second week, whatever, and our appointment wasn’t with the consulate until January, January sixth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: So we just had to sit around and wait and they would come pick up his passport, give it back to him.</span> <span id="s1163">Have to go and pay a fine to get it back and what have you.</span> <span id="s1164">Also, on the first of January, everybody had to have a kennkarte.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: Of ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: Th-This was January 1st, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: And we were leaving, so my dad thought we could get out, they wouldn’t let us get out of Germany without that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: And I don’t know what happened to my mother’s, I don’t have it here, I don’t have my passport.</span> <span id="s1171">And this is my kennkarte, but this is th – right here, if the – if you’re a child under 10 you didn’t have to have your picture or your f – your fingerprints.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1173">Interesting.</span> <span id="s1174">And can I see your passports?</span> <span id="s1175">So these are for your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1177">I don’t know what happened to mine.</span> <span id="s1178">Ma –</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: Do you remember having a kinder ausweis, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1181">I had one, it was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: – because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: – it wasn’t a book, like it was just one –</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: It was a card, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: – little – little card, and I don’t know what happened to that.</span> <span id="s1186">And to be able to go, everything you took with you, you had to pay a fine to the German, so this is Juden [speaks German] that’s where you had to pay them the fine, or – they valued everything, you had to pay them that much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: Right, so they ta – right, they taxed you to leave the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: They taxed you to be in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: And that makes this envelope empty.</span> <span id="s1191">Let me try and see what else I got here.</span> <span id="s1192">Oh, here – here’s from when I went to the – here’s what I was looking for.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: The [indecipherable].</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: This is my report card, this is the second one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: You – you said that you went s – you stopped in Holland, the family stopped in Holland –</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: – on their way to the United States.</span> <span id="s1198">How long were you in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A: We got there on the 11th, and our ship left on the 28th, so we had two and a half weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: This is my report card from – I don’t have any of my American report cards, but I found this.</span> <span id="s1202">This is –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: The Straubing, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: – the prod – prod – Protestant school, Straubing, and the way they marked, one was like an A, two like a B, and so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s1205">This was [indecipherable] how – how [indecipherable] was work, I guess.</span> <span id="s1206">My behavior, I was – of course I was quiet, I didn’t say anything, cause I was afraid of everybody.</span> <span id="s1207">German, how well I did in German, like here you take English.</span> <span id="s1208">My speaking, I guess I – because I was shy, I didn’t want to talk much.</span> <span id="s1209">Reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Well, this is the fall, this is the spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Spring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1214">Writing, I got that.</span> <span id="s1215">Singing, I got the three, I didn’t sing very well then, I do much better now.</span> <span id="s1216">I guess that’s ho – that’s homework.</span> <span id="s1217">Mathematics.</span> <span id="s1218">This is gym, that’s about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1220">And this is for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Th-That is – it’s a [speaks German]</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Right, the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1224">That was the one there, and he has the remarks here that I am a genius at – not exactly genius, but I’m ex-exceedingly bright in mathematics.</span> <span id="s1225">That goes with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: So, do you remember what it was – coming over on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: Well, their – they were very, very happy, of course, we were out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1228">Well, in fact, when we crossed the border into Holland, wa – I opened up the window and I spit out.</span> <span id="s1229">I remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: So you understood that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1232">We were – I was harassed at school, and all along I knew – I – I was taught what – what I could do and what I couldn’t do and how to behave myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Well, what was it like when you said goodbye to your relatives in Holland, for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A: It was difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1236">I mean, did you – did your parents think this might be the last time –</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1238">Well, in fact, when we left Straubing, my grandmother was in Straubing, but she was back and forth.</span> <span id="s1239">And my – we wouldn’t let her go to the railroad station to see us off because my mother knew that – and my father knew that she would start howling and crying and everything, and they didn’t want to have any kind of a scene, so we said goodbye in the house before we left there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">Q: And you arrived in the United States, what was it like for you at first?</span> <span id="s1241">You didn’t speak English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: Well, I remember we got up in the morning on – on the ship the last day and I saw the Statue of Liberty, and it was snowing.</span> <span id="s1243">There was snow on the deck of the ship.</span> <span id="s1244">And everybody always said how hot it is in the United States – you know, you couldn’t believe it snowed over here.</span> <span id="s1245">It was in February and we went off the ship.</span> <span id="s1246">We landed in Hoboken, went off the ship, through customs and one of my father’s nephews, my first cousin was there to meet us.</span> <span id="s1247">And another cousin on my mother’s side was there.</span> <span id="s1248">And they took us – I guess it was the tubes, whatever they called the trains coming from New Jersey into New York, and showed me, I remember, the tallest building in the world, the Empire States building.</span> <span id="s1249">They took us to lunch, and I don’t remember where or what, and they put us on the train for Washington, somebody else was supposed to meet us here to pick us up.</span> <span id="s1250">They didn’t show up for some reason or other, and we took a cab, because the people who sponsored us, who we were going to stay with, they were in their 70s already then.</span> <span id="s1251">So they didn’t come out at night, and so this – I – he – missed connections or whatever, and so we went by cab.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1253">And you – how did you find it at first?</span> <span id="s1254">How did you find the people –</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Well, was strange – strange coming, you didn’t know the – you didn’t know the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: How was school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: Well, I went to American conversation school.</span> <span id="s1258">And I learned English and I picked it up playing with kids in the street and what have you.</span> <span id="s1259">I just picked it up real fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: And so you felt the transition was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: To me it was easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: How about for your parents though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Well, it was hard for them to learn English.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: And what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: What’d he do?</span> <span id="s1266">He-He – he didn’t have much of jobs at all.</span> <span id="s1267">At first he was – had a part time job at [indecipherable] still the end of the depression.</span> <span id="s1268">Before World War II, he worked as a [indecipherable] but they had him in as a packer, then he was a – they used to pack their own stuff in the – like candy and stuff, they had cellophane bags, and put it all out.</span> <span id="s1269">And he used to work in there putting stuff together like that.</span> <span id="s1270">Then he was – he never was a cashier or anything like that, just odds and ends.</span> <span id="s1271">Then later on he started selling door to door like a peddler.</span> <span id="s1272">And then he went the ki – in wi – in the s – dress business, and selling them to – to the colored, they – he gave them credit, which they couldn’t get at the department stores, cause they couldn’t get credit.</span> <span id="s1273">I don’t think they had credit cards in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: And so – so he – he gave them credit and built up a pretty good business.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: And your mom?</span> <span id="s1277">Did she help in the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: No, she – well, World War II came, and we – we bought a house, and we rented rooms.</span> <span id="s1279">So my mother took
