TV series?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s20">But in World War II, it was a smaller unit and we operated directly with an infantry unit.</span> <span id="s21">We were broken up into three platoons, and each platoon went with an infantry division and we took only belly and chest wounds, the very severe cases, and we had surgical teams that came in and operated maybe 6-8 hours average and 10-12 pints of whole blood.</span> <span id="s22">So I was close enough.</span> <span id="s23">I was always within artillery fire but never within small arms, but we moved right behind the infantry and I was the Supply Officer for the unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: You were the what?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: The supply officer.</span> <span id="s26">And we moved right along behind these divisions, so I was in a position to see a lot and not be just isolated to one small areA: I was all over France and Germany going to medical depots and supply depots and one place and another.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you take these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, I took those myself.</span> <span id="s29">We moved into this area Sunday afternoon and stayed until the next day, and then we pulled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: So it was one day, a 24 hour exposure.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: Right.</span> <span id="s32">It was liberated in the morning and we set up...the infantry moves right on through, and then we follow right along behind the infantry.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Do you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s35">So we set up in a field right outside of this place.</span> <span id="s36">Of course, we weren't equipped, even subsistence-wise, to do too much; and the war was still going and we were combat troops, so we moved on.</span> <span id="s37">In fact the war was over in eight more days, and I ended up the war in Innsbruck, AustriA: We went from here [pointing to map], which is outside of Munich, to Stuttgart and Ulm, crossed the Danube at Ulm, and then on down to Goeppingen and then on down to Innsbruck in Austria, and Garmisch.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Do you remember what date you entered Dachau?</span> <span id="s39">A: Yes, it was the 29th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: April 29th and you left on the 30th then.</span> <span id="s41">You said you left the next day and it was 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s43">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Did you know that you were going to be going to a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s45">A: Oh, no.</span> <span id="s46">See, the Seventh Army was advancing, of course.</span> <span id="s47">We crossed the Rhine at Manheim, and we swung south then to Heidelburg, and the reason we swung south was the Third Army was north of us and Patton crossed our whole army front with his armour and closed the Brenner Pass just outside of Garmisch there, and Innsbruck, so it was really just a swing then to the right and a mop up sort of an operation.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: So you were coming behind the infantry, as you had mentioned before.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Right.</span> <span id="s50">With the infantry.</span> <span id="s51">But the war was over for all practical purposes at that point, because it was just strictly mopping up.</span> <span id="s52">They were surrendering to the burgermeisters in the towns as we came along and turned in their weapons, the Germany Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Now you entered the Dachau area.</span> <span id="s54">When you came to these pictures that you’ve shown me, what area did you go to first?</span> <span id="s55">What do you remember?</span> <span id="s56">If you can take yourself back in time a little.</span> <span id="s57">Do you remember what you saw first in this camp?</span> <span id="s58">Was it the entrance way?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: No, this train.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: The train.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Yes, I came up on first from where we set up our hospital, and I took pictures of the train and then on into the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Now, in this picture we see, of course, the emaciated corpses, the skeletons, the dead skeletons.</span> <span id="s63">Do you remember what your thoughts were at that time when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Well, I couldn't believe it, but I should have had an inkling, and I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s65">We came through the Siegfried line with the Third Infantry Division, the particular unit I was following at that time, and the Sargamien.</span> <span id="s66">Sargamund if it’s German, Sargamien was French.</span> <span id="s67">Then we went to Zweibruecken.</span> <span id="s68">We came on through.</span> <span id="s69">Zweibruecken was really the next large town we got to, and in addition to being a supply officer, I was the real estate officer--there's army forms for everything, and we occupied buildings when we could.</span> <span id="s70">We went into tents if we had to, we had tents and all; but if we found a town that had a school or a large home or something similar to this, we would move in there and set up our hospital because we had very few patients.</span> <span id="s71">From Omaha Beach in Normandy to Innsbruck in Austria, we had less than 3,000 patients; about a third of them died.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: And you say that you should have had an ideA:</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: Yes, because in Zweibruecken the town was shot up some, but I went into the town.</span> <span id="s74">Again, the infantry went through and pushed the Germans on through, or the Germans ran and the infantry followed them, and I came right into the town behind them.</span> <span id="s75">I went to this large home.</span> <span id="s76">It was really an office complex, in front of a small factory; there was a small factory behind it.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Was this in Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: No, this was Zweibruecken.</span> <span id="s79">And this small factory -- machines, tools sort of a thing -- was behind this large building.</span> <span id="s80">So I went in this building, and I said, "We'll set up our hospital here."</span> <span id="s81">So I had signs and I had a driver, Herman Cohen, who spoke the language, who was a tailor from Chicago.</span> <span id="s82">I said, "We'll set up here and put our signs out.”</span> <span id="s83">Then we would go back toward the unit, and we’d stick up our signs so they could follow the signs up to the new location.</span> <span id="s84">Sort of like circus people.</span> <span id="s85">But, when I went in this building, it was full of furnishings -- desks, chairs, what have you -- and furnished sparsley.</span> <span id="s86">It was sort of an office complex with an apartment upstairs; it was a three-story building.</span> <span id="s87">We got in there about dusk, and I told the driver, "We don't want to be on the road at night; we'll just throw our bed rolls here and spend the night, and in the morning we'll go back and get the unit."</span> <span id="s88">So we spent the night there.</span> <span id="s89">And the next morning we got up and walked to the back -- we heard some activity there--and looked out the window in the courtyard down there and there was a well, and there were people out there washing up.</span> <span id="s90">We didn't think too much about it -- thought maybe that they were Germans -- but they weren't soldiers so there was really no concern.</span> <span id="s91">We'd seen the German people before.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: These people were well fed?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, not really, but they weren't emaciated like these people that we see.</span> <span id="s94">But I went back and got the unit and told about the signs and to move on up, and then I came back up to this place with this driver that I had, Herman Cohen, and when we got back there it was a wreck.</span> <span id="s95">All of the furnishings in the apartment had been torn up; the office desks and what-have-you had been slashed, so there was really nothing that we could use in the way of comfort for ourselves.</span> <span id="s96">These people were inside the building at this point.</span> <span id="s97">And they spoke Russian.</span> <span id="s98">I don't know whether they were Jewish people or just Russians, but there was one man that was in charge of the group and there were men and women; I assumed that the women cooked, maybe for the household, or maybe even worked in the factory, but there were about 14 of these people.</span> <span id="s99">The man that was in charge of the group, from what we could get out of him -- he was Russian -- these were slave labor that was used right in that little complex there, and they lived in a dungeon, a cavern-type--it was really a wine cellar that was underneath this house.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So there was a factory [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Right.</span> <span id="s102">And this man that was in charge of the group had had every finger on both hands broken and none set.</span> <span id="s103">They were going in all different directions, his fingers.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did he tell you how it happened?</span> <span id="s105">A: No.</span> <span id="s106">We couldn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Couldn’t communicate.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: ...communicate with him sufficiently to find out.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: And you felt that having seen that should have given you some ideA: A: Inkling of what might be going on.</span> <span id="s110">But it didn't register at that point.</span> <span id="s111">Q: Well, your inability to communicate probably had a lot to do with that.</span> <span id="s112">A: Yes, if we could have found out....</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Had there not been a language barrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: We did find out that because he was in charge of this group that he was forced to make them work more, or something.</span> <span id="s115">Anyway, he had all his fingers broken.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: He had security there, too; it seems like a man from a slave labor camp that they were working at.</span> <span id="s117">And that was your first, your closest [unintelligible] before you got to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s119">Dachau is maybe 400 miles or more.</span> <span id="s120">We're talking from March... well no, the 29th of April it was at Dachau and we broke through the Siegfried line about March 15, as I recall, so within a period of 30 days I was from Zweibruecken to this place, but it was still unexpected.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Still unexpected.</span> <span id="s122">There was no talk about it among the men in the Army.</span> <span id="s123">Do you know that anybody had seen anything at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: No.</span> <span id="s125">That's the thing.</span> <span id="s126">Like I say, I had an opportunity to visit supply depots and was on the road and asking directions and different things, and I had a chance to speak with many more folks than a man carrying a rifle that was just going through an area that was three miles wide and several hundred long.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And with that opportunity, you never told [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: We still didn’t, until we hit this place.</span> <span id="s129">In fact, the civilians in there don't believe it, in the town of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Did you talk to them at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: This driver that I had, Herman Cohen, spoke with them, and they denied any knowledge of that place, and I just can't buy that.</span> <span id="s132">I can't believe it, because it is just outside of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s134">And this was a very large camp.</span> <span id="s135">Dachau certainly had its crematoriums.</span> <span id="s136">So as you saw the railroad tracks, you saw the people, you saw these bodies, were you alone?</span> <span id="s137">Were there other men with you when you saw these?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, in those pictures you can see other troops from the infantry that was going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Did you talk to any of these when you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Well, not really.</span> <span id="s141">I took these pictures with a 35 mm camera and I was sure happy that I had it with me.</span> <span id="s142">The American soldier is a fine fighting fellow.</span> <span id="s143">My experience in observing them and working with them is that the German soldier could take commands, but once a sergeant was shot or the officer, then they didn't get with it like the American soldier, because with the American soldiers we promoted right down through the ranks.</span> <span id="s144">If a lieutenant was shot, the sergeant was the lieutenant and the corporal was the sergeant, so everybody could step in; it was that little American ingenuity that paid dividends at all levels.</span> <span id="s145">But, I'd never seen them really brutal until we went through here.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: You never saw the American soldier brutal until you went in here?</span> <span id="s147">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: What’s [unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Now I've seen them shoot a German that came out with this "comrade” bit after he'd emptied his weapon; I say shoot them.</span> <span id="s150">I've seen them turn them over to the French in France, the free French, which meant the death warrant, but this soldier had shot at them until he used up all of his ammo then he had said, "Comrade."</span> <span id="s151">Well, the American soldier generally didn't buy this bit; if he still had a couple of bullets or even one bullet, this saved him, but they're not going to let somebody shoot at them until they use up all their ammo and then say "I'm your comrade” or “I want to surrender."</span> <span id="s152">But in here, they shot...this book indicates...now the G-2 people from Army came down and made this up and they talked with people, and you'd probably get more from this because I didn't speak with people, I just observed it.</span> <span id="s153">The Wermacht was there; the SS had gone and just the old German soldier was there, and everyone they shot they gave a rifle butt right in the face.</span> <span id="s154">His own mother wouldn’t recognize him.</span> <span id="s155">They just caved in his face with a rifle butt after they’d shot him.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">And they shot every one.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: The American, after having witnessed this.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Yes, after having witnessed this, they shot them all and gave them all a rifle butt right in the face and caved it in.</span> <span id="s159">I took a picture of a stream there that had a couple of German bodies in it; I didn't take a picture of a fellow I saw reach down and pull up a ring finger and cut it off and take the ring and throw it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: It evoked so much feeling</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: It did, it did.</span> <span id="s162">That people would treat other people like this.</span> <span id="s163">I tell you, they were vicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: They did this.</span> <span id="s165">Did they talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, in fact, I was going to say, the troops all the while were moving on up, and they captured some more Wehrmacht soldiers.</span> <span id="s167">There were two that came right back up during this afternoon.</span> <span id="s168">They were sitting on the front of a jeep with a GI driving it and a GI sitting on the back with a gun on them.</span> <span id="s169">And as they pulled through this area, these slave laborers pulled these people off that jeep.</span> <span id="s170">Crossed the road and blocked it and pulled them off and beat them.</span> <span id="s171">They didn't kill them, but they beat them on the grass right there, and the GIs did nothing.</span> <span id="s172">Now these really weren’t people that had persecuted them, but they were feeling the same thing that the GI soldier was feeling, and it's very understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: [Unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Now I walked all through that place, and one thing that impressed me was that there was a commissary there.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: At Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: At Dachau.</span> <span id="s177">And, of course, these people broke into that .</span> <span id="s178">Well, when they broke out they came to where we had set up our hospital.</span> <span id="s179">They ate out of the garbage cans, they ate grass, they were milling around all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: How did you feel when you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Oh, this was horrible.</span> <span id="s182">See, I'm a mortician in civilian life.</span> <span id="s183">I’ve worked with the medics all the while in the Army.</span> <span id="s184">I was with the medical department; I didn't want to get in Graves Registration.</span> <span id="s185">I only did once and that was in Korea, about 45 days.</span> <span id="s186">But I’m accustomed -- I was at that point -- to death and dead people, but you’ll notice I didn’t take any pictures of the live ones because they were the walking dead and I just couldn't.</span> <span id="s187">At that point I just couldn't take a picture of those emaciated people that were still on their feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you react to them as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s190">We tried to do everything that we possibly could for them, and that’s what I was mentioning .</span> <span id="s191">They went into this commissary.</span> <span id="s192">They were, like I say, milling around all over.</span> <span id="s193">We weren't equipped to handle them and the people that were going through, but they went into this commissary which was for the Germans, I'm satisfied.</span> <span id="s194">The thing that impressed me was that the floor was littered with little cigars.</span> <span id="s195">They weren’t after cigars; they went for the food that was there.</span> <span id="s196">The Germans had cheeses in toothpaste tubes-like, fine cheeses, and other crackers and other condiments and food.</span> <span id="s197">They trampled cigars all over the floor and when they would pick up one of these they'd heave it aside; they were looking for food.</span> <span id="s198">They could care less for smoking the things.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did they try to talk to you at all?</span> <span id="s200">Did they try to say anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: Oh, well.</span> <span id="s202">My unit was interested only in their well-being.</span> <span id="s203">There was a Dr. Goldblatt from Connecticut and there was a Dr. Rosencranz from Albuquerque, New Mexico, I believe.</span> <span id="s204">But they spoke with them.</span> <span id="s205">But I think they were not interested, really, in having these people tell them all the bad things, you know.</span> <span id="s206">They were more interested in what can I do for you, how do you feel at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s208">So these were medical people.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Yes, these were doctors.</span> <span id="s210">But we were there only for an afternoon and part of the next morning and gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: When you got in there, apparently everybody had gone is what you told me.</span> <span id="s212">There were no SS left.</span> <span id="s213">The Wehrmact was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s215">The Wehrmacht was there and, of course, as the GIs went through, they shot the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s217">And what about the civilians?</span> <span id="s218">Had any civilians come to the camp, at that point, from the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s220">Of course, this was a period when there was firing as we moved through the town and moved through the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s222">There was still fire.</span> <span id="s223">That would have been later on that [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s224">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: I have several more questions to ask you, but I do want to be sure that we get some of these questions for the record on this tape, so I don't forget.</span> <span id="s226">I am going to need your full name.</span> <span id="s227">What is your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: Jesse.</span> <span id="s229">J-E-S-S-E H. L-A-F-O-O-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And your address?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: 6900 Bishop Road, Fairburn, GeorgiA: Q: And your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: 9 November, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: And you were born where?</span> <span id="s234">A: Victoria, VA:</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: And your age at the time that you got into Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, I was born in 1922.</span> <span id="s237">This was 1945.</span> <span id="s238">May and November, the difference.</span> <span id="s239">Q: 23?</span> <span id="s240">At 23 years of age?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Almost 23, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And your present occupation is?</span> <span id="s243">A: I am a retired army officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: And retired from what?</span> <span id="s245">You were a mortician, you say?</span> <span id="s246">A: No, I was with the Medical Department.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And your military unit at the time you were with the service?</span> <span id="s248">A: The 54th Field Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: Is that the whole title because I know there were several...?</span> <span id="s250">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s251">That was it.</span> <span id="s252">54th Field Hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: And your rank at the time of liberation.</span> <span id="s254">A: First lieutenant.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And you liberated Dachau only, or you came into Dachau?</span> <span id="s256">A: Dachau.</span> <span id="s257">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: When you did get there, you were not aware that you were going to be there, so what....</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: We were just moving through.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: You just moved through, so actually you did nothing in terms of the survivors, the inmates, you didn't handle the bodies or anything of that nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: No.</span> <span id="s262">Now, later, I ran into some of these people that were from Dachau.</span> <span id="s263">After the war was over, in Innsbruck, in Austria, is where we ended up, we moved back to Goeppingen, Germany, and they had set up a Displaced Persons camp there.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: In Goeppingen?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: UNRAA in Goeppingen.</span> <span id="s266">The war was over and there was a unit of the 36th Infantry Division in town, so we set up a little station hospital.</span> <span id="s267">Where we'd been a field hospital and had taken bellies and chests, we set up a little station hospital-like and then we took everything: sore throats, fractures, everything; and this Displaced Persons Camp was outside of town.</span> <span id="s268">The burgermeister or the town mayor of our town was a major who had served in World War I, and he had been a town mayor as a sergeant, so he was mayor of our town.</span> <span id="s269">And he had bags of money!</span> <span id="s270">I should have known about this.</span> <span id="s271">But you're young, and you don't know.</span> <span id="s272">But like I mentioned, we broke through the Siegfried line with the Third Infantry Division.</span> <span id="s273">Now Sargemeins was right there at the line, so the minute we broke through the line one morning, that same morning, we were in Sargemeins.</span> <span id="s274">The town was only a couple of miles through the line.</span> <span id="s275">When we hit the infantry broke through, and we had been sitting since December on the other side.</span> <span id="s276">So one morning we popped through the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">When we hit the town the people had all run.</span> <span id="s278">In fact, there was food on the table and there were guns in the corner where the German soldiers had even run; but the whole town was mined and booby-trapped, because the Siegfried line really wasn’t the thing that Hitler sold it for.</span> <span id="s279">The Maginot line was a four-story deep proposition with machine rooms, engine rooms, guns, everything, but Hitler had sold that Seigfreid line as a [unintelligible] when really it was just dragon's teeth and a few pillboxes.</span> <span id="s280">So we got through that in a hurry, and we’re right in this town, and everybody runs, but their buildings are blowing up.</span> <span id="s281">When I came in right behind the infantry to get set up for the hospital, they had just moved through and then I'm there.</span> <span id="s282">The buildings were blowing up and I thought it was incoming artillery; but I went down to the bank and there was money all over the floor!</span> <span id="s283">We went through the building.</span> <span id="s284">Soldiers will look at the loot a little, you know.</span> <span id="s285">You can't carry much.</span> <span id="s286">Anyway, we went down to the bank and there was money everywhere!</span> <span id="s287">I picked out the largest denomination bill I could find and put it in my pocket as a souvenir.</span> <span id="s288">I had to watch my boys so they don't loot or destroy any property or anything.</span> <span id="s289">But, we did pick up a large denomination.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Well, all that money that was printed prior to 1928 was good that was there; the Germans later said that everything after 1928 wasn't any good.</span> <span id="s291">This man that I spoke of, he joined our unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: The mayor?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s294">His town was down Goeppingen, south of Stuttgart, but he hit us about the time we went through the Siegfried, and he was just one man with 4 or 5 people to run a town.</span> <span id="s295">He had to be with somebody to get something to eat, at this point.</span> <span id="s296">But I am satisfied that others waited until the town was liberated and then went in.</span> <span id="s297">But he joined us at this point, and every time that we went through there after that, he policed up all this money, and he had duffel bags of it.</span> <span id="s298">So when we got to Goeppingen -- just getting back to my original story and the Displaced Persons camp -- he was able to hire us people from the Displaced Persons camp to work in their hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: He paid for that with that money from the bank?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s301">And we could get Germans, we could get coal, anything we wanted, he had the money for.</span> <span id="s302">If it was available, he could get it.</span> <span id="s303">But the thing that impressed me was I think I had a fine unit.</span> <span id="s304">There weren’t too many of us.</span> <span id="s305">It was a small unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">We had 5 MFC officers and 15 doctors and 15 nurses and then we had about 85 enlisted people.</span> <span id="s307">But within that group there were so many trades and skills that I think that with those 85 people I could have done most anything, but the thing that impressed me about this Displaced Persons Camp was if we had some patients and I wanted to give them some entertainment, I went out there and there were concert pianists out there, engineers, everything!</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: From the Displaced Persons Camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s310">I mean, even though they had been slave laborers, these people were the cream of the crop.</span> <span id="s311">They were well-educated people, in the arts and everything else.</span> <span id="s312">Q: You mentioned UNRAAA: Was UNRAA the whole unit that ran the displaced persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes, they ran these things all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: You worked with the Displaced Persons camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No.</span> <span id="s316">Just from the standpoint of if I needed any entertainment or anything from the hospital, I could go out there and the mayor would pay them, and I could get just the finest entertainers in the world.</span> <span id="s317">The finest engineers were there, the doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Were these people survivors of concentration camps or labor camps?</span> <span id="s319">Or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No.</span> <span id="s321">I really wouldn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Because there was a difference between those people that were able to work and those people that were totally emaciated and survived by some miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s324">yes.</span> <span id="s325">But in this particular camp, from just glancing through here at the pictures, and seeing the people there, they were at all stages of emaciation.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: There weren't too many survivors at Dachau.</span> <span id="s327">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Very, very few [unintelligible] at Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No.</span> <span id="s330">But, this you might want to glance at, it might raise a question.</span> <span id="s331">Q: This is a soft cover book, Dachau and who put this out?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: The Army.</span> <span id="s333">The G-2 people.</span> <span id="s334">Q: G-2 people?</span> <span id="s335">Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: They came down and interviewed them.</span> <span id="s337">But they only spent a couple of days too.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: The 163 B Photo Signal Company.</span> <span id="s339">A: They took the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s341">The 7th Army.</span> <span id="s342">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Q: Are we going to be able to hold onto this book for a while?</span> <span id="s344">A Oh, yes, I'd like for you to copy it.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Copy it, or would you like to put it in our Archives here at the university?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I would like to do that [put it in the Archives] because most people should see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: Very fine.</span> <span id="s348">Very fine.</span> <span id="s349">It is historical documentation.</span> <span id="s350">And what about these photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: You can make copies of those.</span> <span id="s352">I would be happy to let you have those.</span> <span id="s353">Q: Do you want the originals back, or do you want us to make copies?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I would be happy to give you those, with the book.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: That would be really wonderful, because we are building up Archives here, and this is a certain type of original documentation that would be most valuable in our research.</span> <span id="s356">Yes.</span> <span id="s357">This, indeed, does have a lot of information on Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Now, they interviewed some of the people there.</span> <span id="s359">Q: They interviewed some of the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: In other words, the Army interviewed the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s363">The G-2.</span> <span id="s364">And they have some history of the....</span></p> <p><span id="s365">[End of Side 1 of tape.</span> <span id="s366">Conversation resumes as follows on Side 2]</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: We did talk about the Dachau book and now we're into some more of the questioning.</span> <span id="s368">When you returned from your service, did you share this information immediately, the experience that you had when you saw Dachau?</span> <span id="s369">Did you write home about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: No.</span> <span id="s371">I didn't write any bad news at home.</span> <span id="s372">My folks were elderly.</span> <span id="s373">My father was 35 when I was born, and they were old and I was a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q:.</span> <span id="s375">I see.</span> <span id="s376">So you really shared none of this with them at the time.</span> <span id="s377">When you came home, did you share this information of the camps specifically, or did you stay away from this specifically and share your other Army experiences?</span> <span id="s378">Do you have any recollection of that at all?</span> <span id="s379">Did this make any more of an impression upon you, or less of an impression, or equal impression as did your other Army experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: My Army experiences were pleasant, for the most part, because, even with the hospital that I was with... I saw a lot of death.</span> <span id="s381">In Normandy, of course, there were many people killed when we first came in, military and Germans, and even lots of animals everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: You're talking about dogs and cats?</span> <span id="s383">A: No, cows, primarily cattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: It's interesting that you mentioned that.</span> <span id="s385">You are our first interviewer to mention the death of animals.</span> <span id="s386">Were you close to animals?</span> <span id="s387">Were you on a farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Well, I started out in the funeral business when I was 14 years old.</span> <span id="s389">A mortuary moved into Martinsville, Virginia, and I was living there at the time.</span> <span id="s390">They bought an old home in my area, and I had a friend who was older that worked there, and it was six months before they got a body.</span> <span id="s391">And I happened to be there the day they got a body.</span> <span id="s392">I helped them set up when they first moved in, and I visited often, but my friend hadn't had any experience with death or preparation of the dead, and he got sick on the first body and I took over his job.</span> <span id="s393">So as a 14 year old I worked at that funeral home and then I worked in the funeral business, off and on, until I finished high school and came into the military.</span> <span id="s394">But in the military, I wanted to get with the medical department; I figured that I would enjoy this more.</span> <span id="s395">Because I liked to help people, that's what I'm saying.</span> <span id="s396">I always have.</span> <span id="s397">I enjoy people and like to help people and I got a lot of satisfaction out of the funeral business because I could take a body that looked ghastly and make it look fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s399">And in terms of your animal experience, you had no farm experience, because you mentioned the death of the animals?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Well, my grandparents did, and I have always had animal s. I have animals at home now.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: So it was a part of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s403">So I grew up with animals, and I like people and I like animals.</span> <span id="s404">But when I came back home from the service, I went back into the funeral business and then I went to the Cincinnati College of Embalming and I got my licenses in Virginia.</span> <span id="s405">I showed these photos to the people that I worked with there, in this brochure, and also at the Cincinatti College of Embalming.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: What was their reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: There were some military people there that could see that this thing could happen based on the attitudes of Hitler and his total control of the situation over there, but most of them were younger people then that were just coming out of high school and going into their father's business or going into the mortuary business.</span> <span id="s408">I am satisfied that it didn't have the impact on them that it did the soldiers.</span> <span id="s409">This was my observation.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And so you were really able to take this material immediately and your experience with it.</span> <span id="s411">Did you really apply what you saw since you were in the mortuary business and you had this experience seeing the emaciated bodies?</span> <span id="s412">Was there ever any relationship between your working in a mortuary and having any of the visions of these bodies at the time?</span> <span id="s413">Did you ever feel that you were working with just natural death, as opposed to unnatural death?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: It did hit me a couple of times in that regard.</span> <span id="s415">I hadn't thought of this ever, really, but, an emaciated person that has it happen to them over, we'll say, a month's hospitalization, I can restore that person in the funeral home.</span> <span id="s416">I can bring back the fullness to the cheeks and what have you with fluids and osmosis, but with these people if it happens over a long period of time, no, you can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: [Unintelligible] restoration?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s419">So those people could never approximate the appearance of what they once were.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: I would like to get into some of the questions that we have here that have to do with the religious aspect of our interviewers, in relation to your experience at the camp.</span> <span id="s421">One of our questions is: do you consider yourself a religious person, or did you consider yourself a religious person at that time?</span> <span id="s422">Did you follow any religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I’d been brought up in the Baptist Church and I had, since I can remember, believed in a Supreme Being; but I’ve always respected everyone else's religion.</span> <span id="s424">In the funeral business we handled Catholics, the Jewish people, Polish, all nationalities, Chinese, and so I have always respected everyone's religion and religious customs.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Were there any conscious thoughts about God or religion at the time, or perhaps shortly after you were exposed to this type of an experience?</span> <span id="s426">Do you remember any thoughts of that nature?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I can only remember one.</span> <span id="s428">I've got a pretty good memory, but the one thought that I had was that I grew up poor; I was from a working class family, not poor because we were a family and a close family, but my father had been in the construction business and in the crash he lost everything.</span> <span id="s429">During the time that I was about 10 and can recall, in the 1930's there was a depression, and one of my first thoughts was golly, if Roosevelt had been the type personality that Hitler was, we could have had one of these same situations.</span> <span id="s430">He could have been a dictator, if he had wanted to, I believe, because at that point, in the country, we had the depression and all the related things that the Germans had.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: The historical background at the time led to that type of situation; that's very interesting that you should remember that type of a feeling at the time.</span> <span id="s432">Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s434">Well, we may have discussed it there that, gosh, this same thing might have happened to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: You say you discussed it with your fellow Army people.</span> <span id="s436">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did your religion have anything to do with the way you viewed these inmates, these prisoners?</span> <span id="s438">Do you have any memory of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: No.</span> <span id="s440">I’ve always had a desire to help people and that’s the reason I really wouldn’t have been satisfied in any other service other than the medical.</span> <span id="s441">We tried to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s443">What about your feelings about the civilians then?</span> <span id="s444">What was your reaction to these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: I didn't see any of those in that particular town.</span> <span id="s446">Q: You saw civilians perhaps in other towns.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: After your experience at Dachau, after having witnessed what you witnessed there, when you looked at the civilians did you ever get the feeling of "who is responsible for this" or was there a feeling of apathy for these civilians?</span> <span id="s449">Do you remember having any reaction at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: I met many good Germans.</span> <span id="s451">I had the driver, Herman Cohen, and I was interested in real estate.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did he try to influence you one way or the other?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Well, I'm satisfied that he did, because his grandmother was lost in a similar situation in Holland.</span> <span id="s454">She was from Holland.</span> <span id="s455">But I know that when we took over homes, we went to the burgermeister's office and checked for the Nazis in the area.</span> <span id="s456">We usually ended up with a dentist's home or a doctor's home or someone in that category.</span> <span id="s457">Of course, we were interested in nice homes first off.</span> <span id="s458">I had occasion a number of times after that to go into Innsbruck and then back to Goeppingen where we set up, and I know in Goeppingen I went to the burgermeister's office, this major that I knew, and we got the homes of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s459">At this point the war was over, and when we got back to Goeppingen we could relax some and we set up a little club for our officers.</span> <span id="s460">I went to the burgermeister's office and I said, "Give me the list of the Nazis," and I went to those homes and when they said, "When am I going to get my chair back or my sofa or this particular piece of furniture?"</span> <span id="s461">, I said “Paint your name underneath it on the bottom.</span> <span id="s462">We occupied this country for 20 years after the last war and that wasn’t sufficient evidently.</span> <span id="s463">You can expect it back after 20 years.”</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q:: So in other words, Herman was a Jewish man, and he must have shared some experience or reaction of his with you.</span> <span id="s465">What was his reaction, and how did you react to how he felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: I think what I just said may have been a reaction to what he said, how he felt.</span> <span id="s467">Q: He was out to get every last Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: He was bitter that people could do this to people.</span> <span id="s469">Q: Did he ever influence your feelings about...?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: I am satisfied that with this housing experience he did, but it probably didn't take much influence, based on what I had witnessed.</span> <span id="s471">I just couldn't see how educated people could condone this.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: It is a difficult thing to justify, isn't it?</span> <span id="s473">A: It is.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q:: What kind of persecution did you see this as, in terms of the camps, or have you ever thought about it?</span> <span id="s475">The method of persecuting these people and making these people the inmates of the state.</span> <span id="s476">How did you see this?</span> <span id="s477">Did you ever think about the Nazi methodology?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: At the time that we happened upon this, I wasn't familiar with all of the political and economic implications of the thing, the big picture, but the thing that I recall that impressed me was why starve these people to death?</span> <span id="s479">Why feed them water with a couple of potatoes in it?</span> <span id="s480">If you're going to work them, feed them.</span> <span id="s481">I am from the South.</span> <span id="s482">My family didn't have slaves, but my grandfather and great grandfather had tobacco farms, Bright Tobacco Farm, 50 odd acres.</span> <span id="s483">They always had enough children to maintain it, so we weren't in cotton and didn't require slaves, but I disagree with a lot of people now when they try to tell me about how we treated the people in the South.</span> <span id="s484">I say, "Golly, what you are saying just isn't logical, because when land is selling for 10 cents to a $1.00 an acre and I have to pay $1300 for a slave, am I'm going to abuse him?</span> <span id="s485">“ That's just like saying that I would buy a Cadillac car and run it through my woods down here on my farm.</span> <span id="s486">It's ridiculous.</span> <span id="s487">But I'm sure there are instances.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: You couldn’t understand the logic of starvation if you’re going to have people working for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: You said that you had shared this material, on and off, with several groups and different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: With Jewish groups here in the Atlanta area, in the 1950's.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Is that right?</span> <span id="s493">What was the reaction at that time, in the 1950s?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I really couldn't say, because I loaned this to an individual who took it to these groups, and he always brought it back.</span> <span id="s495">Fantastic!</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s497">You’re fortunate.</span> <span id="s498">They knew that you had the material and they wanted it for a project.</span> <span id="s499">Is that it?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: About the time of the Jewish holidays, I might be tempted to look that up or somebody might mention it, and like in 1948 when they were establishing a country.</span> <span id="s501">I've been 200% for them since then in all their fights.</span> <span id="s502">I think they're the best fighters in the world, probably; and this is the thing that I offer people for an example.</span> <span id="s503">I say back during the Civil War there were twenty million Yankees and there were six million Southerners, and we gave them a good fight.</span> <span id="s504">And I relate this to the Korean thing; there were twenty million south Koreans and six million north Koreans, and you mean to tell me that if the north Koreans invade their homeland that they can't protect themselves, that we have to be there with a presence?</span> <span id="s505">And I go back to the Israelies and their numbers and how they could whip a lot of people.</span> <span id="s506">So I've always been for them.</span> <span id="s507">And I don't know whether that is a result of my experience here or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s509">Yes, it would be difficult for you to know whether or not it was a result of your experience.</span> <span id="s510">Do you have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: Five.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you ever share the experience with the children?</span> <span id="s513">A: I've mentioned it a number of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Have they seen the photographs?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: A lot of people don’t tell war stories, but I tell war stories.</span> <span id="s516">I tell pleasant war stories, situations that have happened to me that are comical.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Have your children seen these pictures?</span> <span id="s518">A: Yes they have.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Do you know whether or not they have shared this type of information with their children, as a matter of history, sociology, to be aware of what has happened, what could happen again.</span> <span id="s520">Are you aware of any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: No, I only have two children that have children.</span> <span id="s522">Q: We were just wondering how much education...?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: They’re small and I really couldn't say what impact this had on my children, but I will say that they’ve been exposed to it and my comments that it shouldn’t have happened and it should never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: Did you see "The Holocaust"?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: I did.</span> <span id="s526">And I hadn't thought of this material for a number of years.</span> <span id="s527">I called my local newspaper up here and I asked them if they would be interested in writing anything.</span> <span id="s528">I told them I had this material.</span> <span id="s529">And they came out and spoke with me, and that's one reason that I can recall possibly a lot of this now that you are asking about; normally, I wouldn't be able to just recall it this well.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: You’ve had several reviews.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I have because I spoke with them and they ran a couple of pictures.</span> <span id="s532">That was one thing, with "The Holocaust" and with them, and I can understand why.</span> <span id="s533">They didn't show any pictures.</span> <span id="s534">They showed pictures of the crematorium and they showed one other picture.</span> <span id="s535">Two pictures and a nice article but it didn’t have any of the gruesome facts, details, or pictures, and I could see that that would be overkill.</span> <span id="s536">But it doesn’t bother me that it would be overkill.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: It’s overkill because it’s so terribly unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s539">The Holocaust.</span> <span id="s540">It wasn’t an overkill proposition.</span> <span id="s541">Q: It was an overkill.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Yes, but they didn’t bring out all the gruesome....</span> <span id="s543">Q: The movie itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s545">That’s what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Very gently done in order to have a viewing public, perhaps.</span> <span id="s547">A: And they didn’t want overkill.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: Do you know if your children saw the movie, "The Holocaust"?</span> <span id="s549">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: I think we’ve just about covered most of the material that we have on our questionnaire here.</span> <span id="s551">One other thing.</span> <span id="s552">I did ask you whether or not you had shared your experiences with your co-Army personnel, and from what you told me, very little was talked about after you saw Dachau.</span> <span id="s553">The men shared very little of what they saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s555">Well, we witnessed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: You witnessed it, but you didn’t talk about it among each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: The war was over in eight days, and this was a relief to everyone, but as I recall, we really didn't go into this thing in detail.</span> <span id="s558">I think everybody was just so horrified that they had rather not discuss it.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Your wife---she knows that you are here today?</span> <span id="s560">A: Yes,</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: You have shared this with her?</span> <span id="s562">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: You obviously have shared this many times.</span> <span id="s564">Your reason for sharing it, I think you have indicated, is that you just don’t feel you want it to happen again.</span> <span id="s565">This is your way of preventing it from reoccurring, which is really admirable.</span> <span id="s566">I am just reviewing here to be sure that I have covered just about all the information with you.</span> <span id="s567">One more question in terms of coping with this experience.</span> <span id="s568">You were close to death at 14 years of age--you indicated that you were working with dead bodies on and off, so you really had almost an "insulation" for yourself in terms of what death was and viewing death.</span> <span id="s569">Do you think that that had any softening impact in relation to your viewing death in the Army per se, or specifically this type of....</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: No.</span> <span id="s571">I would say no.</span> <span id="s572">I have embalmed nine bodies in a single day.</span> <span id="s573">It always bothered me.</span> <span id="s574">It bothered me more if it were a younger person--I hated to work on children, babies in particular, but an older person that had died of natural causes at a ripe old age, this didn't affect me as much, and so I had not been hardened to death.</span> <span id="s575">And this bothered me lots because these people were of all nationalities.</span> <span id="s576">They were not old people.</span> <span id="s577">They didn’t die of natural causes.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: I thank you very, very much Mr. Lafoon.</span> <span id="s579">I have some material here that I’d like you to sign for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">[Tape is turned off and conversation ends.</span> <span id="s581">Conversation resumes as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: I'm going to put this back on tape again because we’re interested in it.</span> <span id="s583">You returned to Dachau in 1961 with your wife and your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Of course, the crematorium....</span></p> <p><span id="s585">Q: Did you think about what you had seen and then what you were seeing in 1961?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Right.</span> <span id="s587">The crematorium was there like it was.</span> <span id="s588">Q: [unintelligible] wasn’t changed yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: The crematorium is there just about like it was, and the monuments are there, and the prison camp is gone.</span> <span id="s590">There is grass, and what-have-you.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s592">I heard that Dachau looked like some sort of chalet, at this point.</span> <span id="s593">And I don't know if it was reconstructed that way in 1961 yet; it may have been a little bit later, where they really made it look fairly attractive.</span> <span id="s594">I don't know if you had that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No.</span> <span id="s596">I didn't go anyplace except the crematorium and the several monuments that are there where supposedly the ashes were spread.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: And at the time that you returned did you share the story with your family when they were there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s599">I showed them where I stood to take those pictures.</span> <span id="s600">The stench was so great that....</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Do you remember the odor when you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: ...that I just went up to the window and snapped the picture and got out as fast as I could.</span> <span id="s603">Some of them were taken in those rooms and those stacks of bodies were taken from a window and the door.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Do you remember the odor at the time when you went there the first time?</span> <span id="s605">Do you remember any odor at Dachau when you went there?</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: Oh, yes, I remember the odor.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: The stench of the bodies and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: But there wasn't as much considering the numbers of people there as you would expect.</span> <span id="s609">The thing that got me was that there wasn't any blood and all.</span> <span id="s610">Of course, these people just died and all of their arteries were intact.</span> <span id="s611">One of the pictures I have there is of a German guard that was killed the dav we came through, and he bled; he's on top of the stack and there’s blood.</span> <span id="s612">You can see blood there.</span> <span id="s613">I noticed how fat he was and how much he bled.</span> <span id="s614">I took a picture of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: So you were really able to relate to your family, when you returned there, what you saw the first time as opposed to what you were seeing then.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yes.</span></p></body></html>
