Q: OK.</span> <span id="s12">Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In Baden-Baden, Germany.</span> <span id="s14">Q: And when?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Uh June 7th, 1914.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Tell me about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: My father owned a pharmacy in Baden-Baden, and he and my mother had three children.</span> <span id="s18">I have one sister who lives here in New Jersey, and my older sister passed away a few years ago in Majorca.</span> <span id="s19">We had a good youth, a very nice up-bringing.</span> <span id="s20">I went to primary school for three years.</span> <span id="s21">I, after that I entered the Gymnasium for nine years and received baccalaureate.</span> <span id="s22">By that time, the political situa...the political situation in Germany wasn't too rosy and there was a lot of unemployment.</span> <span id="s23">I was supposed to enter a pharmacy in the province as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s24">But when I was ready, they were not in a position to accept me anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Because the uh Nazis, while not in power yet, had quite some influence and everybody was afraid to accept a Jewish apprentice.</span> <span id="s26">As far as my Jewish upbringing, there was none.</span> <span id="s27">My parents were quite assimilated.</span> <span id="s28">And Jewish religion, never.</span> <span id="s29">We just... nothing there was said.</span> <span id="s30">And I became more aware of my religion only through the Nazi revo...uh Nazi... Not revolution.</span> <span id="s31">I mean, when they came into power.</span> <span id="s32">In 1932, after matriculation, I left my home town for Switzerland.</span> <span id="s33">We had had an exchange program with a family in the town of Nyon on the Lake of Geneva, and there were still about six weeks that they owed us.</span> <span id="s34">So I spent six weeks there.</span> <span id="s35">And after that, through some friends and through a office of the League of Nations, I got a job on a farm in uh Switzerland, on a..</span> <span id="s36">.</span> <span id="s37">behind the city, the town, of Vevey, on Lake...on the Lake of Geneva.</span> <span id="s38">It was tough times there.</span> <span id="s39">If I had had the money to go back home after I had arrived there, I would probably have turned around and gone back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Instead of that, I had to get up about five o'clock in the morning to start cleaning the pig's sty and then the cows and then the horses.</span> <span id="s41">And everybody spoke French and I didn't know that much French when I got there, but I quickly had to learn whether I liked it or not.</span> <span id="s42">I stayed there for about two months and then the farmer sent me with a..</span> <span id="s43">.</span> <span id="s44">with one man and about twenty cows up in the Alps where he had meadows and I stayed there for another two months 'til the beginning of September of '32.</span> <span id="s45">Yeah, 1932.</span> <span id="s46">By that time, uh my father had been able to get me an apprenticeship in a mechanical factory in the Black Forest which was owned by friends of his.</span> <span id="s47">I went through a two year apprenticeship, commercial apprenticeship, the end of which I had to go through an examination for commercial assistance by the Chamber of Commerce.</span> <span id="s48">Fortunately, during that time, the after (ph) the Nazis were in command in 1934.</span> <span id="s49">But that examination took place during the time these people were not allowed to wear their uniforms due to the RÃ¶hm affair, when Hitler had his... one of his assistants killed and I passed, therefore I could pass that examination and I stayed for another year or so as an employee in that factory.</span> <span id="s50">Then in December 1935, I was informed that due to my status as a Jew they were not able to keep me.</span> <span id="s51">I had to leave by the end of the year.</span> <span id="s52">I went skiing the beginning of December, and hurt my hand; so I left three weeks early.</span> <span id="s53">Went to Frankfurt and tried to find some work there which was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Even a friend of my father's who owned his own bank was not allowed to employ me even without pay.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Tell me what else it was like in 1935, in Frankfurt, for a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Well, you couldn't go any place but to Jewish organizations.</span> <span id="s57">There were lots of young people who had not given up hope that things would change in Germany and we went out together.</span> <span id="s58">We had meetings together, and one of the things I recall is that on Mardi Gras of 1936, at a time when I already knew I was going to leave for Greece, I went out in the streets with some friends and the public was all heppped up and they were all in good humor and playing around and they were stopping cars on the main street and uh trying to lift them up.</span> <span id="s59">There was nothing bad involved 'till suddenly a contingent of SS men came from the side streets with their swords out and just started hitting indiscriminately anybody who was in the street.</span> <span id="s60">I got a cut in my winter coat at that time because I wasn't running fast enough.</span> <span id="s61">Otherwise I did not spend much time in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s62">Before that, in the little town of Hornburg (ph) in the Black Forest where I spent my working time in a factory where I was employed, things were different.</span> <span id="s63">During the winter when the only the people of that little town were there, I didn't have much trouble, but this was a place that had many guests came up in the Black Forest in the summer for vacations and so and I learned soon to keep by myself because on two occasions I was once thrown out of a coffee shop where I was sitting with people from the factory and once was just beaten uh up on the street which cost me fortunately only my glasses.</span> <span id="s64">I even was asked to apply to come, to enter the German Armed Forces because I was in the age group that was called up and the uh mayor of the town of Hornburg insisted that I go through the formalities because he thought I was such a good man that they needed me, but they after they had I had a physical examination and they got the uh information about my parents and ancestors I got the information that they could very well do without me.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Then, to go back to Frankfurt, I had applied to leave for Greece as a student in archeology since I had had uh my background with the Humanistic Gymnasium, knew the ancient languages and in addition to this my older sister had gone, had had the opportunity to go to Greece even earlier.</span> <span id="s66">After about two and a half months of efforts and a number of very uh uneasy meetings with officials in Frankfurt, I indeed got a visa, got a passport to go to Athens.</span> <span id="s67">I found out afterwards that at the same time I left, the Greek police for foreigners was informed that this guy is not really a student - he is a Jewish refugee and due to this information I had quite a bit of difficulty staying in Greece.</span> <span id="s68">But I arrived there in 19.</span> <span id="s69">.</span> <span id="s70">, in February, end of February of '36.</span> <span id="s71">Was met by my sister.</span> <span id="s72">After a nice journey, and I was quite elated to have left the Third Reich, my sister had made some friends in Athens.</span> <span id="s73">She was mainly giving language lessons there, and after some weeks, I got various jobs.</span> <span id="s74">I had brought a typewriter with me and a pair of skis.</span> <span id="s75">Nothing else.</span> <span id="s76">The pair of skis was to show that I was a student.</span> <span id="s77">I was not apt to forget my favorite sport.</span> <span id="s78">And, believe it or not, I did go skiing in Greece--in the Peloponnese--which was nice.</span> <span id="s79">I got various jobs in Greece and the mentality there of the people who employed me was such that they would trust me more than any of their other employees which was to my advantage.</span> <span id="s80">I worked in a technical office where we imported all kinds of electrical equipment from the rest of Europe.</span> <span id="s81">They considered very small as outside of Europe.</span> <span id="s82">I think at that time I worked for them for three years.</span> <span id="s83">Then in, after working for him which was actually part-time, I went in the late afternoon to a newspaper distributing office to - whom I had been recommended to and uh the way I, my first impression of that job was quite interesting.</span> <span id="s84">The uh owner of the (ph), which means (ph) newspaper agency, took me to the office of the foreign newspaper department and there behind the desk uh was a young man with not one but uh three signs that he was a member of the Nazi party and he talked to me in French.</span> <span id="s85">He never knew that I was German.</span> <span id="s86">He was, and he handed the department over to me because he had been called back to Germany he told me.</span> <span id="s87">He was already gone the next day and the boss and I were left with quite a mess because there were quite a number of subscriptions to German Nazi papers in Athens for Germans who lived in Athens, and when I started sending somebody around to collect subscription monies that according to the books they owned us, they had all been paid and the predecessor of mine evidentially had pocketed the money.</span> <span id="s88">I started the work in that department with quite a uh debt, and the only way after, during the two and one-half years I worked there we could eradicate that debt was by ordering lots of newspapers from the various provinces in Germany, five copies from this one, five copies from that town.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Naturally nobody would buy that stuff even, so we would distribute it to the various kiosks and when we got it back you cut the top off, send it back so that you didn't have to pay for it, and the rest of the paper was sold as uh, and we uh wegot credit for it and eventually we wiped out that debt which amounted in quite, to quite a - I think it was over 100,000 pounds.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: How did you come to go Crete?</span> <span id="s91">A: To Greece.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: To Crete, you were . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s94">In Greece, in Athens.</span> <span id="s95">That was all in Athens.</span> <span id="s96">Q: Yes, alright.</span> <span id="s97">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: My parents came - we brought my parents to Athens one year after I came and we uh, my father had some representation from a chemical factory who thought they could sell their pills in Greece but after, by the end of 1938 the Greek government wouldn't allow us anymore to renew our permit of residence in the country.</span> <span id="s99">They informed us that they knew from the German uh authorities that they would be very happy to welcome us back in Germany.</span> <span id="s100">We were not anxious.</span> <span id="s101">The four of us, my parents, my sister and I, we went from one foreign consulate to the other in Athens to try and get a place to uh go to.</span> <span id="s102">And this was quite difficult.</span> <span id="s103">We once thought we had a, we thought to go to Paraguay but when we went to buy steamship tickets, we found out that that consul was only an honorary consul, and wasn't supposed to give visas out and after some difficulty we got half our money back.</span> <span id="s104">Then thanks to my father's connection with the Free Masons - it's a masonic order in Athens - we found a man in the British Embassy who helped to get us out.</span> <span id="s105">His connection through the CID caused them to check our family tree.</span> <span id="s106">And they found--which we knew, which was correct--that my mother was related to Walter Rathenau, who had been the foreign secretary of the Weimar Republic after the First World War and who also was about the first victim of Nazi murder in 1923 already.</span> <span id="s107">They told us we could proceed any place in the British Empire we wanted to go to, provided we had the means to do so.</span> <span id="s108">Closest place was the island of Cyprus; but Cyprus required for anyone who came there one thousand pounds to show in cash.</span> <span id="s109">We didn't have that kind of money.</span> <span id="s110">So the British Ambassador in Athens caused them to reduce this amount to a thousand pounds for the whole family--for the four of us--which was very nice.</span> <span id="s111">The only drawback was we didn't have the thousand pounds.</span> <span id="s112">And I managed to go to the two main employers I had, and I borrowed from each one five hundred pounds in Greek money.</span> <span id="s113">So we put that on an account in Cyprus, and we were...we managed to go back to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s114">Half a year later, I could send them the money back.</span> <span id="s115">But that was uh a break we got, because without this help from the British Ambassador I don't know what would have happened.</span> <span id="s116">We arrived in Cyprus in the beginning of March of 1939.</span> <span id="s117">And in uh...in the town of Limassol, my father promptly got sick.</span> <span id="s118">We were stuck there in a small hotel for quite a while.</span> <span id="s119">After that we moved to the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia.</span> <span id="s120">I got a job in an import office, and my sister got a job in another...in a technical office also.</span> <span id="s121">But in September of '39, when Italy entered the war, I came to my office and I found a note in the typewriter: "Do not come back."</span> <span id="s122">Because business was dead; and besides, that he told me after he was not to employee enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s123">I then got work in a small sausage factory which had been bought by a couple of Austrian Jewish refugees.</span> <span id="s124">They needed somebody who spoke Greek and English, because neither of one did...uh of them did.</span> <span id="s125">And for some weeks, I sold sausage-- much to the embarrassment of my parents, who would never come to the store but who liked to eat the sausage I brought home.</span> <span id="s126">After that, thanks to the Commissioner in Nicosia, the British Commissioner, I got a job in the asbestos mines.</span> <span id="s127">They didn't know anything about asbestos was dangerous, and thank God it didn't do any harm to me.</span> <span id="s128">But uh I went up there.</span> <span id="s129">I worked in the bookkeeping department for, I think, it's only about a year and a half.</span> <span id="s130">And eventually the uh director of the mine put a house at my disposal, and my parents and my sister could come up there to stay with me.</span> <span id="s131">Because in the meantime, things had gotten worse politically.</span> <span id="s132">And uh when the Germans overrun Greece I think every refugee and every person who had arrived in...on Cyprus with German papers was interned.</span> <span id="s133">They opened an internment camp right next to the prison in Athens, for the men only.</span> <span id="s134">Women they left alone.</span> <span id="s135">And in that camp were mostly Jews--maybe about twenty real Germans who were kept strictly to themselves.</span> <span id="s136">Was not a very good time, because that we were staying in tents.</span> <span id="s137">It was uh... whenever a wind came up there was a lot of dirt in the air and we had to work out what we were going to eat every day.</span> <span id="s138">I was more or less in charge of that, again because I knew the languages and somewhere . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: They did not feed you?</span> <span id="s140">You had to...</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: No, well they told us what... "Here's what you get every week.</span> <span id="s142">You make your own menu."</span> <span id="s143">And I still have somewhere menus or a menu.</span> <span id="s144">I don't have it with me, but if I find it I'll make a copy.</span> <span id="s145">So that kept me busy.</span> <span id="s146">Besides that, they gave us a couple of packets of cigarettes every day.</span> <span id="s147">And due to the fact that my father was a heavy smoker, I stopped smoking at that time.</span> <span id="s148">He got my cigarettes.</span> <span id="s149">Uh after about a month in that tent camp, the authorities realized that that was not a good place to leave us because people got sick.</span> <span id="s150">And they moved the camp to a hotel up in the mountains of Greece.</span> <span id="s151">Beautiful place called [Berengaria (ph)].</span> <span id="s152">And it was naturally behind fence, wire fence; but otherwise it was just like a vacation.</span> <span id="s153">What I mean is there was a village nearby, and all the ladies rented rooms there to come and visit.</span> <span id="s154">And at the same time, the government started checking the individual papers of the people they had caught up in their net of internment.</span> <span id="s155">My father was one of the first to be released.</span> <span id="s156">And about three weeks later, I was let go.</span> <span id="s157">And I went back to my work in the asbestos mine.</span> <span id="s158">We all went back there, and . . .</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was Cyprus like...?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Cyprus was a beautiful place, actually.</span> <span id="s161">At that time, the British had about two hundred troops on Cyprus--which kept the peace between Turkish and Greek inhabitants.</span> <span id="s162">I saw quite a bit of Cyprus while moving around.</span> <span id="s163">There have beautiful beaches, and the uh city or the town of Nicosia had some amazing Gothic architecture in their churches...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: I guess what I'm asking--excuse me--is not so much physically what the island is like, but what was it like in wartime--under war conditions--for a Jew living in Cyprus.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Things were rationed, for one thing.</span> <span id="s166">And uh the Jews, Jewish refugees--thanks also to the internship--they got to know each other, and they drew together.</span> <span id="s167">There was no organization yet at that time.</span> <span id="s168">But that came a little bit later with the uh evacuation.</span> <span id="s169">But we knew quite a few people, and uh we attended uh services which was to some extent a first for me at that time.</span> <span id="s170">Naturally, after moving up to the asbestos mine I had no connection ...we had no connection.</span> <span id="s171">We were the only Jews there with the exception of the uh mine physician, who was a Russian man who had come in 1905 due to the pogroms and who didn't admit to anybody that he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s172">Also did not come on the evacuations.</span> <span id="s173">But he and my father got friendly, so... And I had no time to be friendly.</span> <span id="s174">After all, there were also rules that after work, after sundown, none of us were allowed to leave the house.</span> <span id="s175">That was strict instructions, and uh it was known in community in the asbestos mine.</span> <span id="s176">So we stayed, and we had a radio.</span> <span id="s177">That was that.</span> <span id="s178">I only...there was only one store in the whole place, and I went there to buy our ration.</span> <span id="s179">Every week we had a half a pound of butter, which my father got because at that time nobody thought that there was anything wrong with eating butter.</span> <span id="s180">And we were quite lonely.</span> <span id="s181">I wrote during that time in German a treaty [NB: treatise] on my stay in Athens.</span> <span id="s182">One of these days, I might translate it.</span> <span id="s183">And we stayed there until June '41.</span> <span id="s184">We, naturally, knew what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s185">But Cyprus, being away from everything, we did not pay too much attention until the Nazis invaded Crete.</span> <span id="s186">They got the island of Crete without any difficulties.</span> <span id="s187">And then, suddenly, the good inhabitants of Cyprus became very anxious to learn German.</span> <span id="s188">Under the leadership of their bishop, a man Makarios--who afterwards what became President of the Greek part of Cyprus--they became very uh friendly towards the expected German invasion.</span> <span id="s189">And we were worried.</span> <span id="s190">Then uh in June of '41, my father got a wire that he should be ready for evacuation within four days in the capital, Nicosia.</span> <span id="s191">He had no money saved, because we were living from hand to mouth on whatever little money I made.</span> <span id="s192">So in this twen...within twenty-four hours, we had a big sale of all our belongings.</span> <span id="s193">We found that for evacuation we only...we are allowed to take two pieces of luggage each, and no more luggage than each one of us could carry.</span> <span id="s194">Now we...during the short hours, we had to decide what to pack.</span> <span id="s195">We had to try and buy some pieces of luggage from people there, and we had to be so that we had some money in our pockets.</span> <span id="s196">We then proceeded to Nicosia.</span> <span id="s197">And there, the government had accepted two or three--I don't recall whether it was two or three men--as officers, executive officers, of the Jewish evacuation of Cyprus.</span> <span id="s198">With these people--and they were attorneys--started an organization.</span> <span id="s199">Since I had nothing better to do, I helped out there.</span> <span id="s200">They didn't, because they didn't speak Greek.</span> <span id="s201">And we had a little office, and registered everybody who was ready to be evacuated.</span> <span id="s202">And they had to come there with their pieces of luggage to show that what it was, and that they could actually carry it.</span> <span id="s203">And I recall one very sad episode, when a strong man came in there with rather heavy-looking pieces of luggage and the uh person behind the counter who registered him had some doubts whether he could really carry these pieces.</span> <span id="s204">And he uh...well, he was very uh brilliant man.</span> <span id="s205">He lifted both pieces.</span> <span id="s206">"Yeah, I can do it!"</span> <span id="s207">Dropped dead.</span> <span id="s208">That was quite a shock for all of us.</span> <span id="s209">And people were careful.</span> <span id="s210">We uh...we just managed the next day or two days later to bury him.</span> <span id="s211">And, even the afternoon of that day, we were all put on buses to Famagusta.</span> <span id="s212">The evacuation of the Jewish community of Cyprus had started.</span> <span id="s213">In Famagusta, they put us on a small boat.</span> <span id="s214">We were about five hundred people--men, women and children.</span> <span id="s215">There was a lot of complaining and crying.</span> <span id="s216">People had to leave their uh groves, orange groves.</span> <span id="s217">People had been living for many...not just since the Nazis came, but from even from earlier years on Cyprus.</span> <span id="s218">But we all had our lives even so we didn't have much else.</span> <span id="s219">And that small boat went in zig-zag through the Mediterranean at night to Jaffa [Arab: Yafa, or Heb: Yafo].</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: What boat was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: It was an English...English boat.</span> <span id="s222">A British boat.</span> <span id="s223">It was probably...it was not a passenger ship.</span> <span id="s224">Just whatever boats they could find there for...where we were stacked like herring.</span> <span id="s225">Sardines is better.</span> <span id="s226">And we uh got to Jaffa.</span> <span id="s227">Made us disembark, and immediately put on buses and taken to Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s228">It was strict curfew and blackout.</span> <span id="s229">In Tel Aviv, the uh Jewish Agency and the Histadrut had prepared for our arrival.</span> <span id="s230">They had set up a camp outside and there were tents and there were.</span> <span id="s231">The first time I saw that they had dug air shelter, zig-zag uh shelter, cut out.</span> <span id="s232">And we stayed there for a night.</span> <span id="s233">And the next night, they...my parents and my sister and I were among the groups that was taken to homes of individual Histadrut members.</span> <span id="s234">Right off Ben Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s235">There were air raids nearly every night.</span> <span id="s236">One air raid, I think the only one where there were actually people uh caught - there were over two hundred and fifty people killed in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s237">Amongst them, a friend my father afterwards tried to find.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">During these air raids we would meet.</span> <span id="s239">Because my father was staying with one family, my mother with another, my sister with another, and I with another.</span> <span id="s240">In the evening, everybody went downstairs in the air raid...air raid shelter, and everybody along came.</span> <span id="s241">That was when we met, at night.</span> <span id="s242">Was scary so...because we knew that people actually had died during the week or so before.</span> <span id="s243">We didn't stay with these people too long, because when my father discovered that his friend had been killed he also heard from the widow and who had immediately left Tel Aviv for Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s244">She sent my father the key to their apartment.</span> <span id="s245">And we stayed for the rest of our stay in Tel Aviv in a beautiful apartment on Gordon Street.</span> <span id="s246">The only...the drawback was that the lady during that time started selling off her furniture.</span> <span id="s247">So every day there was less there.</span> <span id="s248">Eventually we just had mattresses and our luggage.</span> <span id="s249">But from June through the end of November, to the middle of November, we stayed there.</span> <span id="s250">During that time, the uh British government paid everyone who was a member of the Cyprus evacuation, paid them every two weeks enough money to live on.</span> <span id="s251">But they were not allowed to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">They had to present themselves every two weeks at an office in the Jewish Agency to get the money.</span> <span id="s253">Quite a few vanished.</span> <span id="s254">They had family in Palestine, as it was then, and decided, "Well, goodbye."</span> <span id="s255">They stayed there, and that was that.</span> <span id="s256">They...in the meantime, the English decided what to do with the rest.</span> <span id="s257">There were about three hundred and fifty or so left, and they divided us up into two main groups.</span> <span id="s258">One to go to what was then Nyasaland [Now: Malawi], and the other one Tanganyika [Now: Tanzania].</span> <span id="s259">So we knew our destiny.</span> <span id="s260">And there again, we subdivided the Tanganyika group to those who were going to stay in a camp there, and others who would stay in a small group in a town--which was what we selected.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">And we were told that we would have to proceed to the town of Mwanza, M - W - A - N - Z - A, on the shore of Lake Victoria.</span> <span id="s262">That was a long way off, because the trip has to...had to be arranged.</span> <span id="s263">So in middle of November, finally, we were told everything was fine.</span> <span id="s264">We got travel papers showing that we were...we had no other papers, and that we were to proceed to Tanganyika.</span> <span id="s265">And one hundred and seventy of us--that was the group to go to Tanganyika-- were put on a train from Tel Aviv to Cairo.</span> <span id="s266">At that time, there was a rail line.</span> <span id="s267">And they put us up in a hotel in Cairo...</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Whoa.</span> <span id="s269">Let's not move quite so fast, OK?</span> <span id="s270">There are a hundred and seventy of you.</span> <span id="s271">Uh, you are put on a train at Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s272">Uh, describe that train ride for us, would you, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Very comfortable.</span> <span id="s274">There were both enough room... I don't remember how many carriages, but it was a passenger train.</span> <span id="s275">And uh Cairo...in Cairo, they put us on buses to a hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What was Cairo like at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Very busy.</span> <span id="s278">It was full of soldiers--Australians, New Zealanders, British.</span> <span id="s279">And uh the uh people who received us there tried to show us as much of Cairo as possible.</span> <span id="s280">We never knew whether this was a one-day stop there or two-day stop there.</span> <span id="s281">As it turned out, we were there for six or seven days.</span> <span id="s282">And we had an opportunity to visit the pyramids, to see the uh mosques, and to see the amazing traffic in Cairo.</span> <span id="s283">I recall the flat uh vehicles, drawn by horses or mules, where black-dressed women were sitting in rows just on the flat vehicle.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">That was some rich Egyptian, I guess, uh took his women for a ride.</span> <span id="s285">Otherwise, I don't recall much of Cairo.</span> <span id="s286">It's a picturesque city.</span> <span id="s287">But we were constantly worried, "What next?"</span> <span id="s288">They finally took us to the railroad station again, and took us by train--passenger train.</span> <span id="s289">It was a special train, as far as I remember, to Port Taufiq, on the Red Sea, on the exit of the canal.</span> <span id="s290">And there, we were put on a Belgian passenger ship that was full of Australian and New Zealand troops on vacations.</span> <span id="s291">They were...we had one part of the ship; but naturally there was...we were mingled.</span> <span id="s292">It was...it was still blackout, which made it difficult to move around on that ship.</span> <span id="s293">It was big ship.</span> <span id="s294">And after one day, their captain, I guess, thought it was...we were far enough away from the German and Italian planes.</span> <span id="s295">So he lifted the blackout for a few hours.</span> <span id="s296">Because then came the news of the Japanese uh attack on Pearl Harbor.That was that day.</span> <span id="s297">And we were all shivering in our boots, because we expected that they had nothing better to do but on the way out of the Red Sea there would be some Japanese ship waiting to sink this boat.</span> <span id="s298">Because it was a military transport, after all.</span> <span id="s299">And we were scared.</span> <span id="s300">The blackout was enforced more than ever.</span> <span id="s301">We went through the Red Sea.</span> <span id="s302">We went past Mombasa [NB: in Kenya], and the boat stopped for one day to Dar-es-Salaam.</span> <span id="s303">From Dar-es- Salaam, right without stop on a train to uh...that train that goes through Tanganyika to Tabora, and from there to Mwanza.</span> <span id="s304">In Tabora, those members of the evacuation who were to stay in a camp left.</span> <span id="s305">They had established a camp in a former German prison in Tabora.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Tanganyika, naturally, had been a German colony before the First World War.</span> <span id="s307">The rest of us went to Mwanza.</span> <span id="s308">We arrived there a few days before Christmas in 1941.</span> <span id="s309">And there were about twelve...between twelve and seventeen--I don't recall exactly how many--we were put up in a hotel there.</span> <span id="s310">There was only one hotel owned by a very nice and fat Greek man, who was glad find somebody who spoke Greek.</span> <span id="s311">And the District Commissioner of the Lake Province of Tanganyika showed up next day to assure everybody that they uh they would continue paying everybody for as long as the war lasted, if necessary, but urging us to see if we couldn't find some work.</span> <span id="s312">And there were indeed people, and I remember one couple that did not look for work.</span> <span id="s313">They stayed in that hotel for five years.</span> <span id="s314">They were paid for five years.</span> <span id="s315">And, naturally, when the war was over, the uh British government was obligated to bring everybody who wanted to back to Cyprus.</span> <span id="s316">Now, I couldn't stand doing nothing.</span> <span id="s317">And thanks to the man who owned the hotel, I got some work in the recruiting office of a gold mine in Mwanza.</span> <span id="s318">They had...they sent recruiters out to the various chiefs and got people to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">And they came to the office where I was, and I had to give them tickets to go on a boat across Lake Victoria to the gold mine.</span> <span id="s320">That lasted about a month maybe, not much longer.</span> <span id="s321">After that one day I came back to, for lunch to the hotel and the Greek owner introduced me to a South African miner.</span> <span id="s322">He told me this man, this man has mining claims and he comes here every few weeks because he has to submit renewal applications for the claims to the Inspector of Mines who was located in Mwanza.</span> <span id="s323">But he told me the man had so much to drink he can't draw a straight line.</span> <span id="s324">Please help him.</span> <span id="s325">I helped him, drew him a map for as he told me of his mine, and before he left he told me I could come to the mine to work for him at I think it was ten pounds a month.</span> <span id="s326">Anyhow it was much more than I was earning at that other place.</span> <span id="s327">It was about a hundred miles south of Mwanza.</span> <span id="s328">And he gave me some money, which he thought at that time was payment for my efforts; but he didn't say that.</span> <span id="s329">He 1 December 7, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">said, "Here.</span> <span id="s331">Whatever you need, when you...when you are ready to come."</span> <span id="s332">And he was very surprised when I showed up at his mine.</span> <span id="s333">Before that, he had gotten so drunk not knowing what he did himself that I had to run away from him.</span> <span id="s334">He was, in his mind, under the impression that I was chasing his wife.</span> <span id="s335">And was quite an experience.</span> <span id="s336">I had to run away.</span> <span id="s337">And he was drunk, but he wasn't drunk enough to give up the chase.</span> <span id="s338">And...but finally, he did so.</span> <span id="s339">And uh the next day, he was all sorry and full of excuses.</span> <span id="s340">And I went to the District Commissioner and said, "Look here, what kind of man is that?</span> <span id="s341">He wants me to work for him.</span> <span id="s342">But if that's what happens, I'm scared."</span> <span id="s343">But the uh District Commissioner, whose name I have somewhere, uh assured me that I needn't worry.</span> <span id="s344">And the same of the Police Commissioner there.</span> <span id="s345">So I used the paper that that miner had given me to obtain a truck from the...from one of the Indian merchants in the town, and I set out for the mine.</span> <span id="s346">I stayed in the mining area for...'til September of 1946.</span> <span id="s347">I did about everything connected with diamond mining, except the actual digging.</span> <span id="s348">It sounds very interesting now, but was tough in the heat and long hours.</span> <span id="s349">Eventually I got malaria.</span> <span id="s350">I got Black Water Fever.</span> <span id="s351">Ended up in the hospital in Mwanza with Black Water Fever, and a friendly doctor told me only about twenty-five percent of Europeans who get Black Water Fever survive.</span> <span id="s352">Fortunately, I was amongst the twenty-five percent.</span> <span id="s353">In the meantime, my father had been able to get a job in his profession as pharmacist, in Mwanza, at the hospital.</span> <span id="s354">He was in charge of the pharmacy of the hospital, and he also was in charge of the distribution of medications for the whole province.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: What was life like for the Jews as a group there?</span> <span id="s356">What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: They were all by themselves, at least in Mwanza.</span> <span id="s358">There was no connection.</span> <span id="s359">There was one family we visited - a man who uh had lived there for many years, who was an archeologist.</span> <span id="s360">He studied the native tribes for the British government.</span> <span id="s361">And he showed me very proudly where he...he and his idiosyncracies are mentioned in a book by Hemingway.</span> <span id="s362">But otherwise, there was another...the financial officer of the province also was Jewish.</span> <span id="s363">But he kept away from refugees, and he uh went on vacation whenever there was a Christian holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: You... We have a couple of minutes left.</span> <span id="s365">Uh, tell me, you said you were there until 1946.</span> <span id="s366">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What did you do in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: In uh...by 1946, a very very distant relative here in the States had provided an affidavit for me.</span> <span id="s369">And I went from uh the mine to Nairobi, to the American consul, got everything done and I had then to proceed to Dar-es-Salaam to arrange for an exit visa from Tanganyika.</span> <span id="s370">That was my first flight ever--in an airplane that wasn't bigger than a taxicab.</span> <span id="s371">And it was...the uh pilot was a kind of bush pilot.</span> <span id="s372">He went up and down, until I had to hold on to the paper cup.</span> <span id="s373">He wanted to show us all the wildlife around Kilimanjaro.</span> <span id="s374">Was interesting, but when he landed in a place where you had to land in between and one of the tires went.</span> <span id="s375">After telling us that we were lucky to be alive, the pilot took us to the one and the only hotel in that small place.</span> <span id="s376">And we had to stay there for hours in the heat.</span> <span id="s377">Air conditioning was unknown in Tanganyika at that time, at least.</span> <span id="s378">In the evening, another plane was flown in by the East African Airline and brought us to Dar-es-Salaam.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: When did you get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: December of '41. '</span> <span id="s381">46.</span> <span id="s382">Sorry.</span> <span id="s383">I was on the first boat that brought passengers from East Africa to Canada, actually.</span> <span id="s384">And the trip from the mine to New York took exactly two months.</span> <span id="s385">I had my last attack of malaria while the boat was stopped in Bermuda.</span> <span id="s386">I didn't see much of Bermuda at that time.</span> <span id="s387">Then they went to uh St. John in New Brunswick; and there the line decided the Castle (ph) line decided to send us by train to New York, where one of my sisters was living.</span> <span id="s388">And that was the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Alright.</span> <span id="s390">I thank you very much.</span> <span id="s391">Uh, and I appreciate your coming today.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s393">The thing that uh bothers me somewhat, it all now sounds like a travellog.</span> <span id="s394">It wasn't.</span> <span id="s395">It was to some extent a very scary uh trip.</span> <span id="s396">But we survived...</span></p></body></html>
