I know that because we have decided that whoever survives wherever, our contact is people we know, distant relatives in Palestine – at that time Palestine, Erat Israel, and there was – no one appeared except myself.</span> <span id="s27">I learned about wit – what happened to the others here and there, through other people at one time witnessing.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Could you describe little bit more th – you said that it was a large family, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: – could you describe th – your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A: My grandmother, grandfather, it looked to me like my f-family have lived many generations in the city, but this probably is a child’s perception.</span> <span id="s32">Maybe it was the first generation; to me it was people who were settled there from who knows when, en antiquity.</span> <span id="s33">Where my grandfather, my grandmother had Alimarat(ph) and Hannah.</span> <span id="s34">Hannah who had seven sons.</span> <span id="s35">My father was the oldest, Shmuel(ph), and – and then there were still two daughters.</span> <span id="s36">So, nine children all together, then older, extended family, the spouses and my cousins.</span> <span id="s37">And I am aware of many other names, from letters, photographs, occasional visits from out of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Well, d-do – do letters that you still have today, or those are the letters that you remember from the pre-war time?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: No, I think too many times I was, like I had to undress and throw all my – whatever I had and start from the beginning with – with nothing from before.</span> <span id="s40">I have a picture of my family, it survived – it survived in someone’s hands in Palestine, and I think that I have it on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Oh, oh, that’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Myself, there were two brothers, much older, and I.</span> <span id="s43">They perished as partisans, and a book depicts what they were doing, a book which was published in New York, that was “From the Forest.”</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: So where – where were they, as partisans?</span> <span id="s45">Wh-What region?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">A: Originally – well, I just know that it was – they were in an area which was a – a part of Poland once, taken over by the – by the Russians.</span> <span id="s47">The Russians put them on a train, that’s what I learned from others, because they register to come back, the Russians considered this a risky element of people, because they want to go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s48">They wanted to go back to Germany to fetch my parents and I.</span> <span id="s49">But all that train was sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s50">Would they have stayed, they would maybe survived.</span> <span id="s51">As it is they ran away from the train, into the forest, hiding from the Russians, starting to fight the Germans, even before the – officially the partisan organization was – was known, or whatever – ever ge – organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: So someone survived, who co –</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: One person su-survived, consider that, and he was later able to write about that, and that’s – that’s how I learned that my brothers didn’t die in – in the conditions I experienced, that they were fighting til the end.</span> <span id="s54">And this is the one [indecipherable] that I can accept.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: So what – what is your recollection of – what was – what was your father and your mother doing, what were they doing before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: My – my father was a – a merchant, and my mother was home.</span> <span id="s57">We – I think my parents had to be careful with money, those were the times, and it was very often coming up when I heard that they were worrying about tuition to – for me to continue education.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Well, he was – your father was a merchant?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: D-Do you recall what was he dealing in?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Oh, he dealt for the area, I think, the soap maida,(ph) cosmetics of maida(ph).</span> <span id="s62">At another – at another time, my grandparents had the wholesale grocery store, and for awhile my parents were running also a similar store on the same street.</span> <span id="s63">My brothers were – my oldest brother was in a hafshara(ph) in Rovno.</span> <span id="s64">And he was slated to go to – to Israel.</span> <span id="s65">Shell sided, lost his glasses in one of the battles and couldn’t see any more, was one of the first killed as a result.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s67">So, he was already in that area, in Volhynia, in Rovno before the war, so this was –</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: He – he – he – he – yes, he was.</span> <span id="s69">But in the meantime he came to Sieradz during the time they – th-the picture which I had was taken, this was the occasion.</span> <span id="s70">And when the war broke out, the family was together in Sieradz.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Mm-hm, so your brothers as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: My brothers as well.</span> <span id="s73">This is – we were living Sieradz, as close to the German border.</span> <span id="s74">We were advised to go to a forest in Zduńska Wola, six kilometers away to avoid gas attacks, that’s how World War I finished, and this was the big fear.</span> <span id="s75">But the Germans have advanced – this was supposed to be an outing of a few hours, daylight only, and at night we’ll return.</span> <span id="s76">The Germans moved so quickly that we couldn't go back, only we had to continue and march to Zduńska Wola.</span> <span id="s77">We’re there when – when Zduńska Wola was attacked by bombing and two of my grandparents died.</span> <span id="s78">We were just where they were sheltering in Zduńska Wola.</span> <span id="s79">My mother and I visited them, and we left, there was an alarm when we – noise, when we looked back, the house in which they were was demolished.</span> <span id="s80">They were in the basement, and it went all three floors, so they were the first dead in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And it – that happened in the very first days of September of 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: And – in days.</span> <span id="s83">I believe it was a Sunday and ah – I know that because somebody speculated that they probably wanted to catch as many civilians as possible in one place, and initially went after the churches or whatever.</span> <span id="s84">The roads were machine-gunned and bombed, and it was – they were – they were making the road impass – im – impassable.</span> <span id="s85">After one of those attacks, we couldn’t find my brothers.</span> <span id="s86">Nevertheless, they – they survived that first period, came to Sieradz, left for Russia to – to create a way for us to follow.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: And do you recall it was, you know, they were going to – to the Russian zone?</span> <span id="s88">It was planned with your parents when they still were in Sieradz?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, we came to Sieradz, but the Germans were living in – in our house.</span> <span id="s90">A – a relative left Lódz to go to Warsaw, family Eckstein(ph), I believe, from Poganica.</span> <span id="s91">And they have – we lived – we lived in their house.</span> <span id="s92">This was – the house was on Piotrkowska 82, which was the first street called Adolf Hitler Strasse, and the main street in Lódz.</span> <span id="s93">And the first street to be cleaned of Jews.</span> <span id="s94">So we were put into the ghetto at the very beginning, as it started, I don’t remember the date, was it September, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I – I just have few more questions that want to fill up –</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Specific, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: – with – with the – with your pre-war time, and then please don’t – because w-we – the point that we are at, it’s very good.</span> <span id="s98">Your family was – what – what language was spoken in your family, if you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: It – it was Yiddish and Polish.</span> <span id="s100">I was the – the exception.</span> <span id="s101">I was spoken only in Polish.</span> <span id="s102">I had a teacher, I had Mrs. Viner(ph) Tova(ph) whose husband was a historian, and she was a known Polish poet.</span> <span id="s103">And she thought that I have potential with rhymes and – or whatever, I think.</span> <span id="s104">And she actually talked to my parents to – not to involve me in another language, chayder or otherwise, in order to keep my Polish intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Do – do you still speak Polish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Do you s – you still speak Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah, I – I still s-speak Polish, yes.</span> <span id="s109">I don’t have much of an opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: So, going back to – to the be – the beginning of the war –</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: – if – if I recall what you said, and i – just to summarize, you – in the beginning you were told – th-the family was told to go into the woods outside of Sieradz –</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: – because of the fear of the – the gas attack –</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: – and you landed close to Zduńska Wola.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: And from there –</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Six kilometers.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: And from – and then Zduńska Wola was bombed, your grandparents were killed, and then you went back to Sieradz.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Not my grandparents.</span> <span id="s122">I believe to – this was the sister of my grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Uh-huh, the sister of your grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yeah, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s126">Who was in that house that was bombed?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: Only them.</span> <span id="s128">That’s – the people Zduńska Wola extended their hospitality to the people who came from Sieradz.</span> <span id="s129">So the family that came was in different places, depends who seen you, or who volunteered and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And from there you went back to Sieradz?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: Oh no, not yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: No, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: From – from there we started to take ahead of the Germans.</span> <span id="s134">Terrible exposure, right away people killed, maimed, horses and the deaths – those are circumstance on which my brother and us separated and couldn’t find each other.</span> <span id="s135">And we continued that way just ahead of the Germans, til Warsaw.</span> <span id="s136">And we went through the bombardment of Warsaw, at which point th – a German unit rounded up the men and – young men and men in general, and was starting to marching them back in the direction of Lódz.</span> <span id="s137">Who – already in that early date, who cannot – who couldn’t keep up, was shot and left on the side of the road in a rainy ditch.</span> <span id="s138">My mother and I separated.</span> <span id="s139">She was on the left ditch, I was on the right ditch, in order to facilitate faster kind of search, if between the killed there is our father, you know, we – we met the father when we caught up with – with the main group of men.</span> <span id="s140">So – so, you know, it – it didn’t finish with that first trek, to [indecipherable] if anything it was an – the beginning of a – a harrowing experience.</span> <span id="s141">The people in one of the places were Jews who got the Germans somehow to agree to feed the people.</span> <span id="s142">I don’t remember what – what town it was.</span> <span id="s143">A cow was slaughtered and – and everyone was fed, including us, children, family and so on.</span> <span id="s144">And we continued – and I don’t know where we continued because I begged a German soldier to allow my father not to continue, with my few words of German.</span> <span id="s145">I went in the house [indecipherable] and – and he allowed my father to stay in one of those places as we move on, so I don’t know what happened to the main group.</span> <span id="s146">But my father remained, and that’s when we returned to Sieradz to find the Germans in our house.</span> <span id="s147">That’s when we came to Lódz and found ourselves in – in a get – a ghetto life.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: In Piotrkowska Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s150">As a matter of fact, wh-what’s happening now, I don’t think that I – that I ever put it together in sequence, there – there are always scraps of memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Well, you just put in sequence, so that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: And – and – and here you – here you – you –</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: – this – this is perfect.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: – asked me in sequence, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: So that’s – I – I-I think that this is very clear now that we have that in sequence –</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Yes, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: – cause this is important.</span> <span id="s158">So, probably at the end of September, you landed in the – Lódz in – in Piotrkowska, would you agree with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I didn’t read, or I didn’t read much at all, and they just gave me – so, I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s160">I know that when the ghetto – when the people with the ghetto things started, and the Germans came, and to – and to speed up the process shot a number of people on Piotrkowska, where we were, we didn’t stay around.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s162">You were already in the ghetto, so that means –</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: No, no, we were – we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: Still on the –</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: – we moved to the ghetto, but we were between the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s167">Because the – the creation of the ghetto was in – around March of 1940, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: Ah, I – I thought in – I thought that maybe we were – we were there a little bit before, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Mm-hm, okay.</span> <span id="s170">And you do remember the moving to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I remember the moving of the ghetto, and things which emanated from – my very life was saved at one point because of us staying on Piotrkowska 82.</span> <span id="s172">But this is – this is further in this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s174">So it’s – so, around March of 1940, you are already in the ghetto, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Do you recall where you lived in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s178">We first got the house on Gnieznnienska.</span> <span id="s179">It will be a handful for you, Gnieznnienska, yeah.</span> <span id="s180">Gnieznnienska – what language is my answer?</span> <span id="s181">Gnieznni – Gnieznnienska 29.</span> <span id="s182">This was near the wires.</span> <span id="s183">We were assigned – we were assigned a room, a one room not heated.</span> <span id="s184">Two beds, iron beds.</span> <span id="s185">And while the ghetto was being organized, and the houses were – were given – were kind of being distributed, which again played a role in my – another survival.</span> <span id="s186">Yeah, I was hesitant what I thor – whatever I would have, because it’s – it’s – it’s like cinema, you know, like – like something is going to happen, and – and – and in the last minute something turns – turns it around.</span> <span id="s187">So only when I look at it I say, I would hardly believe so many things happening to so many people.</span> <span id="s188">Nevertheless, when I came to Israel on a – on a ship, we were maybe a thousand of boys, we were more or less, all of us had the similar story.</span> <span id="s189">Many instances of survival against odds.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So, when you landed at Gnieznnienska, that was your father, your mother and you, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: In this, and you were in that room.</span> <span id="s193">Do you recall whether you went to school at all when you lived on Piotrkowska?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: I was vaguely a-aware that there was school, but I haven’t been in – in the school i-in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s195">It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Also, before the ghetto, you were not in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: N-No, no, definitely not.</span> <span id="s198">There was only a very short time before –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: – before the ghetto between.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: So, do you recall anything from the early days o-of your life in the ghetto on Gnieznnienska?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s203">Yes, I do remember.</span> <span id="s204">This was not the only address.</span> <span id="s205">We had to move and move again.</span> <span id="s206">We were on Zgierska, right – right near the bridge.</span> <span id="s207">That’s Koscielny.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: But we were fortunate because on Gnieznnienska there was just a sidewalk and the wires [indecipherable] of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s210">And we had to be careful on this side of the sidewalk.</span> <span id="s211">Nobody was walking there, incidentally.</span> <span id="s212">Our window was [indecipherable] out, and also there was – there was ice on the walls, and I got something which they thought is – is tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s213">They checked me out, I didn’t have tuberculosis, but we – we – we were transferred in some way to that other housing on – on, I believe number – Zgierska number maybe 40, I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s214">A small time, for a short period.</span> <span id="s215">My – my next address after this was Rumkowski’s house.</span> <span id="s216">It was on [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: It was on Lagiewnicka.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Lagiewnicka [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: So, what – what were – were – were your parents employed, or were you employed in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: My – my f-father was employed, but he was getting weaker, and [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Do you recall where was he employed?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: He – he – he was that labor which they had, let’s say at one time say they – they had to oblige people to dig in for potatoes for the winter and things like that, as it was arriving.</span> <span id="s225">This – this was a very difficult experience for him, for all of us, because he felt this was killing him, because he knew the swelling was going up and up, which is very characteristic of the way people died in the ghetto, as you know.</span> <span id="s226">And I – I got a job on a kosa(ph), which means sewing leather things, or whatever, rucksacks and so on, on [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s227">And – and this – this provided enough funds to buy – to – to – to pay for our rations or whatever, which was – didn’t play around, but working – working I was – where I received the soup, which I was able to share with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: And your mother – your mother stayed home?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I – I cannot remember my mother being employed outside of home, I didn’t even think about that.</span> <span id="s230">But was she ever doing something?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: So, do you remember any – any contacts with your peers there, other people your age in the ghetto, or – or you were spending most of the time with the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yesterday I came here to show my family they – I have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s233">They are triplets, they are 14 years old now.</span> <span id="s234">And – and – and I was trying to get to – that’s what it is, I am – I am being – my head is being kidnapped to – to memories as I talk to you, and all at once, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: We were –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: I would – I am tal – talking about – about friends, and because I was here yesterday, and – and the magic happened all at once.</span> <span id="s237">I have a number from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s238">It’s the smallest number anyone ever seen, and there is a circumstance why the number is so miniature it’s hard to read.</span> <span id="s239">And I say, is this the number, B11104.</span> <span id="s240">And it’s one – because I couldn’t find it anywhere when I looked for my presence in Auschwitz, and – and then – and the person who was – who was helping me just did her little magic, and my number jumped out from Auschwitz so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s241">And – and then I ask, my very next thing, to answer your question in a roundabout way, was that I was looking for a boy named [indecipherable] who was where I was working on a kosa, the son of – of a well-to-do family before the war.</span> <span id="s242">A small, a haseek(ph), small but fierce, with a – with a sense of fairness, watching [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s243">If he can help it, unfair things will not be happening.</span> <span id="s244">He came with me when my father was – when my f – mother sent someone to say that my father is dying, he came with me, he stuck with me, I love him.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s246">He was smaller than I, that means I can’t be sure that he was killed.</span> <span id="s247">I – I’ve had – I had more – more people, needless to say.</span> <span id="s248">In addition to that, I got very close to a group of pe – of youngsters.</span> <span id="s249">Those who were in a – in an orphanage in the ghetto, a small orphanage.</span> <span id="s250">[indecipherable] well, it was on [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s251">It was somewhere in the Marysin, and those became my friends, those became the people I have spend my time on while I was with Dora, Dora Fuchs, as kind of protégée or whatever you call it.</span> <span id="s252">And have seen her – have seen them day by day, that they are – I remember them all, some of them I like.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: So this is the – so going back to the –</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: – sol – sort of a recap, your day in the ghetto in the beginning was yours and your father’s, you would go to your respective works.</span> <span id="s256">You would –</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: – go to working on your sewing machine –</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: – in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Oh, it’s not a machine, it’s two – two needles.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Two needles?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Oh, okay, cause you – oh, you said the kosa, I thought of the kosa was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Kosa [speaks Polish]</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: So you’re a man – you have quite a good recollections from that time, I can see.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: I didn’t know that, but you know, now there is nothing else but this team, so yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So – and your father started – do you recall when – when that was happening, when you’re start – your father started being very weak, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: I – til today I don’t have a – a good sense of days, dates, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s271">But was it in the summer, in the fall, in the winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh, wh-when my father died?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: It was not winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: It wasn’t winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: I remember the clothing in –</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: That’s what –</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: – I didn’t have to wear something, I just went off to kosa and – and hung with him, talked him [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: So, wh-when your – when your father passed away, was he buried at the cemetery?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: He was buried at the cemetery.</span> <span id="s281">Eventually my daughter Vivian here, she – she is practicing law in Israel because that’s what she wants – so, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: That – about the cemetery, the cemetery, and you said that your daughter is practice –</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yeah, tha-that – that cemeter – the cemetery, my daughter came with me to Poden(ph), and there was, I think, a Professor Hirsch, and he was supported by some outfit in – from Jerusalem, and the – the man in charge was Noah Fluke(ph), I don’t know if –</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Oh, I know Noah.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: Oh, you – you know, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I know him.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: He is – he is in charge of the survivors –</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: – organization in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s292">Anyhow, so – so he was involved and my daughter and I visited for three days in Poland, just to look for my father’s bones.</span> <span id="s293">At that time, although the – the Poles had an organization which they would find the bones and send, but most of the time those were just bones.</span> <span id="s294">And – but research was going on, and it was possible because when – when people were buried, th-there was – there was a little piece of wood put in.</span> <span id="s295">Right after the war, while the wood was still there undisturbed, some people came and put a standardized stone on this place with a name, which was a stone or – or – or cement, or whatever.</span> <span id="s296">And now it was possible to extrapolate from this na – the – a me – by measurement, who was buried, the rest.</span> <span id="s297">What – what was the – very, very, very sad t-to – to me, because when we were looking at those books, the people who were entering the books, their handwriting was getting slighter and slighter.</span> <span id="s298">Not enough strength to – to – to write with the – with the right pressure.</span> <span id="s299">So, that’s the time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: So the – were you able to –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: No.</span> <span id="s303">So you – you haven’t found this?</span> <span id="s304">There is a foundation in the city of Lódz –</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: – that is – that put together the new graves in the cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: I – I-I – I heard about that, yes, and I was in touch for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: And I took my daughter so he can continue the task, if I am not around.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: What – what – what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Shmuel(ph) Klein.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Shmuel(ph) Klein.</span> <span id="s313">And your mother’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Hiya(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Hiya(ph).</span> <span id="s316">Do you remember her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s319">Okay, so that let’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: And my mother’s, I think something like Feinstein, Eckstein or – or Epstein.</span> <span id="s321">And – but she lived in anoth-nother city.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Was she – was she also from Sieradz, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: She had a background in Konin.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Konin.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: But I don’t know if she was born in Konin.</span> <span id="s326">I – I tried to find her name, and so far did not.</span> <span id="s327">May I ask you a question which may not relate to the – the particular thing that we – I am – I am looking, an-and in touch with someone in Poland.</span> <span id="s328">In order to get the – the birthdays, the birthdays of – of the members of my family, I can’t – I don’t know when they died, but they perished in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s329">And I – and I want to – to engrave the names, since I am the only survivor and I will be the last there, but just what I would have done with my time during – and it’s difficult to get it from Poland, talking in Zduńska Wola when I was looking at the Yizkor thing lately, then [indecipherable] said the Zduńska Wola people have an Yizkor.</span> <span id="s330">But there is also a mention that they had to go to Sieradz, which was the capital city, or whatever, district city, in order to get it, and Sieradz told him, okay, you – you can do it for your Jewish community, which was, if you also do it for the Sieradz community.</span> <span id="s331">So – so a Zduńska Wola book may now be at a [indecipherable] but it’s slow digging, and I wonder –</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: We – we – you know, all the Yizkor books are available online through the New York Public Library.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: We also have in our library here, our Yizkor books, and I know that there is a – if I recall, it’s – there is a separate Yizkor book for – for Zduńska Wola, if I recall it well.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Y-Y-Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So, we can – we can revisit that, you know, aft – after our conversation here.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: This – this is – this is my hope, and – and a big part of my motivation in coming here, that in one of your departments this will be possible.</span> <span id="s338">I went to the consul and – and – twice in – in Montreal, and they tell me that I have to fill it out in triplicate and it will take at least one year, a-and what is the exact spelling, cause they will not be able to find.</span> <span id="s339">All – all those things I didn’t have available.</span> <span id="s340">And I met a consul in a social setting later on, I wrote it up, and he says, yeah, this is – this is like a big, big, big task.</span> <span id="s341">At the same time, Enjay(ph), a – a new Polish writer, got in touch with me about something, he wrote a book.</span> <span id="s342">Enjay(ph) Vart(ph), a new promising Polish writer and he said he – he loves Sieradz, and if I need something for – for him or whatever, he will – he will go, but I didn’t want to impose on him, because there may be a – really a bit of work to sort it out.</span> <span id="s343">He’s [indecipherable] book, I believe [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Mm-hm, yes, yeah, he is –</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: It’s on the way to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: He is a – quite a well known author these days.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Yeah, I don’t know if – he is so modest, like.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s349">But I-I think that this is – it’s quite possible to – to get that information</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah, that will – I will be grateful –</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: And I would suggest – I would suggest that we deal with this when we finish our conversation –</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: – here, and the – the – I’m pretty sure that we can help somehow, through whatever resources we have here in the museum, but also with – with – we have a very good contact with – with our colleagues in Lódz and the surrounding area, including Konin, etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I – I hope for it, to – to give you a picture of me now, I am a heart patient.</span> <span id="s355">I cannot get health insurance.</span> <span id="s356">But being a heart patient doesn’t stop me from windsurfing –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: – together with the youngsters, and so on.</span> <span id="s359">But at the same time, once you have a look at the number of operations or medications that I am taking that – that keeps me active, I’d say you don’t want to insure.</span> <span id="s360">The only exception in 11 years, was to come here.</span> <span id="s361">And that’s – I did it when all my family was around me with definite instruction that no resuscitation, no de – no – bu-but I am here, and – and I cannot count on – on endless [indecipherable] endless unreliability of me, yeah.</span> <span id="s362">So, if I – anything I can get, I will be grateful.</span> <span id="s363">It’s a special circumstance.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Definitely we – we can revisit that when – when we – when – after our conversation here.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: So the – this is the – but it – this is quite, I must say, uplifting, what you just said, that, with your windsurfing and all that thing.</span> <span id="s367">I wish that we all did such an active life – lead active life.</span> <span id="s368">Going back to the – to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: So, when your father passed away –</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: – you still continued working in the – in that leather shop?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: And you – you became the only provider at that time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: And your mother, how did she take?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: My mother was like – there was unlimited good will, but – on her part, but – but she was frail.</span> <span id="s378">And – and when – when eventually the aktion of 1942 took place in the ghetto, at that time we had to go to the – to the yard, and they were checking the apartments to make sure that they are empty.</span> <span id="s379">And – and once they – once they do – do that, and after separating children from grownups, taking away a number of the grownups, my mother wasn’t to be found any more.</span> <span id="s380">So, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: So, she was taken during the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: She was taken, but we knew where she was taken and [indecipherable] to Argenietska(ph) 34 - 36, I decided to join her.</span> <span id="s383">Took our bread rations that we had, I ca – teared off a bread for the two of us, and ha – which was the possession you take with you, or – or to give it to her, or whatever.</span> <span id="s384">She was in the window on the second floor, I saw her.</span> <span id="s385">And a feat I couldn’t duplicate ever since, whenever I see something that will be thrown directly on – in this direction, can I do it?</span> <span id="s386">I threw the bread and it came straight into her, and – and I [indecipherable] and she was worrying what will happen, talking to another woman, I heard every word.</span> <span id="s387">What will happen to Adusha(ph)?</span> <span id="s388">I was Adusha(ph), a diminutive.</span> <span id="s389">But what – what –</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: At that time you were 16 years old, 16 or 15, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s392">I – I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: So you were not taken to – with – with the other children, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: My – the – th-the wife of my uncle from Poganica was in the ghetto in – in the – in those listings of pop – and movements of population and so on.</span> <span id="s395">And I had a cousin my age, approximately, and I – we were – we were – we were changing dates.</span> <span id="s396">He was changing our dates all over the place, til I – til I got complicated with those dates, and – and used the date which is convenient.</span> <span id="s397">And it bothered me, because you know, like sometimes you have to say [indecipherable] and I wish that I rather wouldn’t be asked, and only after searching til I myself was this – searching, I – I – I knew that I can extrapolate, ho – wh-when did I go to school, and when did I this – so I narrow it down to 20 – 26 or 27, those – those two years, and – and then, because I – I also had the – a larger difference at the time which I was using, have – have documents, have life insurance on that and so on.</span> <span id="s398">And people told me just nobody is interested in your exact age, but – but I felt uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s399">So I am started thinking about now finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s401">So, have you ever tried to find your birth certificate in Sieradz?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Or in the – I – I don’t know for a fact whether any records of the Jewish community –</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: And it – it will – it will be –</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: – exist there.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: – I – I do – I don’t even know if May the 30th is an invented date or a real date.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: It didn’t help that at home somehow we didn’t celebrate birthdays or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Wa-Was your family religious at all, or completely –</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: In Mizrachi, a couple of times a year.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: My grandfather had a white beard.</span> <span id="s413">He was in the city, I believe, like for a time, counselor or whatever.</span> <span id="s414">Spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s415">It was quite a circus, because this is the obviously Jewish man with a kippah around head, opening up in the middle of Yiddish, and – and so on.</span> <span id="s416">And Polish to his different customers, and – and turning to me and – and talking in literary Polish, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: And you reme – tha-that’s your recollection from the pre-war time from Sieradz?</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: That’s quite a – so, back in the ghetto, so do you recall how far before the gaspara(ph), the – the September ’42, before your father passed away?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s421">Do I remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah, how far before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Oh, all – all the time, but at – at the very beginning of – of the – of the ghetto, there was optimism.</span> <span id="s424">We survived the shootings and the housings and so on.</span> <span id="s425">There was enough food.</span> <span id="s426">Dark bread, very heavy, oil, enough oil.</span> <span id="s427">Some kind of a kashatsing(ph), and – and a biting optimism that the war is – is just about to finish.</span> <span id="s428">And ther – there were no work, no factories organize yet, nothing.</span> <span id="s429">There was leisure.</span> <span id="s430">But there were cultural evenings, and – and the cultural evenings, every neighborhood – every neighborhood had the – had, you know, displaying whoever they can, someone on an instrument, or someone this.</span> <span id="s431">I was pushed to read my poetry, so I did.</span> <span id="s432">It’s – later on, it saved my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Do you – do you remember, or do you – were you able to recreate any of your poetry?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: I – I – I was asked so many – there was be-bef-before – before the war there was [indecipherable] or something, a newspaper, which also has a section for the young, and for teenagers, or whatever.</span> <span id="s435">So I was a couple of time published there.</span> <span id="s436">And – and I remember this better, but in – in the ghetto, I didn’t know what I was writing, but the adults made the [indecipherable] to what I was writing, and they made – th-they made like that they were thinking about that, as simple as there is, there is a peasant and – and he – he seed – seeds of all kind of things.</span> <span id="s437">When those seeds grow up [indecipherable] this particular evil, a gardener and – and that – well, you know, it’s – it’s things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Do you recall any of your poems from that time?</span> <span id="s439">Can you say –</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: Oh, I’m – I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: – I – you can say it in Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: – I am glad to forget them, because – because this was my ticket, that’s what – what kind of separated me from – from whatever, you know, like in school still, just – that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s443">At – but I – I wrote spontaneously, I read and wrote before the age of five, the age of five, just not learning formally, only reading – reading whatever I could on the street, or wherever.</span> <span id="s444">So, there will be expectation.</span> <span id="s445">It was getting quiet in the house when I was writing.</span> <span id="s446">Skindis(ph) schiven(ph), you know, I-I am going to this.</span> <span id="s447">And – and I – I – I wrote for to make an impression.</span> <span id="s448">And – and – and I thought the time just I don’t feel much, and that it’s phony and – and later when – when a language had to be changed, I once, twice, three times, I – I seized – I seized writing.</span> <span id="s449">But I have a – like everybody, sometimes everybody who is not educated, I have a creative streak, and that’s how I made a li-living.</span> <span id="s450">And – and design of automation systems, things which don’t exist yet.</span> <span id="s451">So – so I say yes, we – maybe every child is creative til public schooling knocks it out of him.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: But you – do you think that any of your writings survived in the – in the published form in the pre-war time you said about this Zev(ph) Nuardik(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Yeah, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: It’s the –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: I – I – I don’t know if he – I am coming from a town where people were born, they had s – they grew up, they had children, they had grandchildren, with an unfulfilled ambition, lifetime ambition to visit Lódz 60 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s456">You know, so some – some of that thinking, can something be taking out from a stack of newspapers which were – which – which was done – it would be nice.</span> <span id="s457">I – I wonder how I would feel about – no, at that time, I was – I was writing because I felt like it, and the results were there.</span> <span id="s458">But later on I – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: In the ghetto you were writing just to please –</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Y-Yes.</span> <span id="s461">In – in the ghetto that’s how I survived, because of that.</span> <span id="s462">I will be able to relate to you –</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Can you be more specific about this, cause i – you referred [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Y-Yeah, and it will also – i-it will also maybe fit the narration of – of what happened.</span> <span id="s465">On Piotrkowska 82, there was a – there was a family, their name was Krikos(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a known one, with international ties, travels to [indecipherable] and so on.</span> <span id="s466">Her husband was taken away and killed in a prison.</span> <span id="s467">She remained alone and my father and I, my mother, were there helping her with anything we could.</span> <span id="s468">I was – I was making sure that she has enough wood for the fireplace and things like that.</span> <span id="s469">Although it – it was just the beginning of the need of the wood.</span> <span id="s470">In the – in the ghetto, we met at the beginning and – and then all at once everything got to be a problem, distance was a problem, time, energy mostly was a problem, and so on.</span> <span id="s471">But she maintained – maintained contact with us, and aware to what’s going on in our lives.</span> <span id="s472">She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or manager in a Beschen(ph) – Beschen(ph) Kleider factory, one of six Beschen(ph) and Kleider factories.</span> <span id="s473">Now, when – when I brought the bread to my mother and I gave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed me, took me into – into an entrance of the house across Lagiewnicka and he beat me up.</span> <span id="s474">I was not supposed to be outside on the street.</span> <span id="s475">And now I think maybe he saved my life at that time, because if I would join them, I would be gone.</span> <span id="s476">But anyhow, it’s – I was very humiliated.</span> <span id="s477">I think this what hurt the most.</span> <span id="s478">And in the middle of the night, I went to – to M-Mrs.</span> <span id="s479">Krikosava(ph) where she lived in Marysin.</span> <span id="s480">A-And I told her what happened, and can she either li – arrange for me to join my mother, or – or get my mother out of that transport.</span> <span id="s481">I didn’t hear much – much about that, but when my mother was taking away, this was – this was my – oh, I t – I didn’t feel that – that I want to go on, especially.</span> <span id="s482">I wouldn’t spend energy, I didn’t have ener – I didn’t go for my bread ration, which is once in 10 days or something, which means death, dying, not – no – and di – she appeared.</span> <span id="s483">And she took me to her office as a runner, in order to have a soup a day, and to survive – to survive on that soup or whatever til – til the – til the time comes for the regular allocation of food.</span> <span id="s484">And now – now my story gets interesting, because as I was there, there was an inspection by the chief engi – by the chief of the Bescher(ph) and Kleider.</span> <span id="s485">To tell you also that when we came to the ghetto, there was somebody who was distributing the apartments.</span> <span id="s486">The one who was the manager of our area was a name by the name of Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph).</span> <span id="s487">Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) was now – was now in charge of those factories, and – and Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me, and kind of, I thought accusingly, he is ask me how do I – what do I know you f-from?</span> <span id="s488">And I say, from the cultural evenings, because he was attending.</span> <span id="s489">So he – he went ahead and I thought he is going to throw me out, he knows that this is fictitious, me being there, and eating the soup.</span> <span id="s490">But Krikosava(ph) followed, and together with other people, the manager, and she smiled to me, that me said nothing bad happened.</span> <span id="s491">And this continued for, I don’t know, two or three days.</span> <span id="s492">After – after which, the droshka(ph) firm with Rumkowski with the white horse, stopped in the front of the building, they called me out and they took me to Balucki Rynek.</span> <span id="s493">And Balucki Rynek was sitting Rumkowski, and on both side female secretaries and people, and so on, and – and a – and they kind of – Rumkowski a-asked me a few words, and the other people, and I z – I saw Anodinka(ph), the head, and I am being taken to the house of Rumkowski, which was divided into four apartments.</span> <span id="s494">And in apartment number one, was the apartment for Dora Fuchs.</span> <span id="s495">That’s the first time I learned about anybody like Dora Fuchs.</span> <span id="s496">Rumkowski, everybody sign – sings – Dora Fuchs was very often doing the things that they complained about, and that Rumkowski fought against, but this wasn’t known publicly, this I learned later.</span> <span id="s497">And Bernard Fuchs, her brother, who died in Connecticut just a few years ago, his wife is still alive, Irena.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: We – we do have an interview with – with him.</span> <span id="s499">You know, we conducted – he – he went by the name Bert Fleming.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Bert – Bert – Bert Fleming, yes, he found me.</span> <span id="s501">He found me when I was in Florida at one time, an-and …</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Okay, I’m sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: He – he married Irena at that time, and a place became available for me.</span> <span id="s504">And this was in Dora’s – in – in – in Dora’s apartment.</span> <span id="s505">So, although the house was – it was a small house, Rumkowski, Jusef(ph) Rumkowski, Eric Yakobovitch downstairs, Dora downstairs.</span> <span id="s506">Eric Yakobovitch had another house in Marysin, so did Rumkowski, or whatever.</span> <span id="s507">So, I was given the place, my clothes were thrown away for a good reason.</span> <span id="s508">And people came to take measurements for my shoes, for my pajamas, for my this, and so on.</span> <span id="s509">And all at once there was a – a – there was a – food, and – and – and – and books.</span> <span id="s510">And that’s how I came, because of Bolek(ph) being this – Rumkowski has given out a di-directive, I think, to the ones who are well-off in the ghetto should – should adopt one of the – one of the children, orphans, who remained orphans at that time.</span> <span id="s511">Dora was very much – very much aware of what’s the tone to give to herself and to her persona, and I was part of it, except I was in the house.</span> <span id="s512">In reality, I was mostly upstairs with Rumkowski, because there was a boy there, Stanislaw Stein(ph), not many people know about him, and when I heard the story what happened to Rumkowski when he went to the camp.</span> <span id="s513">They say that he – a brunette woman, younger woman, and a teenage boy, black hair, was on that open wagon, so I know yes, this must be the right version because this was Stanislaw, who wanted to come with Rumkowski.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Who was – who was Stanislaw, who was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Stanislaw?</span> <span id="s516">He’s a – he’s a – his parents were dead, he – he was – he was a very quiet guy –</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Was he your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: – I was his only friend, I think.</span> <span id="s519">Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q: He was your age?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: He was younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: And – and he had the Bar Mitzvah, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: But things happened – happened in the meantime, and I – I did – that’s not the first time that I did a self destructive thing, but I also did it at that time.</span> <span id="s526">It’s – it’s – it’s a small item, but it’s important because it took my train sideways towards not surviving.</span> <span id="s527">And this was when I – the first time when – when Dora came home from work, the same day, she passed without looking, she passed into her room.</span> <span id="s528">The housekeeper brought a box of bonbons, and she said that I am a very nice boy, but she wants – she wants to note that she’s a very busy person, and she doesn’t have any time away from her work.</span> <span id="s529">So it was – that means this – I didn’t understand exactly what it was, but there was food, and there was – and later – but – but I had my idea with her moral –</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: – more – more because she was such a good pretender.</span> <span id="s532">I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: So you – she – officially she was the one who adopted you, right?</span> <span id="s534">Dora Fuchs.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: It – it was never clear.</span> <span id="s536">It was floating in the air.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was not – officially, I was sleeping in her place.</span> <span id="s539">Our – our lessons, the teacher, lunches and so on, were – were in upstairs in Rumkowski’s study.</span> <span id="s540">When years, years later I was in Tel Aviv, and there was an exhibition of things from the ghetto, and – and I recognized some of the things, and I said, I have never been to the Tel Aviv University Museum of – of whatever, so how can it be that I say I have been here?</span> <span id="s541">No, I haven’t been there.</span> <span id="s542">So – but then I remember.</span> <span id="s543">Every time Stanislaw and I, we had to have our lessons, he would – he would – we would have to take off the table all kind of gift that Rumkowski was getting all the time.</span> <span id="s544">Ta – they sang [indecipherable] to him, he – he – he was the greatest man in history.</span> <span id="s545">I – I think that there are very few people in the world who can withstand endlessly that kind of flattery.</span> <span id="s546">With engravings, with here and there.</span> <span id="s547">We had to take off that things almost en masse, and put it – put it on the side to have place to do our lessons in his study.</span> <span id="s548">And we don’t know if somebody put it back for his attention or not.</span> <span id="s549">No, it was – it was a job by itself just to follow – a – a portrait of his would hang on the wall, and – and a little item would be there, and the – the rest was a big accumulation.</span> <span id="s550">So our – our teachers were Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from – from – from doctor – Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from – a – a place in germa – Hannover, maybe.</span> <span id="s551">I’m – I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s552">Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph), he said that his wife has her dates til this from the Spanish Inquisition still, his wife has a – this is – there was somebody from the –</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So what – what was he teaching you, the – the Dr. Berliner(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Logic, math, German, things like that.</span> <span id="s555">They were – they were a – a calibr – a caliber which is th – which is that they should have the graduate students there.</span> <span id="s556">What we are studying was very – he was applying himself like to everything.</span> <span id="s557">He was applying himself, he was solid.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: So Stasiuk(ph) was – was he – he was adopted by Rumkowski?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: He was eventually adopted, because in my case, my mother was taken away, but couldn’t say that my mother is dead.</span> <span id="s560">This – in the ghetto we didn’t know, and the people who knew, knew.</span> <span id="s561">This is number one.</span> <span id="s562">Number two, I will get it off my – my mind, but there was when – when Mrs. – when the Fuchses – the father Fuchs was a tailor, when – when the Fuchses came – came to – to Lódz, to the ghetto, a family took care of them.</span> <span id="s563">And th-the family, this was Fryman(ph), and they provided work, lodgings and so on for them.</span> <span id="s564">When they moved to the ghetto, Mrs. Fryman(ph), Mr. Fryman(ph) and Dora Fuchs and her father were there, and – and those were the people who came with them, and were part of the people.</span> <span id="s565">And to – just to be converted very, very quickly and forcefully into being the housekeeper, into being like the maid and so on.</span> <span id="s566">She often cried, and I often talked to her.</span> <span id="s567">I was still not to familiarize with the help, but Mrs. – Mrs. Fryman(ph) went to a doctor, and she had to go to a doctor maybe because she didn’t want that Dora should know that she went to a doctor at all, you know.</span> <span id="s568">And there was a louse, and she was bitten, and she had – and she had Fleck –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Typhus.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: – Fleck typhus, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Now, what happened at that time, said – this had t-to be announced to the Germans, and it was – when it was told to Beebow(ph), Krieger was their mark, Krieger was there, and – and he tried to remodel it and says, oh, this is Mrs. Fryman(ph) from [indecipherable] or something.</span> <span id="s573">He says, she’s [indecipherable] for Frau Fryman(ph).</span> <span id="s574">And now many people were working Germans on the boats here [indecipherable] and they were – and they were Baltic Germans, they were not very clean very often.</span> <span id="s575">And Dora was afraid if anybody [indecipherable] sick, that will get back to her.</span> <span id="s576">And she started an orgy of dressmaking.</span> <span id="s577">All kinds of dress – ever – everything had to be crisp, crisp, white colors and so on, in order to project that meticulous, meticulous, meticulous freshness and – and cleanliness.</span> <span id="s578">People didn’t understand what was the whole thing, but I knew because I from inside the house.</span> <span id="s579">Not the end of the story because Mrs. Fryman(ph) was getting worse and worse, and – and eventually was dying.</span> <span id="s580">And Dora says that God had her [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s581">God – God – God punish her for the problems she – she did – she – she did to me.</span> <span id="s582">And I – I couldn’t look at her after that.</span> <span id="s583">This was – I was pretending, but – but I was defensive.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: So Mrs. Fryman(ph) and – and her husband, they were in Lódz.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: They were in Lódz.</span> <span id="s586">Mr. Fryman(ph), I once saw him in a bus passing by in Tel Aviv.</span> <span id="s587">He wouldn’t be alive now.</span> <span id="s588">He married the housekeeper of Eric Yakobovitch.</span> <span id="s589">Eric Yakobovitch was in charge of all the – all the industry in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So Mr. Fryman(ph) survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Mist – Mr. Fryman(ph) survived, yes.</span> <span id="s592">Nice, quiet man.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: We will stop for a second –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Sure</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: – to change.</span> <span id="s596">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: It’s quite a story.</span> <span id="s598">I-It – we are – we are okay now?</span> <span id="s599">Oh okay, we can continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: So what – if – what was your, if you can recall to put it in some kind of a frame after – this is after the gaspara(ph), right?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So it would be probably in the what?</span> <span id="s604">October 1942 or some – somehow like this, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Yes, ’42 was –</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: That you started living in – in Rumkowski’s apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Yes, in – in his house.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: And were you – at that time you were not working any more in the – in the leather factory, are you –</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Not in the leather factory, but this was ac-across from – from dev – Dewczewska(ph) was Lagiewnicka [indecipherable] the – that’s where – where you will – as yesterday I got my Lagiewnicka [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: And with Vivian –</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: We – we – you – you noticed probably that we have a door, original door from that building in the exhibition.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: No-no – no, no, no, I didn't notice.</span> <span id="s614">I – I haven’t explored yet, and I – I doubt that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Oh, so we’ll have to – after the interview we’ll go downstairs and I’ll sh-show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: And the – the – the next – the – the next thing is the – the television is quite successful with the lives of the rich and the famous and things like that.</span> <span id="s617">Well, there were the rich and the famous in the ghetto, but they were not exactly the people that one expected they were.</span> <span id="s618">Even it was Stasiuk(ph) and I, and Marisha(ph) Mazur(ph), a daughter of – of a doctor, would be – would be coached by Mrs. Dr. Eliasburg(ph), in things like rhythmic.</span> <span id="s619">Like, she would play the piano and we would go with sticks, and things like that.</span> <span id="s620">This was – this was in the ghetto as part of – of they considered the – the – the right thing to do and so on, and it was – it was kind of mindless, but what may be a surprise is that Rumkowski’s house was modest.</span> <span id="s621">His – his wife was – was nice, intelligent.</span> <span id="s622">Well, no matter how she was coming through, I only saw with – not from Helena Rumkowski, who was a battleaxe, but she was a – a – she was – I th – I think that they were going to the dentist, Dr. Smolowicz(ph), or Stolowicz(ph), who was a man who had a – a radio in the ghetto, which I didn’t find out til Bernard Fuchs have – have to located me, and said – said an interview here, a kind of, you know, people didn’t understand.</span> <span id="s623">I – I told him, what do you expect?</span> <span id="s624">You kick people.</span> <span id="s625">So he went ahead, run ahead of his wife and I, you know, to live with that, that I came.</span> <span id="s626">He wanted me to say that he was a nice person.</span> <span id="s627">He had nice – some of the nice qualities, some of them not, and I wasn’t shy in telling him, he shouldn’t be surprised why people saw what they saw and reacted to what he saw.</span> <span id="s628">And he better lives with that, he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Going back to Marisha(ph) Mazur(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: – the third person, she was – how did she get into that apartment?</span> <span id="s632">She was adopted by someone as well there, or she was just –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Oh, that – that Marisha(ph) Mazur(ph)?</span> <span id="s634">No, she was – she were – only came for the –</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: For the tutoring.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: For the tutoring, yeah.</span> <span id="s637">And of – of – of this – of this thing.</span> <span id="s638">N-Not tutoring in anything else.</span> <span id="s639">Her father was a known specialist which was brou – brought into the ghetto from Warsaw in order to take care of Rumkowski’s conditions.</span> <span id="s640">Something lara – laran [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s641">There – there was – Dora Fuchs was doing like big dinners where I had to read my poetry, that I didn’t feel like writing, and I didn't feel anything; but this was it, now it was me, I was sitting next to her, and the time was coming traditionally to me.</span> <span id="s642">And of course, I didn’t matter at all.</span> <span id="s643">At one time – at one time, and – and I say it because m – because it – it – it will be so uncharacteristic of what people think.</span> <span id="s644">In the evening, one evening, Gertler is coming.</span> <span id="s645">Strutting Gertler was the head of the police.</span> <span id="s646">And he is strutting in and the two people – the three people outside, because there was already Gingka(ph), who was also coming to help out in the household.</span> <span id="s647">There were only three people in the household.</span> <span id="s648">There were – there were only at – most of the time, two people, Dora and I. And he comes in and – and he – they started to bring in chocolate, and or-or-oranges, newspapers, cognacs, and all kind of drinks like that.</span> <span id="s649">Dora is going, Eric Yakobovitch and the – the brother, Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch wouldn’t fit, he wasn’t on the right level.</span> <span id="s650">So Beebow(ph) comes in, and meantime, while waiting for Beebow(ph), Dora is asking – asking Gertler, Dawid, how did you manage it?</span> <span id="s651">And he opens this, and he says, inspector for the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s652">This was – this was Dawid Gertler, he was going around giving people something to eat, or whatever, and he was considered like an extraordinary fine person.</span> <span id="s653">But I know that people were killed all the time because of him, and he knows what’s going on here.</span> <span id="s654">I know about what was written on his papers, because he [indecipherable] a very valuable, or extraordinary valuable Jew, something like that.</span> <span id="s655">He had a nice wife, he adopted two small children, and he tried to be a rubaszny, that will [indecipherable] of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: The rubaszny [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Y-Yeah, ki-kind of.</span> <span id="s658">A-And – and so he – it – h-he said [indecipherable] it was a – the din of out – and he said that he has a balia, a container for water, for a tub, a tub for th – with swimming fish outside, okay, but this he didn’t bring into the living room.</span> <span id="s659">And Beebow(ph) was feeding me pieces of orange and – a-and so on.</span> <span id="s660">So, this was – this was the – all those things were heard upstairs, because there were only a few stairs.</span> <span id="s661">Windows were open, a truck pulls up, Rumkowski is in the house, and all this was done under his nose.</span> <span id="s662">Having nose to – to Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s663">And Dora raised her voice and said wir werden – wir werden dem alten gar nicht geben.</span> <span id="s664">We will not give anything to the old one.</span> <span id="s665">Anyhow, he says that all this is mine, all this is mine, everything is mine, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: This was for me an illustration about a – a – Rumkowski part of the time was helpless, and the things were done by a clique.</span> <span id="s668">And they allowed him to go around and – and get the darts thrown at the people who make hunger and everything.</span> <span id="s669">But he, on the contrary, I – I – I know from hearing, because even if there was – there was a [indecipherable] Rumkowski’s courage, y-you know, in situation which were dangerous to him, very dangerous to him, and – and nevertheless, he followed through, he put his life on – on line.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: So, cou – could you explain little bit more about that truck that came, so that was a – a – while the – the party was going on in the Rumkowski’s apartment, the truck pulled to take the patients out of the hospital, or – what was the –</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s672">Oh, you – you – with the truck?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: No, the truck was brought by Gertler from Warsaw –</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: – with things which were not available even for the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Uh-huh, oh, okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: This was probably his bonus because he brought many rich Jews probably to their deaths, you know, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s679">So – so, Rumkowski was excluded.</span> <span id="s680">To me, I didn’t have to – at – at one time, and this I will not forget either, there was – there was – people were saying at the table, said, the Germans have left a ghetto, maybe Kovno, maybe Rovno, I don’t remember exactly, and they left the Jews intact.</span> <span id="s681">Now, we kind of had a feeling, I had a feeling that I’m not going to live, around the corner there is death.</span> <span id="s682">I couldn’t get rid of that feeling, that death is waiting around the – but – but probably the – that means, like they killed the Jews before they leave the ghetto?</span> <span id="s683">One way or another, it – it – it was – this what came around.</span> <span id="s684">And people were talking about that, and continue with their dinner, with their galareta, with all those things that Dora was preparing; preparing – that she made to be prepared.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: So – but Rumkowski was not part of that feast?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: He was – he was – he was not a part of it, but in this case, in the afternoon, I waited outside my house because Gertler said that he is going to buy me a bike.</span> <span id="s687">According to the historical book nobody had a bike.</span> <span id="s688">I had a bike.</span> <span id="s689">It – it’s – so – so the room – yeah, Rumkowski comes in and gets out of his dorożka and he grabs me by – by the [indecipherable] and he swirls me around him.</span> <span id="s690">He – he is radiant with happiness.</span> <span id="s691">He – he – he walks straight.</span> <span id="s692">He – he shed 20 years off, when I saw him at that time.</span> <span id="s693">Later in the evening I heard about – about the Jews remaining – remaining alive, following which days later, we knew that it was – it wasn’t true, that the Germans didn’t leave Jews alive, but at that time – but Rumkowski was del-de-delirious with happiness that – that the chances that the Jews were – and the other people in the ghetto –</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Tho-Those were the Jews who were departed during the gaspara(ph), right?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: Those were the Jew – he was happy because he learned that the Jews –</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: No, it said – said – said the Germans are likely to leave Lódz ghetto alone, okay, and not kill the people, okay.</span> <span id="s698">That was the big thing.</span> <span id="s699">But the people who were sitting at Dora’s dinner, with me in attendance as well with, th-they – they – they – they didn’t – they were not – y-you know, th-they were not moved.</span> <span id="s700">No – no one was happy that they were talking about the ranks within the ghetto, the – the different levels of career, res-res-resonsi – responsibilities and – and this, they – they did not care.</span> <span id="s701">Rumkowski cared.</span> <span id="s702">Okay, there was no doubt in my mind that he cared.</span> <span id="s703">There is no doubt in my mind that he – he was a demigod.</span> <span id="s704">There was no one that – that he was – that he was on a extraordinary ego trip.</span> <span id="s705">Most of the time he pretended.</span> <span id="s706">[indecipherable] because you know, you – you had to throw the fear in th – into them.</span> <span id="s707">What – but actually he was – after the – the – the [indecipherable] there was a situation that people had to say to – who worked there, had to say send less food because there are less people in the ghetto, because they were already – well, Rumkows – and no one wanted to sign, or whatever, which had to be signed.</span> <span id="s708">And Rumkowski volunteered, and he signed, and he was beaten up for that, but he survived just the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: So do – do you remember instances when Rumkowski would come from the meetings with the Germans and be beaten up?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Re – because in the evening, I wasn’t any more [indecipherable] ask me about what they ate on Friday, I forgot about that …</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Wh-Wh-What did someone ask you what – what they were eating on Friday?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: The Rumkowski – on Friday, I said usual, only to remember later, to remember that actually I wasn’t there on Friday night.</span> <span id="s715">This is – the distance is kind of telescoping and – and [indecipherable] so actually, I wasn’t there at night, at night I was ac – ac – exhibited at Dora’s, so – now – but –</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Oh, so tho-tho-those were the evenings where you had to recite her poetry.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Ye-Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: On Friday evenings.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: Poe – po – poetry, yes.</span> <span id="s720">I wa – I was – how much time has passed?</span> <span id="s721">Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: One hour and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: But it is quite interesting what you are saying, so if you don’t mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: It’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah, sure, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: Let’s continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: I will – ye-yeah.</span> <span id="s730">It’s – it – we are –</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Would you – would you like to take a break, because if – if you would like to take a break, we could –</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: No, I – I am fine.</span> <span id="s733">If you – if you see me kind of losing my think, it is because –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: We don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: I – I want – I want to tell you that, I – I don’t have an opportunity to talk about it, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: I will definitely extract every opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: It’s – it-it – yeah, th-the i – the idea is that I – I – I don’t even – I don’t even try.</span> <span id="s738">I belong to a – to a book club which exists 50 years already, and whatever in Israel, and – and – and I – I thought that they are Holocaust deniers.</span> <span id="s739">They were Holocaust deniers.</span> <span id="s740">I-I changed that one perception there, because they read some books and so on.</span> <span id="s741">But – but gosh, you know, it’s – they say there was nothing special about the Holocaust and this.</span> <span id="s742">Those were leaders of the communists at one time, and they were – they were kind of thinking in a global terms to include everybody, and the – so – so – actually, and I don’t have friends who were – with who I can kind of rehash it.</span> <span id="s743">I-I know that in Israel people meet, and – if they were in the camp.</span> <span id="s744">I – I think that I would like to – to – to save an insider’s view, because I am actually – I have to be grateful to Krikosava(ph), who died in the ghetto on tuberculosis, despite everything.</span> <span id="s745">I have to be grateful to Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch, who was the fiancé for Dora, h-he – he saved my life by pulling me out from there, you know, and putting my ca-candidacy as – as the one.</span> <span id="s746">It’s a – it – it – it is – I – I would like – I would like as – personally that – that Rumkowski should be seen – should be seen no-not only in terms of – of being – what – what is th-the word, like that he – he – he tried, he tried.</span> <span id="s747">H-He – he tried.</span> <span id="s748">He was misguided lots of times.</span> <span id="s749">He tried his best, also most of the times.</span> <span id="s750">The – Gertler was bringing death to many Jews, he wound up as a hero after the people were writing letters that he saved their life and things like that.</span> <span id="s751">The – the people who died, almost at his hands, which may count to hundreds and thousands, they cannot write letters that he saved them – their life.</span> <span id="s752">I think that there was – there is an injustice in this one.</span> <span id="s753">There was a – Dora – D-Dora Fuchs, they were locating me after the war, I – I wanted to go to the camp with my friends.</span> <span id="s754">We were very – we were very, kind of connected.</span> <span id="s755">The [speaks foreign language here] those 12 – 12 or fi – 15 [indecipherable] 12.</span> <span id="s756">Wa – wa – wa – over – over 10 children who were there, some of them alive, Miraka(ph) is a writer, a writer in – in Sweden.</span> <span id="s757">There is Majel(ph), there is Benek(ph), there is Chaim Kamalowski(ph) from Wilna who – who died and so on.</span> <span id="s758">I – I was with them, so I wasn’t any more participating on the daily things that Dora is doing or not doing.</span> <span id="s759">Neither did I know –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q: But they were – they were – all those people whom you just mentioned, they were part of the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah, but Dora and 500 other people, less than 500, I think, left later on, this – this I already heard from – from Bernard, okay?</span> <span id="s762">And the fact is that they were left, they were left under the tutelage of – of the Beebow(ph).</span> <span id="s763">And – and they were – and they were – they had good condition.</span> <span id="s764">Eric Yakobovitch had a son, Mula.</span> <span id="s765">Mula was five years old, and there were some – a few hours, they were not – they were not delivering food, or whatever, so Mula says that he want chocolate, and Eric Yakobovitch was raging.</span> <span id="s766">This was in the camp, in a concentration camp, for the privilege, raging, my son is hungry, where is the chocolate?</span> <span id="s767">Where is the chocolate?</span> <span id="s768">My son is hungry.</span> <span id="s769">The – the chances for survival in that group, I think that very few have died.</span> <span id="s770">The father of – of Ita Salomon(ph), which is the wife of – of Bernard, and she is still alive, but with the – with the Alzheimer’s, which I seem to be getting, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: Not – not a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s773">So, an-and say the survival – the survival was almost, almost complete, of those people.</span> <span id="s774">Where I went, what I went through had – had very little chance for survival.</span> <span id="s775">I came together very romantically wi-with the boys and the girls, and – and we thought that we will live together, all of us, like a group of youngsters, but not men or women yet.</span> <span id="s776">That we will share everything, that once we come to the labor thing and so on, we will support each other, and we will be strong and – and so on, so – w-we came to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s777">So, you know, in Birkenau right away, right away part of us didn’t make it.</span> <span id="s778">I ma – I made it, I was small – I am small.</span> <span id="s779">And I don’t know how I went through – through the initial selection.</span> <span id="s780">I think that I went through the initial selection because I couldn’t believe I saw – we already knew, as we were undressing, they already told us.</span> <span id="s781">When we went one way, already people told us, you go to life.</span> <span id="s782">And – and I believer there were only maybe a hundred or 200 from the whole train, and the rest – the rest went right away to – the train which came a day before us, everybody went, the day after us, everybody else.</span> <span id="s783">Us, had a small – a small contingent of survivors.</span> <span id="s784">But then there was the selection, and this time the selection was undressed.</span> <span id="s785">So, I have a white jacket, because see, it was custom made still.</span> <span id="s786">I had from that time, so maybe I looked a little bit stronger.</span> <span id="s787">But then we were – we were undress, and there was that figure in black going back and forth, and it really fascinated me, like that – that – that situation of a man deciding that or – or – and I was – and I was looking at – at that – at that assessment, a-and I was – I was staring.</span> <span id="s788">When I came there, there was kind of a movement of resignation that he – he put me there to – li-like he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I think was it, did my staring do it?</span> <span id="s789">My physic simply wasn’t – I wasn’t like a person for work yet, never – never did I see [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s790">I will never know, nobody would never know, but I had other occasions that I remained alive because of something unexplainable, some – somebody did something, somebody had – had a moment of compassion, or – or – or – or whatever, again and again and again, because I came to Mauthausen later on.</span> <span id="s791">And – and Mauthausen was – and later that it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s792">And – and then there was – then there was the hospital, I went on the hospital.</span> <span id="s793">And – and the war finished for me, not on the fifth, the war finished for me, I – I know when.</span> <span id="s794">On – I – I must have, in my delirium, I must have in the hospital in – in Austria, in the basement of the hospital, I must have, being delirious, and I remember talking del – del – delirious.</span> <span id="s795">As a matter of fact, I remember that I was doing some – that I was e-engage and ar-articulate whatever speeches.</span> <span id="s796">That’s what I remember from my – from my be-being in a high delirium.</span> <span id="s797">But I must have mentioned that – the 30th of May.</span> <span id="s798">That’s what I was so – so the 30th of May must be my date, and – because in delirium wa – it came through.</span> <span id="s799">And – and a nurse brought me – there were two nurses, one Ukrainian, one – one – one was Austrian.</span> <span id="s800">They brought me a – a – a card with birthday.</span> <span id="s801">That’s the first time during the war that I cried.</span> <span id="s802">I never cried during the war, not once.</span> <span id="s803">And – and – and the war finished, and the things started from that point on.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: So, going back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: – to we – we were still – we – you gave us very nice, very educating run-through what happened.</span> <span id="s807">But I just want to go into little details.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s809">S-Sorry, I think that I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: No, no, no, it was very good, but th-th –</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: I-It –</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: – I just wanted to –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: – if you remember any details from the time, cause we – we are getting into 1944 and your deportation.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s817">Do you remember any circumstances which were around it, cause you were in this privileged part of the ghetto, and how did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Oh, it – in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: In the ghetto, when – when you were deported to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: I – I was – I was not any more – I place myself outside the magic circle, okay?</span> <span id="s821">I was – I wanted to go with my – with my friends and – and I didn’t want to say that I don’t want to be with Dora, I – this would be crass, or whatever.</span> <span id="s822">And even more under – I just said that I want to be with this – Gertler, just knowing that I have friends, Gertler gave me – gave me a bike.</span> <span id="s823">Oh, incidentally, someone called me a couple of months ago, and his name is Walter Kelly(ph).</span> <span id="s824">He was one of the three men who was sent from the United States by this organi – by your organization to – to review, receive the – the – the rec-records, 18 kilometers of records.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Ideas?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Whi-Which were – n-n-no – re-recor – rec –</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Records were in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: – German er – the records in Germany –</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: – which – which was open, Walter was one of them.</span> <span id="s831">So, here a – here is some – somebody from there.</span> <span id="s832">And I say, Walter, do you remember something about a bike?</span> <span id="s833">And he says, sure, you were coming on a bike, and every time you were giving me a chance to – to drive around.</span> <span id="s834">So – so here is Walter the first person who says never mind what the historians write, there was at least one bike in the – in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s836">So you – you got – you got that bike, and were you riding your bike in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s838">Yeah, that’s the idea.</span> <span id="s839">To Marysin, because this was the other end, going Lagiewnicka 63 was Radigosz(ph).</span> <span id="s840">Goes to Radigosz and I would –</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So you were constantly, de-despite the fact that you lived in the Rumkowski’s apartment, you were constantly in touch with your colleagues, with your friends, in – in Marysin, in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Ti-Til I created the situation that kind of things were dissipating and I was spending more and more time with my friends, and it was kind of accepted.</span> <span id="s843">And – and Rumkowski from time to time, he would call me to see how I am making out, how I am doing.</span> <span id="s844">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: D-Do you remember ever, the Rumkowski’s visits to the – to Marysin, to the – to the orphanage there?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: To – to the orphana – every day s – every second day to that orphanage, to the small t – orphanage.</span> <span id="s847">An interesting thing, that somebody looking for an orphanage like that, there was a twin orphanage with some 12 – 12 youngsters, which were chosen by – by Rumkowski, and she was looking for people from her group.</span> <span id="s848">Her name is Lucia Ailmer(ph), I think.</span> <span id="s849">And – and instead of finding her people, she found the people in – in my group.</span> <span id="s850">So, we are – we are in contact act-actually now.</span> <span id="s851">So somewhere there was that secret, second – like, there were two.</span> <span id="s852">I thought til now that there was only – only – only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: And there Rumkowski was taking care of – of the – o-of – of – of those youngsters who were in those orphanages, right?</span> <span id="s854">He was –</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Oh, the orphanages?</span> <span id="s856">Yes.</span> <span id="s857">And he was pushing for schools, and he was pushing for – for young people who have a chance to survive, to – to have a – a better chance to survive through food or good work, or something.</span> <span id="s858">He was not God, he didn’t have a right to decide who is, who isn’t.</span> <span id="s859">But he probably thought that he is doing exactly the right thing.</span> <span id="s860">Oh yes, when – when he was twirling me around about what – what he thought history will say about him, he will – he will say – he – he s – he will say that after the war, you – no, I and you will go in America, and I will give a referaten – just the f-first time that I head the – the word referaten, which means lectures or something.</span> <span id="s861">So – so his – there – there was no question in my mind after that little thing, that he was not afraid of – of – of history, but that he – he has done – that he has done his best.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And your – your feeling is among the – the people that Rumkowski, w-was he aware of the fate that is awaiting everybody, including himself, or – or he was in denial of that, or what – what would you think?</span> <span id="s863">How – how did he treat the – the tr – the truth, that he must have known, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: If – he – he – he mu – he must have known, even because – even – he’s twirling me around, and being happy.</span> <span id="s865">Was – I learned the same evening, was because the Germans have left the ghetto intact.</span> <span id="s866">This means that if he say intact, not killing everybody, this means that he must have known the alternative to leaving intact.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s868">And how – how were the others, th-the Fuchses, the – the Gertler, they were als – also aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: The Ge-Gertler was not only aware, he was a perpetrator.</span> <span id="s870">This is [indecipherable] was a smart man, nice man, gentle man, but he was the second kid to – to get – at one time in the ghetto, Krieger – after they took away Gertler, Krieger and Dora Fuchs and Eric Yakobovitch were deciding everything about the ghetto.</span> <span id="s871">No matter who was being blamed, they were deciding.</span> <span id="s872">I saw it, I saw the process, I saw the meeting, I saw them – I saw them say so that I am a fly on the wall.</span> <span id="s873">I didn’t think that my memories will be historical in some way, but – but you know, I also, you know, sometimes – sometimes they would – they would hush a little, and the child is there or something, you know.</span> <span id="s874">And – and we go back and – and there was no way, the apartment wasn’t very great.</span> <span id="s875">There was – Dora – Dora Fuchs had her – her room with – with blocks of ice like bricks from ice, so you couldn’t see the counters.</span> <span id="s876">There was my room with – with a bed where Bernard Fuchs was using, and that’s what became available for me.</span> <span id="s877">I-Incidentally, an-another thing which bothered me; there was – the-there were two – two machines in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s878">They were called the diathermia.</span> <span id="s879">This is a word from that time.</span> <span id="s880">Dora had some occasionally stomach cramps.</span> <span id="s881">And this was – this was prescribed for people with diathermia.</span> <span id="s882">It was – it was said to me, I didn’t count, that there were two diathermias in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s883">Dora, for herself and the rest of the 160,000 or 100,000 people who had only the use of one diathermia machine, because diathermia machine was in her room, just in case she feels like it on this is the date that she wants to apply the diathermia, and so –</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: What – what was that machine?</span> <span id="s885">What – what was – can you describe –</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: Th-They’re doing something good for her – fo-for her intestines or whatever, I didn’t go deeply into it.</span> <span id="s887">There was a cow in the ghetto, you were probably not – you didn’t hear about that, about the cow, possibly – I don’t know if there are two people in the world who know about the cow.</span> <span id="s888">There was a cow in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s889">There was – there was an orchard in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s890">And everything very hush-hush, , but it was there.</span> <span id="s891">But it was every morning, almost every morning, the chief of police, Rozenblat or something, would bring eggs.</span> <span id="s892">At one time he forgot to bring eggs, and Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch was sleeping over, he was sleeping over, af-after all, she – she was his fiancé, Bolek(ph) – Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch was eating breakfast, my father died of hunger, this was early in the game.</span> <span id="s893">And I was eating breakfast, I – I finished my breakfast, Dora’s father, Papa was invited for breakfast.</span> <span id="s894">So he was eating breakfast and – and he was – he packed lunch, a beautiful sandwich or something with an egg and sp – it was with, not egg, sprouts and things like that.</span> <span id="s895">And he unpacked it after I finished breakfast and says, would you like to eat my lunch?</span> <span id="s896">I didn’t give it a second thought, I ate his lunch.</span> <span id="s897">But he was sending me – I also got the message, you know?</span> <span id="s898">We – we – we – we measure – we – we measure, somehow, you know, what we – or whatever.</span> <span id="s899">At – Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch said, because the eggs were not delivered for – for breakfast, he says, you see?</span> <span id="s900">You can – you can live a day without eggs for breakfast, he says to Dora, or something like that.</span> <span id="s901">You see, you can eat – the chil – children were born and died in the ghetto without ever seeing an egg, without knowing what it is, or what it tastes.</span> <span id="s902">And he says that it’s possible to survive.</span> <span id="s903">Yakobovitch wife, Regina, dropped in just to have a talk with me.</span> <span id="s904">Dropped in and she had a sandwich and she started over with her s – she started to – to eat the sandwich and – and wrapped it up and put it back.</span> <span id="s905">She says, the doctors say – said the best – the best way – said, th-the – the best way to eat, is to stop eating while you are still hungry.</span> <span id="s906">This was in the ghetto where – which hunger was – was giving everybody an unendurable pain, just the – the feeling of hunger.</span> <span id="s907">The doctor told her that it’s the healthiest to stop while she is still hungry, and exercise and a diet, or something like that.</span> <span id="s908">And I – I – I couldn’t – I couldn’t stop, my father just died of hunger.</span> <span id="s909">My mother was – must have been very afraid of being – being taken away, as a person who cannot work any more, or whatever.</span> <span id="s910">And then, okay, but then I – I prefer to be – to eat – which means, like I have my principles that I have to compromise with, but – an-and ne-nevertheless, it was – it was good to – to eat that.</span> <span id="s911">At the same time when I went over to the other children, there was less food and less [indecipherable] but, at that time it wasn’t a question of hunger or no hunger, and it didn’t make a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: So, it – and that was the basically everyday life after the gaspara(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: – and d-during 1943, up until the –</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Concerts, reviews, theaters, th-there was e-entertainment, dinners.</span> <span id="s916">Dora Fuchs was a big – was a big th – kind of dinner arran – arranger.</span> <span id="s917">She was very inventive.</span> <span id="s918">She wasn’t doing it by herself, but she was very, very inventive.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: So who would be coming to those dinners?</span> <span id="s920">The – the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: No, th – but, they would – the people were coming who were always heads of departments in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s922">It – it was a – Dora was able to pull out – in – in a setting of home, she was able to pull out anything, anything she wanted, without the people – without th-the people wanting or not wanting to say.</span> <span id="s923">She – she was a genius.</span> <span id="s924">She – she could draw out, people couldn’t stop themselves, only blurted out, an-and she was – she was the puppet master [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s925">She – she was a much more, let’s say a – say, her job description.</span> <span id="s926">As a matter of fact, I-I saw it, Eric Yakobovitch was sitting on a chair.</span> <span id="s927">I remember lying on the corner, and – and she was standing over him, and she was shaking a finger at him, and – and she would say, remember with some things, one German closed all the – all the food in the ghetto, this, and no one is – was allowed to touch the food.</span> <span id="s928">This means punishing the whole ghetto because he got angry about something.</span> <span id="s929">And it was a question of hunger and people dying and whatever, and things getting rotten at the same time.</span> <span id="s930">Well, Dora – Dora spend the night, and – in Lódz.</span> <span id="s931">She came back and – and she was proud that she got the – she got that this was an example of Dora being able to do some things, which amb – anyhow, she was shaking her finger at Eric Yakobovitch, who promised her that he will never do anything without first running it by her.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Do you have any recollections from that time of any of the Germans?</span> <span id="s933">You said th – at one point, that Genovine(ph) – not Genovine(ph), th-the Beebow(ph) came.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: What are your recollections of Beebow(ph)?</span> <span id="s936">How did he behave there, how was –</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Be-Beebow(ph)?</span> <span id="s938">Beebow(ph), I think that Dora – Dora admired Beebow(ph), because number one, she was changing his shirt every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Number two, she saw what’s written about him, that he is an extraordinary organizer.</span> <span id="s941">This was his freedom from the eastern front, needless to say.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: So, he had like a – a very high thing.</span> <span id="s944">I think – I think that Beebow(ph), a – a drunken, who probably attack anyone if he drinks, and he was very careful what he does publicly.</span> <span id="s945">That means that he wasn’t – wouldn’t engage in any – in any beatings or this or being angry.</span> <span id="s946">He wouldn't – he – he was spending more time with Yakobovitch, Eric Yakobovitch.</span> <span id="s947">A friend who was in Lódz after the war was telling me that he attended the – Beebow’s(ph) trial, and Beebow(ph) all the time said that they should ask Erici Yakobovitch, Eric Yakobovitch, like what Eric Yakobovitch will say, would – would – would have much importance after the war.</span> <span id="s948">Which we said Beebow(ph) was naïve in some – in some respect.</span> <span id="s949">I know that Beebow(ph) had lots of money, siphoned off from the ghetto, because I heard and I heard again, and it was obvious, and it was always kind of that we understood.</span> <span id="s950">I think that Gertler, who all at once after the war was – he was the head of the underworld before the war.</span> <span id="s951">So – at – it – I think that Gertler all at once, gets to be a big manufacturer in Munich, and I think that he knew where Beebow’s(ph) – where Beebow’s(ph) stash of monies and [indecipherable] away, this is my wa – thi-this is nothing, this is just a feeling I – I have.</span> <span id="s952">But there were pilgrimages going to Gertler, the murderer.</span> <span id="s953">This was un – unjust – he didn't deserve an-any of it.</span> <span id="s954">Rumkowski didn’t deserve all the contempt that he – that he encounters by subsequent historians.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s956">So, do you remember any other Germans coming there for – o-only Beebow(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: No, I remember – oh, I re – I re – I remember that tough talking, that they were talking with Germans, but th-the names didn’t – didn’t dis – there was – somebody was protecting – was protecting Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s958">Beebow(ph) – Beebow(ph) had to be careful with Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s959">Any other Jew he could kill, he probably couldn’t kill Rumkowski, he would – he would – he would have to answer to – to some.</span> <span id="s960">I remember some name –</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: And you don’t know who that person was?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: Who that pers – after the war, it came to me – aft-after the war Dora – Dora was working in UNRRA in – in – in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s963">The Yakobovitches were there, Erik and this – Mula, meantime, got to be super-duper si – rich in – in Kissimmee, near Kissimmee in Florida with horses and vintage cars and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s964">And he did it at – at the record – the record speed, and guess where the money came from?</span> <span id="s965">A Krieger son, Malachi(ph) was in the – he was in South Africa, I think.</span> <span id="s966">Eventually – eventually in – in Miami as well.</span> <span id="s967">We are talking about riches.</span> <span id="s968">Those are – those are old things of monies which accumulated in the hands of a few.</span> <span id="s969">There is no doubt in my mind that this – this was on – on different scales.</span> <span id="s970">Those monies didn’t just happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: So when the time of – th-the final deportations in 1944 came, when did you learn about that?</span> <span id="s972">Do you re – do you recall anything?</span> <span id="s973">What was the sequence of – you know, of – of th – of the events in – at the – at the end of the liquidation of the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: I would say the liquidation of the ghetto at that time was not that the – that the second shoe has fallen, only that the second shoe is falling.</span> <span id="s975">So, it was something that everyone wanted to avoid.</span> <span id="s976">People complained about the ghetto, but were doing their utmost to avoid deportation from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s977">The – the worst dates that they ghetto had, probably when Rumkowski was missing for two days.</span> <span id="s978">There was despair throughout the ghetto, everyone’s nerves were this, because with all the complaining, they felt that at least there is some kind of a hand at work on behalf of survival.</span> <span id="s979">Must have felt it, because otherwise, why curse Rumkowski and be so terribly concerned when he is missing for two days?</span> <span id="s980">So, e-e-everybody knew, and – and the rush was to resource which are likely to be needed by – by the Germans.</span> <span id="s981">Resource means the factories.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: So, let’s say Himowicz(ph) fac-factory, which is metal [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s984">Th-then Zatlersort(ph), where I was working, this had a chance because it was for military rucksacks, it had a chance to continue as a group working together.</span> <span id="s985">And this is the transport that we have chosen to go with.</span> <span id="s986">We probably got advice also, which to get of – of course, all this was nothing, the only group was Beebow’s(ph) group that he brought to Flossenbürg and – and whatever, divided.</span> <span id="s987">So this – this was the only – the rest, the rest, the moment – the moment people came into the camp, th-they were – they were just meat for grinding.</span> <span id="s988">So this was the atmosphere of the ghetto, that people hoped to be lucky and be at a place where their work will be needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: So y-you were deported how – when the deportations started, how many days, if you remember at all, you were still there before y-your own deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: How – how – how long?</span> <span id="s991">I – I know that Rumkowski, Rumkowski came a week after we arrived, our group.</span> <span id="s992">When did I learn about that, I don’t read many books about that or anything, but some – sometimes, here or there I notice a – a note, which rings a bell.</span> <span id="s993">So he – he came a week later.</span> <span id="s994">The story was that – that Beebow(ph) didn’t want to release his brother to go with that select group.</span> <span id="s995">So Rumkowski decided to – to – to be – it’s the – the – the other part of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: To go with his brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Mm, yeah, it’s – he didn’t – and – and – and Rumkowski put many – just means Beebow(ph) put, after giving Rumkowski and his family, his very small family – incidentally, Stanislaw looked like the brother of – of the – of Rumkowski’s wife, Mrs. Rumkowski.</span> <span id="s998">They say that she married Rumkowski in order to save her brother, tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s999">And she couldn’t save her brother, but Stasiuk, Stasiuk was – looked and was like her brother.</span> <span id="s1000">It looked to me that Rumkowski kind of talks to me more than he talks to Stasiuk, maybe because Stasiuk was – Stasiuk was so very serious and measured, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1001">Nice, nice guy.</span> <span id="s1002">You could build a house on whatever he said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: And Stasiuk went together with Rumkowski, as far as you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: With Rumkowski, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And so he didn’t survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: He – he – he did not survive the first day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: So, when – when you were going to – to Birkenau –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: – to this, did you have any clue where you were going?</span> <span id="s1010">Did you know anything about it, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: Abso –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: – did you know what to expect?</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">A: Absolutely nothing.</span> <span id="s1014">Abso – the – the ghetto lived for – for four or five years on a what we called kaczki(ph).</span> <span id="s1015">Kaczki(ph) means just something which flies by –</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: The rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">A: Yeah, and builds up a rumor into, like, something that they know.</span> <span id="s1018">From my – my personal story, the ghetto may be of interest, my real war, and you can say luck in survival, started actually at – at that time.</span> <span id="s1019">Coming – coming into – into the concentration camp, and – and winding up in – in Mauthausen, Braunskirsche(ph) and so on.</span> <span id="s1020">If – if – if I would, and the war would be finished, at – at – at the times that we talked about, I think that I would have suffered a quarter or less of a – of a risk of death and an ugly story of cannibalism, ways to escape – to escape sexual advances, and remaining alive.</span> <span id="s1021">Luck connected with it.</span> <span id="s1022">And I don’t know if we have a – and I could – I could probably condense it in – in a number of sentences, but I don’t know if we still have – have place for that story.</span> <span id="s1023">But this was – this was the real war, and this was – I – my life was saved, because of different good people.</span> <span id="s1024">At least on three occasions, my life was saved by German SS.</span> <span id="s1025">On one of the occasions, by a – by a – a enthusiastic killer, a young SS man, who turned out to be a killer once we were on a forced march.</span> <span id="s1026">I shared his bread with me.</span> <span id="s1027">Hard to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: So when – when you – when you got to – to Auschwitz –</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: – in – in – in ’44, this is the – you – you never – you never heard of – of that name before, or you never –</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Auschwitz Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: N – ab-absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I – I – I – i-if there would be two people who knew about that, it would be – it would be Gertler, Krieger and – I think, and – and Dora knew – Dora knew – probably she knew everything, who knows?</span> <span id="s1036">But no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: Cause you mentioned also that someone had a radio, and – but not even from that source –</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: Do – Dr. Szwalowicz(ph) had – had a radio.</span> <span id="s1039">Of course, he will be killed if – if it would come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Bernard Fuchs was saying that Szwalowicz(ph) was giving him the news.</span> <span id="s1042">There were only a few people who were doing it.</span> <span id="s1043">Szwalowicz(ph) was the – the dentist of Rumkowski and [indecipherable] and Beebow(ph).</span> <span id="s1044">Szwalowicz(ph) was the dentist of Beebow(ph).</span> <span id="s1045">He had to get a special permission from the Gestapo to go to a dentist, to a Jewish dentist in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1047">So, you arrived in – in Auschwitz and you said that you didn’t go through initial selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: Your sel – selection happened when you were already naked, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Oh, no, I – I – there was – there was a selection right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Mm-hm, on the ramp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: On the ramp.</span> <span id="s1053">There was another selection in the shower, and the hiring – hiring.</span> <span id="s1054">And – and – and – and then – do you have some time?</span> <span id="s1055">Because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: I was just wondering if you have some time, because I am – I am cruising around what happened at that point, and – and – and it’s not clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: We do ha – we do have all the time that is required for that.</span> <span id="s1059">It – it’s – th-this is quite important, if you recall – if you could recall what happened when you arrived to Auschwitz in a-as detailed as possible, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Well, I – I arrived at Auschwitz at – a few of us, the ones who were not taken to this, we came to block 14, and block 14 they would chase us from place to place with sticks, and just to have an occasion.</span> <span id="s1061">A – a man came up on the chimney, saying that there is only one way out, through – through the chimney, you know, so that we would be – the – the old stories, horror story.</span> <span id="s1062">Walter, of Russia, I have the name here, I go – I have a calendar here – Walter himself was – was hit here with a stick, and he started to cry, not because of the stick, only because he didn’t give us food the whole day.</span> <span id="s1063">And even at that point I found it like a – you know – you know, like a little bit, you know, funny.</span> <span id="s1064">He doesn’t remember it.</span> <span id="s1065">So the – at that certain point, the – and a large man comes in the middle of tha-that speech, and so on, give up money and so on.</span> <span id="s1066">A l – a [indecipherable] came over, and he was a butcher, I learned from Pionki(ph), a nice person, from what I have seen.</span> <span id="s1067">And – and he says, can somebody peel potatoes?</span> <span id="s1068">And everyone started to peel potatoes.</span> <span id="s1069">I knew I have no chance, I – I was squashed by the people.</span> <span id="s1070">I remained where I was, near the wall, and he pointed at me.</span> <span id="s1071">And – and people started to pass me o-overhead to – to him, like – and – and they say, oh you will survive, you will survive, like this would be, you know, like peeling potatoes would mean survival.</span> <span id="s1072">And I peeled potatoes, they cooked.</span> <span id="s1073">What happened that – that night, the blockalteste, the blockalteste, which means the leader of the block, at the entrance to the main block, th-there was a little – a little place which – which was the kitchen and also the blockalteste.</span> <span id="s1074">In this particular place it was not only the blockalteste, but also the lagerfuehrer – the lagerfuehrer, this means the main – the main blockalteste, whose name was Willie.</span> <span id="s1075">Willie, nobody had anything against Willie.</span> <span id="s1076">He – he was going to Familienlager very often.</span> <span id="s1077">He was released early for – an-and sometimes people on a transport saw Willie, and – and it was like a friendly thing.</span> <span id="s1078">He was a captain of a ship which sold the load because of some romantic entanglement, they said.</span> <span id="s1079">And – and – and he was well known by – by the people.</span> <span id="s1080">And the Familienlager who came from Theresienstadt, who were in the Potenkins(ph) village, feel it wasn’t necessary any more to – to present that theater to the cro – Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1081">And th-that Willie on one side.</span> <span id="s1082">And now I – I was working in the kitchen, doing whatever they were telling me.</span> <span id="s1083">It was getting late, but nobody told me what – what to do with myself.</span> <span id="s1084">At one point, a – a German – th-there was an SS invited that – into to those festivities.</span> <span id="s1085">Somebody there was a kapo who played on – on an accordion, or the – and that officer comes, an officer, it looked to me like an important officer.</span> <span id="s1086">But he came over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, and he is asking for water, and I gave him water, and I answer him in – in – in German.</span> <span id="s1087">So he says, oh, I know German, how come that I know German?</span> <span id="s1088">I must be a Mischling or something, and I said n-no, but at home, this means at home, this means Dora Fuchs and so on, we spoke only German.</span> <span id="s1089">My first book, [indecipherable] in British Columbia, I – I read there, you know, the first German book.</span> <span id="s1090">And – and I did the most stupid thing that anybody can do in one’s life, because I was embittered by – I saw the smoke coming out from – from the chimneys, and because he asked me, do you also speak English?</span> <span id="s1091">And I say, what for, so I burn better?</span> <span id="s1092">A-And I showing this a – I thought, i-in a moment I will – my head will be under his boot, or he will shoot me, or he will [indecipherable] I – I [indecipherable] already on – already this second day, I have seen people killed all over the place.</span> <span id="s1093">So he says – he kind of sobered up, and he says, oh no, not boys like you.</span> <span id="s1094">We will – we will teach you a trade, and after the war you will be working for the Reich.</span> <span id="s1095">And – and that’s how it finished.</span> <span id="s1096">The next – the next day, didn’t finish – it didn’t finish, I didn’t tell to anyone that.</span> <span id="s1097">And this is – then I don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1098">Willie, who – who occupied a cubicle, says – says [indecipherable] there is a bed.</span> <span id="s1099">A bed?</span> <span id="s1100">People were lying on the floor all over.</span> <span id="s1101">But I went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, and I am petrified, completely.</span> <span id="s1102">I don’t move, I am frozen.</span> <span id="s1103">He talks to me and so on, and – and I am – I am petrified.</span> <span id="s1104">So he started to talk to his little dog, and he says that he is not a good burschak(ph), he is not this, and so on.</span> <span id="s1105">He – he kind of turned around and I s – I – I left the bed, and I didn’t have where to sleep.</span> <span id="s1106">I didn’t know if to go into the block if somebody will beat me up.</span> <span id="s1107">So I remained in this section in the kitchen, a-and I slept there.</span> <span id="s1108">In the morning I was woken by the din of giving – giving the – giving bread – bread and something [indecipherable] or whatever, to the passing people.</span> <span id="s1109">So I helped.</span> <span id="s1110">It was – this time it was some cheese, and the one from Pionki(ph), the – the butcher from Pionki(ph), who was also the cook, was very nice to me and so on, so he also gave me some potato from the day before, which made a big difference.</span> <span id="s1111">And later on, the boxes, the crates remained with – with the – for – with some cheese gl-glued to it.</span> <span id="s1112">Can I take it and – and – to find my friends and give it to them?</span> <span id="s1113">Well, my friends was – Walter I didn’t know so – so well yet, but other, Benek(ph) and Chaim and – and so on.</span> <span id="s1114">Benek(ph) in Maryland, here, nearby, he lives nearby.</span> <span id="s1115">It started to – I went out with the box, and people absolutely attacked me, to – broke the box into little pieces.</span> <span id="s1116">I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you – you had like a promenade.</span> <span id="s1117">There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk back and forth.</span> <span id="s1118">And I don’t know if it was the same day, or the second day or the third day or the fourth day.</span> <span id="s1119">After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one section of the – of the – of the promenade is being like taken – taking in a gauntlet, and put into a block, and some – some people, like stronger people would be put aside, but small people, and old people, who – who somehow – some of them were [indecipherable] for some time – I was new – were pushed into – into that block, op-opposite the 14 block.</span> <span id="s1120">Now, thi-this – this was – it – it was so tight that it was like – it was difficult to breathe, because everything was squeezed.</span> <span id="s1121">No sitting, no this, you know, just trying to sit in each other’s lap, fighting for breath.</span> <span id="s1122">I remember my chest hurting the way it hurt now, with a – with heart disease, like empty, empty hurting.</span> <span id="s1123">And – and it was in the middle of the night, middle of the night or whatever, there are cries, the lights go on, flashlights coming to – to my row, showing no this, this, people started to try and make space.</span> <span id="s1124">I was taken out from that bunch of people, brought to the door.</span> <span id="s1125">At the door was the German officer, Willie, the guy who wanted me to – to – to do sexual things to him, and Karl, which was the – the main kapo, or – aft-after Willie, a man – a man – a lame – a lame person with a stick.</span> <span id="s1126">And they pulled me out and they put me into block number two.</span> <span id="s1127">In block number two there was a bunk to sleep, and – and this was the first block near the SS stuba entrance.</span> <span id="s1128">And the Canada commando were there.</span> <span id="s1129">Canada commando were actually the people who were – not where they do the – I – I read something, clothing and so on.</span> <span id="s1130">Some of the things with the Canada commando, yes, those were clothing, things to sort out.</span> <span id="s1131">But the people who were working at the receival – at th-the – re-receiving the people on the train and emptying this and so on, this was the – the real Canada commando.</span> <span id="s1132">Most of them at that time were from Holland, where – where I was.</span> <span id="s1133">They had food and all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1134">I was brought there, and they pass without any resolution where I belong and what’s my name, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1135">And – and then I am told that I will be – I will be the runner for the SS stuba, which was the next, and the SS stuba, th – it means, like if there was a raport(ph), an appell, and everyone had to be in front of the block, and later they would make a tally of – of the people, and – and I would – I would have to run along it, and bring the pieces of paper.</span> <span id="s1136">The raport(ph) pier(ph) is standing in the middle, would correlate if th – all the people are there.</span> <span id="s1137">If not, the thing has repeated itself.</span> <span id="s1138">Sometimes it repeated just in order to show people, you know, to be punitive, or – or whatever.</span> <span id="s1139">And that what I was doing, and jobs were being piled up on me.</span> <span id="s1140">One of the SS men had the rabbits, and he wanted me to bring greens.</span> <span id="s1141">The greens were – were growing near the electric wire, where nobody would go.</span> <span id="s1142">But I got a number, for the first time, I got a number, which yesterday here I was in the file with my number, which is already not visible, almost not visible.</span> <span id="s1143">It – it was a small – a small portion of that.</span> <span id="s1144">You – you probably haven’t seen a number that – and – I’m sorry, yo-you said something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: W-We have to change for a second, just a moment.</span> <span id="s1146">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Yes, are we?</span> <span id="s1148">Yeah, okay, it’s done.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">A: This was – this was my life from that point on.</span> <span id="s1150">I was vacillating between being on the edge of – of death, to – to all at once being – being either better off than everybody else, or being worse than everybody else.</span> <span id="s1151">And I was positioned [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1152">So, that’s what I was doing.</span> <span id="s1153">I met there Dina Gottliebova, she fought about – about her paintings.</span> <span id="s1154">So she was coming – she was coming with Mengele in order to kind of paint characteristics of – of – of the twins in – in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1155">When – when Mengele came to make a – a raport – a – that means just a selection, she would remain where I was, at the entrance to the block two, near the – near the stuba, and – and we talked.</span> <span id="s1156">And we were in contact later – later on.</span> <span id="s1157">I – what coincidence, many, many years later.</span> <span id="s1158">I think she is not well now, she wa – she is in California, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: She passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: She passed away, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: So when the – the block 14, both 14 and the block number two –</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: – were in Birkenau, and those were the brick barracks, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: No.</span> <span id="s1166">They were on the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: No – they – they – the – the brick barracks were in Auschwitz proper, and those were – and those were the – th-the barracks built for horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">Q: For horses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: So how far – you mentioned before th-the family camp, the Terezin family camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: Were you in touch with that, or di – were you observing it, were you – what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: I – I – this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Do you have any recollections of that, other than the – what that Willie would be going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Ah – at that time, yeah.</span> <span id="s1176">I – I – I heard talking, Karl and so on talking that the – also something else happened that – that I know.</span> <span id="s1177">Once somebody came to me, that’s means – those people were in – in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1178">Somebody came to me and says, I heard that you were in Birkenau at that – that time, and she said that they saw my brother, from – from Theresienstadt, from Familienlager, there.</span> <span id="s1179">Is it possible that – that he – that he was there?</span> <span id="s1180">And – and I told her, yes, it’s possible.</span> <span id="s1181">Somebody passed on the same circumstances saying you shouldn’t give people false hope.</span> <span id="s1182">I – I felt insulted.</span> <span id="s1183">I didn’t, but it was possible, why was it possible?</span> <span id="s1184">On the last night, when – when they were taking out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was Willie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to bring approximately a hundred – hundred people – hundred young men from – from the Theresienstadt out into our end.</span> <span id="s1185">And so they avoided being th-th-they – th-they remained alive.</span> <span id="s1186">So yeah, her brother could have been – her brother survived this particular person.</span> <span id="s1187">But so – an-and then there was a dispute with those people.</span> <span id="s1188">What hundred people, what are you sa – talking about?</span> <span id="s1189">Only 22, we were the only ones who remained, 22.</span> <span id="s1190">My friend, he’s a psychiatrist, and he was in this.</span> <span id="s1191">And I said, no, there were a hundred, I was there.</span> <span id="s1192">Gilbert wer – wote – wrote a book, the – the boys of Birkenau, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1193">A-And he writes about those – those children, and – and he – and he writes about those hundred and – there is a page for – for every one of those hundred, and they are still in England, the ones who are alive, most of them are alive, and they are still in England.</span> <span id="s1194">So this was – this was what I knew, that little, in the – in the camp, and – and the later, because I just met people from there and we were comparing notes on some occasion.</span> <span id="s1195">Just how I learned, I thought that Dina Gottliebova is a – a – a – I said that the-there was a – once, I said [indecipherable] I said – somebody sa – oh, I see you have a number from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1196">I said yes.</span> <span id="s1197">So I say, I see you have a number, too.</span> <span id="s1198">So, yes, yes, I was there, in the Familienlager.</span> <span id="s1199">And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I will probably never find out what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1200">She was sent, so I thought she is going with – she is going with Mengele, she probably knows much more than the rest of us do.</span> <span id="s1201">And probably – and – and she was sad.</span> <span id="s1202">This also – this also doesn’t allow me much hope.</span> <span id="s1203">She – she [indecipherable] to – had a husband, Rudy, and – and she says he is talking about Dina Gottliebova.</span> <span id="s1204">Bobbit.</span> <span id="s1205">I was in contact with her later on, and Bobbit – Bobbit is a – is – is her husband’s – her husband’s name.</span> <span id="s1206">And she was fighting to get the – to get some – she was also somebody who not – admired her boss.</span> <span id="s1207">And this is – she admired things about Mengele.</span> <span id="s1208">Things were coming all the time.</span> <span id="s1209">When she talked abou – about Mengele, some kind of pride came into her voice, you know?</span> <span id="s1210">Like she would make an example.</span> <span id="s1211">She says, I made his portrait, she says.</span> <span id="s1212">She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts.</span> <span id="s1213">And – and then six or seven of those Gypsy paintings, and the wall, which is probably in Israel, in Yad Vashem, the – the wall – the wall the seven dwarfs, that’s what the children wanted – wanted once they were there, in the Familienlager.</span> <span id="s1214">They were in a room, and she painted it.</span> <span id="s1215">And – and, so the seven dwarfs.</span> <span id="s1216">And actually, she married the man who was the author of one of the seven dwarfs, which is Bobbitt.</span> <span id="s1217">So, we are now with the – so I thought that there is no survival.</span> <span id="s1218">There is absolutely, there is absolutely no survival.</span> <span id="s1219">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Were you – were you the witness of the liquidation of the Terezin family camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I-I – I was there when – when they took them, but this is the – this is the night that they brought the almost hundred boys into – into the camp, into the Zigeunerlager, the Gypsy camp.</span> <span id="s1222">But my friends were there, and as a matter of fact, they are in Montreal and now he re-retired as a – an – and he is writing his third book in Czech, about those times, about a re – reminiscences.</span> <span id="s1223">He is – their children are – were from childhood, with what happened, involved writing poetry on those sa – things.</span> <span id="s1224">My children, I protected them as much as I could, especially since I lost her – their mother at the age of nine and 12.</span> <span id="s1225">This is my daughter, she was nine when my – when my wife has died.</span> <span id="s1226">So, the number – I said this is a telephone number, and so on.</span> <span id="s1227">Til today they don’t know.</span> <span id="s1228">Part of the fact that the family is meeting together here and I am giving the testimony and will try also to leave the testimony for my family out there.</span> <span id="s1229">This is the same, this – thi-this is part why we are here.</span> <span id="s1230">But just an aside, that it’s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they – they know anyhow, but in some dark and untouchable way.</span> <span id="s1231">What – what happened – what happened later on, I was lucky again.</span> <span id="s1232">There was a – they were supposed to – to e-empty the Zigeunerlager, and I don’t know – I don’t know the – how – how those minds worked, but Willie was interested in my survival.</span> <span id="s1233">Karl was nice to me.</span> <span id="s1234">I-It’s – n-nobody bother me.</span> <span id="s1235">I – I could help others.</span> <span id="s1236">I knew two boys, and their father was put in – into a – into that – the same block where I was, and they wanted to get the father out, and they gave me a – a diamond, I didn’t want the diamond.</span> <span id="s1237">And I went to – to one of the Dutch people that I knew, and I ask him for a couple of sardine boxes, so they can bribe the – the blockalteste.</span> <span id="s1238">They went, they bribed, they got the father out.</span> <span id="s1239">Later they were – they were all going from some – on some assignment to work, hopefully.</span> <span id="s1240">I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it.</span> <span id="s1241">And – so the idea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the hospital, I will bring in a metal container, food.</span> <span id="s1242">But at one time the guard shot down the line.</span> <span id="s1243">I – I was startled, and I got electrified, and – and fell out while – while this happened.</span> <span id="s1244">I also was [indecipherable] flowing back, and disconnected, but it – it was a fe – quite a feeling to – to be the – I was going to – to look for Mrs. Feldman, who was the head of the orphanage before, that – the same orphanage.</span> <span id="s1245">And she was not – she is an artist, a known person in my life, felt fine.</span> <span id="s1246">Mrs. Feldstein.</span> <span id="s1247">And I – I found other people.</span> <span id="s1248">They asked me for warm underwear, and – and I would be bringing to the people warm underwear.</span> <span id="s1249">One of them had the relative in Montreal, who said that her underwear that I brought saved her life.</span> <span id="s1250">Whatever.</span> <span id="s1251">It – it’s – it’s probably misconception with some people that it was dog eat dog and only dog eat dog.</span> <span id="s1252">It wasn’t.</span> <span id="s1253">People were doing things when they could.</span> <span id="s1254">I did too.</span> <span id="s1255">It was almost something pushing me do something good, since, you know, like – so – so this was the time, and – but I don’t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after – after trying to – to – to get me to be his plaything or whatever.</span> <span id="s1256">He – he wasn’t rough, or he wasn’t this.</span> <span id="s1257">Talked to his dog that I am not a good boy.</span> <span id="s1258">And – and later he is – and I am – as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS, probably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again.</span> <span id="s1259">And that letter – with that letter, I was sent to Sosnowice.</span> <span id="s1260">And in Sosnowice – in Sosnowice, I arrived and I gave the letter to the commandant of the camp.</span> <span id="s1261">And he says, if you were look – you were good enough to be a runner in – in Birkenau, you are good enough to be a runner for me.</span> <span id="s1262">One of the strangest things happened; if somebody would make a film, I would be the first one to say this is impossible: I was – I was running, stoking the fires in all the SS have their barracks, I was stoking the – stoking the fire and – and all that; ea-eating sometimes from the – from the SS kitchen.</span> <span id="s1263">Everybody knew me, it was a small camp.</span> <span id="s1264">I said that I was interested to see the machinery, always interested me, machinery [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1265">So I went for one shift, commandant praising me that I am interested.</span> <span id="s1266">So I – I went to – to the factory.</span> <span id="s1267">I liked what I saw.</span> <span id="s1268">Poles were working together with the Jews from the camp, the relations were this.</span> <span id="s1269">I didn’t see a Pole for years, five years, well, at that time.</span> <span id="s1270">And it was very nice, I ti – I fell a little bit in love with one Polish woman who was in the center of the factory, writing things down, reading poetry, so we have something – something in common.</span> <span id="s1271">She was talking something, so the youngsters that I said are running away they say, to – to the [indecipherable] to Warsaw, actually go into the forest, talking that maybe I can go into the forest, but I will have to avoid the – the Polish partisans and go 30 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1272">It’s – I made a little reading lamp in the workshop of the camp, for the commandant, an SS man, a young SS man sees me and he says, oh, did you do it?</span> <span id="s1273">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s1274">So – so I say, take it.</span> <span id="s1275">So he says, no, I will – di – you made it for the – for the commandant, no I will not take it.</span> <span id="s1276">So I say okay, so I will make you another one.</span> <span id="s1277">I – I make him – I made him another one later on.</span> <span id="s1278">This is the young one, who was later killing people on that – on that road and sharing the bread with me, and other things, which – which help me to survive.</span> <span id="s1279">There was another SS man there from Austria, who was crying his head off because he didn’t hear from his wife, and he thought maybe they were bombed, a-and – and I – I put my arm on him, saying that the – maybe the post doesn’t work or things.</span> <span id="s1280">He shared with me some sugar cubes, also on the trip, on that long trip where so many people were – were – were killed, per we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: The trip west from Sosnowice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: From Sosnowice to Mauthausen, yeah.</span> <span id="s1283">Part of it was by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Do you – do you recall any – anything in the – in the – where did you walk on that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: No, to Gliwice, because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: To Gliwice now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: – because the commandant, a porky man, good-natured, but I never forgot that he reached his [indecipherable] in Dachau.</span> <span id="s1288">Okay, he got to be a commandant in Dachau, so he is not a gent-gentle – as a matter of fact, so gentle, his family, like, they adopted me.</span> <span id="s1289">I was running around the camp, I had the movement.</span> <span id="s1290">The telephone was ringing in the – in the office, I would pick it up and say, this is Camp Sosnowice, so and so, and take a message.</span> <span id="s1291">And – and now it looked to me – show it to me in a film and I don’t believe it, you know?</span> <span id="s1292">That – so this was the true.</span> <span id="s1293">But – but that’s how it was, that was the thing.</span> <span id="s1294">I – I was a – a – decorating the – the Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s1295">I took every candy out, as a joke, and – and have only empty candies there, I didn’t need the candies.</span> <span id="s1296">But it was a joke, and it was accepted as a joke, but where did I come to do this [indecipherable] but I did survive.</span> <span id="s1297">The – the gift that I brought to the commandant that I made, was packed as a gift from – from me.</span> <span id="s1298">The family had gifts – gifts for me for Passover.</span> <span id="s1299">It’s a – it was a crazy time out, a-at crazy times, crazy places.</span> <span id="s1300">Sosnowice was different, separate from – from anything else you – you – you can say.</span> <span id="s1301">Nobody was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: What – what kind of a factory was that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: They were – they were in – in Sosnowice, they had to march a certain dis-distance, and oh – oh – oh yes, I – when they started to tear with running away to – to the partisans, I – I asked the – the commandant to be – to – to – to free me from my duties, because I want to learn a trade, to be useful.</span> <span id="s1304">And he stopped the whole column and praised me, because – and I actually wanted to see – to give a chance to run away, and – and to see her more often.</span> <span id="s1305">She was much older, with knowing eyes, she knew exactly what it’s doing to me.</span> <span id="s1306">I was the hungry.</span> <span id="s1307">I was rested.</span> <span id="s1308">It’s – so, that was – that was – so one morning – one morning, everything is packed.</span> <span id="s1309">I didn’t have to worry any more what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be courageous, to run away.</span> <span id="s1310">I didn’t know if I had the courage.</span> <span id="s1311">And we started to – to [indecipherable] at Gliwice, the commandant unloaded his stuff, his furniture, and – and it occurred to me that I will ask him that – maybe to hide in the furniture and I will help the family later on.</span> <span id="s1312">But I chickened out on that as well.</span> <span id="s1313">After – after that, that young SS man was crazy, the – going around and shooting people; he had so much energy.</span> <span id="s1314">He brought me – at the end of the day he brought me his coat, spattered with blood, to wash out the blood.</span> <span id="s1315">And I was washing out the blood, and felt sick over it, brought it to a place where – where they – where the SS were sleeping on the floor with – with – and there was a panzerfaust or something, you know, a grenade, and I thought – I thought if I will grab the grenade and throw it, maybe we’ll change our – because we could hear the Russians in the back.</span> <span id="s1316">And – anyhow, I didn't know how to actuate it.</span> <span id="s1317">It’s – I s – I saw a movie only recently where – about a school for SS, and said that you unscrew the bottom.</span> <span id="s1318">So for half a century I didn’t know how I could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah, now, now.</span> <span id="s1319">So, and – and that way we came to Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1320">Mauthausen was – was – I had, from sleeping on the ground, I had four large furuncles.</span> <span id="s1321">I couldn’t bring it down.</span> <span id="s1322">I went through the selection, because it was in – in two days it swelled up more and more.</span> <span id="s1323">We had the – the – that thing written, that’s me – somebody was going around writing down the names of the ones who have to go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1324">The hospital actually was the Russian lager, and actually it was a place where they kill people.</span> <span id="s1325">Put people in, and bottles of chlorinated water, phenol injections, al-all kind of things.</span> <span id="s1326">So, on the way – and this might be of interest, on – on the way there, there is the lageralteste from – from Sosnowice, and the lageralteste was – was a – a delegate to the – to the Reichsdeutsche’s Reichstag, wha-whatever the na – the name was.</span> <span id="s1327">And – and he was held in very high esteem by the raportfuehrer.</span> <span id="s1328">I heard what’s going on, the bombing, because the two of them talked, and – and later I saw this lageralteste, but he was hiding his – his red – red triangle, because the – the kapos in Mauthausen were criminals, and not political.</span> <span id="s1329">And – and this kapo criminal was actually in charge of the Jehovah Witnesses.</span> <span id="s1330">They have some tailoring blocks, or whatever.</span> <span id="s1331">So he talked – he talked to – to that kapo as we pass.</span> <span id="s1332">My group was halted, and – and they’d say talk to the Yugoslav, and I was brought to that – to that hospital, which I didn’t know, only that it’s not a good place.</span> <span id="s1333">I didn’t know that I will go to death.</span> <span id="s1334">And some SS put me on a table from – from stone, and he started to cut and I started to faint.</span> <span id="s1335">He sprayed something and I fainted again.</span> <span id="s1336">And I was brought to the block.</span> <span id="s1337">I was brought to – I don’t know when and how I was brought to the block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: But it was in Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: It was in Mauthausen, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Not gunski – Gunskirchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: No, it – it was Mauthausen, it was – it was the – the quarantine, two – two –</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q: Uh-huh, the quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: – two – two blocks were quarantined.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: So – so I was – I was lying there, I didn’t have to stand up for a – to be counted.</span> <span id="s1346">Before that, she helped me to stand and I was collapsing the moment.</span> <span id="s1347">But that – they let me recover, I wrote poetry again.</span> <span id="s1348">There were some Poles there again.</span> <span id="s1349">And again I was helped, and – and I wasn’t – I – I didn’t take myself the luxury that actually what I write is empty phrases, you know.</span> <span id="s1350">It’s a – it’s – was good to have their support.</span> <span id="s1351">And – and then – then, one – one – one evening, I’m sleeping inside there, an-and somebody gets to me and signals to me to go.</span> <span id="s1352">This is the blockalteste of this block, the quarantine, an Austrian.</span> <span id="s1353">And I heard that two days before, he killed a Hungarian boy in the washing – washing – where y – where you wash hands of – you kno – you know that?</span> <span id="s1354">And he – and he tells me to go to his cubicle, also a cubicle with – with clothes.</span> <span id="s1355">And I made – I made noise to wake up people and he retreated.</span> <span id="s1356">And the next morning everyone goes to the appell to – to that count, to the – we knew that we are going to the count to the big square, not the – for counting everyone.</span> <span id="s1357">And as I am passing by, he is waiting with a milkmaid’s stool, and he throws it straight on my head.</span> <span id="s1358">A-And I managed to sneak out from under it, and run out, but – but this was – this was my last – last day of life.</span> <span id="s1359">I was standing there for hours, and – and I knew it’s the last day of – of my – my life, and I was making peace with it; everybody died, everybody died, and – and now I’m going to die, and – and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1360">We were standing, and later separated Jews from non-Jews.</span> <span id="s1361">We were some 300 Jews.</span> <span id="s1362">They brought us down to lager number – number three, which is a [indecipherable] lager.</span> <span id="s1363">We were there maybe a couple of days, I don’t know, it was very, very cold, freezing at that time.</span> <span id="s1364">And later they brought us over to a – to a [indecipherable] lager.</span> <span id="s1365">This means there were so many people coming from the front, Hungarians mostly, and many Mischlings, with families, w-women and children, that they brought those o – those [indecipherable] in those tents – tents, circus tents, and tha – they were overflowing.</span> <span id="s1366">There were [indecipherable] and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: But it was still in – in Mauthausen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">A: It was still in Mauthausen, but just the temporary [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: – all around.</span> <span id="s1371">And then a small plane comes.</span> <span id="s1372">And – and the plane – those people were working at the front, and – and this hit them, the hunger and everything, and with the families they were, the families were lying in front of their families – of the other member.</span> <span id="s1373">And a small plane comes and it shoots up the towers in Mauthausen.</span> <span id="s1374">Some wer – somebody must have written about that, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: It was a Soviet plane, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: A Soviet plane, they think.</span> <span id="s1377">They think that one Soviet was there, and he says, I will be here later.</span> <span id="s1378">This means like he’s going to run away.</span> <span id="s1379">It was a Soviet – a Soviet plane, shot on the towers.</span> <span id="s1380">And later, through two rooms on the – on the SS barracks.</span> <span id="s1381">What he didn’t know, he couldn’t have known, that near the barracks now are those tents, and the bombs fell into the tents.</span> <span id="s1382">So, there was that all over, and pieces of flesh.</span> <span id="s1383">There was no place for everybody in the tent.</span> <span id="s1384">Flesh on the wires around that.</span> <span id="s1385">The next day there was – there were cooking fires, that the people still had utensils from their trip.</span> <span id="s1386">Kaduk(ph), a raportfuehrer from Auschwitz was going around.</span> <span id="s1387">Wherever he saw something in a pot which was suspicious, he would kick it over and shoot a few people.</span> <span id="s1388">Other fires were going, people were not exactly running away.</span> <span id="s1389">It was extraordinary, it was not like from living people running away, scurrying away, and him going and sh-shooting people.</span> <span id="s1390">Later on, there was no – there were no bombs, and you could see missing buttocks on people still alive, still the – the mouth is still moving.</span> <span id="s1391">I didn’t tell it to anyone.</span> <span id="s1392">And when I wrote I only wrote that those were – well, from – from – from Mauthausen, from this place, we were sent – and we – we were – we – we had lice right away.</span> <span id="s1393">The ones from the camp didn’t have lice, but the ones from the trip never had a chance to – to wash them – wash themselves.</span> <span id="s1394">And we were taken over to – to Gunskirchen.</span> <span id="s1395">Gun-Gunskirchen not – not far from Linz and so on.</span> <span id="s1396">Th-The weather was better, we – we – we ate grass.</span> <span id="s1397">We ate some escargots from the grass.</span> <span id="s1398">Came to Gunskirchen, Gunskirchen was – was the place to die.</span> <span id="s1399">I was dying.</span> <span id="s1400">There was no place to lie down inside, outside it was rain.</span> <span id="s1401">So people went on and use – use the belt to remain on the rafters.</span> <span id="s1402">I did, too, but you couldn’t go out, if you go out, they would not allow you to come back.</span> <span id="s1403">Some people didn’t care.</span> <span id="s1404">I crawled down, I couldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1405">Remained there near the – near the dig-out, which was from before, with feces and so on, and – and in the rain.</span> <span id="s1406">And – and the Americans came.</span> <span id="s1407">Hesitated a little bit, what they will do, whatever.</span> <span id="s1408">And that’s how I wound up in the hospital.</span> <span id="s1409">And th-that’s – that’s – I – I – I have never – never had a chance to – to say all the things that I am saying now.</span> <span id="s1410">It is – like, people don’t know – don’t know, and it – and – and it’s – and it’s probably hard on everybody.</span> <span id="s1411">I am glad I had a chance to – to say what I did.</span> <span id="s1412">I – I have more, but this would take up too much time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: No, no, no, no, it’s – do you want to take a break now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Well, it’s not a question of – of a break.</span> <span id="s1415">I could be more concise, but it was in – in a way I don’t know how noticeable it was, but it was like a – a stream of – of consciousness.</span> <span id="s1416">I never thought about – about the – the willu – the Willie, the one who probably saved my life, o-or wanted me to – to be a s-sex – must have been drunk, because he had a woman, and – and this.</span> <span id="s1417">Maybe he felt bad because he even – he even created that little situation to an innocent, obviously.</span> <span id="s1418">You really don’t know where – where you get the – who you’d get your bikes from, like Gertler gave me a bike.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: That – I – I – I think that we should stop for the moment, and we will most likely have some questions or so, but that can come later.</span> <span id="s1420">But I – I think that you said enough during this time on this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Is it possible to find out who was – who was the delegate to the Reich?</span> <span id="s1422">Who was the blockalteste on Sosnowice at that period of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: To do the Reichstag?</span> <span id="s1424">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Yeah, Reichstag delegate.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: Blockalteste.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: It – it – it – Reichstag, he – he was not a blockalteste, he was in charge of all the blockalteste.</span> <span id="s1428">He was lageralteste.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: So, he was like lagerfuehrer – lagerfuehrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: Lagerfuehrer, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: He was lagerfuehrer in Sosnowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Later in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Later in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Yeah, because I saw him in Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: So – so I take it that he was a – he was a prisoner, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: So he – he must have been the member of Reichstag –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: – before 1933, before Hitler got to power.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: And it – would you know wh-what – what party was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: I – I be – he was – he was political, he had the red – the red thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1444">So he probably was from –</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: – social democrats or – or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: I – I – I have – I have no [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: And you – you have no idea, no hint on what – what even his first name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1450">I knew, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Yeah, well – well, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Fair enough.</span> <span id="s1454">But maybe we’ll be able to.</span> <span id="s1455">We have to talk to – to – to someone who was doing research in that camp.</span> <span id="s1456">And that would be the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: Oh, in what camp?</span> <span id="s1458">In –</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: The Sosnowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Sosnowice, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: The good camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: The good camp.</span> <span id="s1464">And that was – you think that when you get to Sosnowice, that was already in 1945, or – or – or you were in still – was it winter, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: It was winter, we slept in the snow most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: So that’s the – and then it is really difficult to – for you to remember anything for – what was happening after the quarantine in – in – in Mauthausen, cause it seemed to me that you were half time unconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: Ah, that – that means like a-after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Af-After the – you were liberated, that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: Yeah – yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: And so – so when the – you spent, just to finish up that portion, you spent time in the – in the American hospital in Gunskirchen, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: It – it was an Austrian hospital, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s1474">The upper – the uppist – the third floor was for wounded German soldiers or SS.</span> <span id="s1475">The second – the – the – the second – the lower floor from that was for the – for the citizens of Linz.</span> <span id="s1476">The ones from the concentration camp and the hospital, around by an American captain or something, but with the old crew of doctors and nurses, or whatever, the wa – the ones in the – in the lowest thing, this was the basement, this was us.</span> <span id="s1477">The Ukrainian nurse and the – was going around to give injections, she had a basket with injections.</span> <span id="s1478">There was no time to go around the bed, there was no place to go around the bed.</span> <span id="s1479">She was – she was giving injections the same thing.</span> <span id="s1480">I had a black spot on – on my – this, for years in Israel, I had the black spot from the injections deadening the – that – the flesh at that area, for years, til – til one day I – I look and I see she is all gone, you know.</span> <span id="s1481">So – so that was – that – that was – I don’t know who it – if people were informed to – to the highest degree.</span> <span id="s1482">Maybe the captain wanted to be nice, a nice occupier and we were an unknown species, whatever, we had the worst treatment.</span> <span id="s1483">The least treatment, I’d – I won’t say the worst treatment, only the least treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: And from that – from the camp, you – from – from the hospital, when you were released from the hospital, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: There was either Lin-Linz or where else I don’t know, although I remember the name of the place, Alpenjäger Caserne.</span> <span id="s1486">And I don’t remember how long I was there to – to continue a story just a little bit beyond, is when I could, I got a paper from the – from the city hall, by an American, and who wa – who was there in city hall, to – to afford me a assistance as I look for my mother, because there was still time for illusion about her right away then.</span> <span id="s1487">So, I-I – I-I was – I was going around with that paper, and then I see a group of people [indecipherable] you have to sleep over, eat something.</span> <span id="s1488">They were going to Switzerland, and they told me to – to – to lower my age, because they were supposed to take youngsters to – to – to Switzerland, about the school – school level, a certain school level.</span> <span id="s1489">They didn’t know much either about what was happening.</span> <span id="s1490">School level.</span> <span id="s1491">So she told me, just put – put less [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1492">And I was later on those – I was stumbling over those dates.</span> <span id="s1493">Once you have a piece of paper, everything starts to emanate from the piece of paper, and – and then you leave it alone, and then you find su – as I, that I was going around with a – a incorrect date, which, it shouldn’t matter much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: So, did you go to Switzerland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: So I – I registered to go to Switzerland, but a little bit further, there was another legation, English.</span> <span id="s1496">Okay, and – and they were – and – and some of the English are the ones that jer – Gilbert is writing about from the boys of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1497">Now, th-the next legation was American.</span> <span id="s1498">As – so I had to sleep over, and so on.</span> <span id="s1499">They were encourage – they didn’t have enough – enough youngsters.</span> <span id="s1500">They all came out with a goodwill gesture, but they didn’t have enough, at this area, there, they didn’t have enough young people survivor that they can – that’s why they say – say – say that you are less in age.</span> <span id="s1501">And then I saw a soldier, a soldier surrounded by people, speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1502">A pole that here was written Palestine.</span> <span id="s1503">And then I rem – then I remember how I talked to him at length, or where – when there was a chance I waited out a – the crowd and so on.</span> <span id="s1504">He told me the best way to find relatives is to go to Israel, once they have a specialized – a specialized facility, they call it mabrodliki(ph) puskravym(ph), the Institute for Finding Relatives.</span> <span id="s1505">And – and then, you know, you don’t have a telephone, you don’t have this, you don’t have communication.</span> <span id="s1506">You – it – it really, it has to be a chance once to a thousands that you touch base with someone who knows something.</span> <span id="s1507">As – an-and then, I remember that during the war we also said that if we separate, then – then those people will be our contact.</span> <span id="s1508">So I went to Israel, and that’s where I was for 11 years.</span> <span id="s1509">I was there a student, I was a volunteer in the pel-mah(ph).</span> <span id="s1510">I was later a – a teacher, for some three years.</span> <span id="s1511">My wife was from Canada, we – we were not sure where we will be, but decided to give one year to Canada, which with the birth of my son and so on, turned into a permanent thing.</span> <span id="s1512">So – so that – that’s what happened after the – the – that means the fact that – that I found myself in Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: And in Canada you always lived in Montreal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1516">So I guess that we can cut.</span> <span id="s1517">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1518">It was quite informative.</span> <span id="s1519">We probably will have tons of – of questions still.</span></p> <p><span
