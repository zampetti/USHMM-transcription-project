Uh huh.</span> <span id="s401">And did they fit into the community or did they look very different?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: They didn't look very different, but they were kind of they had their nose up in the air, so to speak, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: They were above everybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s406">Yeah.</span> <span id="s407">Such a human thing.</span> <span id="s408">What was the main economy in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: The main economy basically was coal mining.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s411">I see.</span> <span id="s412">So did most people I mean, did most people work in the mines or have, you know, family members work

<span id="s421">Made sure we dressed, we went to school.</span> <span id="s422">We had to have special clothing like Catholic kids wear.</span> <span id="s423">You know, we had to wear certain certain clothing</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What kind of clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: attached to the shirt or whatever.</span> <span id="s426">And that was the kind of life.</span> <span id="s427">And it wasn't the best, at least not in my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: When you went to school, at that time you were old enough was she able to afford a pair of shoes for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Hardly.</span> <span id="s430">Hardly.</span> <span id="s431">There was a couple times that I wore her shoes because I didn't have any any shoes to wear.</span> <span id="s432">And that was already just before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: You were already maybe, like, an 11 , 12 year old boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Did your younger brother and sister go to school?</span> <span id="s436">Maybe your sister not, but did</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: My brother did.</span> <span id="s438">He was a year younger than I am even though he said two.</span> <span id="s439">It was just one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Were you hungry at any time?</span> <span id="s441">Did you have enough to eat when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: No.</span> <span id="s443">There was always potatoes.</span> <span id="s444">There were always things that you could eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: But it was enough food.</span> <span id="s447">When I say food, I mean, you know, basics.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s449">Did you also have any chores that you had to do as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Not much, you know.</span> <span id="s451">We didn't have a big house, so my mother cleaned and whatever she did.</span> <span id="s452">And we were out playing when we were kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: What did people say?</span> <span id="s454">I mean, in this in this small place or big village, as you say, but, you know, not one that had were there people who had cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Cars?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: No.</span> <span id="s458">The only thing person that had a car that I remember was a doctor in town, and he had a Mercedes.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Well, what a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Yes, indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: And so that's a rarity.</span> <span id="s462">Things like that were did anybody own a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">Just people owned and we had one.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: You had one too?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: We had one too.</span> <span id="s467">When the Germans came, they took it away and we turned it in.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: So you had they told you to turn it in rather than coming to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Yes, to turn it in.</span> <span id="s470">Everybody had to turn in.</span> <span id="s471">You couldn't listen to the radio because if you picked up in fact, you could pick up London on most radios.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: And they didn't want us to hear the news from London.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Had you ever before the Germans came, before the World War started, did you listen to the radio outside of you know, radio broadcasts that came from London or other places outside of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s476">Yes.</span> <span id="s477">We like, one time we moved where my father and mother were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: And it's closer to the Czech border.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: To the Czech border?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: To the Czech border.</span> <span id="s482">That was the other I don't know how far away it was.</span> <span id="s483">It was quite a distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: And we used to listen to Radio Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s487">In Czech or in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: In German and Czech mostly.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: So you could understand what they were saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: In a roundabout way, yes, because the Czech language is a Slavic language.</span> <span id="s491">So you could understand some of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: And was this about the time that Czechoslovakia was annexed to Germany or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Before and after.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s496">But, you know, when the Germans came in, they took all the radios.</span> <span id="s497">You know, there was a death penalty, at least they said, if they caught you to have a radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: I guess what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how much information came into the town.</span> <span id="s499">How well informed were people about the larger historical, you know, things that were going on?</span> <span id="s500">The political developments that were going on?</span> <span id="s501">Were people afraid or did it all seem very distant?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No.</span> <span id="s503">My father went through World War I when he was a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Uh huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: And so he was aware of the things of war.</span> <span id="s506">And I heard him speak to his friends about the war.</span> <span id="s507">And the consensus among them was it's not going to last very long.</span> <span id="s508">Because they were aware there were planes and, you know, kinds of things that they can use to really to do a job on another country.</span> <span id="s509">So they were aware of things.</span> <span id="s510">And I heard them speak and I was sort of aware what was going on myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: So there was talk of war, but there was also a confidence that you could beat somebody who invades your country?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: There was no confidence?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: There was never any confidence because within the government</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: the Polish government had some Germans in high office.</span> <span id="s517">And so they just they actually dismantled the air force before the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: So you're saying there was some sort of sabotage from within?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s520">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s521">And since it was you know, the last place I lived which was Sulmierzyce, they we had seen you know, it was very close to the German border.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: And we were aware but not to the extent that they came in with, which the blasts and the armament and whatnot was going on.</span> <span id="s524">So the war was wasn't going to last very long.</span> <span id="s525">Nobody believed that it's going to last very long.</span> <span id="s526">Because the Poles didn't have enough of a force to fight them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s528">So it was in that sense that you that there was talk that they were coming and they'll overrun us immediately?</span> <span id="s529">That sort of talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s531">There was no doubt about it.</span> <span id="s532">And they did come in, and within a couple days they were all occupied, the whole area.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Tell me the first time that you do you remember where you were when you learned that the war had broken out?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: I was at home.</span> <span id="s535">And it and a Polish Polish government called upon the people of age to come and join the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: So there was an as announcement over the radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: There was an announcement.</span> <span id="s538">And so my father left</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: to join not join.</span> <span id="s541">He had to he was a in the military before.</span> <span id="s542">It's been a couple years.</span> <span id="s543">So, therefore, he was supposed to report to one of the military I would say where register and they get you into the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: One yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: So he left.</span> <span id="s546">We didn't know where he was when the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s547">And my father finally came home.</span> <span id="s548">I don't know how many how much time.</span> <span id="s549">I cannot remember the time element it took for him to come back.</span> <span id="s550">He was told the story that he was captured by the Germans and they held him.</span> <span id="s551">And they were going to kill him and a whole bunch of people that they were going to kill.</span> <span id="s552">So they had my father had a gold Omega pocket watch, which in those days was the style.</span> <span id="s553">And one of the German guards saw it.</span> <span id="s554">He says, "If you give me this, I'll let you go."</span> <span id="s555">So he gave him the watch and he really let him go, and he came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s557">So it was for his breath.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Right.</span> <span id="s559">Right.</span> <span id="s560">That was just the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: And when was the first time you saw any did you see German soldiers soon after that announcement came?</span> <span id="s562">When did you first have the war come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Within two days.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s565">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: The Germans moved in and they started killing people.</span> <span id="s567">They rounded up the teachers, the priests, the rabbis, you know, and they started killing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: So this sounds like it was not based on whether you were Jewish or not but based more if you were, like, a community leader.</span> <span id="s569">'Cause a priest or a rabbi would be a community leader.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Right.</span> <span id="s571">The elite.</span> <span id="s572">The teachers, the doctors, the old the educated people.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s574">And they were the ones who were being arrested and killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Right, either killed or sent to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s576">I am not aware how many people they killed, but I know they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Did you see anything did you see any violence on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: From time to time.</span> <span id="s579">The occupation was broadcast and we didn't go out on the street until they entrenched themselves within the city, within the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: So you stayed at home.</span> <span id="s581">When you found out that the war was on, your mother and your brother and your sister you stayed inside the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: And when did you first venture out?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Right after.</span> <span id="s585">Right after a few days, we ventured out and 'cause we understood the language.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: The German people the German soldiers did not know who was Jewish and who was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: They did not.</span> <span id="s589">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: They did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Were you similar you said you mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s592">But in your dress and in your manners and so on, you were indistinguishable from anybody else?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: Right.</span> <span id="s594">Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s596">Okay.</span> <span id="s597">And what is the first thing that you noticed that was different?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: The food.</span> <span id="s599">We didn't get much food.</span> <span id="s600">It was rationed.</span> <span id="s601">And the ruthlessness of the German occupiers.</span> <span id="s602">They'd just beat people up, beat kids up, beat grownups up and got them to work or picked them up in the street and took them to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: So in other words, I get the sense that there's really no fighting that actually happened; that there was no fight that was put up in your area.</span> <span id="s604">They just ran in.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: They just overran the place?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: They just came in, and that was that was it.</span> <span id="s608">They did not there was no fight.</span> <span id="s609">There was not a soldier within miles.</span> <span id="s610">And</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: When you say they came in then, does that mean no soldiers were there?</span> <span id="s612">No Wehrmacht was there or</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s614">The Wehrmacht came in, the SS right after that.</span> <span id="s615">You know, I didn't know who was an SS man is, but I did know what an Wehrmacht is.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s617">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s618">But no Polish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No.</span> <span id="s620">They were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: They were all gone.</span> <span id="s622">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: 'Cause I never saw when the war started.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s625">So aside from aside from rationing and, you said, the ruthlessness of the German soldiers, how else did life change?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: You had to stay in line for to get a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s627">Everything was in short supply.</span> <span id="s628">There was no sugar, no nothing.</span> <span id="s629">You know, that whatever you had to do, you were rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Was that across the board for everybody or was this particular targeted to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: That, I don't know.</span> <span id="s632">I would imagine it was across the board.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: Was there in those early days, was there any discrimination against the Jews that was harsher or more different than, let's say, the Polish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: They didn't know they couldn't recognize one from the other unless they wear the religious hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Otherwise they didn't know who the Jews were.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: They just didn't know.</span> <span id="s641">And so, like, myself, I was able to go anywhere even where the soldiers were and, you know, it was okay.</span> <span id="s642">I was afraid, but I did go.</span> <span id="s643">You know, I did see them, you know.</span> <span id="s644">I didn't go near any Army installation or any you know, anything like that.</span> <span id="s645">I avoided that.</span> <span id="s646">But, however, you know, they didn't they didn't know who the Jews were or what they looked like unless they saw somebody who was religious that they wore the the garb, the hair, the face, you know, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Well, when you would go, you know, I take it out of, like, a child's curiosity to see what was what are some of the things you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: A lot of military around there.</span> <span id="s649">There was a lot of they established the SS headquarters.</span> <span id="s650">They took over the police department.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: So they had special German police.</span> <span id="s653">They didn't have any Polish.</span> <span id="s654">They just disbanded them.</span> <span id="s655">And right when I was about in fear because they were ruthless.</span> <span id="s656">If they got ahold of somebody who did something, they either killed them or beat the hell out of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Did you see things like that?</span> <span id="s658">Did you see people being beaten?</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: Oh, yes, a lot.</span> <span id="s660">In fact, as we go, I have something I can tell you about myself, what transpired.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s662">We'll probably be there soon.</span> <span id="s663">Tell me, what happened with your mother and your father?</span> <span id="s664">How did they start how did they continue to put food on the table?</span> <span id="s665">I take it your father, when he came back, didn't leave again because, where would he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: My father was gone for quite a while.</span> <span id="s667">We didn't know where he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: But when he came back, he is he was an educated person.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: He spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Spoke clean Polish.</span> <span id="s674">He spoke a little bit between.</span> <span id="s675">He had knowledge of a lot of languages, you know; Russian, for instance.</span> <span id="s676">'Cause his his father was a Russian teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s678">That's quite impressive</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: to know that many languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Well, I was impressed with him, but I didn't like him, quite honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s683">Yeah.</span> <span id="s684">I got</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: So about when he came back, he had to start providing things.</span> <span id="s686">He was able to go among the Germans, talk to them, establish a Jewish city hall.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Which he was one of the people that worked for them.</span> <span id="s689">He was a mediator between the Germans and the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: That's very responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Yes, it was responsible.</span> <span id="s692">And but, you know, I</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: Was he a harsh man?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: No, he wasn't.</span> <span id="s695">He wasn't.</span> <span id="s696">Only when I did something I shouldn't have done.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Was he distant then?</span> <span id="s698">Decent but distant?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: I would say I don't think he was instant.</span> <span id="s700">You know, I hugged him and, you know, he hugged me.</span> <span id="s701">You know, so but he was he was not a warm father, but he was not distant.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: I got that.</span> <span id="s703">Okay.</span> <span id="s704">So he became a mediator, you know, between the Germans and the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: And did I understand correctly that sometimes he would just perform some services for the Germans and then he was able to put food on the table because of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: He was able to do things the food was rationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: When we have a situation like we had, when you have rations, you have you have sometimes a preference if you know people.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: So this was the kind of thing that he did.</span> <span id="s712">But he also bailed out people that were arrested.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: He paid them off.</span> <span id="s715">He did a lot of things that was for the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s716">The Jewish community apparently gave him things, you know, for the Germans that were what he needed to buy the person out for money or for other things.</span> <span id="s717">I don't know.</span> <span id="s718">For gold.</span> <span id="s719">I don't I would imagine.</span> <span id="s720">But he was a mediator between the Germans and the Jewish community the Jewish city hall that they formed.</span> <span id="s721">And, of course, they had people that they talked to and that decided what to do, how to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So did he come home and talk about all of these things or did</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Never, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Never talked about anything.</span> <span id="s726">I never knew, but they do did know that he was a mediator because he used to bring home a lot of a suitcase for the money.</span> <span id="s727">And what did he need money for?</span> <span id="s728">Only to buy out or to buy off a German, you know, for</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: For somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: For</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: For somebody's life.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s734">How long did you all live in this kind of situation?</span> <span id="s735">How long did this kind of limbo situation last?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: It was probably about a year and a half, maybe two.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So were you in a ghetto or were you just</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: This was before the ghetto the time they formed that ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: So in other words, for a year and a half or almost two years</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No, not quite.</span> <span id="s741">Not two years.</span> <span id="s742">About a year, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s744">So it would be from September '39 to September '40, one could say?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s748">Something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: Something like that.</span> <span id="s750">Your you still lived in your own home.</span> <span id="s751">You were under this this occupation regime.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: It was bad but there was no sense yet that the Jews are going to be targeted for some special special treatment in the negative sense?</span> <span id="s754">It was it was bad for everybody?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: We knew because there were a lot of killings taking place.</span> <span id="s756">There was a lot of stuff that was going on.</span> <span id="s757">Being as young as I was, I wasn't aware of a lot of things.</span> <span id="s758">You have to remember, when the war started, I was 12 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s760">Of course.</span> <span id="s761">Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: And I didn't I wasn't aware of no one person what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s764">Yeah.</span> <span id="s765">It would be clues.</span> <span id="s766">It's from your child's memories that I'm trying to get this picture of what things were like.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s768">I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s770">So did life stay the same, pretty much, until the ghetto was formed or were there some incidents before it happened that</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: There were some things before it happened.</span> <span id="s772">They took a lot of people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Tell me what those were.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: Well, they rounded up people.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: And they rounded up people and they just disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: And later on, we found out there were labor camps, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: So how did they round them up?</span> <span id="s780">Did they block off streets or did they go by a list of names?</span> <span id="s781">How did this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: Well, they had names.</span> <span id="s783">The some of the Polish people were turned the Jews in, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: So and they rounded they rounded them up and they disappeared.</span> <span id="s786">And they were brought back for instance, a couple Jewish Polish soldiers, and they killed them because they did something that they didn't like.</span> <span id="s787">So they killed them so everybody can see or that most people can see so that they wouldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">Q: So these why like public executions?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Sort of, yes.</span> <span id="s790">Sort of.</span> <span id="s791">But then then after about a year or so I'm not sure as to the time, you know, that</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: at the place.</span> <span id="s794">They took a Polish two streets and took the Polish people out of there and put the Jewish in there.</span> <span id="s795">And then they had that is where the ghetto was formed.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: And the ghetto was in the small town you were born and grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: In the small town, yes.</span> <span id="s798">Another part of town where I used to live or another a part of what is called, quote, downtown area.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s800">Okay.</span> <span id="s801">And so did you have to move into those two streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s803">Yes.</span> <span id="s804">We had to move in.</span> <span id="s805">We had to have one room.</span> <span id="s806">We shared a place with another family.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Was there indoor plumbing?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: You know, I do not recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: The most people didn't have it.</span> <span id="s811">This was a newer house.</span> <span id="s812">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: I don't think so.</span> <span id="s815">And they formed a ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: Before they formed the ghetto, were you going to school or was school suspended?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: School was suspended for the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s819">And what about the Polish kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A: The Polish kids had school, yes.</span> <span id="s821">They had schools for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s823">So during the day, you just hung out at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: I mean, what where can you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: No place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: And your father was with you when you moved into the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: He was with us.</span> <span id="s833">And moved into one room.</span> <span id="s834">There was five of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: And we had a little kitchen, you know, a small little kitchen.</span> <span id="s837">But that was the extent of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: And so the ghetto, when they took out people, like myself I was, like, again, 12, 13 years old at that time.</span> <span id="s840">And they put me to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: And what was what did you have to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: My job was I was an electric welder.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: An electric welder?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Welder.</span> <span id="s845">They showed me how to do it and I was welding the wheelbarrows.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: You were welding wheelbarrows?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: Right.</span> <span id="s848">So they they produced they have that iron now.</span> <span id="s849">They had the company there and they hired they got the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: Or the Jewish people, you know, that were working and producing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Well, did you get any kind of pay for this?</span> <span id="s853">Any kind of</span></p> <p><span id="s854">A: Oh, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q: No.</span> <span id="s856">So this was this was forced labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: It was forced labor, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And no food?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: They didn't give us any food.</span> <span id="s860">The food was from the house, whatever you could get.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: And no and no ability to say no?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A: That's correct.</span> <span id="s863">Because if you refused, you weren't around very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s865">What kind of job did your father do?</span> <span id="s866">Was he continuing being a mediator?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s868">He was a mediator to the very end of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And what did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: Not much.</span> <span id="s871">She tried to provide for us.</span> <span id="s872">She tried to keep us fed.</span> <span id="s873">Didn't do much.</span> <span id="s874">There was no nothing that you can do.</span> <span id="s875">You were packed like herrings into a small area.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Did you when you went to work in the morning, did you leave the ghetto area?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: They left we left when we left the ghetto area, we were under guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: They had some Jewish what they call kapos or whatever and the Germans.</span> <span id="s880">They walked with us to the place of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: And the Jewish kapos are these people that you recognized and knew or were they strangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: No; people that we knew.</span> <span id="s883">It wasn't that big of a town that we didn't know people, you know, but yeah, we knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And were they were they harsh?</span> <span id="s885">Were they</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: No.</span> <span id="s887">They just you know, kids are kids everywhere.</span> <span id="s888">They tried to get out of line.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: That's true.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: They put them back, you know.</span> <span id="s891">We didn't realize the enormity of this whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: So but I I don't know how to explain this.</span> <span id="s894">We used to go to work every morning and come home in the evening, and that was going on for quite a while.</span> <span id="s895">And a little bit at the time, they took the Jews and shipped them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">Q: That's when the ghetto gets liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A: Right, a little bit at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: A little bit at a time.</span> <span id="s899">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s902">But and was that something everybody noticed, that another group was gone and another group is gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s904">They what you call they rounded up all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: And they picked out whoever they wanted to pick out to send to the gas chambers or prison camps or such, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: And, again, how was this done when it was a little bit at a time?</span> <span id="s908">Was it by a list or was it you were called to a square and then they would say every tenth person?</span> <span id="s909">How did those people who get rounded up</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: You were called to a square.</span> <span id="s911">Everybody had to appear.</span> <span id="s912">And they picked out I don't know how they went about picking out picking out people.</span> <span id="s913">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s914">And but they did.</span> <span id="s915">Families let's say, mother and father or mother and the kids, and I don't know how they went about doing it.</span> <span id="s916">And my father occasionally was able to get somebody back from what they picked out by buying them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s918">Were there more people who were doing the same thing as your father was doing as a mediator?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s920">Not to my knowledge.</span> <span id="s921">At least I didn't know any.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s923">Yeah.</span> <span id="s924">Well, you told me earlier that there was a story you had to tell me.</span> <span id="s925">It was when I was asking about did you see people being beaten up, did you see people you know, violence in the streets.</span> <span id="s926">And can you tell me what what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: There was violence.</span> <span id="s928">There was a German population that they moved in and they used to beat up the Jewish kids or the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: So it was civilians who would do this, not just Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Civilians and occasionally they had the SS going through there.</span> <span id="s931">And, you know, they picked up people.</span> <span id="s932">They you know, I cannot explain they used to beat them up, and sometimes they picked them up and killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Did you see corpses in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Not at the time that I was in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s935">I saw corpses from starvation.</span> <span id="s936">Occasionally, yes, I did see, but not many.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: They didn't do it in public view, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Except for those two Polish Jewish soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Two Polish Jewish soldiers; brought them in because they called the German soldier and I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s941">And they brought them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">It was a Jewish restaurant before the ghetto.</span> <span id="s943">And they used to the Jewish people used to go there to this what they call a restaurant.</span> <span id="s944">And they brought in this Jewish Polish soldier that he was imprisoned.</span> <span id="s945">He was a POW.</span> <span id="s946">They brought him in to explain what happened, what he did.</span> <span id="s947">And that was the end of him.</span> <span id="s948">After that, we didn't hear of him anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s950">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: So logically speaking, knowing what I know, he didn't make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s953">So but you didn't see this public execution?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Remember, you said that there were a couple who were executed publicly.</span> <span id="s956">So</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: I saw that.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: You saw it?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s960">But I saw within the town.</span> <span id="s961">And they did something, and I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s962">And they just shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s964">That's an awful lot of violence for a 13 year old to see.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Hm, yeah.</span> <span id="s966">It was a bad time.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s968">Yeah.</span> <span id="s969">Did you yourself ever get beat up?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s971">You know, I got hit a couple times across my back.</span> <span id="s972">But that's about it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s974">Were there I remember in the interview that we did in Los Angeles, you know, where where we were only able to speak with you for a short amount of time</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">Q: you did mention something about the son of the German police chief.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: What was that about?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, we only were allowed to walk on one side of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: The other side was for Aryans only.</span> <span id="s982">So here this kid you know, being a kid, again, I went to the other side of the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: The wrong side.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: The wrong side, the one that I'm not supposed to.</span> <span id="s985">But I also wore a (inaudible) with "Jew" on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Oh, you wore the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Yellow star.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: So this kid came and pushed me off and I pushed him back.</span> <span id="s990">And we started hitting each other.</span> <span id="s991">Then he started running.</span> <span id="s992">I cornered him, kind of beat him up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">And next thing I knew, the I found out later he belonged to the police officers police captain or something and they were looking for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: And I was hiding.</span> <span id="s996">Well, after a while they, stopped looking and everything turned out okay.</span> <span id="s997">But, you know, I guess if they would have caught me, I wouldn't laid on seen the light of the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: It could have very easily been that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: So was this before you

announced that any Jew that was being caught, they're going to shoot.</span> <span id="s1077">We heard that from this Polish guy that owned the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: So we didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1080">My suggestion you know, I was then 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1081">My suggestion was to turn ourselves in.</span> <span id="s1082">We have no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: Some of us would survive.</span> <span id="s1085">Most of us

to go to a different town.</span> <span id="s1093">Are you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: I'm here, but I'm kind of shocked.</span> <span id="s1095">So he kind of abandoned his family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: So to speak, yes.</span> <span id="s1097">And because he knew the end result.</span> <span id="s1098">He really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: He didn't talk.</span> <span id="s1101">He knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1102">So the question was: What do we do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1105">And there was a man with his son and his wife ask me.</span> <span id="s1106">I says, you know, I'm 13 years old.</span> <span id="s1107">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: I said, you know, in my opinion, if we turn ourselves in we have absolutely no place to go.</span> <span id="s1110">If we wait days, they catch us, they kill us.</span> <span id="s1111">There's no there was no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1113">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: I says, if we turn ourselves in, some of us have a chance to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: What a hard thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yes, a hard decision to make.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: So as it turned out, they they listened to me and we turned ourselves in to the

<p><span id="s1321">A: And they hung a 15 year old boy who smoked, who worked with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">A: Because he smoked, they hung him.</span> <span id="s1324">So anyhow, we were there for almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Tell me, what kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: The place that we worked was a conglomerate of all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1327">They produced oil, coal extract oil from coal, fuel.</span> <span id="s1328">They cement pipes all over the place.</span> <span id="s1329">They used to bomb this place often.</span> <span id="s1330">I don't know chemicals they used to produce there.</span> <span id="s1331">Our job unloading cement bags of cement, mixing cement.</span> <span id="s1332">These are, you know, things that they can hide like, bunkers, we used to do.</span> <span id="s1333">And when they bombed, they couldn't penetrate the bunkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: So you were there from 1942 to 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: Something like that, you know.</span> <span id="s1336">I you lose track of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s1338">Of course.</span> <span id="s1339">Of course.</span> <span id="s1340">But do you remember if you got there in the fall or in the winter?</span> <span id="s1341">Do you remember the time of year that it was that you finally ended up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Well, let me put it to you this way: What I remember that we were picking fruit at home, whatever we can find.</span> <span id="s1343">And around that time of the year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1345">So it could have been harvest time?</span> <span id="s1346">Could it have been</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">A: Harvest, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">Q: And tell me</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">A: Almost two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: It must have been hell on earth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: Well, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: What did you eat?</span> <span id="s1353">What did they give you to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: They gave us spinach that they had, coal or little pebbles.</span> <span id="s1355">They gave us soup.</span> <span id="s1356">I don't know what it was made out of, but people used to swell, you know, because they ate that soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: And I ate two slices of bread a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: Did a lot of people die just naturally because of exhaustion and hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yes, very much so.</span> <span id="s1361">I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s1362">You know, there's a couple people that I knew.</span> <span id="s1363">One person in particular that I knew ran away from prison.</span> <span id="s1364">He was from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: He went back to Poland and he had no place to go.</span> <span id="s1367">He finally came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: He came back to the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">Q: To the labor camp.</span> <span id="s1371">Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: So when he came back, the Germans let him run, told him to run.</span> <span id="s1373">And they used the German shepherds.</span> <span id="s1374">And the only thing that I heard is a little scream, and that was the end of that person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: So this goes to show you cruelty of</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Tell me, did your brother and you stay together?</span> <span id="s1380">Were you able to stay together during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: What was</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: We kind of took care of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Do you think that yeah, how do you how do you explain that you survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: Well, we ate what they gave us, which was very little.</span> <span id="s1386">Occasionally, the accountant when we walked to work a Yiddish POW contingent</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: once in a while would send us some bread, threw it at us.</span> <span id="s1389">____________.</span> <span id="s1390">We made the best of it.</span> <span id="s1391">We survived.</span> <span id="s1392">That was the main thing: Survival.</span> <span id="s1393">And sometimes at work, we had a guard that was very old that was probably in his late 60s or mid 60s that he used to give us some soup from time to time, a German guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1396">And he was from the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s1397">And he was from Austria, an Austrian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">Q: He was Austrian rather than from Germany proper itself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1400">He was from Austria.</span> <span id="s1401">And he kind of you know, he used to say to us, "Just hang in there.</span> <span id="s1402">It's almost over.</span> <span id="s1403">Hang in there."</span> <span id="s1404">'Cause, you know, he used to he told us about the invasion of Normandy, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: Did he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1407">It was amazing.</span> <span id="s1408">I never could believe it, you know.</span> <span id="s1409">He saw us walk out, throw us a little bit, you know, the best he could, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">Q: So you met</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">A: Anything else than what I just told you, you know ____________________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: But it's so unusual to here have a guard in the forced labor camp do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Yes, it probably was.</span> <span id="s1414">And but decided, you know, he couldn't work anymore anyway because he was evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: But let's just stay those two years in this camp.</span> <span id="s1416">Tell me a little bit about the barracks that you that you lived in and about the daily routine and, you know, how large it was.</span> <span id="s1417">And where was it located?</span> <span id="s1418">Was it in Poland or in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: You know, I don't really know.</span> <span id="s1420">I can tell you this: I went back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Oh, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: Recently, with Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s1424">With your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1426">And we came out to this particular camp where I was.</span> <span id="s1427">I think it was annexed by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: So you think it was a part of Poland that had been annexed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Annexed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1430">Because my home town was annexed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1431">They called it Oberschlesian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1433">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: So because, you know, primarily the industry was coal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: Were the coal mines.</span> <span id="s1437">So I guess they needed coal to produce something there, so where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: When you were you were about to talk about after those two years, and I still wanted to talk some more details about those two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: We were at that time at what they called a Yiddish esvangzva (phonetic) arbeitzlager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: A Yiddish esvangzva arbeitzlager, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">A: So this we were at war for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">End of File One</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Beginning File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1445">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons.</span> <span id="s1446">And so we were talking about the Yiddish Itzvongzaviteslaza (phonetic), which is a Jewish forced labor camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: -- that you were part of.</span> <span id="s1449">And I was asking things like what was the living situation.</span> <span id="s1450">What kind of barracks did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A: We had, we had barracks.</span> <span id="s1452">We were a little bit overcrowded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: With straw mattresses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: With straw mattresses, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: And bunks three high.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">A: So what they -- well, this is where they really kept us.</span> <span id="s1459">And occasionally when somebody, an inspection from Switzerland or Sweden came, we had to get rid of the mattresses.</span> <span id="s1460">Got new mattresses and new straw.</span> <span id="s1461">_________ We had a couple of inspections.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: And when they walked by, they said how are you treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: And of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: You didn't tell them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: (Laughing) Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: So they never really found out anything, did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: No, not at all.</span> <span id="s1470">I think they could see through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: But nothing was said.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So, tell me, was it the same camp commandants the entire time or was there a change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: You know, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1475">I could not, I could not tell you, really, whether it was the same commandant or not but he was -- I know afterwards -- you know, there were also women which was used by the SS, by the military there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: I was going ask you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: There was women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: I was going to ask you were there any women in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Yes, Jewish women.</span> <span id="s1480">Their husbands were prisoners.</span> <span id="s1481">And they used them for their own use.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1483">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">A: And so they -- we were there about, I guess, maybe a year, maybe not, the SS took over.</span> <span id="s1485">And they came in and gave us concentration camp clothing.</span> <span id="s1486">And they put numbers on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: So you were tattooed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: I was tattooed, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: What's your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: 178212.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: 178212.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Did that mean that there were -- you were -- there were at least 17,212 prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s1495">I don't, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s1496">I could not account for anything, you know.</span> <span id="s1497">Really, I can only tell you what I saw and what transpired there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: Were the women ever used for anything else?</span> <span id="s1499">I mean, did they ever have actual jobs or was it they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: -- they were prostituted?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: They were prostituted.</span> <span id="s1503">That's -- I wouldn't -- I didn't want to use that term.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">Q: I know, I know.</span> <span id="s1505">But it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">A: They had husbands there.</span> <span id="s1507">That's the irony of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Well, it's a tragedy and a catastrophe all the way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1510">Then they gave us the concentration camp clothing and I was tattooed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: And we were part of Auschwitz, became part of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1513">Q: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s1514">So then you became one of the subcamps of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1517">Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1518">And so you -- did your treatment change?</span> <span id="s1519">Did the food change?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: The food was the same.</span> <span id="s1521">There were -- only thing, you know, they used to -- they got people, the prisoners, to play music as we marched out and as we came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: You know, there was people that were -- you know, they had people, like Jews from Holland, Jews from France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Jews from just about everywhere.</span> <span id="s1526">The Polish Jews were, I think, the predominant, you know, people, so.</span> <span id="s1527">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">Q: Do you remember the kind of music they were forced to play?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">A: March music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: Marching music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1532">And, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">Q: Was there anybody, in addition to that old guard, was there anybody who behaved in a more humane way towards the prisoners amongst the guards or the, you know, the army or even the SS or were they all pretty brutal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">A: I wouldn't say -- only if they think you committed a crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Like smoking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: Like stealing.</span> <span id="s1539">Things, you know, of that nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: They put you up on the gallows so everybody can watch.</span> <span id="s1542">And we watched quite a bit of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Oh, my dear.</span> <span id="s1544">Oh, my dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Can you hear me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">Q: I can hear you.</span> <span id="s1547">I can hear you.</span> <span id="s1548">Again, but I'm just speechless because I'm trying to imagine a young kid -- I mean, for anybody this would be, this would be horrifying but particularly for young teenage boys, you know, young teenagers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: There was no _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: They took us out.</span> <span id="s1552">We had to watch while they do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: We were beaten up by them but it's something -- I don't know what I did.</span> <span id="s1555">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s1556">I was hit a couple times, you know.</span> <span id="s1557">They hit me over the back, over my rear end, you know, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">Q: And your brother too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: My brother, basically, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: He was with me.</span> <span id="s1562">I tried to protect him the best I could.</span> <span id="s1563">And I did, you know.</span> <span id="s1564">I couldn't do much for him, you know, except we kind of were very close together.</span> <span id="s1565">He -- I slept in the middle bunk and he slept in the down bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1567">On the bottom bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: The bottom bunk.</span> <span id="s1569">And the third person, I don't remember who it was.</span> <span id="s1570">You know, you, you were only fighting for your own life, so, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Did he do the same work that you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1573">He was a year younger than me.</span> <span id="s1574">And he was very skinny.</span> <span id="s1575">He was a little guy, period.</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">A: And I had people from my hometown, you know, kids like myself from my hometown.</span> <span id="s1578">Three sets of brothers, in fact, that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: Three sets of brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: Three set of brothers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: Myself and my brother.</span> <span id="s1583">Another couple, which they -- I don't know whether they're still alive.</span> <span id="s1584">They were their friends.</span> <span id="s1585">We had another set of brothers that were very close to the -- one of the brothers was a _________.</span> <span id="s1586">He was very close friends with Elie Wiesel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1588">And you were in that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1590">He was a scientist who worked for Brooklyn -- the naval yard and died of cancer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: So you kept in touch with them after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1593">In a roundabout way, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1594">Elie Wiesel I haven't seen for -- since we got here.</span> <span id="s1595">Since we left Europe, in fact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: But was he in this camp with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: I met him in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: So were you transferred at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: Yes, we were transferred.</span> <span id="s1602">Let me, let me back up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">Q: Yeah, let's go back to the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">A: Continue the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: We were taken out and the Russian army came close.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: We were taken out and -- to walk.</span> <span id="s1609">So we started walking.</span> <span id="s1610">We slept outdoors.</span> <span id="s1611">And this was, mind you, during the winter season and it was snowing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">A: We kept walking.</span> <span id="s1614">Probably half the people didn't make it.</span> <span id="s1615">Either froze to death or didn't take care of sufficiently.</span> <span id="s1616">I did the best I could.</span> <span id="s1617">I washed myself with snow.</span> <span id="s1618">I told my brother to do the same because you get your blood going.</span> <span id="s1619">And the walk, we walked and walked for probably a couple weeks, maybe more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">Q: My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">A: Time was not of essence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: We tried, you know, we tried to run into the homes.</span> <span id="s1624">We slept in barns.</span> <span id="s1625">From time to time -- we finally, after two, three weeks, we got to a place called Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">Q: Gross-Rosen, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">A: It was sort of, I think, a death camp.</span> <span id="s1628">They packed us in in barracks.</span> <span id="s1629">And, I mean, we were packed.</span> <span id="s1630">The place was filling up almost.</span> <span id="s1631">And I didn't think we were going to make it from there.</span> <span id="s1632">But they took us from there.</span> <span id="s1633">We were there about a week or two weeks.</span> <span id="s1634">Again, time wasn't --</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: -- important anyhow.</span> <span id="s1637">And they took us and packed us on open freight trains to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s1638">Now, come to find out, after the war when I went back with Lisa, that it -- they produced marble in that area.</span> <span id="s1639">They were digging for marble.</span> <span id="s1640">And the place was surrounded but you -- the people outside could not look in.</span> <span id="s1641">No access to it.</span> <span id="s1642">So nobody knew what was going on in that prison camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">They took us.</span> <span id="s1644">Anyhow, they put us on freight trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: And they transported us to Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1648">And Buchenwald is really close to Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Buchenwald is very close to Weimar.</span> <span id="s1650">Well, lo and behold, there were air raids.</span> <span id="s1651">And unfortunately, the U.S. Army didn't know, they of course didn't know who was down there and they bombed that train --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1653">My goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A: -- unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1655">Anyhow, a lot of people passed at that time.</span> <span id="s1656">And then they took us into Weimar to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: So those that survived were taken to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: Buchenwald, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: And we were with kids, with other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: We had two or three barracks or four barracks.</span> <span id="s1663">I don't -- I'm not -- don't remember which, you know.</span> <span id="s1664">And we were on the, I guess on the famous barracks, 66.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1666">What makes them famous?</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1668">I think everybody that I heard about, they were talking about barracks 66.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1670">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: _________ older kids.</span> <span id="s1672">Maybe that was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">A: And anyhow, they gave us a little bit of soup a day and they took us from _________ out, to march us out.</span> <span id="s1675">Then put us back.</span> <span id="s1676">We were supposed to go down for a while.</span> <span id="s1677">And I got so sick that I really begged them to take me away.</span> <span id="s1678">I had, unfortunately, diarrhea so bad --</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Oh, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: -- I could no longer take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: Oh, dear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: So they took me into a -- I'm shaky.</span> <span id="s1683">They took me into a barrack with a lot of, a lot of kids.</span> <span id="s1684">I think -- what I saw was mostly kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">Q: Was it an infirmary or what should have been an infirmary?</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">A: It was barracks set up for that purpose.</span> <span id="s1687">I don't know -- I can tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s1688">They took so many people out every day and they didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Oh, my goodnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: After the war, I found out they were giving them -- they were killing them by giving them an injection.</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: Now, what happened to me is I kind of lucked out.</span> <span id="s1693">There was a man that came up to me that was working there.</span> <span id="s1694">Whether he was Jewish or not, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1695">Whether he was a doctor, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1696">So he came, of all the kids, he came up to me and he said, "How old are you?"</span> <span id="s1697">I said, "Sixteen."</span> <span id="s1698">He says, "You have a long life ahead of you.</span> <span id="s1699">Let me see what I can do for you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s1701">So what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: Well, let me get my composure.</span> <span id="s1703">I'm just, I'm choking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Shall we pause for a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1707">I'm going to pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Just take a few minutes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1710">I'll pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1713">This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons.</span> <span id="s1714">Okay.</span> <span id="s1715">I'm back.</span> <span id="s1716">So he came -- I was asking you, what did this man do to help save you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: I don't remember if he was a doctor or not.</span> <span id="s1718">But anyhow, he says, "I'm going to see what I can do for you."</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: He said, "Let me take your stool."</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Which he took my stool and he took it.</span> <span id="s1723">Wherever he took it, I don't know.</span> <span id="s1724">He came back a few days later, which I was lucky they didn't put me into that room where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: He says, "I think I can help you."</span> <span id="s1727">So he took me out and put me on a two-wheel transportation thing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">A: Like a wheelbarrow.</span> <span id="s1730">And he took me out.</span> <span id="s1731">They took me to a hospital.</span> <span id="s1732">I guess -- there were beds there, bunks, and things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: Within Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: It was in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">A: They had other prisoners there, international prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">A: So they used these hospital primarily for non-Jews, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">A: Occasionally they did have, like myself, they took me in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">In comes a guy with an injection.</span> <span id="s1742">It looked to me like it was a foot long.</span> <span id="s1743">He gave me an injection.</span> <span id="s1744">He says, "That will make you feel better."</span> <span id="s1745">And they started giving me, I forgot what they call this, like a very plain cereal that you cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1747">Could it have been, like, farina or cream of wheat?</span> <span id="s1748">I mean, whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Cream of wheat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q:-- the generic name would be?</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Cream of -- this is what they fed me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: And I gained a little weight.</span> <span id="s1754">And I got news out to my brother, my brother was in the barracks, 66, to see whether he can come.</span> <span id="s1755">And I gave him some food.</span> <span id="s1756">And they put me back, sort of, together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1758">How long did you stay there in that room with those --</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: I couldn't even tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1762">When I got a little better, they sent me back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s1763">And by that time, the closing of the war was just about beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">A: So we were there, I don't know how long I was still there, and the war was coming to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: All of a sudden -- we used to hear the artillery from far away.</span> <span id="s1768">It was -- I forgot the word for this.</span> <span id="s1769">Erfurt.</span> <span id="s1770">It was called Erfurt, the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q: Erfurt is a town, yes, a small city.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: Erfurt, we used to hear the artillery.</span> <span id="s1773">They were firing across to Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: And so we used to hear the cannons.</span> <span id="s1776">And all of a sudden, we had a plane that came in, a tank that came in with U.S. soldiers.</span> <span id="s1777">This was quite a while later.</span> <span id="s1778">And they took out people.</span> <span id="s1779">They took them out and never heard from them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: So this is a tank, a German tank.</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">Q: This is a U.S. tank?</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">A: No, it was -- yeah, it was made in the -- I was there for quite a while longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">A: And then when the war was coming to an end, they broke through the lines, I suppose, from Erfurt --</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: -- the U.S. military, the Third Army moved up and took over Weimar and they came in to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">Q: So, in other words, the Americans liberated you in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">A: The Americans liberated us in Buchenwald, yes.</span> <span id="s1790">But it took -- it's a longer story than that because they used to take out people out of the prison camp, either kill them or get rid of them.</span> <span id="s1791">I don't know what they did with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: When you're talking about they took them out, who took them out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: The Germans took them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: That's what I thought.</span> <span id="s1795">Okay.</span> <span id="s1796">So the Germans --</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Before the U.S. came, the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">Q: Before they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">A: Before they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">A: They took out, in fact, one of them, a person, my hometown, their father they took out.</span> <span id="s1802">But he was _________.</span> <span id="s1803">For some reason or another, they kept the kids intact.</span> <span id="s1804">The prisoners themselves were political prisoners, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1805">They made sure that these kids, these Jewish kids, that they kept in barracks 66, 64, 65 got maintained.</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: They took, they sort of took care of them.</span> <span id="s1808">I found out later.</span> <span id="s1809">I didn't know that.</span> <span id="s1810">And so the U.S. Army moved in and here we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: What was that like?</span> <span id="s1812">My God, three, almost three years then that you had been in the camp system, that you had been under such conditions.</span> <span id="s1813">And all of a sudden, these GIs appear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: The GIs, yeah.</span> <span id="s1815">Let me just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: We can stop.</span> <span id="s1817">Hang on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1821">They came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: They came in.</span> <span id="s1823">There were mostly Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1824">And I understand, from what I heard and what I saw, was some non-Jewish kids too among the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: And they took over.</span> <span id="s1827">They fed us.</span> <span id="s1828">Put us, really, back together to help and the really, whoever with tuberculosis, with TB --</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: -- was sent to Switzerland, to Sweden, to Germany into the mountains.</span> <span id="s1831">And they took a group of kids that the French government okayed it and they took us to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: So you went to France?</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: With your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: One brother and -- there was about three sets of brothers the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Who also went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: _________.</span> <span id="s1838">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">A: They took us by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: They took you by train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1843">When the U.S. Army moved in, they had a rabbi that came over and took the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1844">And some of them were non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1845">And they had a segment of the kids that they sent to France, they sent them to Switzerland, to England.</span> <span id="s1846">You know, whichever country took them in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1848">So you end up in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: I end up in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">Q: Before we go to France, what was in France, tell me, when you were in Buchenwald and right before the Americans come, what happened with the German guards and the German authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">A: Well, the German authority were -- for instance, you know, I was sick.</span> <span id="s1852">I came out of the hospital and I was laying there on one of the bunks, so to speak, like a shelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: And there was a window and glass and I used to, I watched the main road.</span> <span id="s1855">All of a sudden I saw tanks moving up in that glass.</span> <span id="s1856">It was like a mirror reflection in the glass.</span> <span id="s1857">And I knew the U.S. Army is moving in.</span> <span id="s1858">So when they came in, they took the kids.</span> <span id="s1859">And the rabbis, the priests, they gave them, you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">A: -- food.</span> <span id="s1862">They gave them medicine.</span> <span id="s1863">And some of them had to be hospitalized and they brought us back sort of together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: And, you know, back to health, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1866">And they sorted out kids to go to France, it had to do with their health also, to England, and to some other countries, you know, that they -- I don't know all the countries that the kids went to, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A: But they spread them out.</span> <span id="s1869">Each country took in so many kids, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: But I was backing up to ask you what had happened to all of the German guards.</span> <span id="s1871">Did they disappear?</span> <span id="s1872">Were they arrested?</span> <span id="s1873">Did they run away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: The Germans had jumped off the towers --</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">Q: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: -- during that because -- the guard towers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">A: And they started running.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">A: If the GIs came up on one of them, they killed them, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">Q: Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: They were running away from the prison, period.</span> <span id="s1883">And I guess, I don't know who they caught, the main commandant was caught by the U.S. Army.</span> <span id="s1884">The main people that were caught, the same thing.</span> <span id="s1885">They had sort of a mini revolution within that prison because there were a lot of Germans that worked in that prison also that were there for many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: Germans that were not Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s1889">Political prisoners.</span> <span id="s1890">There were a lot of political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">A: Political prisoners that were put in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1893">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">A: But they're the ones primarily that run that prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1896">Did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: Had access to armament.</span> <span id="s1898">There was a munition factory --</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: -- and an armament factory in one of the prisons down the road.</span> <span id="s1901">And they had a man over there that _________ worked in that prison, the munition factory.</span> <span id="s1902">And one of them was Leon Blum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1904">Well, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: I don't know whether he survived or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: But he was one of the people that was in that.</span> <span id="s1908">But _________ prison, the armament.</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: And the U.S. Air Force bombed it.</span> <span id="s1911">And after that, I don't know what happened to the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1913">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1914">So you end up in Paris.</span> <span id="s1915">I mean, excuse me, in France.</span> <span id="s1916">Was it Paris or was it somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A: Yeah, they dispersed all the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: They dispersed the kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: Some of them went into _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Others went into a religious home.</span> <span id="s1924">They had -- they divided them, you know, in different homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">A: Then they had, I want to say they had homes for the French kids also there.</span> <span id="s1927">So they put them together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Jewish kids that had, you know, that survived the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: The French kids.</span> <span id="s1932">One of my friends -- and the OSE took over.</span> <span id="s1933">I don't know whether you're familiar with the OSE.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Well, tell me about it.</span> <span id="s1935">What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: OSE was an organization that was from, I guess -- a French organization which took care of the kids to make sure they go to school and some of them had trades and they paid for the education.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Was it a government organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: Was it a Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: It was a Jewish organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Primarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s1943">I don't know whether it was totally Jewish.</span> <span id="s1944">It was like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: How do you spell the acronym?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1947">It was initials O-S-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: O-S-E, okay.</span> <span id="s1949">Okay.</span> <span

millionaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s1955">And what about you?</span> <span id="s1956">When you got off the train, what kind of a place were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: I went into a Jewish religious situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: Even though I wasn't religious, I went into that home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">A: I don't know.</span> <span id="s1962">I don't know what I was thinking.</span> <span id="s1963">And I started going to school a little bit and then I returned to the United States in 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: So you were in France for, let's say, almost two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Almost.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: Did you learn --</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: I would say a year and a half.</span> <span id="s1968">April, in April, to be specific, April the 11th was my freedom day in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: Well, those kind of dates you don't forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: April 11th was freedom.</span> <span id="s1972">And was your brother with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: My brother was with me and there were other two sets of brothers, one of the brothers of the father that they took out and disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s1975">That's right.</span> <span id="s1976">So did your brother go with you to France as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s1978">He was with me all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: He was with me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Same school, same everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: He was in the same religious family, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1985">It wasn't a family.</span> <span id="s1986">It was a home --</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">Q: It was a home.</span> <span id="s1988">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1989">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">A: -- for religious kids, I think donated by the Rothschild family --</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: -- you know, for the kids to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1994">The Rothschilds, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: And they had Jewish religion, Jewish food, and Jewish upbringing, so to speak, you know.</span> <span id="s1996">And, like, again, like Elie Wiesel was there also with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1998">So is that where you met him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: That's where I met him, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2001">Okay.</span> <span id="s2002">Did you learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: Did you learn French?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2006">I went to French school.</span> <span id="s2007">You know, it's been a long, long time.</span> <span id="s2008">I still speak it but I'm a little rusty on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: Well, but it's such a huge change, where one month you were a prisoner in a concentration camp and month and a half later you're in a home in France and the following September you go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: It wasn't just like that.</span> <span id="s2011">First of all, I don't know the time --</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: -- you know, the time it took.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: After liberation, again, after a while, we went to Switzerland, went off.</span> <span id="s2016">A Jewish serviceman, who was a rabbi, he saw to it that the French government, they picked out certain kids that were, I guess, a little healthier then a lot of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: -- and, you know, designated for France.</span> <span id="s2019">We were there _________ for several months before we left for France.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Oh, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2022">I don't know about several months.</span> <span id="s2023">Maybe a couple months.</span> <span id="s2024">Three months.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2026">But you were there for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Just for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">A: Again, the time wasn't important to me then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">A: So then they picked kids to go, the sick kids, some of them went to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Some of them went to Switzerland that had TB so, you know, to get -- to recuperate.</span> <span id="s2034">Myself and my brother and a whole bunch of other kids, I don't know how many it was, we were designated to go to France.</span> <span id="s2035">And when we came to France, we had doctors --</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">A: -- that checked us over.</span> <span id="s2038">And they placed us in sort of a vacation home in the country, which was also one of the Rothschilds' homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2041">And so we were there for a while.</span> <span id="s2042">The time element, I just don't, couldn't tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2044">That's okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">A: Then we went back to Versailles.</span> <span id="s2046">We went to Versailles, rather, back -- the first time.</span> <span id="s2047">We went to Versailles.</span> <span id="s2048">And then they sent us to school, to public school.</span> <span id="s2049">Some of them had families, they found families in the U.S.</span> <span id="s2050">Some of them found each other.</span> <span id="s2051">We had French kids also for a while but very few of them, what we did have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">Q: Well, in 1945 -- you say your birthday is in August.</span> <span id="s2053">So in 1945 you turned 18 years old, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Actually, I -- the truth of the matter, I was born in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2056">You born in October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2059">So it's October --</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: The reason for August is

id="s2063">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">A: -- read it as August.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Because it's very similar.</span> <span id="s2067">And he misread it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2069">So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: So I just let it go.</span> <span id="s2071">I didn't want to change it.</span> <span id="s2072">I changed the name but I didn't change the date.</span> <span id="s2073">It was a couple months.</span> <span id="s2074">It didn't matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2076">Okay.</span> <span id="s2077">So officially you were born --</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">Q: -- August 15th but

here's my question.</span> <span id="s2088">By August 15th, 1945, you are free.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: And -- but for one --</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">A: No, in April.</span> <span id="s2092">We were freed in April.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Correct.</span> <span id="s2094">Correct.</span> <span id="s2095">But what I want to say is, at age 18, one-third of your life had been spent in, one could say, absolute fear from the time the war started, when you were 12, and it started just a -- you know, just before your 12th birthday --</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: -- on September 1st.</span> <span id="s2098">And I wonder what kind of a person you were at age 18, you know, having gone through all that.</span> <span id="s2099">How would you describe yourself at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: You know, I had here an uncle.</span> <span id="s2101">And also an aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">A: I didn't know much about the aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: But my uncle, when he found me in the newspaper, he found the name in the newspaper --</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: -- wrote me a letter.</span> <span id="s2108">He couldn't write nothing else but Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: So he wrote me this letter and asked who my family is.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A: It turned out that I was his sister's kids, me and my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: So, in other words, your mother's brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: My mother's brother was in the U.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s2116">Had you known about him before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">A: No.</span> <span id="s2118">I knew she has a brother but I didn't know where and what.</span> <span id="s2119">I didn't know even how to go about it anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: There was -- he was illiterate.</span> <span id="s2122">Excuse me just a minute.</span> <span id="s2123">I need to cough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A: Are you on

didn't know where he was but they told me _________.</span> <span id="s2134">He was illiterate.</span> <span id="s2135">Only he knew how to write in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: He came and found a job as a weaver.</span> <span id="s2138">A weaver is people that make cloth _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: That's right, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: And he worked for Botany 500, which is a famous company.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: What kind of company?</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">A: Botany 500.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Botany 500?</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2145">They went out of business now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2147">A: Because of the innovation of the mechanical, you know, that they have.</span> <span id="s2148">The factories, you know, they run it on electricity but -- so he worked for them for many, many years because at home he was trained as a weaver, weaving fabrics.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s2152">Do you want to take a pause?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2154">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2156">We'll pause a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">(Pause)</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2161">So we're continuing.</span> <span id="s2162">And you're saying your uncle was a weaver here for many years in the United States.</span> <span id="s2163">And he found you through a newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: _________</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: He spoke to you and asked if you were so and so's son and it turns out that he was your mother's brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: So what happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Well, he didn't have money.</span> <span id="s2169">He was a very poor man but had a soul.</span> <span id="s2170">But he -- I don't know where he went.</span> <span id="s2171">I understand he went to the people that make matzo.</span> <span id="s2172">And they supposedly had signed papers for me and my brother.</span> <span id="s2173">And the thing was, you know, we communicated at that time in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2175">A: Which I can still, I guess I can still write.</span> <span id="s2176">But I don't use it.</span> <span id="s2177">But at any rate, he -- I -- he sent me papers, immigration papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: The matzo company signed that I would be important in the government, which is a normal thing for immigrants.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: So they guaranteed you.</span> <span id="s2181">The matzo company gave their guarantee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">Q: They were like your official sponsors.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: They were official sponsor.</span> <span id="s2185">So I got the papers and of course the people in France --</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: -- made sure that everything goes smooth.</span> <span id="s2188">We went to the American consulate, x-ray taken, so on and so forth.</span> <span id="s2189">And we got immigration papers.</span> <span id="s2190">For whatever reason, they said that we have to hurry up and be in Sweden by such and such a date --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">A: -- getting on a ship to go to the U.S.</span> <span id="s2193">So we got on a train and we went to Sweden, a whole bunch of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">A: I don't know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A: They put us on the ship, a Swedish ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q: Do you remember the name of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A: You know something?</span> <span id="s2200">It kind of -- yes, I do but it slipped my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Not right now.</span> <span id="s2202">That's okay.</span> <span id="s2203">That's not a problem.</span> <span id="s2204">So, anyway, they put you on this ship and you're on your way to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">A: That ship was a troop ship during the war.</span> <span id="s2206">That I know.</span> <span id="s2207">In fact, I have probably a picture of it too.</span></p> <p><span id="s2208">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2209">A: Excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: There are a couple of them that were pretty famous but the names slips my mind as well.</span> <span id="s2211">One of the first ships out of Europe was used for military purposes.</span> <span id="s2212">Anyway, was it a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: That was a ship _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: -- Swedish ship or a U.S. ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: It was, yeah, made into a troop ship or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: Yes, but was it -- belonged to the Americans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: I don't know who it belonged to.</span> <span id="s2218">It had the Swedish name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">A: It was a Swedish ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: As far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2224">Got it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: We got the papers.</span> <span id="s2226">Put us on the train.</span> <span id="s2227">And we came to Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: We went all through Germany, which was bombed out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A: We finally got to Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s2232">And from Copenhagen we went to -- I guess by train.</span> <span id="s2233">The train.</span> <span id="s2234">Got on the ship and took us across the waters and wound up in Gothenburg, Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">Q: I remember, yes, it's the tip of Sweden.</span> <span id="s2236">The bottom part, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2238">So in Gothenburg, we boarded the ship to the U.S. And I don't know how many days it took.</span> <span id="s2239">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s2240">And believe it or not, we wound up in New York City.</span> <span id="s2241">The ship pulled up to dock.</span> <span id="s2242">And it docked.</span> <span id="s2243">And my uncle was supposed to come to get us.</span> <span id="s2244">Well, he couldn't.</span> <span id="s2245">We got off the ship.</span> <span id="s2246">We don't have -- we have just clothes what we had on.</span> <span id="s2247">We thought, well, when we get to the U.S., we'll buy new clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: So we tossed most of the stuff in the ocean.</span> <span id="s2250">And we got off the ship.</span> <span id="s2251">My uncle isn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: That was the good question.</span> <span id="s2254">The question was what do I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2255">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">A: But apparently he had enough sense to call one of the Jewish organizations in New York.</span> <span id="s2257">I can't remember which one.</span> <span id="s2258">They came and picked us up after a while.</span> <span id="s2259">And we spent some time there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">Q: Where did your uncle live, by the way?</span> <span id="s2261">What part of the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: New York City.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: Your uncle lived in New York but he wasn't able to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2265">My uncle lived in Paterson, New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: He lived in Paterson, New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2269">A: So we went there and they gave us -- you know, I smoked so they gave us, they gave me cigarettes.</span> <span id="s2270">Brought us some clothing, this organization.</span> <span id="s2271">Was it HIAS?</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: HIAS could very well be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A: Or one of the organizations similar to HIAS.</span> <span id="s2274">Or HIAS itself.</span> <span

to work that picked him up that lived in Los Banos, California.</span> <span id="s2317">It was a cotton -- a Jewish guy, who was an American.</span> <span id="s2318">He owned a cotton farm.</span> <span id="s2319">And he was going to take him and educate him, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">Q: Clear across the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">A: Clear across the country.</span> <span id="s2322">And myself, I went to school.</span> <span id="s2323">Tried to learn English.</span> <span id="s2324">And of course I met some people and, you know, so on and so forth.</span> <span

id="s2369">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">Q: When you turned 18, tell me, what kind of a person were you?</span> <span id="s2371">I mean, most 18-year-olds today are still -- you can't call them kids anymore but they're not yet adults and yet you had seen so much.</span> <span id="s2372">You had been through so much.</span> <span id="s2373">How do you describe the person who turned 18 years old in 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: I think you grow up fast.</span> <span id="s2375">I had a responsibility to my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: And he was really little, skinny and little.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: So if because of the war, he's that little, the nourishment --</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: -- or by genes, but he didn't grow too tall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: And, you know, I wanted him to go to school.</span> <span id="s2384">He was smart.</span> <span id="s2385">And I would be going to work, you know, and just keep him in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: It turn out that this man came to pick him up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: And offered to give him an education.</span> <span id="s2390">And, you know, and he went to Los Banos, California.</span> <span id="s2391">You know, I wasn't very happy in New Jersey because I was of age but I was trying to date.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: And everybody knew me in town.</span> <span id="s2394">Wherever I went, everybody knew me.</span> <span id="s2395">Wherever I'd go --</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">Q: So you didn't have much privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">A: -- the whole town knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: And I got to a job.</span> <span id="s2400">I worked for a man who was from Belgium.</span> <span id="s2401">And one of the reasons he hired me, because I spoke French.</span> <span id="s2402">So, you know, I had a job for a while and I decided New Jersey, Paterson, New Jersey, is not going to be for me because the people, everybody knew me in town.</span> <span id="s2403">And I couldn't go out with anybody because everybody knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">A: So I had to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q: No privacy at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">A: I had to behave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: So I left New Jersey and went to California.</span> <span id="s2410">I had $50 in my pocket.</span> <span id="s2411">I bought a ticket.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: How did you get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: On a

Angeles.</span> <span id="s2417">So I got in touch with him.</span> <span id="s2418">And he gave me a place to stay.</span> <span id="s2419">And I kept going to school.</span> <span id="s2420">I went to high school, going to school, kept going, because I wanted to learn the language, get some education, get some knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: And I kept going until about 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Lo and behold, the Korean War broke out.</span> <span id="s2425">And me and my brother, who had left the United States and went to Israel, you know -- I forgot this part.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">A: He went to Israel and he couldn't get a

independence was in the works.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: So he joined the army.</span> <span id="s2438">He didn't tell me where he was and I didn't tell him where I went, you know, because I didn't want him to worry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: And so later on, he told me he was in the army.</span> <span id="s2441">He was on the border not too far way.</span> <span id="s2442">Because Israel's not that big.</span> <span id="s2443">Everywhere's a border.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">A: So, anyhow, this is where he was in the army.</span> <span id="s2446">I knew he was in the army but I, you know, I didn't tell him I was in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">Q: You told me, you said this was the early 1950s when the Korean War --</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: The Korean War broke out in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q:

brother's not here.</span> <span id="s2453">When is he coming back.</span> <span id="s2454">Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: He comes back to register with the drafts.</span> <span id="s2457">But anyhow, I registered with the drafts board in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s2458">I had to follow up here to register.</span> <span id="s2459">And I got a notice, a drafts notice.</span> <span id="s2460">Well, again, I was going to school and I had to break the school and I was drafted into the service, in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: And did you fight in the Korean War?</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: I -- no, I wasn't directly involved in the fight because I was the guy behind the lines with the artillery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2464">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: So, you know, I spent some time in Japan, at Okinawa and so on, in the Korean War _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2467">The sound is now muffled again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s2469">Can you hear me now

id="s2567">You know, I didn't want them to know the agony I had been through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2569">Did that change at some point?</span></p> <p><span id="s2570">A: Yes, it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2571">Q: When did it change?</span></p> <p><span id="s2572">A: Well, I was prompted by Lisa, by the kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s2573">Q:

you.</span> <span id="s2577">You know, we didn't know about you.</span> <span id="s2578">So all of a sudden they had interest in me and my life and my past.</span> <span id="s2579">Before that, you know, nobody ever -- I never talked about it.</span> <span id="s2580">They know that -- where I came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s2581">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2582">A: But we never talked

them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: Are the grandchildren interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: They are.</span> <span id="s2591">They are.</span> <span id="s2592">But, you see, I have -- my wife wound up marrying somebody who's not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2594">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: My kids, for the most part, they're not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: So I don't have -- you know, what I mean?</span> <span id="s2598">It's --</span></p> <p><span id="s2599">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s2600">It's not, it's not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2601">A: It's sort of --</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: -- a different situation here.</span> <span id="s2604">Who are you going to talk to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: When your brother was still alive, did you talk to him about the past, because you both had been through it together, or did you not talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Well, we talked very little about it because we both went through the same thing so, you know, there was really not a lot to talk about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2607">Q: You both knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2608">A: You know, we just kept it in.</span> <span id="s2609">And my brother in particular, he wouldn't talk about anything, you see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">A: I finally started talking and, you know, and started telling and -- but he didn't.</span> <span id="s2612">He didn't want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: Tell me, when you did start talking and telling, did it change you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">A: Change me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">Q: I'm asking, did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">Q: Did it change your relationship with your kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2618">A: No, it didn't change.</span> <span id="s2619">They have sympathy or -- what is the other word.</span> <span id="s2620">I don't remember the word but they have, they were sympathetic to what I went through.</span> <span id="s2621">They wanted to know more about it when they got older.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">A: And, well, when you go through, I guess, a marriage, I wound up broke after so many years --</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: -- what do you do.</span> <span id="s2626">I couldn't take them where I wanted to take them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2627">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2628">A: So Lisa suggested let's do this and this and this.</span> <span id="s2629">And I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: So you went back with Lisa?</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: I went back with Lisa one time, Lisa and my son.</span> <span id="s2632">Then I went back another time to Poland.</span> <span id="s2633">It was my granddaughter -- no, grandson, rather, and my son and Lisa and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">Q: And what kind of -- you know, did you go back to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">A: I went back to my hometown.</span> <span id="s2636">I showed them where I lived.</span> <span id="s2637">It's so often that the night was -- we got there late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s2638">I couldn't show them the main town.</span> <span id="s2639">We showed them the area where the ghetto was was still fenced up, sort of.</span> <span id="s2640">And I guess -- I don't think anybody's living there now --</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">A: -- after so many years.</span> <span id="s2643">And so we went through the killing camps.</span> <span id="s2644">The first one, which was Blechhammer, Gross-Rosen, and Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2645">So there was not -- you go through this and you really don't see what really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">Q: No, it's so many years later but nevertheless, it's the same -- it is back in the area, back in the places where it all happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">Q: And I can't imagine that it wouldn't have made an impression on them, that it wouldn't have had great meaning for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">A: It did make an impression, mostly Lisa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2650">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: My son, I don't really know whether it made that much of an impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s2652">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2653">Well, what about you?</span> <span id="s2654">When you went back, was it like it was in your memory?</span> <span id="s2655">What kind of impression did you have of your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">A: My hometown, if I could have disappeared when I was a baby, I would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">A: That's how I felt about my hometown, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">A: But there was nothing there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">Q: Have you spoken at schools?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: Have you spoken in classrooms to young kids?</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2666">Or to teenagers?</span> <span id="s2667">Or has it been mostly when you talk now, it's been to your own family members?</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">A: To my own family members.</span> <span id="s2669">You know, there's another situation, that some people that project themselves, that did well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: -- I happen to know one or two, that did well financially and they try to project themselves as the people that it happened to.</span> <span id="s2672">So they want to write a book and they want to do this, they want to do that.</span> <span id="s2673">And everybody else is left behind.</span> <span id="s2674">So they do that and they come in the forefront of all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2676">That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: And they went to schools right here in _________ --</span></p> <p><span id="s2678">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">A: -- you know, and teach in schools, you know _________.</span> <span id="s2680">Unfortunately, the way I see it, some of these people that go to the school and teaching of what happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">A: -- don't tell them the whole story.</span> <span id="s2683">They make up some of the stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: There's always a danger that that can be, you know.</span> <span id="s2685">Sometimes people remember things differently but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">A: You remember things differently but also this guy, this person is in the forefront.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: He wrote a book.</span> <span id="s2689">He's pushing himself.</span> <span id="s2690">Like he went to see the governor and _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: I think I know what you're saying, is that you found that a little bit distasteful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: Pushing themselves out in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">A: And you're kind of left behind if you're a little reserved, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2696">A: And so people call him.</span> <span id="s2697">You know, they know that, so.</span> <span id="s2698">I don't know.</span> <span id="s2699">I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: Have you ever, have you ever given an interview to a newspaper before?</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s2702">In fact, there was a man here that was in the newspaper business -- not in the newspaper business.</span> <span id="s2703">He worked for the newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">A: He worked for the newspaper.</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">Q: He was a reporter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">A: He came to me and asked me because what happened in Buchenwald itself --</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2709">A: -- I have seen -- first, if you're a kid, you move around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2710">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2711">A: They have a, they had a -- I don't know how you say it in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2712">Q: In Dutch, Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2713">A: They have a quarry, rather --</span></p> <p><span id="s2714">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">A: -- that they were getting stones.</span> <span id="s2716">I don't know for what purpose.</span> <span id="s2717">Probably for making cement or whatever.</span> <span id="s2718">And they buried artifacts.</span> <span id="s2719">And what I mean, artifacts, what I have seen is primarily jewelry, cases and cases and cases of jewelry that, military trucks that drove up and they loaded all that stuff up and _________.</span> <span id="s2720">And they had GIs with machine guns guarding all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s2721">Q: And this would be at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">A: At Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s2723">And I told him the story.</span> <span id="s2724">And he was going to write.</span> <span id="s2725">And his bosses said you can't do that because you'd be accusing the government.</span> <span id="s2726">It disappeared.</span> <span id="s2727">Nobody knows where it's at.</span> <span id="s2728">It disappeared.</span> <span id="s2729">What that was _________.</span> <span id="s2730">Nobody knows why.</span> <span id="s2731">And, you know, he says do you have any witnesses.</span> <span id="s2732">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2733">I called up.</span> <span id="s2734">They probably have their story too, you know, the Kaleckshtaund (phonetic) in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2736">A: We had one in France, a couple brothers from my hometown _________ with me.</span> <span id="s2737">They witnessed that.</span> <span id="s2738">They told them.</span> <span id="s2739">There are a couple of other people that I met that were there at the same time I was, you know.</span> <span id="s2740">And that didn't do it.</span> <span id="s2741">He says the government would be accused of what.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">Q: Well, it could be that it was sold -- either they gave -- either they transported that jewelry and gave it up to the government or the soldiers themselves just took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">A: I got to tell you, people went over there after they left and they found all kinds of stuff buried in the ground because they stepped on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">Q: So you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">A: Whole cases opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">Q: So you're saying jewelry that was buried in the ground on the site of Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">A: On the site of Buchenwald in the quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2748">Q: Yeah, in the quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">A: And knowing what I knew after the war --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">A: -- what they did is they took five prisoners or ten prisoners to dig these tunnels, you know, to bury that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: And then they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">Q: You're talking about the Germans who did this before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">Q: I mean before the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s2757">A: Before the war ended.</span> <span id="s2758">During the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">A: We were still prisoners.</span> <span id="s2761">They dug these tunnels and they killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2762">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">A: So there would be no witnesses.</span> <span id="s2764">The guards who came forward and said, told the story was a German --</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2766">A: -- that -- who saw what happened.</span> <span id="s2767">So they started digging and they found all this.</span> <span id="s2768">And the little reporter, he didn't want to write it because you're accusing the government of hiding things or stealing things.</span> <span id="s2769">He says you can't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">Q: So this was the interview that you gave to a newspaper man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2771">A: The newspaper man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2772">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2773">And it never went anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">A: Never went anywhere.</span> <span id="s2775">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">Q: Well, I'm grateful that you have spoken with us today, you know, that you have wanted to get your story recorded by the Holocaust Museum here in Washington, D.C. We're very, very appreciative that you've done it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2777">A: You know, I tell you, my mother was an angel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">A: And my mother, when she said that, I have never forgotten what she said to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2781">Those were amazing words, an amazing, and an amazing sacrifice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">A: And she said to me, go save yourself.</span> <span id="s2783">Then I tell her I can die alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2785">I'm glad that you shared that.</span> <span id="s2786">And I'm glad that other people will be able to hear that and know that about her when they'll be able to listen to your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s2787">A: I'm very appreciative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">Q: Is there anything else you would want to add to what we've talked about today?</span></p> <p><span id="s2789">A: I don't know what to think of.</span> <span id="s2790">Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">Q: You know, in one interview, you can never catch -- you can never get everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">A: You can't.</span></p> <p><span id="s2793">Q: It's just like that in life.</span> <span id="s2794">It's how -- we've talked for a couple of hours now but, you know, we're talking about your whole life so how can you put all that in a few hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s2795">A: Well, you know, _________ I'm going to add a few things.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2797">A: I don't know whether you can put it in perspective or not.</span> <span id="s2798">But, you know, they used to take people and hang them to teach the people a lesson.</span> <span id="s2799">If you do this, the same thing is going to happen.</span> <span id="s2800">And people started making noises.</span> <span id="s2801">So they had machine guns in the towers and they started firing, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2802">Q: You mean the dying people make noises.</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">A: Not the dying people.</span> <span id="s2804">The dying people were hanging.</span> <span id="s2805">They couldn't make noises.</span> <span id="s2806">They were just swinging.</span> <span id="s2807">But they just, they had guards on the towers --</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2809">A: -- that the prisoners started making noises, anything at all, some movement, they fired right in the crowd, into the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s2811">Wow.</span> <span id="s2812">So you couldn't even show that you were upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">A: Oh, of course not.</span> <span id="s2814">You know, they took you out and they did what they call _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2815">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2816">A: And you had to watch it, you know, the hanging, you know.</span> <span id="s2817">You just couldn't stay in the barracks.</span> <span id="s2818">You had to watch the whole episode.</span> <span id="s2819">And this 15-year-old kid that worked with me and smoked cigarettes and they caught him doing it, even though I did also, he wouldn't tell them that and they hung him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">Q: Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">A: A French kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2822">Q: Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2823">Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s2824">And there but for the grace of God it could have been you because you smoked as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2825">A: Right.</span> <span id="s2826">And, you know, nearby there was some English prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s2827">And we used to encounter them when we walked to work.</span> <span id="s2828">You know, sometimes we walked the opposite direction.</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">A: And, anyways, in that place --</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">A: -- we end up -- we used to hike.</span> <span id="s2833">We were in an open, open field in the open area and they bombed the hell out of it.</span> <span id="s2834">And they came very frequently because of the fact that they produced oil, fuel --</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">A: -- out of coal.</span> <span id="s2837">They extracted fuel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">Q: So it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2839">A: _________</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">Q: It was a target.</span> <span id="s2841">It was, you know, trying to take up something that could help the German war effort --</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: -- you know, so when they bombed the place, you had no place to go.</span> <span id="s2845">And we were in the open.</span> <span id="s2846">For some reason or another, I walked in through one of the bunkers that they built, that we built for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2847">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">A: They had -- I went in there and for whatever reason they didn't kick me out, this one part.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: And they bombed the hell out of it.</span> <span id="s2851">You know, they -- it just choked.</span> <span id="s2852">They couldn't penetrate.</span> <span id="s2853">It didn't kill anybody except a piece of cement fell on some person there that killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">Q: But it meant that you were a hair's breadth away from death so many times, so many times.</span> <span id="s2855">And it's incredible.</span> <span id="s2856">It's incredible.</span> <span id="s2857">I mean, it gets me -- gives me the sense -- I mean, one of the questions that I have is did you ever not have fear?</span> <span id="s2858">For the entire six years, was there anytime you were not afraid?</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">A: No.</span> <span id="s2860">I was afraid.</span> <span id="s2861">I was afraid for my life.</span> <span id="s2862">I'd run into -- one time during an air raid, I went into a shack --</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: -- you know, that had a shed on top of it.</span> <span id="s2865">And basically people do that for shrapnels.</span> <span id="s2866">The debris starts falling when the bomb explodes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: And they buried all the -- the whole -- there were about ten people there.</span> <span id="s2869">And we were all buried.</span> <span id="s2870">Fortunately enough, another bomb dropped nearby and uncovered us and we found each other right on top of one other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s2872">Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s2873">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: Well, any final thoughts?</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: No.</span> <span id="s2876">I hope it never happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2878">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2879">Well, as I say, I know that it cost -- I know that it's not easy to remember these things but I also, on behalf of the museum, I'm very appreciative that you've taken the time and that you have shared all of this with me today and through us to be able to share it with those who will research and those who will show interest in what happened to people, in the future.</span> <span id="s2880">So with that, I'd like to say that this concludes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">A: Well, excuse me one second.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">Q: Anything else you want to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">A: I only want to add one thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2885">Let's do that before I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">A: I want to go back in time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">A: _________ whole thing.</span> <span id="s2889">But this man that they shot that I told you, they took us out, an old man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: The father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: The father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">Q: The father of those _________.</span></p> <p><span id="s2893">A: The father they shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">A: They had me out there.</span> <span id="s2896">And for whatever reason, you know -- we were against the wall.</span> <span id="s2897">For whatever reason, he just couldn't do it.</span> <span id="s2898">And they told me that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2899">Q: Are you talking when you were in the ghetto, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">A: In the ghetto.</span> <span id="s2901">When the ghetto was closing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: When the ghetto was closing.</span> <span id="s2903">So was it a German soldier who was doing the shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: It could have been a Pole also.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">A: Or a German.</span> <span id="s2907">I don't know who they were, you know.</span> <span id="s2908">It wasn't the SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2910">And it was in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">A: I think they were SA people.</span> <span id="s2912">You know what they are, right, I'm sure?</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s2914">SA?</span></p> <p><span id="s2915">A: SA.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2917">SA, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2919">The SS people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">Q: There were SS and there were SA too, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">A: SA.</span> <span id="s2922">They are the ones who did the shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2924">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2925">A: So anyhow, I didn't have to go for burial.</span> <span id="s2926">You know, I don't know what they did.</span> <span id="s2927">There were about 19, 20 people there that were killed that day -- that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: That's right, in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s2931">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: I know you probably had a burden on you, you know.</span> <span id="s2933">_________ people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">Q: Well, it is -- I'll finish, I'll finish our final statement and we can then talk a little bit more.</span> <span id="s2935">But what I'm going to say right now is that this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons on May 20th, 2014.</span> <span id="s2936">Thank you again, Mr. Ribons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2939">End of File Two</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">Beginning File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Hello.</span> <span id="s2942">This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Jacques Ribons on June 10, 2014, taking place between Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas, Nevada.</span> <span id="s2943">It is a continuation and addition to the interview we conducted with Mr. Ribons on May 20, 2014.</span> <span id="s2944">There were some topics that were omitted from the original interview, and Mr. Ribons would now like to complete that picture.</span> <span id="s2945">So please, Mr. Ribons, let me know what it is that you wanted to add to what you originally talked to us about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: I am not sure that I gave the interview on the subject of a march from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">Q: Let's talk about it in detail, even if it might be in the original interview.</span> <span id="s2948">Tell me about that march and as much as you remember.</span> <span id="s2949">And what about it is significant in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2950">A: Well, the Russian Army came close, took over just about all of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">A: And you can hear the rifle shots, and the Germans took out the whole tent, with the exception of some very sick people that were left there.</span> <span id="s2953">And we start walking.</span> <span id="s2954">We didn't know where we were going or nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: So which camp was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: This was Blechhammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: Blechhammer.</span> <span id="s2958">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">A: So from Blechhammer we walked.</span> <span id="s2960">And every second night or every night, if I remember right, they took us to a farm.</span> <span id="s2961">And we slept outside in the barns, where they had the cows and the pigs, and you know, the prisoners went there to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: And so what time of year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2963">A: What time of year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2965">Was it winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">A: January.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">Q: So it was cold?</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2969">I think it was the month of January.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2971">So was there snow on the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2973">Q: Was it difficult to walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s2974">A: It was difficult to walk.</span> <span id="s2975">Mainly, we walk on the main streets, where the German Army started retreating.</span> <span id="s2976">We walked alongside the ravine, so to speak, you know, alongside that main street.</span> <span id="s2977">And there were guns, but the Russians machine gun the area where the Germans were walking.</span> <span id="s2978">And occasionally, they hit us as we were walking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2979">Q: Can I interrupt just for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">Q: When they machine gun, does that mean they were flying overhead and doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">A: The Russian Air Force was flying overhead and had machine guns, primarily, aimed at the Germans.</span> <span id="s2983">So they had German guards with machine guns watching us.</span> <span id="s2984">So they kind of machine gunned along the line of the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s2985">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2986">So they must have been flying pretty low, and it was nevertheless dangerous because you were walking right next to them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2988">Q: -- on the side of the road?</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s2990">So occasionally, they killed some prisoners.</span> <span id="s2991">I don't think they could have helped it.</span> <span id="s2992">They were aiming at the guards, primarily, and they carried guns, machine guns and rifles and so on to watch the prisoners.</span> <span id="s2993">And we walked.</span> <span id="s2994">Probably every night we stopped.</span> <span id="s2995">We slept outside in the snow.</span> <span id="s2996">And on a Sunday, we wound up in a barn with the cows and pigs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: How were you dressed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: In -- very skimpy, in the prisoners' uniforms that we wore.</span> <span id="s2999">Myself, personally, I had a -- I happened to have a sweater somehow.</span> <span id="s3000">I don't remember how I got it.</span> <span id="s3001">And I wore that sweater.</span> <span id="s3002">And I also wore bags, you know, the empty bags of cement as protection to keep warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">Q: And you would wear that under the uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s3005">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3006">Q: And what kind of footwear did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">A: Myself, I had a pair of boots somehow I got, and there were no soles on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">A: So you know, they were very skimpy.</span> <span id="s3010">It was actually -- you know, we got all wet.</span> <span id="s3011">My feet got all wet.</span> <span id="s3012">And well, I didn't have any shoes.</span> <span id="s3013">So I wrapped, you know, some of the stuff, my feet in cloth, that I could find or whatever I could get, you know, so my feet wouldn't freeze.</span></p> <p><span id="s3014">Q: So when you were walking along the side of the road, and it was January, and there was the machine gunning from the Soviets, and the Germans as well, were there snow drifts?</span> <span id="s3015">Was it loud?</span> <span id="s3016">Was it icy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">A: No.</span> <span id="s3018">We actually walked not on the outside of the road, because it was impossible to walk, but we walked on the main road to the side.</span></p> <p><span id="s3019">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3020">A: And you know, on one side of the street.</span> <span id="s3021">And as we were walking, the Russians, I don't know if willingly or not, the machine gun, primarily, they tried to machine gun the guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">A: And of course, the guards moved in among the prisoners.</span> <span id="s3024">So you know, I guess they must have hit some prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3026">So the guards would realize this, and then they would intermingle with the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">A: With the prisoners, correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3029">And by that point, were there a lot of German guards, or was it few and far between?</span></p> <p><span id="s3030">A: No, it was a lot of guards.</span> <span id="s3031">Again, they carried machine guns.</span> <span id="s3032">However, you know, the roads were full of people going west, because the Russians were right behind us.</span> <span id="s3033">So we could hear rifle shots from time to time.</span> <span id="s3034">So they were very, very close behind us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">Q: So you were about to talk about one Sunday you ended up someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">A: One Sunday, we ended up in a barn.</span> <span id="s3037">I don't know where that was.</span> <span id="s3038">And they gave us coffee.</span> <span id="s3039">And they were shooting, practicing, I guess, either that or shooting at the legs of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s3040">So of course, they fell, and us, we left them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3041">Q: Who was doing the shooting?</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">A: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">Q: The Germans were shooting at the legs of the prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s3044">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3045">Q: As you were drinking coffee?</span></p> <p><span id="s3046">A: Well, we were getting coffee from that big -- what do you call it -- pot, and they were giving the prisoners coffee.</span> <span id="s3047">Well, the prisoners did, but the Germans are the ones that allowed that to happen, the coffee pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3049">A: And as we got the coffee, they were shooting at the legs of the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3050">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">A: So when that happened, of course, they fell.</span> <span id="s3052">They couldn't stand up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3054">A: And we had to leave them behind.</span> <span id="s3055">And I am sure -- I personally didn't see it, but I'm sure they killed them after they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3057">Yeah.</span> <span id="s3058">Did people die as they were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">A: Oh, yes, many, many people.</span> <span id="s3060">They were actually froze to death.</span> <span id="s3061">We had to sleep in the snow.</span> <span id="s3062">Occasionally, on a Sunday -- we walked about three Sundays, and I was able, with my brother and some other kids, get into a barn with the cows and the pigs, you know, and keep warm, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3063">Q: So you were walking for at least three Sundays?</span></p> <p><span id="s3064">A: I believe it was three Sundays.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">Q: So that would mean at least two weeks, maybe more?</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">A: Three weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3067">Q: Three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">A: About two to three weeks.</span> <span id="s3069">And again, I don't know how many prisoners died during that march.</span></p> <p><span id="s3070">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">A: I mean, it must have been an enormous amount of prisoners that passed on.</span> <span id="s3072">I try to -- I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s3073">Q: No, I was going to say, it's the kind of stamina you would need in order to survive that would be very high, and some people just couldn't hold out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3074">A: That's correct.</span> <span id="s3075">We fought for our lives, literally.</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">A: And I was fortunate.</span> <span id="s3078">I was able to make it.</span> <span id="s3079">I tried to help a man that I knew in prison.</span> <span id="s3080">He was from France.</span> <span id="s3081">And his name was Ribak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">Q: Ribak?</span></p> <p><span id="s3083">A: R-I-B-A-C or B-A-K.</span> <span id="s3084">I don't know how he spelled it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">Q: R-I-C --</span></p> <p><span id="s3086">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3087">R -- Ribak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: Oh, R-I-B-A-C-K?</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: R-I-B, yes.</span> <span id="s3090">And I helped him as much as I could, and then I finally gave up.</span> <span id="s3091">I couldn't do it any longer, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s3092">Q: In what way were you trying to help him; by helping him walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">A: By helping him walk.</span> <span id="s3094">Yes, by helping him walk.</span> <span id="s3095">I mean, I knew him in prison.</span> <span id="s3096">We occasionally worked side by side, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">Q: Did anybody try to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">A: Probably.</span> <span id="s3099">I didn't have the stamina.</span> <span id="s3100">I wouldn't know where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3101">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3102">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3103">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3104">A: We were in Germany at the time, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3105">Q: Were there civilians on the road, too?</span> <span id="s3106">I'm sorry I interrupted.</span></p> <p><span id="s3107">A: Oh, yes, there were civilians.</span> <span id="s3108">There were people with push carts and their belongings.</span> <span id="s3109">There were all kinds of people that walked, because they were trying to avoid the Russians, you know, particularly if they were Germans, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3110">Q: It sounds like chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">A: Yes, it was, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3112">And we had Russian prisoners, and you know, all kinds of prisoners walked alongside of us.</span> <span id="s3113">The road wasn't big enough for all of these people that walked, including the German Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">Q: Tell me this, how many lanes did it have, or at least the main roads you were on?</span> <span id="s3115">Were they single lanes, one in each direction, or were they wider than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">A: I believe they were wider than that.</span> <span id="s3117">I'm not sure, you know.</span> <span id="s3118">Again, we were fighting for our lives.</span> <span id="s3119">We didn't pay attention too much of what was going on around us, except, you know, we tried to hide from the bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: You know, and we didn't know they were Russian planes until they came down real low.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: So it was chaos, absolutely chaos.</span></p> <p><span id="s3124">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3125">A: And it was a 250-mile stretch.</span> <span id="s3126">And I took my daughter and my son and my grandson on that stretch from Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen in a van.</span></p> <p><span id="s3127">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3128">A: Just recently about a year ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s3129">Q: So that would be like in 2013?</span></p> <p><span id="s3130">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3131">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3132">Q: So you redid the whole death march walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s3133">A: The whole trip, yes, the whole trip.</span> <span id="s3134">From my hometown where I was born to the trip, all the way to Gross-Rosen and from Gross-Rosen to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s3135">Q: So tell me, the 250 miles, does that go from your hometown to Buchenwald, or does that go just from Blechhammer?</span></p> <p><span id="s3136">A: From Blechhammer to Gross-Rosen was about a 250-mile stretch.</span> <span id="s3137">At least, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s3138">My daughter told me that it was that distance.</span></p> <p><span id="s3139">Q: Of course.</span> <span id="s3140">I mean, at that time, how would you know.</span> <span id="s3141">It took you three weeks or so at that time.</span> <span id="s3142">How long did it take by van when you went?</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: By van, I don't know, about eight hours, ten hours.</span> <span id="s3144">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s3145">I didn't even think of paying attention to that, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3147">A: I drove with my daughter, my grandson and my son.</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">Q: Did any of it look familiar to you, the road, when you went on it again?</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s3150">It was totally changed, because they -- first of all, you know, with so much chaos, you didn't even pay attention to anything, except, you know, you try to survive.</span> <span id="s3151">You know, the food was very scarce.</span> <span id="s3152">I was in one of the areas where you ate in one of the farms that we walked in.</span> <span id="s3153">I saw a house, people, that the farmer, I guess, lived in.</span> <span id="s3154">And I run to the farmer, knocked on their door asking for food, for bread.</span> <span id="s3155">And the commander, so to speak, the person in charge of the prisoners, he said, What are you doing here, in German.</span> <span id="s3156">And I said, I would like to have something to eat.</span> <span id="s3157">So that young woman -- it was a young woman.</span> <span id="s3158">He said, he says, you can give him bread, provided that you sleep with me tonight.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: So she says okay.</span> <span id="s3161">And she gave me a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s3162">And when I went out, I got hit over my back with a cane.</span> <span id="s3163">And I went to my brother, and I gave him half of the bread.</span> <span id="s3164">We ate that just one night, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">Q: Oh, my gosh.</span> <span id="s3166">What a horrible -- what a horrible situation and how cruel, how absolutely cruel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3167">A: It's much crueler than anybody can even anticipate.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s3169">What human beings will do in order to kill the humanity in others.</span></p> <p><span id="s3170">A: Well, I would imagine, you know, it happens all over, even today.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: So the cruelest animal on earth is the human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: Unfortunately.</span> <span id="s3174">Unfortunately.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">A: So anyhow, then we got to Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s3176">We were there for several days.</span> <span id="s3177">We were packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s3178">And we had just a bowl of soup during the day.</span> <span id="s3179">And I don't remember whether we got bread or not.</span> <span id="s3180">We were there for almost about a week.</span> <span id="s3181">And that was Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s3182">And Gross-Rosen was very secluded, because they had -- they were mining marble in that area.</span> <span id="s3183">So the people on the outside couldn't see what was going on there in that -- in Gross-Rosen.</span> <span id="s3184">And you know, after five days or so, a week maybe, maybe longer, they loaded up -- they loaded us up on the freight trains.</span> <span id="s3185">They were going and taking the marble to market, I guess.</span> <span id="s3186">And they loaded up the prisoners on these open freight trains, and they took us.</span> <span id="s3187">We didn't know where we were going, and with guards on them.</span> <span id="s3188">Each car had two guards with machine guns or regular guns.</span> <span id="s3189">I'm not sure what.</span> <span id="s3190">At that time, I wasn't really familiar with the weapons.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3192">Just that they can kill.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3194">So they -- when they loaded us up, we were on the way.</span> <span id="s3195">And we got all the way to Weimar where we were bombed.</span> <span id="s3196">I think the allied's air force made a mistake and didn't know who it was, because they did see guards watching these things, you know, and they bombed the train.</span> <span id="s3197">A lot of Germans, the guards, including the prisoners, were killed, a lot of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3199">And this was allied bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">A: This was allied bombing.</span> <span id="s3201">I don't know what air force that was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">A: But primarily, I think the U.S. Air Force was in that area, or the U.S. Army was in that area, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">Q: Did you ever make it then to Buchenwald –</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">Q: -- or just to Weimar?</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">A: No, we made it into Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s3208">They took us to Buchenwald, and I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s3210">Can I interrupt you for a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s3211">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3212">Q: Did the train go until Weimar, the Town of Weimar, or did it go up to the camp at Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">A: To my knowledge, the railroad into Buchenwald, the railroad tracks, to my knowledge, if I remember right, were bombed out.</span> <span id="s3214">So they took us by truck.</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3216">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: Into Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s3218">It was not all that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s3219">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s3220">It isn't that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s3221">A: So in fact, we used to walk it after the war.</span> <span id="s3222">Because Buchenwald is in the mountains, and this is below the mountain.</span> <span id="s3223">So from there, we were there, I don't know, from January until April.</span></p> <p><span id="s3224">Q: So you were in Buchenwald for all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3225">A: Oh, yes, and we were in what is called a children's barracks.</span> <span id="s3226">It had three -- I think they had three or four barracks where they kept just children.</span> <span id="s3227">And I guess, there was a whole story behind it, because the -- also Germans, since the 1930s, were -- they were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3228">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3229">In Buchenwald, it had had a lot of German political prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s3230">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3231">So they sort of protected, to my knowledge, the kids.</span> <span id="s3232">And at the time that they tried to take the kids out, we went to this appellplatz, and you know, we all lined up.</span> <span id="s3233">And then they took us back to the barracks.</span> <span id="s3234">What happened in the interim, I don't know.</span> <span id="s3235">I guess they had -- they had, within the prison, you know, people that carried guns.</span> <span id="s3236">In fact, outside of Buchenwald, there was an ammunition factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s3237">Q: Now, I'm a little confused at this point.</span> <span id="s3238">When you were in Buchenwald from January to April, --</span></p> <p><span id="s3239">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3240">Q: -- who was in control?</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">A: Well, the Germans were in control.</span> <span id="s3242">However, there also, since the factory where most of the German prisoners worked, and the other prisoners, I don't know which one of the prisoners they kept work in the ammunition factory, they smuggled in a lot of arms, the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3243">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">A: And to my knowledge, they had Germans with guns roaming the prison.</span> <span id="s3245">So I guess, the Germans feared a lot that the prisoners, whether it was the Germans or Russian prisoners, I don't know, but I know there were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s3246">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3247">But when you are saying Germans, are you talking about German political prisoners or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3248">A: German political prisoners that smuggled in arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s3249">Q: Oh, I see what you are saying.</span> <span id="s3250">They were working in the ammunitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s3251">A: In the ammunitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s3252">Q: They were smuggling in some arms that were kept secret from the authorities?</span></p> <p><span id="s3253">A: Absolutely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3254">Q: And yet, they would patrol the place with those arms; is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s3255">A: Not patrol, but they watched.</span> <span id="s3256">As soon as the Germans left, they took over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3257">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3258">As soon as the regular Nazi, you know, they left, then these political prisoners --</span></p> <p><span id="s3259">A: Yes, these political prisoners came out and tried to help -- they were not just Germans.</span> <span id="s3260">They were all kinds of prisoners.</span> <span id="s3261">There were Swedes, and they had Danes.</span> <span id="s3262">I don't know where -- the Danes I can understand, but I don't understand the Swedes, how they got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3263">Q: Yeah, because they are supposed to be neutral.</span></p> <p><span id="s3264">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3265">I don't know how they got there, but they had them there.</span> <span id="s3266">So and the reason I know that to be a fact is because I was hospitalized.</span> <span id="s3267">I had extreme diarrhea that they -- I begged them to take me away already.</span> <span id="s3268">I couldn't take it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s3269">Q: I remember that part in our conversation before, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3270">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3271">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3272">Q: And what was -- what did you do and your brother when you were there?</span> <span id="s3273">Were you also put to work or --</span></p> <p><span id="s3274">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3275">Q: -- or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s3276">A: No.</span> <span id="s3277">In Buchenwald, we didn't work.</span></p> <p><span id="s3278">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3279">A: At least the time, the period of time that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3280">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3281">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3282">A: You know, there were deaths all over.</span> <span id="s3283">People cut out the innards of the dead and ate, you know.</span> <span id="s3284">This is the kind of stuff that I saw.</span> <span id="s3285">It was a matter of either dying or doing that, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3286">Q: What about, when you say that the Nazi authorities left and the political prisoners took over, could you say that they liberated -- the German political prisoners liberated the camp, or was it another army that did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3287">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s3288">I think it was -- I can't think of the general's name that came in.</span> <span id="s3289">Let me kind of put a little emphasis on the whole situation, the whole picture there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3290">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3291">A: They had a -- if I can remember the town -- Erfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3292">Q: Erfurt, yes, is near there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3293">A: It was in the mountains, across the mountains.</span> <span id="s3294">You could see from Buchenwald all the way into the mountains of Erfurt.</span> <span id="s3295">They had a battle going on in Erfurt.</span> <span id="s3296">At night, we used to see the cannons going off, the artillery going off at night from Erfurt, because it lit up.</span> <span id="s3297">So the general who was the tank commander, and I can't remember his name.</span> <span id="s3298">My memory is not like it used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s3299">Q: That's easy to find out though.</span> <span id="s3300">We can look it up, you know, who that would have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s3301">A: Well, he got killed in Germany in a car crash or something.</span> <span id="s3302">I'm not sure how he died, the general.</span></p> <p><span id="s3303">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3304">A: He was in charge of the tank unit that came into Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">Q: And did you see then American soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3307">There was just a tank came in with a couple -- they opened the turret, and they peaked out.</span> <span id="s3308">And the Germans were already gone.</span> <span id="s3309">They jumped off the guard towers, and the prisoners were chasing them.</span> <span id="s3310">You know, so they caught some.</span> <span id="s3311">You know, it was all chaos, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3312">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3313">A: They killed some, you know, and they brought some back to prison.</span> <span id="s3314">So they -- the Germans were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s3315">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">A: The army came in and -- the American Army came in, and of course, they start giving us food, you know, rations and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s3317">And then organizations came in from western Europe that fed us after a while.</span> <span id="s3318">So but as a whole, Erfurt, they were there for about a week or maybe more.</span> <span id="s3319">They were shooting at the Germans across the mountains, and you could see it.</span> <span id="s3320">At night, you could see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">Q: So when they finally came into the -- into Buchenwald itself, the tank and with the solders, --</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">A: The tank, yeah, with the people in it, opened the turret and looked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3323">Q: And did they get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">A: You know, I don't recall that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3325">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">A: I don't recall if they got out or were in the tanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3327">Q: Where were you when you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">A: We kind of roamed around, because there was nobody there to keep us anywhere, you know, because the Germans were already gone.</span> <span id="s3329">I saw the Germans -- you know, I used to sleep on the top bunk.</span> <span id="s3330">It was three high.</span></p> <p><span id="s3331">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3332">A: And the top bunk, I could look out the window.</span> <span id="s3333">You know, what it is was glass, and when I got the window in a certain position, we could see the main road.</span></p> <p><span id="s3334">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3335">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3336">So they -- because we were on top of a mountain.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">Q: That's right.</span> <span id="s3338">It was high up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3339">A: Right.</span> <span id="s3340">So we looked in there, and I saw the tanks, the Germans running and Germans jumping off the towers.</span> <span id="s3341">And it was just like a movie scene of some sort.</span> <span id="s3342">So this is what I saw through that window.</span> <span id="s3343">And I was kind of -- you know, because they were shooting into the barracks.</span> <span id="s3344">So we got to the ground on the floor, and we just waited it out, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">Q: Were there any revenge killings?</span></p> <p><span id="s3346">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3347">They had, some of the people, I don't know what rank they were, what capacity they were, the Germans, they took them in to where they held the prisoners, the Buchenwald prisoners, you know, that they tortured them there.</span> <span id="s3348">And they took the Germans, and they gave us two hours for people to go in and beat them up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3350">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">A: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: And things took place then, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">A: Well, you know, you punch the guy.</span> <span id="s3354">How much revenge can you take, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3355">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3356">What did I want to ask you?</span> <span id="s3357">Now, there is a famous photograph of, I believe it is Eisenhower.</span> <span id="s3358">I'm not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s3359">But when he comes and he sees what has happened at Buchenwald, he is so appalled that he orders the townspeople of Weimar to come and be forced to look at --</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3361">Q: -- what was going on in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s3363">Q. Were you still there when that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3365">That was in the beginning, you know, because we were there several weeks after.</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3367">Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3368">A: About that, I cannot tell you very much.</span> <span id="s3369">But you know, because first of all, the army kept away the prisoners from these people that they brought in.</span></p> <p><span id="s3370">Q: Oh, so you saw them at a distance?</span></p> <p><span id="s3371">A: We saw them in the distance.</span> <span id="s3372">We couldn't get so close to them, because of the fact that, you know, revenge would have taken place.</span> <span id="s3373">And in the U.S., don't take revenge on other people, you know, even, you know, they come into a town, and they don't kill other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3375">A: Either they keep them prisoners or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">Q: So in other words, the reason why the prisoners were kept away from the townspeople was because to prevent any kind of violence happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">A: Well, you couldn't help some violence.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">A: Because the prison -- the wires were all torn down.</span> <span id="s3380">You could go out through the wires anywhere you wanted to go.</span> <span id="s3381">I used to go to the villages and ask for things to eat, you know, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s3382">Q: And did they give them to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3383">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s3384">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s3385">I think they had so much fear in them, that it was beyond belief.</span> <span id="s3386">You know, a guy nearby Buchenwald was a mayor of this particular town.</span> <span id="s3387">He was made mayor right after the Germans moved away and the Allieds came in, the Allied Forces.</span> <span id="s3388">I don't know who installed him as mayor, but he was the mayor.</span> <span id="s3389">I walked into the mayor's house, and I asked him, I would like to have a bike.</span> <span id="s3390">He says, no problem.</span> <span id="s3391">He gave me an address, and I went up there and tried to get the bike.</span> <span id="s3392">And of course, the bikes were all hidden.</span> <span id="s3393">You couldn't find them.</span> <span id="s3394">So you know, the idea is that the -- the reason I'm saying that, that the Germans had so much fear of being beaten up or being killed.</span> <span id="s3395">And in fact, some of them were.</span></p> <p><span id="s3396">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3397">A: By the Russian prisoners, you know, the ones that were older, not the youngsters, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">Q: Finish the story about the bike.</span> <span id="s3399">Did you finally get a bike?</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">A: No.</span> <span id="s3401">They didn't have it.</span> <span id="s3402">It was all empty.</span></p> <p><span id="s3403">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3404">A: All the barns were empty.</span> <span id="s3405">Everything was empty.</span> <span id="s3406">You know, so I didn't get a bike.</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">Q: So but it means that by the time that the Americans got -- they were entrenched there, you were able to move out of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">A: Oh, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3409">Somehow or another, we got right through the fence.</span> <span id="s3410">The fence was torn apart, and we just walked out.</span> <span id="s3411">And we went to the nearby towns.</span> <span id="s3412">I went a couple of times to Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s3413">Q: What was it like?</span> <span id="s3414">Did you still wear your prisoner's uniform?</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">A: We didn't have anything else, really.</span> <span id="s3416">Just a prisoner's uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: How did people behave?</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: Fear.</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: Some of them were beaten up by others, by the prisoners.</span> <span id="s3421">So, you know, I was a kid incapable of doing anything, too weak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3422">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3423">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">Q: But you saw it in their eyes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s3426">I saw it, saw them being beaten up, and they were beaten up when they brought the Germans in.</span> <span id="s3427">I don't know whether it was soldiers or civilians that were brought in, and kept them where they used to torture the prisoners.</span> <span id="s3428">They kept them there.</span> <span id="s3429">And they used to let them in at, let's say, 3:00 in the afternoon for a half hour to beat the hell out of them, you know.</span> <span id="s3430">But you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: But were these civilians that were brought in there?</span> <span id="s3432">A. Yes, civilians.</span> <span id="s3433">I don't know what capacity, or if they were soldiers, they also were, you know, in probably civilian uniforms.</span> <span id="s3434">I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">Q: But what I'm trying to get at is, they weren't former guards that you could recognize?</span></p> <p><span id="s3436">A: No.</span> <span id="s3437">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3438">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3439">The reason they were brought in is because they happened to be German, not because they happened to have been a particularly cruel guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s3440">A: They had some too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3441">Q: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s3442">I'm sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">A: But they watched how much beating they could get, you know.</span> <span id="s3444">They wouldn't allow, even though that person had seen about 19 Germans being shot, you know, soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3446">A: And I couldn't tell you who shot them.</span> <span id="s3447">I know they wore military uniforms, but whether there were civilians in the uniforms or American or any other nationality that shot him, you know, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3448">Q: And how old were you at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3449">A: I was born in 1927.</span> <span id="s3450">This was '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s3451">Q: You were 18 years old when you were seeing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3452">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3453">You know, we were used to seeing all kinds of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3455">A: I have seen dogs chasing the prisoners and eat them up alive, you know, kill them and eat them.</span> <span id="s3456">You know, it was not something -- or people being hung, for whatever reason that they found, you know.</span> <span id="s3457">So it was not something that --</span></p> <p><span id="s3458">Q: It's not new to you, in other words?</span></p> <p><span id="s3459">A: -- I hadn't seen before.</span> <span id="s3460">It wasn't new.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">Q: It wasn't new to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">Q: It was already --</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">A: I, myself, were under a gun once or twice, you know, but I -- they let me go.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">Q: You mean you were under threat of being shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">Q: And this was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s3468">A: This was still in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3469">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3470">Oh, I remember.</span> <span id="s3471">I remember.</span> <span id="s3472">Yeah, you had told me about that.</span> <span id="s3473">How long did you stay at Buchenwald after the Americans arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">A: It wasn't really that long.</span> <span id="s3475">There was a -- you know, I didn't know, because I didn't -- there was a rabbi, I suppose.</span> <span id="s3476">He was an American chaplain that worked on taking the kids out of Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s3477">And I guess, each government, to my knowledge, I found out later, let in so many kids.</span> <span id="s3478">And some kids, I understand, went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s3479">Some kids went to England.</span> <span id="s3480">Some went to Switzerland, and they went to France, they went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s3481">It depended on the government how many kids they would allow in, into the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3483">And so you were amongst that group?</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">A: I was amongst that group that went to France.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">Q: And how long did you stay there?</span> <span id="s3486">Where did they take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s3487">A: They took us, if I -- if my memory is right, to a home that the Rothschild family owned.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">Q: That the Rothschild family owned?</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">A: And they gave the home, I guess, to use for the kids for the summer.</span> <span id="s3490">I don't know.</span> <span id="s3491">They had their hires in France to take care of all the kids.</span> <span id="s3492">To what capacity, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s3493">They gave us a home.</span> <span id="s3494">They gave us food.</span> <span id="s3495">They gave us schooling, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">A: They sent us to school, you know.</span> <span id="s3498">So it was a variety of things, and I don't know who was what.</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">A: You know, like for instance, my friend, Elie Wiesel, look what happened to him.</span> <span id="s3501">He went to the Sorbonne in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">A: You know, the guy that was also his friend, my hometown friend, a fellow by the name of Gallenstein (ph.), he went also to the Sorbonne, because they were geniuses.</span> <span id="s3504">They were geniuses, these guys.</span> <span id="s3505">And I don't know who else.</span> <span id="s3506">And they sent them to trade schools, and they sent them to different things.</span> <span id="s3507">I came to the United States early enough, you know, right past -- it wasn't that long after that, about a year, year and a half maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3508">Q: Do you remember the date that you came to the U.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s3509">A: The date exactly --</span></p> <p><span id="s3510">Q: Or the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s3511">A: Yes, I do, but I have it written down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3512">Q: It's okay.</span> <span id="s3513">I'm just curious.</span></p> <p><span id="s3514">A: Yes, I do have it.</span> <span id="s3515">I have it written down.</span> <span id="s3516">I used to know, but I don't know now.</span></p> <p><span id="s3517">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3518">Did you sail into New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s3519">A: At the moment, I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3520">Q: That's okay.</span> <span id="s3521">Did you sail into New York or some other port?</span></p> <p><span id="s3522">A: No, we came -- we went to -- from France, they took us to Sweden.</span> <span id="s3523">We came from Sweden across the SS Gripsholm, which used to be a cruise ship in War World II.</span> <span id="s3524">It was reconverted into a passenger ship.</span> <span id="s3525">And they brought us into New York.</span> <span id="s3526">There was a lot of other people.</span> <span id="s3527">There were a lot of Russian immigrants and all kinds of stuff, all kinds of people that were on that ship.</span> <span id="s3528">And we came to New York.</span> <span id="s3529">When I came here, they didn't have Ellis Island anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s3530">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3531">How did you -- where did you land?</span></p> <p><span id="s3532">A: Well, I had an uncle in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s3533">My uncle, supposedly, was going to come and pick me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s3534">Q: Oh, I remember this from the interview itself.</span> <span id="s3535">And he couldn't on that particular day.</span></p> <p><span id="s3536">A: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3537">Q: And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s3538">A: So the hirers, I believe, came to pick us up and kept us there for a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s3539">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s3540">So in order -- here's another question.</span> <span id="s3541">Is there anything else from your first interview, because I do remember we talked about coming to your uncle in New Jersey and then your life after that.</span> <span id="s3542">Is there anything else you think you didn't cover in your European experiences that you want to add, or do you think we pretty much touched it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3544">We covered this.</span> <span id="s3545">When we were in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s3546">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3547">A: And they took all the Jewish people out.</span></p> <p><span id="s3548">Q: And we're talking about your hometown ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s3549">A: My hometown ghetto, when they took out all the Jewish people, the transportation to take us to the next town, big town, was by horse and buggy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3550">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3551">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3552">Q: Not by truck, not by train, nothing like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3553">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3554">Q: By horse and buggy?</span></p> <p><span id="s3555">A: They wouldn't spend money for gas to take the Jews across a couple of towns down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3556">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3557">A: So how long we traveled on that, you know, with the horse and buggy, I don't know.</span> <span id="s3558">I can't really remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3559">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3560">But you remember going that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s3561">A: Oh, yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3562">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s3563">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3564">A: My mother and my sister and my cousin, you know, my grandmother, we were all on that horse and buggy thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3565">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3566">Well, any other thoughts you'd like to add now?</span> <span id="s3567">You know, we can always do this again, by the way.</span> <span id="s3568">If there is something that comes up that you have forgotten, we can always make an appointment to talk again for a brief moment and then record that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3569">A: The march was very important because a lot of people died.</span> <span id="s3570">I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s3571">Hundreds and hundreds of people died.</span></p> <p><span id="s3572">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3573">A: From Weimar going to Gross-Rosen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3574">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3575">A: Because they'd shoot them.</span> <span id="s3576">They'd shoot them in the legs.</span> <span id="s3577">And when they did that, they couldn't walk.</span> <span id="s3578">And when we left, they shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3579">Q: It's just --</span></p> <p><span id="s3580">A: Or left them dead to die, either one of the two.</span></p> <p><span id="s3581">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3582">A: And I've seen many kids my age, their legs were frozen.</span> <span id="s3583">The flesh was peeling off their legs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3584">Q: Oh, dear.</span> <span id="s3585">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3586">A: So I mean, it's --</span></p> <p><span id="s3587">Q: Were there girls on the road too?</span> <span id="s3588">I mean, was this usually young men, or were there women on the road as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s3589">A: They had women.</span> <span id="s3590">There were no girls.</span> <span id="s3591">They had women that they kept for prostitution there in Blechhammer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3592">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3593">A: So these were the women that they kept, that many came with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3594">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3595">A: And then they parted company.</span> <span id="s3596">Where, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3597">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3598">Well, I'm very grateful that you have gone into more detail.</span> <span id="s3599">It's not called a death march for nothing.</span> <span id="s3600">It sounds horrific and amazing that you were able to survive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3601">A: Incidentally, another thing I need -- I don't need, but I'll tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3602">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3603">A: I came to Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3604">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3605">A: And I was roaming the streets, you know.</span> <span id="s3606">We were kids and curious or whatever.</span> <span id="s3607">I ran into a young girl that looked very familiar.</span> <span id="s3608">Because the guy that I dragged to help walk --</span></p> <p><span id="s3609">Q: That's right, Mr. Ribak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3610">A: Mr. Ribak.</span></p> <p><span id="s3611">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3612">A: Showed me pictures from his family.</span> <span id="s3613">And he said his wife and his kids -- I don't know if he had one child or not -- showed me pictures of them --</span></p> <p><span id="s3614">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3615">A: -- being in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s3616">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3617">A: And I came to Paris.</span> <span id="s3618">And now, you know, we were roaming the streets, and I see a girl, a young girl that looks familiar.</span> <span id="s3619">Well, I walked over to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3620">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3621">A: Believe it or not, it turned out to be this guy's daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s3622">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3623">A: I swear on my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s3624">Q: So how did that happen?</span> <span id="s3625">Did she say, My name --</span></p> <p><span id="s3626">A: I apparently remembered from the picture what she looked like.</span> <span id="s3627">I suppose this is what happened.</span> <span id="s3628">And I asked her the last name.</span> <span id="s3629">She told me the name is Ribak.</span> <span id="s3630">And the first thing I said, is your dad alive.</span> <span id="s3631">She says, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3632">Q: So he made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3633">A: He made it.</span> <span id="s3634">She took me over to their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s3635">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3636">A: I saw this guy Ribak, and it was really something.</span></p> <p><span id="s3637">Q: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s3638">A: And if I could remember that from a picture, it's really something.</span> <span id="s3639">I don't know.</span> <span id="s3640">She looked just like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3641">Q: It is.</span> <span id="s3642">I mean, there are many amazing moments and miracles here.</span> <span id="s3643">One, that you recognized her from a picture.</span> <span id="s3644">Two, that he made it.</span> <span id="s3645">Three, that she was able to bring you to him and that you were able to find out what happened to him, and it's an amazing story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3646">Do you remember, after you left him, did he tell you how he came to make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3647">A: No, I really didn't talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3648">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s3649">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s3650">A. I didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s3651">I saw him, and I was so happy to see him, and I met his family.</span> <span id="s3652">I don't remember if I met his wife, but I did meet his daughter.</span> <span id="s3653">I saw her on the street.</span> <span id="s3654">She was going somewhere, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3655">Q: Now, did you ever see him or have contact with him after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s3656">A: No.</span> <span id="s3657">No, I didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s3658">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3659">A: I think I was busy with myself, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3660">Q: Your own life, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3661">A: My own life and trying to put my life and my brother's life together.</span></p> <p><span id="s3662">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3663">That was a big enough task.</span></p> <p><span id="s3664">A: So anyhow, I told you about the story, I was drafted into the army here.</span></p> <p><span id="s3665">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3666">A: So on and so forth.</span> <span id="s3667">Now I cannot recall.</span> <span id="s3668">There was something else I wanted to tell you.</span> <span id="s3669">And I, for the life of me, I'm trying to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3670">Q: You know, if you have forgotten now and you do remember it, write it down and get in touch with me again, and we'll talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3671">A: Hold on just a second.</span> <span id="s3672">I wrote something down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3673">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3674">A: Let me see what I -- let's see.</span> <span id="s3675">The march from Gross-Rosen -- to Gross-Rosen, the freight train, which you are aware of.</span> <span id="s3676">People froze or got shot or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s3677">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3678">A: And let's see.</span> <span id="s3679">I just told you about the frozen limbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s3680">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3681">A: The legs and whatnot.</span></p> <p><span id="s3682">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3683">A: Unfortunately, these kids were my age, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3684">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3685">A: That's all, really that I had written down.</span></p> <p><span id="s3686">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3687">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s3688">When I was in that hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s3689">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3690">A: My brother --</span></p> <p><span id="s3691">Q: And this hospital is in France?</span></p> <p><span id="s3692">A: No, this hospital is in Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s3693">Q: Oh, the one where you got sent for diarrhea, that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s3694">A: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s3695">And we used to get two slices of bread a day in rations when I was in the barracks before I got sick.</span> <span id="s3696">And my brother saved -- collected my rations and saved as much as a whole loaf of bread, a loaf wasn't that big, but it was a loaf of bread that he saved for me when I got back.</span> <span id="s3697">And he put his life in jeopardy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3698">Q: Oh, my.</span></p> <p><span id="s3699">A: And you know, of course I shared the bread with him later.</span> <span id="s3700">But when I got back, when we were still in prison, he had saved a whole loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s3701">Q: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3702">A: In fact, when he passed away, I talked about that to the people that were there, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3703">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3704">It is a very -- it's a moment that is -- shows truly what he was made of.</span> <span id="s3705">Like the moment when your mother tells you why she can't leave shows you the stuff she was made of.</span></p> <p><span id="s3706">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3707">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3708">Thank you for adding that detail.</span> <span id="s3709">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s3710">A: Thank you very much for listening to me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s3711">Q: Mr. Ribons, it is my honor.</span> <span id="s3712">And I appreciate -- I appreciate this.</span></p> <p><span id="s3713">A: Well, I do have tears in my eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3714">Q: Oh, I know.</span> <span id="s3715">It's not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3716">A: Thank you.</span> <span id="s3717">I never had the nerve to do that, to be quite honest with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3718">Q: Well, I don't know what it's like to have gone through what you have, but I do know there is a cost to bringing all of these things up.</span> <span id="s3719">And I appreciate it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3720">A: I did tell you about my Army life, didn't I?</span></p> <p><span id="s3721">Q: I think you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3722">A: Yeah, I think I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3723">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3724">If -- yes, you did.</span> <span id="s3725">Now that I recall, yes.</span> <span id="s3726">We talked about your Army life and being in Korea and some of the experiences you had there.</span> <span id="s3727">Again, if there is something, we will -- at this point, I will wrap up our addition to our interview.</span> <span id="s3728">This concludes the addition to the interview with Jacques Ribons, and today's date is June 10, 2014.</span></p> <p><span id="s3729">End of File Three</span></p> <p><span id="s3730">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
