us -- at the beginning --</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Excuse me, do you want Tencer Chana, or do you want Chana Tencer?</span> <span id="s15">Because she is used to the [indecipherable] way, and

again?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Okay, you want her to say -- yeah.</span> <span id="s20">Okay.</span> <span id="s21">Okay.</span> <span id="s22">My name is Chana Tencer, I was born in Starochowice, March 12th, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Could she tell us how, in 1939, at the beginning of the war, how life changed for her in Starachowice, what she was aware of changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I was a quiet child, and my first shock occurred after war broke -- war broke out, when the first bomb fell very near our home.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s26">Would she like to just carry on?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: Life has changed, because as the Germans came in, they started rounding up people in the streets.</span> <span id="s28">Then we had to wear the armbands, and that was the big change in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What was the armband?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: The armbands were white with a blue Star of David on it.</span> <span id="s31">This was specifically for the Jews to wear, so that they would be recognized, by wearing that white armband with the blue Star of David.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: How -- you were just a child then, how did you understand all that?</span> <span id="s33">What -- what -- what did -- do you remember what you thought when you had to go and wear a special thing on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: I only thought in terms of why is it that we are different from the others.</span> <span id="s35">Q: Did you have an answer to that?</span> <span id="s36">Di -- what did that mean for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: No, I had no answer for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Do you remember your parents saying anything at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I am quite sure that the parents spoke to each other about it, but they did not speak to us about it -- the -- the children -- and they did not speak to children about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: And then, I assume they -- you saw more Germans, did they -- A: Fear.</span> <span id="s41">I felt very fearful.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Can you describe the situation?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: My first memory of that is when the Germans used to come -- came up to our apartment with dogs, and I was sitting on the couch, and one of the big dogs jumped on me, and this is what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Why did they come to your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Wi -- nobody knows, but there were searches being conducted.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: When were you -- when did you have to go and live in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s47">A: 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: 1940.</span> <span id="s49">Does she remember the month at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Off the record, as they say in court, could I explain this to you?</span> <span id="s51">Q: Okay, let’s turn off.</span> <span id="s52">It’s difficult --</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: -- because I know all the people assume you know things, and you know you don’t want to s --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Right, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s56">Okay.</span> <span id="s57">So turn off the [indecipherable] Q: -- so she should treat me like [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Okay, the change occurred when certain streets were completely cleared of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s59">But we li -- I -- they lived in an apartment which was on the side streets, which was still open to Jews.</span> <span id="s60">And they lived in a three bedroom apartment, which immediately was being packed with other people who were being evacuated, cleared off the other streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: And so other people moved into her apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: I see, so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: And that was not the end yet.</span> <span id="s65">The big change came about when the people who were placed in our apartment had to take up the room which my sister and I once shared, just the two of us, and now we had all these other people in our room, and on our bed, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: How many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Two families.</span> <span id="s68">12 to 15 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: So -- how did they eat?</span> <span id="s70">I mean, how did -- did they have to provide for them?</span> <span id="s71">How did they get food, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Everybody was trying to organize his own way, his o -- his own food, and there were -- bread was being rationed, and you had to stand in line, and sometimes all night long to stand in line to get your bread.</span> <span id="s73">And these people, just like everybody else, had to sort of, say, shift for themselves, and stand on line, and of course sometimes the line got -- by the time they got to your point in the line, the food was gone.</span> <span id="s74">But this is -- basically was the division of everybody for himself.</span> <span id="s75">They had to secure their own food, and they -- her family had to secure her own food.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: What was the atmosphere like in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Very stressful.</span> <span id="s78">But we shared whatever we could with each other, so that nobody in the house was -- went hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: What was the -- what did your -- was your father doing at the time?</span> <span id="s80">A: I have written down the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s82">But I need to hear it from her.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Father was a cost analysis engine -- ...</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Okay, did the women all cook together in the kitchen, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: Well, everybody was cooking together, and -- and -- as long as the food lasted, there was food cooked in -- in that place all together.</span> <span id="s86">And as -- and people did not go hungry at that time, while food was still available.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Up until what point was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: It went on like this up to the time when the Jews were removed from the -- from town all together, but there was less and less bread, but it was all rationed.</span> <span id="s89">But there was always less of it, up to the point when the town was cleared of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Were you hungry, though, up until the for -- of the time that the town was cleared of Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, basically the children, she and her sister very seldom went hungry because their parents would give up their own rations to feed the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: Did your father continue working at -- at his profession for this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Not at all, because the -- the company w-was located outside of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s94">Q: So what did he -- what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: He did nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: He stayed home all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: There was forced labor, and when they came and made you go to do forced labor, you did, and my father -- her father did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: What -- what sort of -- two questions, what sort of forced labor, and was it every day, or was it -- from the -- with the way she just said it I got the feeling maybe it was just occasional, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: No, this was work here and there, as they required and as they -- as they rounded up people.</span> <span id="s100">There were -- there were people -- there were people who were rounded up for this forced labor, who would come back beaten up, and some would never come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: What was the labor they were forced to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: They cleaned the town.</span> <span id="s103">This was basically the job done up to the point of the clearing of this town of -- of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Did she go to school during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No.</span> <span id="s106">My sister and I, we took private lessons, but not in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: When you were all in the -- the open ghetto, how much German presence was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Were there soldiers there every day patrolling, did they -- I’m trying to get a sense of how much you were in day to day contact with German troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: I remember the Germans all around town, plus these German soldiers who marched in formation through town, singing that song that she just said, that the lyrics to which go, when the Jew -- when Jewish blood springs --</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Are there any particular incidents that she witnessed at the time which -- which really affected her deeply?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: When they were killing people.</span> <span id="s112">And all --</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: I’m sorry, what I was going to say is don’t translate sentence by sentence, because, if you could just like --</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: -- [inaudible] pause, and just wait right till the end of story, okay?</span> <span id="s116">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: I’m sorry, could we start that again?</span> <span id="s118">I -- I made a mistake there.</span> <span id="s119">A: I-I’m trying to nod the head to show you that there’s more than -- Q: I know, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: We maybe should tell her is that I -- I’d like to try and keep -- she’s going to -- you can tell the whole story, and right at the end I’ll get the translation.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Okay, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s123">Did you want to

at the time that particularly marked her or shocked her?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: I saw how people were being killed, and first time in my life I saw people -- dead people.</span> <span id="s127">Also, on one of the Sundays, they erected a gallows in the center of the square, and they hung 10 or 12 people, and they waited for the people to come out of the church, and forced everybody to see it, including the Jews.</span> <span id="s128">Could I add something?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: These were Polish people, Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Polish Christians.</span> <span id="s132">Could -- yeah, who was it -- who were the people who --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: I think that what happened was that the night before suther -- Sunday, there was a -- some kind of a party on Yuzhetska Street, where two germ -- in a Polish -- Christian Polish house, where two Germans were killed.</span> <span id="s134">In reta -- and in retaliation, they -- 10 or 12 people were hung in the square.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: S -- was it an atmos -- can she remember back to the -- like waking up in the morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">What was the atmosphere like?</span> <span id="s137">Was it one of terror, was there any hope?</span> <span id="s138">Was -- A: It was terrible fear among all, because nobody knew who was going to be next.</span> <span id="s139">Q: Did you think you would survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I cannot answer that.</span> <span id="s141">At that time I

<p><span id="s143">A: It was basically that a -- that very fear of what will happen that my parents, I’m sure, felt.</span> <span id="s144">Q: Did you ever hear any tales of -- witness any form of resistance to what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I don’t remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Can you turn it off for a second?</span> <span id="s147">I think the feeling

A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: -- really to the end of the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Maybe I just ne -- nod my head, so -- Q: Exactly, exactly, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s153">She will try, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Okay, I know it’s difficult.</span> <span id="s155">As much as -- as much as you can.</span> <span id="s156">I guess what -- what we’re sort of looking for is -- is a word picture.</span> <span id="s157">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: I wa -- I wanted just to go back, because you s -- you were talking about the fear, that it could happen to you, you never knew who would be next, and I wanted to ask you if -- you said you’d seen people die for the first time.</span> <span id="s160">Did you, in any incident see people die that you knew personally, or were these strangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: At that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: Yeah, in the oagen ghetto.</span> <span id="s163">Okay, whenever you’re ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: The dead people she saw were basically strangers, but that was the first time that she ever saw dead people as -- as such.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Could she describe the incident to me.</span> <span id="s166">I mean, what -- where was she going when she saw it, what happened, was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: There were many people dead in the street, who were just laying in the street, and that is what I saw for the first time in my life, though other people were dying also, but basically what you saw on the streets all the time were these corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Had they died from starvation, or from -- A: Cold, and -- and -- and hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Would you -- so people every day, I mean, two people, or three people, or 10 people, or -</span></p> <p><span id="s170">-</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I saw them -- I saw single corpses here and there, but mother was very protective, and she would not allow me to see it, so whenever there was somebody killed in the street, she made sure that I didn’t go out to see any more than I -- I have already seen.</span> <span id="s172">I ... I do remember something.</span> <span id="s173">... They were apparently concentrating all the people at that time, but basically there was a work -- there was work to be done in our town because of the munitions factory.</span> <span id="s174">And they were always looking toward having cheap, or slave labor out of the people who were shipped in.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: I don’t know if she happens just to know how many people were in the ghetto by 1944 when everyone was --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Not ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: -- when were people sent into -- A: ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: ’42.</span> <span id="s179">By fi -- ’42, how many people were there?</span> <span id="s180">A: I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: I’d like to go back a little bit to -- ... just to wait until -- before she answers.</span> <span id="s182">A: Well, thi -- the circle vot -- of women, the volunteers sa --</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: I guess what I was interested to hear was that there was this sense of solidarity with the new arrivals, and trying to help, and that it was organized help.</span> <span id="s184">And I just wondered if she could tell me a little about the theater group, and -- and doing plays, and what plays she did, and -- and what she -- what she thought she was doing, and what was her understanding of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: Well, the theater was composed of th -- I need to answer.</span> <span id="s186">Then there was a -- there was a -- a little drama about a woman who took in a child, and she was -- she wasn’t very kind to the child, and the child was taken away from her, and that was the drama that they enacted on the stage in that little theater.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Does she remember the poem?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: I don’t know, some of it.</span> <span id="s189">Yeah, she remembers, did you want her --</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: Can she [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s191">Very nice.</span> <span id="s192">You’ve got an extraordinary memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: This is -- this is the way the locomotive starts, and then it picks up steam, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Did you get a lot of applause for that?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: And a lot of kisses, too.</span> <span id="s197">A lot of kisses, and a lot of applause.</span> <span id="s198">Q: So there were a few happy memories from this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: The most important thing is that I was at that time still with my parents and my sister.</span> <span id="s200">And my parents were -- their only goal was to protect us, and to feed us, and to -- to be sure that our way of life does not change as drastically as the circumstances have forced us to live in.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Could we move on now to couple -- a few years, to the time when you’re taken to Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s202">Is your father s -- is her father still alive [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: He died in camp, you see.</span> <span id="s204">We were talking -- you were talking up to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Now is camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: -- and her father -- I told her to remember when the father died.</span> <span id="s209">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: But let’s build up to that.</span> <span id="s212">Perhaps -- can she tell me how she came to go to the camp?</span> <span id="s213">What were the -- did someone come one day to the house and say, your -- pack up and go, or how did that --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: At that time, and that is toward -- Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Toward the ... So what do you want to tell her?</span> <span id="s216">I gave her the date, what did -- Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s217">Yeah, if she could tell us, when she heard this knock --</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: She knew what it meant?</span> <span id="s220">Did she know what was going to happen?</span> <span id="s221">And could she describe how she felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: We knew by then that this was a clearing to go to -- t-to Treblinka, but we --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: What happened at Treblinka?</span> <span id="s224">Did you know who -- there were death camps, and that you would be systematically --</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Basically, ah -- she knew that people were being -- Q: Is this noise okay for you?</span> <span id="s226">It’s gone now, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Could we -- could you carry on telling me the story of when you heard -- they banged on the door, and you heard them saying everybody up?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: What’s sh --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: What happened next?</span> <span id="s231">I mean, I wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: What happened next, okay.</span> <span id="s233">The night before, we -- because there were selections going on in neighboring towns, and it was then that everybody realized that it was not passive -- that we will not get away, by not -- we will not get away, that we will be included in the selections, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: So you got dressed, and you went down to the square.</span> <span id="s235">A: When the selections started, they were se --</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: You knew at that point what each group meant, that it -- you were presumably put in the children’s group.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: No, she was a older child -- Q: So th --</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: They’re talking about -- Q: Oh, little -- little children.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Babies, yeah.</span> <span id="s240">What was the question originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: So, ho -- did she know what was -- everybody was aware that little children were going to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s243">Then there was also a group of women that was being separated and my mother was in it, sort of assigned to personnel, that they were going to run personnel or whatever.</span> <span id="s244">And I stayed with my mother, and -- and I was able to get in with her, into that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: And what ha -- where were you taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: We were marched into -- toward that camp.</span> <span id="s247">Father always -- also went to Shterneetsa, the camp Shterneetsa.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: But he marched separately, or -- A: Together.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: So the whole -- your whole family managed to stay together?</span> <span id="s250">A: All four.</span> <span id="s251">Father, mother, and the two girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: You know, when you di -- I was coming back to what you were saying about the doctor and -- and her child.</span> <span id="s253">From the footage that I’ve seen, the -- the selections always look sort of -- everyone seems very quiet, and passive, but obviously that wasn’t the case with -- with the selection as you experienced it.</span> <span id="s254">It must have been a lot of screaming, and crying, and horrible, awful stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: If the people were very quiet, chances are that they were totally in shock.</span> <span id="s256">Because the crying, and the -- and the -- the -- the noises were basically were people were being separated, where they were being torn apart.</span> <span id="s257">But otherwise, people were in total shock, and they were -- i-in that way, they were quiet.</span> <span id="s258">There were also those who were [indecipherable] and they knew that this was the last -- last trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Tell me a -- so you -- you marched for three or four hours to the
