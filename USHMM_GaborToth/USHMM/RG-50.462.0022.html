I was born August 31, 1921, in the city of Frankfurt on the Main [Frankfurt am Main] in Germany.</span> <span id="s6">My parents were married just about a year and it was the post-war period in Germany.</span> <span id="s7">At that time it was very difficult to find apartments, and to get settled, and they managed to find a place finally, I understand, on the third floor in the West End of Frankfurt very close to the place where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s8">I am talking about the father and mother of my mother.</span> <span id="s9">We lived there from 1921 until 1930.</span> <span id="s10">I went to school when I was six years old.</span> <span id="s11">It’s called Vorschule; it’s an elementary school where you go for four years and from there you proceed to the so-called middle school or the Gymnasium if you want to pursue a professional education at the university.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">NL: Was this a government school, or a school set up by the community of Frankfurt?</span> <span id="s13">Was it a Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">HS: It’s very unusual in Germany to go to a Jewish school unless you want a particular spirit or a particular type of education.</span> <span id="s15">In Frankfurt it became a matter of necessity due to the fact that the Jewish students were thrown out of public schools more and more as time went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">NL: But this was a public school that you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">HS: Oh, absolutely, yes.</span> <span id="s18">That was even before Hitler.</span> <span id="s19">That was from 1927 to 1931, and Hitler only got into power in 1933 when I already was attending the Gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">NL: What was father’s work at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">HS: Well, it is a bit of a story.</span> <span id="s22">Conditions were very unsettled after the war, and my grandfather on my mother’s side had a mica factory.</span> <span id="s23">Mica is a material, a mineral which is used in irons or in ovens to insulate heat from the outside.</span> <span id="s24">It comes in sheets and gets split.</span> <span id="s25">In any case, he had, my grandfather had that factory in the outskirts of Frankfurt together with somebody else who was very active at the local synagogue and, do you want the name of that factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">NL: No, that’s not necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">HS: Not important.</span> <span id="s28">O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">NL: A feeling about the economic conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">HS: My father worked there until, he was a member of the Board whatever the equivalent is today vice-president.</span> <span id="s31">My mother also worked there off and on as a secretary.</span> <span id="s32">We had a maid, so it was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NL: Did you have brothers, sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">HS: No, I am the only child, but the interesting part of that other story was for today inflation got so bad that my grandfather lost his factory due to the economic conditions and had to give up his factory, and my father became a sales representative, and my grandfather continued to be an agent for mica-processing in some form or another.</span> <span id="s35">He dealt with England, I remember, and even had an office at one time in London and...</span></p> <p><span id="s36">NL: So the family managed fairly well through these adverse times.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s38">My mother was very helpful in supporting my father in the business and they worked together, and I remember them going out late at night with important letters to the railroad station to send out the orders and information immediately to Silesia where some of the factories were, or to the Rhineland, because if you did not do that in those days, the competition was so fierce that there were always two people standing behind you with something new.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NL: Frankfurt had a large Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">HS: Frankfurt had a population of five hundred thousand.</span> <span id="s41">I don’t recall how many Jewish families there were, but it was a substantial element in the city from way back actually, and the Jewish population in Frankfurt had contributed tremendously to learning, to culture, to restoration of the old city.</span> <span id="s42">There was an Association of Friends of the Old City.</span> <span id="s43">It was really a very liberal and friendly atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">NL: Didn’t Rosenzweig have his school there?</span> <span id="s45">And then Buber?</span> <span id="s46">I think Frankfurt was the center.</span> <span id="s47">Did your parents belong to the Kultusgemeinde?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">HS: Yes, you paid taxes.</span> <span id="s49">In Germany everybody paid taxes according to his religious classification.</span> <span id="s50">This does not mean that you pay taxes according to this religious beliefs, but he paid taxes because you belong to a Catholic or Jewish or Protestant...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">NL: In Frankfurt was this money collected by the State?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">HS: That money was paid to the State all over Germany.</span> <span id="s53">It was called a Kultus steuer, which was a cult [cultural] tax.</span> <span id="s54">From that tax the State maintained the salary of the rabbis, the salaries of all the organizations, the priests and churches, and whatever.</span> <span id="s55">I don’t know to what degree they paid towards the maintenance of religious teaching organizations, but in those organizations people, of course, contributed also by way of the students that were sent to the school, tuition.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">NL: Your parents belonged to what we would call the Liberal or Reform segments?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">HS: Yes, it is very funny story.</span> <span id="s58">My mother only went to synagogue to please my father, who came from a very Orthodox background, but he, too, had lost his father very early and grew up in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s59">My grandmother, who had lived in Paderborn, Westphalia, where they had some kind of a store, moved with her four children to Frankfurt to join the rest of her family after the death of her husband who had been considerably older, I never met him, and brought up those children in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s60">There were two boys and two girls.</span> <span id="s61">Now, they maintained a traditional life.</span> <span id="s62">My grandmother was a traditional woman, a very strict woman, she had to be, and did a very good job.</span> <span id="s63">My father and his brother traveled a great deal before the war.</span> <span id="s64">They were in the U.S. and South America on business and there came a time when they were hardly home any more in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s65">So they got away from the tradition a little bit and my mother grew up in a Jewish household, that just was Jewish by classification and paid the taxes, but kept nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: Did you have any sort of Jewish education?</span> <span id="s67">Did you go to a Sunday School?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">HS: Yes, of course, that came later.</span> <span id="s69">We belonged to a Liberal congregation which we went to and it was a well-known synagogue, the Westend Synagogue in Frankfurt and it was a tremendously big place, a very modern place, very beautiful, wonderful rabbis.</span> <span id="s70">Cantorial art flourished and, of course, they had a school, too.</span> <span id="s71">Now when you go to school in Germany, at least at that time, you had Religion.</span> <span id="s72">You had with your three hours, you also had Religion.</span> <span id="s73">From the very beginning, there were two sessions a week, where you had to go whether you liked it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NL: Did a rabbi come into the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">HS: No, there was a regular Jewish teacher, who was even a director of one of the schools, co-director of that elementary school, who not only taught Religion, but also taught German and History and different subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">NL: And this person was paid by the State?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">HS: Of course.</span> <span id="s78">This was a regular teacher in the teaching system.</span> <span id="s79">You must keep in mind that under the German system, everybody was recognized in his own right as a teacher.</span> <span id="s80">There was no such thing as anybody being of different caliber for certain purposes, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NL: You went twice a week to this special class?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">HS: Well, it was in the school building.</span> <span id="s83">A certain class was set aside just for religious instruction, which was used by Catholics and Lutherans alike.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">NL: Did you learn any Hebrew in this, or just history...</span></p> <p><span id="s85">HS: At that early age I didn’t, but I must say that, when I started going to school at the age of six, there were already some young people who had private lessons in Hebrew, because their parents wanted it.</span> <span id="s86">And I must say, I didn’t even known what Hebrew was when I started school.</span> <span id="s87">That was the situation there, and after my fourth year in elementary school, I went to the Gymnasium, because I was trying to go to the university later on.</span> <span id="s88">That took place in 1930, before Hitler got into power in 1933.</span> <span id="s89">So I really had a very good German-type education at that humanistic Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s90">It was the best school in Frankfurt, and I went there with a lot of my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NL: That was government or was this private?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">HS: All government.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NL: Now what were your relation with non-Jewish children?</span> <span id="s94">Did you have non-Jewish friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">HS: I must tell you that overall there were good relations.</span> <span id="s96">There were always some anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s97">Always.</span> <span id="s98">This is a part of life in Germany, as it is perhaps everywhere else, and under unpleasant economic conditions this is coming out more openly than at other times.</span> <span id="s99">But generally speaking...there were about one-third Jewish in that class.</span> <span id="s100">It was usually good relations with the exception of two really fierce anti-Semites, who were usually the bad sheep of the class to begin with, and nobody took them very seriously.</span> <span id="s101">This changed in the course of time under Hitler propaganda.</span> <span id="s102">In the early times there was no such problem, but I must say that there was one thing that sheds a little bit of light on the way things were in Germany.</span> <span id="s103">I was born during a year when there was a surplus of children in the post-war period, and that was in 1921 when apparently everybody had children.</span> <span id="s104">By the time I went to school, the regular facilities of the State schools were insufficient to harbor everybody, and some of these classes, where there were usually four, had to have six class accommodations.</span> <span id="s105">So our group was sent close by to a strictly Catholic establishment.</span> <span id="s106">And that was really a revelation.</span> <span id="s107">The Catholic people in that school and the students were absolutely anti-Semitic, strongly anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s108">That is before Hitler.</span> <span id="s109">It had nothing to do with Hitler, except maybe the Party was coming up.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">NL: This was religious anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">HS: This was anti-Semitism ingrained in the Catholic population and fostered by parents and probably by the clergy, too.</span> <span id="s112">We had constant physical fights.</span> <span id="s113">That lasted for a year.</span> <span id="s114">Then we went back to our own school where there were more Lutherans and Protestants, so to speak, and there were fewer Catholics, and this whole situation eased up quite a bit.</span> <span id="s115">But, of course, in the meantime, the Nazi Party became stronger, and the economic conditions for many people in Germany, especially for the laboring people, became very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s116">Unemployment got worse and worse; the government was too weak, couldn’t stop anything from getting worse and with that, the rise of the Nazi Party was getting a hold of the students and young people, which was unfortunately inevitable, with all the propaganda.</span> <span id="s117">So this carried on into the 1930’s.</span> <span id="s118">Now when I got into the Gymnasium, the teacher, the director of the school was half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s119">He was very well known in Frankfurt as a strong liberal educator, and I really remember his speech welcoming the new class into his school, in which he said that all political tendencies would be strictly cut out from his school.</span> <span id="s120">Little did he know what was going to happen to him because within four years, he lost his job and he went to England, and was interned, and later committed suicide.</span> <span id="s121">It was a very difficult time for people who felt total acceptance, and that reversal was experienced by many thousands.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NL: Your own parents’ economic situation, was that, too, damaged in the early ‘30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">HS: Well, my father built up this business with the help of my mother, and unfortunately my father had a weak heart muscle from malaria that he had incurred in his travels abroad.</span> <span id="s124">He got very sick in 1929 and had a heart attack and pleurisy, and we could not stay in our apartment anymore where he had to walk up three flights of steps.</span> <span id="s125">We moved to a different apartment, close to the city, where we occupied the first floor.</span> <span id="s126">After we had moved there in July, he got sick; he had had another heart attack and died in August, 1930.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">NL: How did Mother then manage?</span></p> <p><span id="s128">HS: My mother continued the business after a fashion.</span> <span id="s129">She was very well-liked, and she even went traveling.</span> <span id="s130">She went to Darmstadt and Wiesbaden and Mainz, and things were a little bit easier.</span> <span id="s131">There were heavy sample cases involved, and I remember carriers coming to the apartment and picking up the sample cases, and having them ready for my mother to work with at the customer’s place the next morning.</span> <span id="s132">It really was a system which we could learn from, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">NL: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s134">It was all very systematic.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">HS: It was a smaller city and everything was much easier to come by.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NL: And so you began to feel the more vehement anti-Semitism in the early ‘30’s?</span> <span id="s137">And were you aware of any Jews already trying to leave the country in ‘32 or ‘33?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">HS: Hitler came into power only in 1933.</span> <span id="s139">After I had gone to the Gymnasium for about three years it was only then, in April of 1933, that we had the first boycott action.</span> <span id="s140">You are familiar with that?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s142">Was Mother’s business affected by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">HS: Well, we didn’t have a store, so my mother’s business at that time was not affected.</span> <span id="s144">But as the years went by, towards the ‘36 - ‘37 period, really, my mother carried on quite well until the Nuremberg Laws.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NL: September ‘35?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">HS: Well, it was after that that the economic pressures mounted because some of the customers could no longer receive Jewish representatives, could not work with Jewish people any more, and by the same token the manufacturers couldn’t keep their Jewish representatives because it was bad for business.</span> <span id="s147">Well, the pressures were there.</span> <span id="s148">Eventually it actually did become illegal, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NL: Did she have to give up the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">HS: Yes, she had to.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: And how then did you manage economically?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">HS: We must have had some money and we had a nice apartment with a maid up to 1938, and the maid had to leave because, at one point, I had turned 16 and you could not have a non-Jewish woman in a household with a 16 year-old so-called man.</span> <span id="s153">I was in school until I was 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: So you were in school until 15.</span> <span id="s155">Were you forced to leave school?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">HS: I was and I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s157">As the times progressed, more and more Jewish people left Germany.</span> <span id="s158">I happened to be in contact with people who had connections to Switzerland, France, and England, and America.</span> <span id="s159">With Frankfurt being so close to the western border and all that trade going on, a lot of people fortunately were connected.</span> <span id="s160">But I lost quite a few friends who had to leave overnight.</span> <span id="s161">Their parents had money outside, and the Gestapo got a hold of that information, and they got a warning.</span> <span id="s162">A very good friend of mine just left overnight with his parents.</span> <span id="s163">It took years until we met again.</span> <span id="s164">So, it was a matter of a tightening net, of an ever more closing circle.</span> <span id="s165">Nobody expected to be exterminated, but the writing was on the wall, and as I went to school, there were fewer and fewer Jewish boys in that school.</span> <span id="s166">I was one of the few because, I left because I didn’t especially like to go to make a change still before leaving Germany, and I wasn’t too badly off or persecuted and...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">NL: Your teachers weren’t too hostile?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">HS: Most of the teachers were very nice.</span> <span id="s169">Some of them were from the old guard, Prussian officers, fairly decent people.</span> <span id="s170">There were, I remember my Latin class, for instance.</span> <span id="s171">When I first started out with Latin, I did very poorly.</span> <span id="s172">I could not relate to Latin at all, and apparently that teacher was furious at me.</span> <span id="s173">He knew I could do better, and I simply fell flat on my face, and he had me put right in front of his desk.</span> <span id="s174">In every Latin class, which was at least once a day, I had to change seats with somebody else, and I always thought that the guy did it because he was experimenting with his Jews.</span> <span id="s175">He didn’t say so, and he was very successful with me.</span> <span id="s176">I did very well in the end.</span> <span id="s177">I became his pride and joy after a while, but, I think it was a start which was semi-political.</span> <span id="s178">Then we had a man who was a math teacher who taught at the University of Frankfurt, and he was a teacher who should have stayed with the university.</span> <span id="s179">He was a very bad math teacher for gymnasts, gymnasts is the wrong word, for students who were attending the early years at the Gymnasium and he was almost abstract, and he was always very, very nice to the Jewish students and joked with them and fraternized, and was very nice to the mothers and the parents in general.</span> <span id="s180">The school had a country home in the mountains near Frankfurt, it is called the Taunus; and the classes went up there once a year for a week, and we could also go on vacation.</span> <span id="s181">Any time there was a vacation we could go to this country home.</span> <span id="s182">He was there and he was very very nice, but he was the first man who came in with a swastika on his sleeve, the first one of all the teachers, with a big smiling face, and all the other teachers laughed at him, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">NL: What year do you suppose this was?</span> <span id="s184">1936-37?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">HS: ‘36, ‘37.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">NL: Did his attitude toward you change?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">HS: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">NL: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s190">NL: This is tape #1, side #2 of an interview with Mr. Harold Stern, September 10, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">HS: Eventually all teachers came in with the swastika on their sleeve.</span> <span id="s192">It was compulsory.</span> <span id="s193">At the end of the class everybody had to get up from his desk and stand there and raise his hand and say, “Heil, Hitler.”</span></p> <p><span id="s194">NL: Including the Jewish students, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s196">I remember distinctly there was a man who came from the Rhineland, who had a very strange pronunciation, and everybody made fun of him, especially with the way he said, “Heil, Hitler,” and some people said, “drei Liter,” and others imitated him, but there was one Jewish boy who was a little bit slow at one point and got caught imitating him.</span> <span id="s197">HE didn’t do much about it, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">NL: He wasn’t a fervent Nazi, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">HS: It was still at the time when things were a little bit easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NL: Apparently Frankfurt was a fairly liberal community then?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HS: It was liberal, it was probably ranking next behind Berlin in humanism and in the feeling of internationalism.</span> <span id="s202">I would say perhaps Hamburg was the third city where people tried to keep up a front of decency, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s203">NL: When did you leave school?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">HS: Well, then, because the director, long since the half-Jewish director had left, and we got a real Nazi as a director.</span> <span id="s205">He had short cropped hair; he walked around with a swastika; he had his scars from his student years.</span> <span id="s206">The man was like in a movie about Germany.</span> <span id="s207">You could not have cast him any better.</span> <span id="s208">Then dissensions arose between the Jewish students and the other students.</span> <span id="s209">There was a little episode, for example, where they played with marbles, and when the Gentile students took away the marbles from the Jewish students in the school yard, nothing happened, but when the Jewish students won in the marble game, then one guy one time got so upset about it that he started crying, and at that time the director was walking through the school yard during intermission, and that man went to that pupil and said to him, “If the Jewish guys give you any trouble, just let me know.”</span> <span id="s210">That was one episode, and then some other time we had music lessons together with another class of the same level, because, as I explained before, there were so many people, and you had two or three classes together.</span> <span id="s211">The class was about 30-35 people, and we went to the auditorium, where, by that time, we didn’t learn anything about music or harmony, but all the music consisted of Nazi songs.</span> <span id="s212">I had been in the school choir up to a certain time, and then when it changed to a point where you only sang these stupid Nazi songs, I resigned from it.</span> <span id="s213">At that time, on that particular day, they had on the agenda a song which was anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s214">Not particularly anti-Jewish, but it had two verses that were anti-Jewish, the rest was very patriotic, and I didn’t sing the anti-Jewish verses, and I didn’t think much about it.</span> <span id="s215">As I left the school yard afterwards with my bicycle, the super-Nazis of the class waylaid me and beat me up.</span> <span id="s216">This was, I don’t know whether it was because I didn’t sing the Nazi verses, but because probably the song had inflamed them.</span> <span id="s217">I finally left that school and went to the Philanthropin for six months.</span> <span id="s218">This was in 1935.</span> <span id="s219">I would say 1935.</span> <span id="s220">And went for six months to the Philanthropin school, which was the Jewish school, where I was reunited with a lot of my former friends and people I knew from the outside from sports activities, and I learned there an awful lot, and I was really sorry that I had not left earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">NL: This was a Jewish studies program essentially, plus...</span></p> <p><span id="s222">HS: No, it was the Jewish School in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s223">There were two Jewish schools in Frankfurt that were famous all over Germany.</span> <span id="s224">One is the Philanthropin and the other one is the Samson Raphael Hirsch School.</span> <span id="s225">If you want, I will give you a book on the Philanthropin school.</span> <span id="s226">It is written in German by all the teachers and other people and has good source material.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">NL: You stayed there for six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">HS: Yes, and with the situation the way it was, it was no longer a matter of trying to go through to college or university afterwards, because there were no more students allowed in the colleges, Jewish students.</span> <span id="s229">So, from a practical point of view, I was supposed to learn something or get into something that I could use later on non-professionally, or going abroad.</span> <span id="s230">I wanted very much to go into learning how to make shoes.</span> <span id="s231">What happened was already—at that time people were giving up their businesses left and right.</span> <span id="s232">A non-Jewish company couldn’t and wouldn’t employ anybody Jewish anymore, and so I found the parents of a friend of mine who had one of the big shoe companies in Germany, a well-known brand.</span> <span id="s233">They took me in as an apprentice.</span> <span id="s234">Now I wanted to be very much on the practical side of shoe manufacturing, because everybody said you have to know something practical when you leave Germany, but my mother put a stop to it and got me into the commercial part of the factory.</span> <span id="s235">It was, unfortunately, a mistake which she did not realize at the time.</span> <span id="s236">I got in there in spite of the vice-president who was Aryan, non-Jewish, and even lived on my street, that he did not advise non-Jewish people to be employed anymore in that factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">NL: Jewish, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">HS: Yes, Jewish.</span> <span id="s239">He didn’t want it any more and he thought it was unwise.</span> <span id="s240">I suppose by that time they had directives from the Chamber of Commerce, which was of course under the Nazi party, but the Jewish owners prevailed and got me in there.</span> <span id="s241">The factory was in Hoechst near I. G. Farben, and I had to get up very early in the morning and take a train from Frankfurt to Hoechst to be there at 9:00 and look after things.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">NL: Now, Harold, before we continue, I wonder if we could go back, since we talked this afternoon about several other experiences which I would like very much for you to recount on tape.</span> <span id="s243">Can you tell me again a little about your holiday in Italy in the summer of 1935 and the so-called shadows that you began to feel?</span> <span id="s244">I had said it seemed to be a carefree holiday and you didn’t agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">HS: Well, already at that time, Germany and Italy cooperated quite a bit, politically.</span> <span id="s246">However, the big thing in Europe at that time was the preparation of Mussolini’s invasion of Abyssinia, and the school I went to for this vacation was a great big villa overlooking a fishing port on the Ligurian Riviera close to Genoa.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">NL: And the name of the school, please?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">HS: The name was Villa La Palma in Recco.</span> <span id="s249">The little town was called Recco.</span> <span id="s250">It was a very picturesque place.</span> <span id="s251">It lived from the sea, on the sea.</span> <span id="s252">It had a beach.</span> <span id="s253">On Sundays they had lovely concerts in the village square that we went to, and it was a picturesque, beautiful setting.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: Could you feel any Fascist tone or force in Italian life?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">HS: Well, we were secluded insofar that we were under very strict supervision at the school, and all activities had been structured.</span> <span id="s256">We were never on our own, except once in a while we would go out to the little village on our own, but this, too, was a 20-minute walk, and you had to walk up a very steep hill coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">NL: So you were very much secluded.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">HS: We did have contact so far that we bought little things in the village like ice cream, and with our limited Italian we couldn’t go very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">NL: You were saying earlier that the head of the school...</span></p> <p><span id="s260">HS: The head of the school was a German-Jewish Privatdozent [unsalaried university professor], so to speak.</span> <span id="s261">He was a professor from a university who had lost his job as a Jew, on top of which he was suffering from a disease that caused him tremendous tremors.</span> <span id="s262">He was comparatively young and he had a little boy at that time, he was about six years old, and he and his wife took over that villa and made a school out of it, with a staff of former German teachers, partially Jewish, partially non-Jewish, but if they were non-Jewish they were anti-Nazi.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: And you went to this school with all-Jewish group?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">HS: Yes, I went to that school with several friends from my school in Frankfurt and a young man who was half-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">NL: Now, we also talked during the interlude about some friends of yours or acquaintances who were leaving for Palestine.</span> <span id="s266">Were you and Mother at all thinking about going to Palestine during the late or middle ‘30’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">HS: No, we could never think of it.</span> <span id="s268">First of all, my mother still had her business, and she still had her father and sister living in Frankfurt, whom she was supporting.</span> <span id="s269">I myself was going to school and she was not about to interrupt that either.</span> <span id="s270">For a woman alone, with a business and being established and family connections, we were still comparatively untouched directly by what was going on, although the atmosphere in general was becoming less and less attractive.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">NL: Tell me a little more about the Zionist school that your friend went to, that you thought of going to.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">HS: This school was in Herrlingen near Ulm.</span> <span id="s273">People sent their children there from all over Germany in preparation of aliyah [emigration to Palestine].</span> <span id="s274">It was a very strict school.</span> <span id="s275">Of course, Hebrew was taught, and it was a little bit on the Spartan side.</span> <span id="s276">People would get up at 6:00 in the morning to take cold showers.</span> <span id="s277">My mother went there after they thought, she and several parents, thought I should go there with their children.</span> <span id="s278">She took it upon herself to take the trip to Bavaria to look the school over herself, and when she got there and saw what was going on and everything, she said, “This is not for Harold.”</span> <span id="s279">Consequently, nobody went, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">NL: She brought her report home to the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">HS: It was a good thing that it happened that way.</span> <span id="s282">First of all the school was later on totally surrounded and closed by the Nazis, which was a bad experience for anybody who was there, of course, and, then, some of the people who were going to be with me had to leave Germany overnight, and it was a good thing that they were with their parents in Frankfurt and could take off when the gong sounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">NL: Did you have any direct contact with the Zionist movement in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">HS: Not me personally, but there were many people who belonged to the Zionist Youth Group.</span> <span id="s285">It was called JPD [Jüdische Pfadfinder Deutschlands], which is a German abbreviation for Jewish Boy Scouts of Germany, but it was a definitely Zionist-oriented organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">NL: And were considerable numbers of Jewish Youth members?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">HS: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s288">The others were in something called Schwarzes Faehnlein which means Black Pennant, also a big organization which operated under the auspices of the Reichsbund Jüdischer Frontsoldaten, which was the organization of former Jewish soldiers, war veterans.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">NL: Was there also a Blau-Weiss, a Blue White group in Frankfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">HS: Blau-Weiss I only know as a sports organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NL: A Jewish sports organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">HS: I don’t recall this.</span> <span id="s293">It’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">NL: In the other cities of Germany apparently it was a Zionist group, maybe more so between the wars in 1910-12, 1918-20.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">HS: Blau-Weiss brings up thoughts of a football team, I mean a soccer team, really, Bavarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">NL: Now I think we can move to...oh, you made some reference to Dovercourt...also in ‘36, you spent a vacation there.</span> <span id="s297">Tell me a little about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">HS: My English teacher in Frankfurt had relatives in Dovercourt, who knew somebody with a boarding house, and this lady took in maybe eight to ten Jewish young men from Germany with the objective of learning English before they emigrated.</span> <span id="s299">However, with all the German boys there, who, of course, only spoke German, because they didn’t know enough English to make it very easy on themselves.</span> <span id="s300">We learned very little English, but it was very nice to be on the beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">NL: You were there for several weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">HS: Yes, I was there for maybe four or five weeks.</span> <span id="s303">Some of them had connections in London and went to London for a few days and came back.</span> <span id="s304">It was interesting.</span> <span id="s305">We could walk; one night we went down to the harbor in Harwich and looked at the ships and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">NL: Was Mother perhaps thinking of sending you to England or trying to get you to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">HS: Well, we were forever thinking of getting out of Germany somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">NL: So, this excursion was conceived with the possible thought that you would...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">HS: For everybody.</span> <span id="s310">Oh yes, for everybody.</span> <span id="s311">By 1936 people had to flee, working on getting out of Germany any way they could, if there was any possibility at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">NL: The German government, Nazi government, in ‘35 and ‘36 when you took these summer vacations, were not restricting you in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">HS: Oh no, we could not take out any money; we went out with ten Marks which was what everybody took out.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">NL: No, I mean for the summer excursions?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">HS: No, they were not restricted.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: You could spend money in the summers of ‘35 and ‘36?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">HS: No, we couldn’t take any money out any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">NL: Well, how were you being supported?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">HS: Well, somebody in England had relatives in Frankfurt, and we gave that money to relatives in Frankfurt, and instead of supporting their relatives from England and Frankfurt they paid towards that boarding house in Dovercourt and we paid for the maintenance of that party in Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s321">Now we will resume the story of your work in the shoe manufacturing factory.</span> <span id="s322">You were saying that you had to get up very early and get a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">HS: There was a great deal of chicanery involved.</span> <span id="s324">They, of course, wanted me to be out of there, to get out of the factory.</span> <span id="s325">There were still Jewish employees and many of them relatives of the owners who were the three brothers.</span> <span id="s326">They had cousins and nephews and friends in there in various positions.</span> <span id="s327">A lot of the salesmen were still Jewish and later on they lost their jobs.</span> <span id="s328">They put me into a department called filing department, which was a tremendously big office with very high shelves of folders for each customer, and I had to come in in the morning and open the mail, sort the mail, and in the evening, when letters had been written that had to be signed by the executives, each letter was put into a separate page of a big folder, and I had to present this folder to the owner or one of the owners who, in turn, looked it over, signed it, and I would turn the page to the next letter.</span> <span id="s329">When these pieces were signed, I took it back to the filing department, which also served as the postal area for the company, and they sent out several hundred letters a day.</span> <span id="s330">They had to be put into envelopes and then put through a machine, which at one and the same time folded the envelopes, sealed them, and stamped them also.</span> <span id="s331">Then the whole thing went into a basket and was taken out.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">NL: How was the atmosphere for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">HS: Unpleasant.</span> <span id="s334">The leading people were in cahoots against the new Jewish arrival and kept me in this department where there was nothing to learn, deliberately, for nine months.</span> <span id="s335">No one had ever been in this department for that long.</span> <span id="s336">It was mind-killing, monotonous.</span> <span id="s337">The top man would call out the name of a customer in a little town in Germany, and I would have to go and run and get this file for him, and bring it to him and take others back.</span> <span id="s338">No apprentice was ever there in that department so long.</span> <span id="s339">The idea was that you circulated from department to department.</span> <span id="s340">Well, I finally had enough of that and really got into another department, which was the billing department, where the atmosphere was very much more pleasant, with the same company, and from there I went into the order department where I processed orders and that was very much nicer too.</span> <span id="s341">Whenever you talk, you worked with simple people and equal people on the scale of employment, they all were very nice.</span> <span id="s342">It was the high-ups that gave you trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">NL: You felt anti-Semitism from the higher level?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">HS: Not overt.</span> <span id="s345">It was disguised under a type of Germanic humor that you don’t find anywhere else.</span> <span id="s346">It must say that the Jewish salesmen who came in from time to time participated in this, because the position of an apprentice in a German commercial establishment is like that of a pariah to begin with.</span> <span id="s347">With this tradition behind them, and having to go through it, it’s like going through hazing at a college.</span> <span id="s348">So, unfortunately, they didn’t know what they were doing, and some of them were caught in Germany with a very unhappy ending.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">NL: How long did you stay in this apprenticeship?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">HS: I stayed in it for 15 months, because eventually the company was so-called “Aryanized.”</span> <span id="s351">The owners sold and went to America, and there was really no point in staying any longer because they would have kicked me out anyway, and they were very happy and relieved when I handed in my resignation.</span> <span id="s352">They gave me a very nice testimonial, and were very nice with regard to restitution, and many years later they must have dug into their files 25 years old to come up with the proof that I worked there and how much I had earned, and were very, very helpful.</span> <span id="s353">And I must say so were the people, that my mother represented in Germany, many years later.</span> <span id="s354">They showed a lot of interest and friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">NL: It helped to confirm her accounting.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">HS: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NL: And so this takes us to what point in time now?</span> <span id="s358">You resigned when?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">HS: I was 15 years old when I left school.</span> <span id="s360">That was in 1936.</span> <span id="s361">That was probably Easter 1936.</span> <span id="s362">I was in England later on.</span> <span id="s363">It’s a little hard to reconstruct it like that.</span> <span id="s364">I think late in 1937.</span> <span id="s365">When I left the shoe factory, there was nothing I could do.</span> <span id="s366">Nobody would employ me anymore, and something had to be done.</span> <span id="s367">I started to study Spanish with a refugee from Barcelona who had married a German insurance executive who was, of course, on the side of Franco, which in those days you didn’t ask much about and didn’t question, because the middle class was unpolitical, especially when you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">NL: Why did you want to study Spanish?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">HS: Well, it was always a good idea that when you left Germany, Spanish might have been important, just as English was.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">NL: You already knew a good bit of English by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">NL: So, what did you then do?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">HS: I tried to get a job the worst way.</span> <span id="s374">I even went to Offenbach, to the leather factories.</span> <span id="s375">They were mostly in Jewish hands, but everybody was giving up.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">NL: Was the Jewish community helping to set up vocational training programs?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">HS: There was a very good vocational ORT school, yes, and people came from all over Germany to Frankfurt, but my situation was in flux.</span> <span id="s378">I had left employment...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">NL: You had had an apprenticeship.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">HS: No, no.</span> <span id="s381">All interrupted.</span> <span id="s382">And you just can’t go into an ORT school without a program, in the middle of the season, so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NL: I see.</span> <span id="s384">You couldn’t go into that.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">HAROLD STERN [1-1- PAGE 1] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive HAROLD STERN [1-2- PAGE 13] From the collection of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Tape two, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s387">NL: This is tape #2, side #1 of an interview with Mr. Harold Stern, September 10, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">HS: When nothing could be found for me to work at, next, a lady whose family had a little factory producing fountain pens and mechanical pens in Frankfurt, and it was a very small place, but the company was still going, and so they said, “Yes, Harold can work here, but in order to teach him the business, you have to pay towards it.”</span> <span id="s389">So instead of earning money working there, we paid just to have myself occupied.</span> <span id="s390">I learned how to cut pencils on lathes, how to polish them and...</span></p> <p><span id="s391">NL: Did you find it interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">HS: It was quite nice.</span> <span id="s393">I had very nice company and it was a place to go to and, under the circumstances, I was thinking of having a place to go to instead of getting up in the morning not knowing what to do.</span> <span id="s394">The foreman came from very far away every morning and it was, the man came from the Odenwald, which was a big distance away from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s395">He must have gotten up very early.</span> <span id="s396">But there were two other, three other young Jewish men there.</span> <span id="s397">One was from Poland, and got deported into no man’s land when the Poles were transferred suddenly by Hitler into Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">NL: Did you ever hear from him?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">HS: Yes, that too is a very interesting story.</span> <span id="s400">And then came November 10, finally, and the two owners of the company were put into concentration camps.</span> <span id="s401">They came back and left Germany, of course, immediately.</span> <span id="s402">In the meantime, well, maybe two months later, everything fell apart.</span> <span id="s403">The factory was taken over, and here we were again we were sitting there.</span> <span id="s404">I think that was 1938, and by that time things were very desperate.</span> <span id="s405">My grandmother...no, an aunt of mine was living at the other end of my street in Frankfurt, and I went to visit her one afternoon, having nothing to do.</span> <span id="s406">She was the sister of my father, and when I got there, she was just finishing with her English lessons, which were given by the best friend of my late father.</span> <span id="s407">We exchanged a few words, and then I left, and that friend of my father’s, whom I had only seen intermittently over the years because he lived far away in a different suburb, said to me, “Harold, if I can be of any help to you, (he wanted to tell me about the birds and the bees and anything at all) I would be very happy to.</span> <span id="s408">There are things you might want to discuss with me you don’t want to discuss with your mother,” and I said, “You know, the only way you can help me is to get out of here, but I don’t expect you can do that any more for me than you can do it for yourself.”</span> <span id="s409">The man was married to a Gentile lady, and he himself had lost his job as a writer for a New York paper, and also had nothing else to do but give English lessons.</span> <span id="s410">He said to me, “You know something, Harold, I don’t know whether it is worth anything, but it is worth a try.</span> <span id="s411">When we were young men, your father and I and a third young man went abroad, and this third man settled in England and went into the banking business and stayed there.</span> <span id="s412">He is an Englishman now, lives in London, and maybe you will write to him.</span> <span id="s413">I haven’t heard from him for a long time.</span> <span id="s414">Tell him that I mentioned his name.”</span> <span id="s415">Now at that time, there were children’s transports going to England for children under the auspices of the Quakers, Society of Friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">NL: Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s418">The Society of Friends was extremely helpful in rescuing children, and under their auspices some children went to Holland, some to England, some to France.</span> <span id="s419">I think what it was, certain people in these foreign countries had declared themselves willing to take in the children.</span> <span id="s420">It is a very interesting chapter, because for years people in Germany relied to some extent on the aid and assistance of the Quakers from abroad, especially from Holland, to organize these transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">NL: Do you have any idea how many Jewish children were saved?</span> <span id="s422">I’ve never heard of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">HS: No, but you can find that out, I am sure.</span> <span id="s424">But I was too old for a children’s transport.</span> <span id="s425">I was already over 16 years old and over the age.</span> <span id="s426">My mother and I had been registered on one and the same quota number, and a very early quota number in Stuttgart to go to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">NL: Can you tell me when Mother first registered?</span> <span id="s428">Do you have any idea?</span> <span id="s429">Did she wait until ‘38?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">HS: Oh, absolutely not, when you first could register.</span> <span id="s431">We had a very early number, we had number 11,022.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">NL: Now, you had said something before about the long lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">HS: We were waiting and could not get out, even when our quota number came due.</span> <span id="s434">The papers were not all right, because too many people who gave us the affidavit in this country had given so many affidavits that the consulate people laughed in Stuttgart when we mentioned their names.</span> <span id="s435">They wouldn’t give us a visa to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">NL: Let me interject for a moment.</span> <span id="s437">Give me some idea of the numbers of people who used to wait in line to apply for emigration.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">HS: The American Consulate was not in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s439">The nearest Consulate was in Stuttgart, which serviced a great part of western and southern Germany.</span> <span id="s440">I imagine there was another one in Hamburg, and, of course, in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">NL: You had said before that people waited in line three stories up the building.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">HS: That was something else.</span> <span id="s443">That was in the police station.</span> <span id="s444">Every Jew had to get something called the Kennkarte which was a special Jewish identification with a “J” in it.</span> <span id="s445">All the men had later in their passport their name, with “Israel,” and the ladies with the name “Sarah.”</span> <span id="s446">So if my mother’s name was Alice Stern, her name would then be Alice Sarah Stern for identification purposes.</span> <span id="s447">Well, the only other way for me to get out to England was with a guarantee in a bank in London, with a job as a so-called trainee in an English factory, with the understanding that as soon as my number and visa came up for the United States, I would leave England for the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">NL: You had written to this old friend of your father’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">HS: Well, this was the situation.</span> <span id="s450">I had written to him and within a week I had an answer that he would do everything possible he could do.</span> <span id="s451">He found me a job immediately and was contacted by a friend of my mother’s who was then in London and relatives of ours.</span> <span id="s452">One went to the Bloomsbury House which was the clearing station for Jewish immigration in London, and the other lady arranged for money to be paid into the account.</span> <span id="s453">It was fifty pounds.</span> <span id="s454">My father’s friend became my guarantor and deposited the fifty pounds in a bank, and a distant relative of mine who was a medical student in England at the time, from a very small stipend that he had himself, paid off a pound per week to pay back the guarantor.</span> <span id="s455">In this way I got to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">NL: What?</span> <span id="s457">March ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">HS: March, ‘39.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">NL: And Mother, of course, remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">HS: My mother stayed in Frankfurt and had to split her apartment with a German dentist, an Aryan dentist, apparently a very young man who was, from what I understand later, very very nice, who established his dental practice in the front rooms and she had the back rooms until she would be able to move out.</span> <span id="s461">I left Germany in March 1939 and had the job waiting for me.</span> <span id="s462">My guarantor, Mr. Worthing, picked me up at the station in London and had found a room for me in the East End of London, in Dalston.</span> <span id="s463">I think I arrived on a Friday, and on a Saturday we went, my landlady’s daughter took me around.</span> <span id="s464">The people in that particular section of London were a totally new breed.</span> <span id="s465">They were not only British, but they were first or second generation immigrants into England and spoke more Yiddish than English.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">NL: And you didn’t know Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">HS: So once again I could not learn too much English.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">NL: Sounds like a conspiracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">HS: Of course, they spoke it, but they used it only outside.</span> <span id="s470">They could not understand that a Jewish person doesn’t speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s471">And among themselves they always spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s472">I understood less of their Yiddish than I understood their English.</span> <span id="s473">When I went to the factory everybody spoke Cockney.</span> <span id="s474">And there again, no English.</span> <span id="s475">Gradually my ear got attuned to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">NL: What work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">HS: O.K.</span> <span id="s478">The people for whom I worked had a factory in Pentonville Road.</span> <span id="s479">The owners were former German Jewish people who had moved from Nuremberg to London and had for some years been naturalized citizens of England.</span> <span id="s480">They had a very nice thing going with one branch by that time established in England and one branch in New York State.</span> <span id="s481">They had under one roof lots of different businesses.</span> <span id="s482">They had one department which made shoelaces and boxed them.</span> <span id="s483">And the next department made a kind of powder that when you added it to water makes an orangeade or lemonade with a fizz.</span> <span id="s484">The next department produced games, like Snakes and Ladders, which is an English game for kids, and another one made firecrackers, and another produced Christmas stockings.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">NL: A multipurpose business!</span> <span id="s486">And what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">HS: And for all this there was a department that produced boxes, and things were boxed and sent to Canada and all over the world, mostly utilizing merchandise produced in Germany and Japan and so on.</span> <span id="s488">Well, I was working in the box-making department and after a few weeks of carrying papers and cartons, I was privileged enough to work on something called the guillotine, which today we call a papercutter.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">NL: This was a promotion.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s491">This went on for quite a while, several months.</span> <span id="s492">In the meantime I heard from my mother occasionally, and I met some friends in England who subsequently moved in with me, the same house, and at one fine point we reached September 1939, and I was on my way to see my guarantor in Hempstead.</span> <span id="s493">At that point people were talking, in the train, what Hitler’s answers would be after the ultimatum that Chamberlain had given him after the invasion of Poland.</span> <span id="s494">And with this, the sirens went off and the train stopped for a moment and went on and somebody said very dryly, “Well, this is Hitler’s answer.”</span> <span id="s495">A marvelous British understatement.</span> <span id="s496">They’re so wonderful.</span> <span id="s497">So I arrived at my station and, of course this was the middle of a Sunday afternoon, it was about 12:00, and the streets were swept clean of people.</span> <span id="s498">I arrived on Finchley Road, which is a main street in Hempstead, and wanted to go to my guarantor who lived on top of a department store in a very nice apartment building, but had to duck into a doorway in order not to be seen by the air raid wardens.</span> <span id="s499">That was the time that started for everybody to start seeking shelter.</span> <span id="s500">When the “all-clear” sounded ten minutes later, and I proceeded to my guarantor and I said to him, “With this war on now, what am I going to do?”</span> <span id="s501">And he said, “Harold, there is nothing I can do for you.</span> <span id="s502">You have to fight your own battle now.”</span> <span id="s503">This was a great education.</span> <span id="s504">He was very nice throughout and very helpful.</span> <span id="s505">The rest of the day I spent with another man, an English teacher of mine from Frankfurt who, at that time lived just around the corner from these people in Hempstead.</span> <span id="s506">When I came home that evening about 6:00, my landlady and her daughter had flown the coop.</span> <span id="s507">They got so panicked that they immediately packed a few things and went into the country together with other relatives.</span> <span id="s508">I never saw her any more, ever again.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">NL: Were you able to get into your room?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">HS: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s511">My friends were there with a short wave station and watching things that way, and, in the meantime, there was a raid on the Kiel Canal and it was very heartening, but didn’t result in very much, and then I cooked some of the food that was still available in the house, and after a week of this, I was working and nobody else touched anything, I said to myself, “Why should I go shopping for food and why should I do all this?</span> <span id="s512">If nobody else is interested in it, I will move out.”</span> <span id="s513">So I moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">NL: Your friends also had moved out?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">HS: No, they were still there, but nobody made a move.</span> <span id="s516">The landlady had gone and it was really an untenable situation.</span> <span id="s517">How can you live in a house with a landlady gone?</span> <span id="s518">We were not equipped to keep house.</span> <span id="s519">We all had our jobs!</span></p> <p><span id="s520">NL: You had taken your meals with her before?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">HS: Yes, she provided dinner and breakfast for one pound a week.</span> <span id="s522">I couldn’t argue with this, but I only made 30 shillings at the time, out of which one shilling and six-pence went for health insurance.</span> <span id="s523">But a streetcar or bus ride was only tuppence, two pennies or one penny.</span> <span id="s524">So I found myself a room closer to where I worked in North London, and these people were...it was an interesting situation.</span> <span id="s525">These were very poor working-class people, and the house had no electricity and no telephone.</span> <span id="s526">I understand even to this day telephones are not as common as they are in this country, when it comes to England.</span> <span id="s527">But electricity was provided by gas jets.</span> <span id="s528">My room had two canaries, and when I woke up at night and I heard them scratching I was happy.</span> <span id="s529">This was the only way I could find out that no gas was escaping.</span> <span id="s530">Still and all, I was corresponding with Germany still because somehow my mother had found somebody in Denmark who forwarded correspondence between different parties.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">NL: What was her life like in ‘39?</span> <span id="s532">Did she still have the means to exist?</span> <span id="s533">Was there food rationing for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">HS: Yes, eventually things got very rough for the Jews living in Frankfurt, or Germany altogether.</span> <span id="s535">They were forced to move into boardinghouses and give up their apartments and move into single rooms.</span> <span id="s536">Each one had a single room, which, I suppose, was all a measure to get them closer together for later events.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">NL: Her number obviously had not been called for immigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">HS: It was absolutely useless.</span> <span id="s539">So she ended up in a boarding house that my grandmother had lived in before my grandmother moved to Holland.</span> <span id="s540">My mother saw my grandmother off to the airport in Frankfurt, and my grandmother went to Holland, where she joined two cousins of mine in Amsterdam, and my mother still kept the friendship of a very nice Jewish man who liked her very much apparently and wanted to marry her, as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s541">But she also had the friendship of a Gentile lady, who used to be the housekeeper and companion of a lady in Frankfurt, who, before that, had moved to California.</span> <span id="s542">Without these two people my mother could never have left Frankfurt, because, after she had moved out of the apartment, she then could not move around as freely as before.</span> <span id="s543">There were curfews for Jews and curfews for others.</span> <span id="s544">You were not allowed to buy groceries until late at night.</span> <span id="s545">I happen to know that our former landlord, a Gentile, was beaten up by party members because he had dared to sell fish and food to Jewish customers.</span> <span id="s546">These are things that usually don’t come out very often, but they do exist.</span> <span id="s547">My mother had bought a lot of new furniture, because she had intended to go to New York and open a boarding house.</span> <span id="s548">So we were sitting there, with all this disillusion taking place, in great grandeur with fruit-wood modern furniture, Oriental carpets, everything...she was hoping to bring it out.</span> <span id="s549">We almost succeeded.</span> <span id="s550">What happened was, everything was put into a great big box, which is called lift-van, and my mother paid for it to go to America, and it was all paid for with the exception of a few Guilders that had to be paid in foreign currency to pass through Holland.</span> <span id="s551">This was a device by the Nazis to get in foreign currency.</span> <span id="s552">The trip from Holland to New York was paid in German Marks to the German shipping agency.</span> <span id="s553">Whatever you took out, you paid extra money, which was called gold discount, which was an extra way of the Nazis to get Jewish money, usually from accounts that were already blocked anyhow.</span> <span id="s554">All this almost worked, but our relatives in Holland, and my mother never stopped talking about it, did not have the money to pay those ten Guilders or 15 Guilders.</span> <span id="s555">So my mother stored this whole thing in the free port of Hamburg, waiting for an occasion to get it out later.</span> <span id="s556">In the meantime, she was pursuing her own emigration.</span> <span id="s557">I was in England, of course.</span> <span id="s558">Finally, it became obvious that there was no way of sending this out anymore.</span> <span id="s559">The war had started, she wanted to leave Germany, couldn’t get the stuff out, so she said to her friend, “You know what, I am going to get all the stuff back, and you can put it into your apartment, and you can administer it for me or enjoy it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s560">NL: This was her non-Jewish friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">HS: Yes, “Until such time when and if we meet again.”</span> <span id="s562">And there was all this furniture, and all the housewares, and it was brought back from Hamburg to Frankfurt, and put into the apartment of that very, very lovely lady, and when they opened it up, of course the oriental carpets were missing, the stamp collection was missing, which seems to be silly to talk about under the circumstances and in view of what had happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s563">It’s just to illustrate how things worked.</span> <span id="s564">So my mother, after many trials and tribulations, finally got her visa and went to Berlin in a sealed train in August or September, 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">NL: She was in Germany until 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">HS: Yes, but America wasn’t in the war yet, and people left Germany on the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Japan and then to America.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">NL: Yes, but in the ‘30’s, not so much in the ‘40’s.</span> <span id="s568">This was a very late departure, was it not?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">HS: There was a time, with the Stalin-Hitler Pact, where people...</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Tape two, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s571">NL: This is tape #2, side #2 of an interview with Mr. Harold Stern, September 10, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">HS: My mother left Germany with one of the last steamers leaving Portugal for America.</span> <span id="s573">In order to do this, they were all gathered at a certain place in Berlin at the station, and went with a sealed train through occupied France and Vichy France and Spain to Lisbon, where they boarded their transport for America.</span> <span id="s574">My mother said good-bye to her brother in Berlin on that occasion.</span> <span id="s575">He was later on hunted by Gestapo agents.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NL: He couldn’t get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">HS: No.</span> <span id="s578">He was really very, very daring.</span> <span id="s579">He had a very nice Christian girlfriend who stuck by him and wrote to us after the war that she saw him being, well—he was actually apprehended on his roof with bloodhounds.</span> <span id="s580">They took him to Gestapo headquarters, and she stayed outside the Gestapo headquarters all night, and she never saw him again.</span> <span id="s581">Another thing that happened in the family was that my mother had a sister in Germany who was a musician.</span> <span id="s582">She taught piano and had a very deep friendship with a critic who was fairly well known in musical circles, who wrote musical articles in the daily papers, and who had also written books on music.</span> <span id="s583">That was the oldest sister of a family of four children.</span> <span id="s584">She was a little bit of a nervous person and never married and all she had was her music.</span> <span id="s585">She lived with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s586">The attachment to that family of the critic was a very deep one, and they felt very, very congenial to her and she to them.</span> <span id="s587">But these people lived in the Taunus mountains somewhere, a little distance away from Frankfurt, and one fine day they said to her, “We are very sorry, but you know, we cannot have you here anymore.”</span> <span id="s588">This was a terrible blow for that poor soul and she never quite recovered from it.</span> <span id="s589">She lived with my grandfather, who, by that time, was, of course, very much retired and just made a living with the support of my mother.</span> <span id="s590">She felt very much misunderstood by everybody and, of course, after the death of her own mother she was pretty much alone.</span> <span id="s591">I understand that after I left Frankfurt, they had to put her in a sanitarium, and my mother went to visit her from time to time, and when she spoke to one...on one of her visits, she spoke to one of the doctors there.</span> <span id="s592">She was in a public sanitarium in Niederrad which is near Frankfurt, and the doctor said to my mother, “I have to tell you, we are required to send your sister East.”</span> <span id="s593">She had tried to commit suicide twice, the first time she only broke her leg jumping out of the window, the second time I don’t know what happened, but this was the time that Hitler had instituted the elimination of people who were a drain on the “German Volkskörper,” so to speak.</span> <span id="s594">[German population -ed.]</span></p> <p><span id="s595">NL: Euthanasia.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">HS: This man actually said...and my mother said, “Well, what can I do?</span> <span id="s597">Can I take her into my house again?</span> <span id="s598">Can she live with us?”</span> <span id="s599">The doctor said, “I am very sorry, Mrs. Stern, but we have strict orders, and your sister will not feel anything.</span> <span id="s600">We are going to put her on a train, and she is going to get a needle, and that will be all we can do.”</span></p> <p><span id="s601">NL: He told her this?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">HS: My mother didn’t talk about a lot of things.</span> <span id="s603">It was one of the few things that came out, and she only mentioned it once.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">NL: This is the first time I have ever heard of an admission by a German that this euthanasia was in existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">HS: Well, my mother had a very good way of relating to people wherever she went.</span> <span id="s606">She got to people, and people respected her, and she had a very pleasant appearance, and she knew how to talk to people.</span> <span id="s607">She was a business woman.</span> <span id="s608">She was a civilized human being, and she dressed nicely and was attractive so...</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NL: Now back to you, Harold.</span> <span id="s610">You had left your landlady...</span></p> <p><span id="s611">HS: O.K. I stayed with these people and now we get into 1940 more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">NL: Was there any pressure on you from the British authorities to leave?</span> <span id="s613">Was there some labeling of you as an enemy alien, anything of that sort?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">HS: I want to come to this.</span> <span id="s615">In the meantime the war went through Dunkirk in Europe.</span> <span id="s616">The British troops came back.</span> <span id="s617">Everything went against England.</span> <span id="s618">Paris had been occupied, and the Jewish refugees in England were classified.</span> <span id="s619">There were three classifications: A, B and C.</span> <span id="s620">The A category was simply Nazis, Fascists, and real German Gentiles who were caught in England with the German Mercantile [Merchant?]</span> <span id="s621">Marine, political business, diplomatic business, and these were clear-cut cases.</span> <span id="s622">I don’t think that the British quite knew what they were doing in those days, and it was admitted later on in the House of Commons, too.</span> <span id="s623">The classifications of B and C: You had to, every refugee had to appear before a tribunal with a judge, to be classified for the future and for the security of the State, of course.</span> <span id="s624">They all were not only violently anti-Hitler and pro-British, but I would say that 95% had volunteered for National Service, which was the only thing you could do, under the circumstances, as an enemy alien in England to prove your willingness to fight Hitler.</span> <span id="s625">These judges had very unspecified instructions, and the B case was...if you were a B category, you had more of a curfew, less chance of moving around, and you were supposedly declared a little bit more dangerous, if at all, than the C cases.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">NL: Could you work in the B category?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">HS: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s628">Many of the judges, not knowing what they were doing, in the interest of their country, imposed the classification of B category on people who were perfectly innocuous, and other judges just went ahead and classified these German Jewish refugees as C cases.</span> <span id="s629">It really was a very arbitrary matter, and I brought testimonials from the people I worked for, and from my landlord and I happened to become a C case.</span> <span id="s630">I think what helped me was the fact that I was in a district of London where there were very few refugees, and that judge simply set me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">NL: It was accidental then?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">HS: Well, there were a lot of C cases, but the B cases were all interned on May 16, 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NL: What happened on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">HS: On that day all the B cases were picked up by Scotland Yard or by the army, let’s call it British authorities, and they were taken to the Isle of Man, and the C cases were still running around freely.</span> <span id="s635">I was still working, and, I think, it was June 10, I am not quite sure, I was cutting papers on my papercutter, when the son of one of the owners of my factory, who never talked to me; they were very remote, came to me and said to me, “Harold, they’re interning all the refugees.</span> <span id="s636">Maybe you want to go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s637">NL: Home?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">HS: Well, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NL: In England.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">HS: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s641">My home was ten minutes from the factory.</span> <span id="s642">I said, “Thank you very much for the information,” and that was the last time I saw him.</span> <span id="s643">I went home, took my camera and my bank book to my guarantor in Hempstead, came back, and then I said to my landlady, “You know, I am going to pack.</span> <span id="s644">It is possible that I will be picked up sometime between today or tomorrow, and I want to have my suitcases packed.</span> <span id="s645">When somebody knocks at the door don’t get alarmed.”</span> <span id="s646">They were very simple people, you know.</span> <span id="s647">So she said, “All right.”</span> <span id="s648">When I happened to them, so to speak, I had brought in a totally different world, something they had never seen, something they had never heard, and I was able to really become very good friends of theirs.</span> <span id="s649">They were very nice to me.</span> <span id="s650">One funny episode happened.</span> <span id="s651">There was a man living in that house who was a little bit of a drunkard, a bachelor.</span> <span id="s652">He had a room there, and he was employed by the London County Council.</span> <span id="s653">His job was to check the manholes in certain districts of London and see that everything went all right.</span> <span id="s654">I didn’t know what his real classification was.</span> <span id="s655">It was one of those jobs, but he could never get it through his head that I was a refugee.</span> <span id="s656">To him I was “dyed-in-the-wool German” and an enemy.</span> <span id="s657">And whenever there was a setback for the Germans and, unfortunately, there were very few setbacks, when there were any, he would talk to me and say, “Your country isn’t doing so well, is it?”</span> <span id="s658">I told him, “It’s not my country.</span> <span id="s659">I am on your side.</span> <span id="s660">What are you talking about?”</span> <span id="s661">He did that several times and finally my landlady and my landlord said, “Don’t talk to Jock, he’ll never understand.”</span></p> <p><span id="s662">NL: I presume a number of British had this feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">HS: Well, you had to be very dense under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s664">But this man was very, very stupid.</span> <span id="s665">It was sheer stupidity.</span> <span id="s666">You couldn’t convince him.</span> <span id="s667">There was somebody else who lived in the house who felt sorry for the refugee boy.</span> <span id="s668">I was between 18 and 19 years old.</span> <span id="s669">He took me to a music hall to entertain me on a Saturday afternoon.</span> <span id="s670">This happened, too.</span> <span id="s671">One night in the winter, long before this internment business happened, there was a knock on the door.</span> <span id="s672">Nine o’clock at night, and my landlady said, “Scotland Yard is here, and they want to talk to you.”</span> <span id="s673">I said, “Scotland Yard?</span> <span id="s674">What would they want from me?”</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: You had left your job already?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">HS: That was in the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">NL: In the fall of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">HS: Yes, but I had not left my job.</span> <span id="s679">I worked in my job in London until the last day before I was interned.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">NL: But your boss had said...</span></p> <p><span id="s681">HS: But I am switching back now to four months earlier, and Scotland Yard knocked on the door, and two very nice gentlemen came in and said to me, “We have some information.</span> <span id="s682">Do you have a typewriter?”</span> <span id="s683">I said, “Yes, I have a typewriter.</span> <span id="s684">There it is.”</span> <span id="s685">And I got a little bit apprehensive, because I was corresponding with my mother by way of Sweden, and having been brought up in Germany, I very nicely put everything in a folder, punched date by date, not only her letters, but all the copies of my letters.</span> <span id="s686">I was brought up like that, and I guess it gets into your blood, and you don’t do it differently.</span> <span id="s687">I said, “Well, here is the typewriter.</span> <span id="s688">What else do you want to see?”</span> <span id="s689">And I was ready to show them all the correspondence.</span> <span id="s690">There was nothing in there that was in any way inimical.</span> <span id="s691">I could have done without it.</span> <span id="s692">Why start up a hornet’s nest.</span> <span id="s693">So they looked at everything and I said to them, “Do you feel you want to see some of my correspondence?”</span> <span id="s694">They said, “No.”</span> <span id="s695">And then I said to them, “Look, to whom and to what do I owe this pleasure?”</span> <span id="s696">They said, “Well, apparently there is somebody in this house who hears you using the typewriter, and he called us and informed us that you were doing that, and that you were corresponding with the enemy.”</span> <span id="s697">That was that idiot.</span> <span id="s698">So you can get into all kinds of situations.</span> <span id="s699">Before I moved from the East End to North London, I was in a very Jewish neighborhood.</span> <span id="s700">And after two weeks I hear the Horst-Wessel Song [the Nazi anthem] in English, and speeches and people at my next street corner.</span> <span id="s701">I didn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">NL: These were English Fascists.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">HS: They were English Fascists.</span> <span id="s704">It was the Mosley group, who, of all the places in London, picked my street corner to demonstrate and hold their meetings.</span> <span id="s705">So you can imagine.</span> <span id="s706">Well, anyway...</span></p> <p><span id="s707">NL: And they were not being stopped?</span> <span id="s708">Even after England declared war on Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">HS: Well, I guess they were stopped, but then I moved out a week later.</span> <span id="s710">What happened afterwards, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s711">I heard later on that Jewish people banded together and beat them up or something.</span> <span id="s712">This was even a tough Jewish neighborhood where I was.</span> <span id="s713">These people were not taking it anymore.</span> <span id="s714">But there were quite a few experiences.</span> <span id="s715">So, I went...when I left...to get back to the day before my internment, I told my landlady that I may be picked up, and sure enough I was picked up the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">NL: This was in June?</span></p> <p><span id="s717">HS: This was in June 1940, and I was taken to a police station and got processed, or a general gathering place, where I met a lot more German Jewish people, and then we went on a truck to a race course in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">NL: Did anyone tell you why you were being taken out of your homes?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">HS: They were rounding up everybody.</span> <span id="s720">If you were familiar with the situation of the B case, of course, they just processed you to be interned as a C case.</span> <span id="s721">At that time the Home Office was under Herbert Morrison, and he claimed he couldn’t guarantee the safety of Britain with all the German refugees running around, after what had happened in Holland, with the nuns in the trains who had hairy hands and suddenly threw off their habits and became the real Nazis.</span> <span id="s722">So, it was a very bad time.</span> <span id="s723">We got to a race course called Kempton Park and after a few...we slept in the grandstands...it was the summer, and from there went to an internment camp near Liverpool.</span> <span id="s724">The name of the place was Huyten.</span> <span id="s725">Huyten was a working settlement that had just been finished before the war to harbor workers’ families.</span> <span id="s726">It was like a new development for low-income people but, instead, at this time it was occupied by thousands of people who were interned, and who slept on the ground in the empty houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">NL: These were Jews and non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s728">HS: They were mostly Jews.</span> <span id="s729">The non-Jews had been interned much earlier.</span> <span id="s730">They were on the Isle of Man, and, by that time, one transport of internees had already been sunk on the way over to Canada.</span> <span id="s731">The name of the boat was the Arandorra Star, and at one time...it was lunch time or mess time, and quite a few of the people who had been floating in the water came back to the camp where we were, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">NL: They told you their experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s733">HS: Well, they were in a separate area, I think.</span> <span id="s734">I never met them.</span> <span id="s735">But then...also a lot of them were not only Jewish, but they had been German Nazis, and Mercantile Marine, and so on, and Italians, too.</span> <span id="s736">After a few days there, we were on parade, roll call, and the leadership of the camp told us that a boat was leaving Liverpool the next day for Canada and, if we wanted to volunteer to go to Canada, we would then have a much easier time immigrating to the U.S. from there, and this was July, 1940.</span> <span id="s737">The war was lost, so to speak, on the Continent.</span> <span id="s738">It was pretty hopeless.</span> <span id="s739">I didn’t have any people in England except for an aunt, and there was no reason for me to stay in England.</span> <span id="s740">So I volunteered for that transport together with many others.</span> <span id="s741">The next day we were taken to the Port of Liverpool and we boarded the ship in the evening and left for, supposedly, Canada.</span> <span id="s742">The garrison on that ship were mostly members of the dregs of the British Army, people who had done time in the penitentiaries, people who had only one eye...there’s nothing wrong with having one eye...but they were the opposite of the cream of the crop, so to speak.</span> <span id="s743">No political understanding at all.</span> <span id="s744">On this ship were people from the Kitchener Camp, which had been emptied, and all these people were interned.</span> <span id="s745">The Kitchener Camp was the refugee camp established in England to receive those who had come from Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen and other concentration camps, on their way to America, as a transfer station.</span> <span id="s746">However, not only were we treated very badly on this ship, people had their life’s belongings with them, documents of books they had written, jewelry, anything of value was stripped from them.</span> <span id="s747">The luggage that they had was opened up, and partially thrown into the sea, partially the soldiers took it for themselves.</span> <span id="s748">Those who protested were roughly handled, and we finally got on our way.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">NL: Do you have any idea how many people there were in this transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">HS: The ship’s name was the Dunera and was a 12,000 ton ship and I think there were 3,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">NL: And your impression is that there were other ships like this leaving England with German Jews on them?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">HS: No, not too many.</span> <span id="s753">I think we were perhaps the last or next to last boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">NL: But there had been others?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">HS: Yes, but there were boats that went to Canada, and I know people reached Canada on boat.</span> <span id="s756">I don’t know anything about this, unfortunately, because I never really pursued this.</span> <span id="s757">We never heard about anything like that under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s758">But then we started out in a convoy, several other ships, and the second night out...we were in the Irish Sea...by that time people were very, very sick, very desperate, the food was very bad.</span> <span id="s759">We were not allowed on deck, the rumors got worse and worse about how people had been treated.</span> <span id="s760">It had no proper accommodations, people slept on hammocks hanging in the upper deck and lower deck, or on the floors or on the tables.</span> <span id="s761">It was totally overcrowded.</span> <span id="s762">I’m trying to find a picture of the boat.</span> <span id="s763">Anyway, we were...when people were at their worst and sickest, we were attacked by German U-boats.</span> <span id="s764">Until this day I can still hear the clatter of the depth charges that our ship threw off.</span> <span id="s765">But we got through it all right.</span> <span id="s766">After two or three days we were allowed on deck for twenty minutes, barefoot, marching around.</span> <span id="s767">We couldn’t get to our belongings at all.</span> <span id="s768">We had one suit, what we had on our backs, no toothbrush, no comb.</span> <span id="s769">A few people rescued some things, and had put some things in their pockets and that’s what they had.</span> <span id="s770">What we did have, however, was constantly hot showers and sea baths.</span> <span id="s771">You know, hot showers and salt water.</span> <span id="s772">Amazingly, we kept somewhat healthy.</span> <span id="s773">Of course, the food was so bad and so rare that people were very hungry and after a while...</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Tape three, side one:</span></p> <p><span id="s775">NL: This is tape #3, side #1, of an interview with Mr. Harold Stern, September 10, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span> <span id="s776">We last left your narrative, Harold, where the ship received instructions to turn back.</span> <span id="s777">Do you have an idea why this decision was made?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">HS: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s779">I presume that Australia had made arrangements to receive prisoners of war, and since there were no prisoners of war to send at that time, they just sent us being the most available material.</span> <span id="s780">The Canadian camps were probably filled and perhaps it was the safer route to go to begin with.</span> <span id="s781">Also, England was very dependent on boats coming back from Australia as much as from Canada and from India with raw materials and food, and all that.</span> <span id="s782">So by shipping us there there may be all kinds of reasons why they changed their minds.</span> <span id="s783">We never found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">NL: What date was this approximately?</span> <span id="s785">How long had you been on the seas?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">HS: We were on the seas for about ten weeks.</span> <span id="s787">It was a very long trip because first we went half-way across the Atlantic and, then, we went along the west coast of Africa.</span> <span id="s788">I am trying to think which the first port was.</span> <span id="s789">The first port was a little town called Takuradi, which today is Shana, and we stayed there for a short period of time, two or three days, and then we went down the coast to a city called Freetown, which must be Bechuanaland, because the butter that was served afterwards on the ship was called Bechuanaland butter.</span> <span id="s790">I remember that distinctly.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">NL: Was the food getting a little better as you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">HS: Not really.</span> <span id="s793">Maybe we got an apple for a change, which we hadn’t seen for a long time, and we got butter, which we hadn’t seen for a long time.</span> <span id="s794">But generally speaking there wasn’t any improvement.</span> <span id="s795">There just wasn’t very much that could be done.</span> <span id="s796">The boat was equipped for a certain passage that took on no provisions, and then we went to Capetown.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">NL: Was the treatment being meted out to you somewhat decent?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">HS: No, we were still allowed only 20 minutes on deck.</span> <span id="s799">There was no way of protesting.</span> <span id="s800">In fact some of the soldiers amused themselves by throwing empty beer bottles under the feet of people walking on the deck barefoot.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NL: How do you account for so much hostility?</span> <span id="s802">Did they think you were Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">HS: Of course.</span> <span id="s804">We were enemy aliens.</span> <span id="s805">They had come through Dunkirk.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">NL: They had no conception of what was happening to Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">HS: This was too sophisticated a situation for anybody to grasp.</span> <span id="s808">No one had heard of German refugees, probably.</span> <span id="s809">In spite of the fact that they were religious people, Orthodox people, people with long beards, people with Orthodox clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">NL: Were there any children on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">HS: Oh, no, only men.</span> <span id="s812">There was one section that was full of Germans and Italians, and then the rest of the people on board were all German refugees or Austrian refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">NL: You didn’t mix?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">HS: They were kept in a separate area, which was arranged beforehand somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">NL: You said there was a somewhat better internal organization of this group.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">HS: Well, one gets used to everything, of course.</span> <span id="s817">By that time people were ready to clean up the various messes.</span> <span id="s818">People learned to live with the conditions.</span> <span id="s819">I mean it wasn’t that the garrison came down to beat anybody up any more, but people had lost everything and were very despondent.</span> <span id="s820">They didn’t know where they were going, what was happening to them...</span></p> <p><span id="s821">NL: You heard no news about what was happening elsewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">HS: No, no.</span> <span id="s823">Nothing, just rumors.</span> <span id="s824">We had no fresh fruit whatsoever.</span> <span id="s825">You had a table with twenty people, which was folded down and set to eat.</span> <span id="s826">At one time we had an apple for each one.</span> <span id="s827">While you had this arrangement, two people always had to go to the kitchen to get a bucketful of tea and a bucketful of food.</span> <span id="s828">Well, you could rest assured that by the time the person came back from the kitchen, his apple was no more there.</span> <span id="s829">It happened to me.</span> <span id="s830">Was no big shakes...what is one apple?</span> <span id="s831">But this is how people lived, and there was a lot of selfishness on the part of some people and, I must say, I was amazed that a lot of people who had been through concentration camps were totally selfish, and others, who had led completely different lives, people who had been to colleges in England...we had some very fine persons there...One was a son of the Bleichroeder family, so they behaved totally humane and helpful, and tried to do everything they could to make life easier.</span> <span id="s832">About that time there were a lot of intellectual people there, and, of course, politically oriented people, so they started lectures, or they read from the Bible with commentaries.</span> <span id="s833">So, at least, you had some food for thought and didn’t linger like animals waiting to be fed.</span> <span id="s834">It got more bearable except for the hunger and the general situation.</span> <span id="s835">Well, we got to Capetown and were there for three days.</span> <span id="s836">We were never allowed on deck in the harbor but we lined up to look out at the Table Mountain through a latrine window, at least, so we saw a beautiful city with the mountain in back of it beautifully lit up.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">NL: So far away...</span></p> <p><span id="s838">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s839">Then we went to Perth and Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney.</span> <span id="s840">At Sydney we disembarked.</span> <span id="s841">This whole trip took ten weeks.</span> <span id="s842">Then we got off and we looked pretty bad and very disheveled.</span> <span id="s843">We were practically loaded from the boat onto a passenger train, and in the evening the passenger train left.</span> <span id="s844">For the first time, we were handed a box lunch with fresh fruit, sandwiches, things we hadn’t tasted in months.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">NL: Who arranged this?</span> <span id="s846">The municipality or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">HS: No, the Jews didn’t even know we were there.</span> <span id="s848">They couldn’t know.</span> <span id="s849">This was all government and military supplied.</span> <span id="s850">Of course there was plenty of good food in Australia.</span> <span id="s851">We didn’t have to skimp on anything, but they had expected Italian and German soldiers, prisoners of war, and instead of the paratroopers, they got the people from the Kitchener Camp, and the German refugees, and the Orthodox Jews, and they had quite a surprise.</span> <span id="s852">They didn’t know what to do with us.</span> <span id="s853">I mean the government was completely baffled.</span> <span id="s854">As we were on the train, we took a very long trip and, while it was very nice and warm when we got on the train, it got colder and colder overnight and we found out later on that we went through mountains and it was just a trip from Sydney in New South Wales into the interior.</span> <span id="s855">As we woke up in the morning, the heat was terrific and, by that time, we really were in the Outback.</span> <span id="s856">We saw ostriches, kangaroos, and our spirits lifted a bit, but then there was no more vegetation to speak of.</span> <span id="s857">It wasn’t really desert, but very, very sparse.</span> <span id="s858">There were eucalyptus trees here and there, and, as we drove through these little stations along the way, we saw signs “Beware of tarantulas,” “Beware of such a snake, such a spider,” and it was a totally new exotic setting.</span> <span id="s859">So we finally arrived about noontime in a very, very flat landscape.</span> <span id="s860">That was the city of Hay in New South Wales.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">NL: How many days had you been on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">HS: We had been on the train from 6:00 at night until 12 noon the next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">NL: Sounds like a long, long journey.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">HS: We got unloaded, so to speak, and in the distance, there was a great big compound with barbed wire, with huts reflecting the sunlight in a sparkling fashion.</span> <span id="s865">It was just like everything was waving in the heat, and we marched into that place, and had our first hot meal, which the army there had prepared, and then went into those different huts and tried to arrange to stay together in groups of friends, and that was O.K.</span> <span id="s866">After we had eaten and before we went into these camps, we were waiting to be allotted to those different areas and a tremendous sandstorm arose.</span> <span id="s867">It went through everything, and even after we got into the huts later on, which were two bunks in rows one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s868">Because of the heat, you could not have the huts closed up with a full wall under the roof.</span> <span id="s869">There was a space between the outer wall and the roof, which was filled in with chicken wire to let the air come in all the time and to circulate, and the sand and the dust blew right through.</span> <span id="s870">By that time we were dreadfully exhausted and [wondered] why should we be in this camp?</span> <span id="s871">For what reason?</span> <span id="s872">But there we were...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">NL: Did anyone address you?</span> <span id="s874">To tell you what lay in store for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s875">HS: I think the authorities were so surprised about what they were getting that they had simply nothing to say, and, of course, very shortly a camp leadership emerged, and there were enough doctors, lawyers, even members of the British Bar, totally anglicized, who had a way of talking to the authorities.</span> <span id="s876">Within a very short time we got life organized in these camps.</span> <span id="s877">Lecturers were springing up, lecture series, and after a while it became almost pleasant but in an unjustified fashion.</span> <span id="s878">We didn’t know, of course, why we shouldn’t, as enemies of the Germans, why we should be behind barbed wire sitting in Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">NL: Were you put to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s880">HS: No, not really.</span> <span id="s881">There was so much to do in camp, digging ditches around the huts, for instance, to have the water flow off...</span></p> <p><span id="s882">NL: But this was on your own initiative?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s884">Our strength came back.</span> <span id="s885">We had a medical hut, of course.</span> <span id="s886">We had medical doctors from Vienna and Berlin, all kinds of specialists.</span> <span id="s887">There were musicians.</span> <span id="s888">Everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">NL: You had concerts?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">HS: We had nothing, of course, to work with.</span> <span id="s891">After a while people in Melbourne became aware of us.</span> <span id="s892">We wrote to the Jewish community there.</span> <span id="s893">They were very surprised.</span> <span id="s894">Of course, they had read about us in the papers, but somehow it quite didn’t sink in, and there was one organization which was simply marvelous.</span> <span id="s895">It was the Australian Christian Student Movement under a Miss Margaret Holmes, who took us under their wings, and they fed us all kinds of books, lecture books, and supplied us with material as if we were a university.</span> <span id="s896">The Australian Christian Student Movement.</span> <span id="s897">I met Miss Holmes in New York many years ago.</span> <span id="s898">But it was due to their specific effort that we really could continue our education and kept our minds active.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">NL: How do you account for this interest, Harold?</span> <span id="s900">Was it Miss Holmes who took this project upon herself?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">HS: I don’t know if she is still alive.</span> <span id="s902">But she was a marvelous, marvelous woman.</span> <span id="s903">And she had all of these resources at her disposal.</span> <span id="s904">Of course she was not the only one.</span> <span id="s905">There was a Zionist organization, the Jewish Welfare Board.</span> <span id="s906">Again, some of them wanted to have nothing to do with us.</span> <span id="s907">There was one rabbi in Melbourne who said, “Why are these people coming here, why don’t they shake the dust off their shoes and go back where they come from?”</span> <span id="s908">And others just couldn’t do enough.</span> <span id="s909">I myself was told from America that I had relatives in Melbourne, to whom I wrote.</span> <span id="s910">I had never known about them back in Frankfurt, and they had converted to non-Jewish in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s911">I didn’t know about them, but it was a lovely family, and they sent me my first toothbrush and sausage and other things like that.</span> <span id="s912">At least I had somebody to write to there, and later on, after I was released I had wonderful times with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">NL: You couldn’t be in touch with Mother, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">HS: Well, yes.</span> <span id="s915">My mother was still in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">NL: She didn’t leave until ‘41?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">HS: And this was ‘40.</span> <span id="s918">I had never expected to see my mother ever again, because in the meantime, this lady wrote to me from Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s919">I was together with her brother in the internment camp.</span> <span id="s920">She wrote to me [how] bored she was, how there was nothing for her to do, and one fine day...The correspondence was with the Red Cross...Prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s921">Then one fine day, I didn’t hear from her anymore.</span> <span id="s922">The last I heard from her was, “Don’t forget me,” and we went from that camp, which was in Hay, to be a better climate camp in Tatura in Victoria.</span> <span id="s923">That had a more moderate climate.</span> <span id="s924">Well, in this camp we could work outside, planting tomatoes, and work in the kitchen, and do all that sort of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">NL: Why did the encampment from Hay move to Tatura?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">HS: There were two camps in Hay, and somehow these camps got dissolved.</span> <span id="s927">Part of it went to a place called Orange which I wasn’t lucky enough to get to.</span> <span id="s928">I understand it was lovely.</span> <span id="s929">And we went to Tatura, where another two camps were established, and this was a better climate and much more moderate and nice.</span> <span id="s930">But, of course, you didn’t especially enjoy being interned, because you knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">NL: That is to say, you knew how the war was going?</span></p> <p><span id="s932">HS: We knew how the war was going; we had newspapers, the radio constantly; you had even mails from Europe through prisoner of war camps.</span> <span id="s933">My mother was in touch with the wife of another guy in my camp, in Frankfurt, and she told me later on that this poor woman was actually recruited for working service in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s934">Every morning she had to get up at 5:00 in the morning to do some kind of slave work in the factory an hour and a half away from Frankfurt, and that lady never got out anymore.</span> <span id="s935">Her name was Stern, too, by the way.</span> <span id="s936">So they exchanged information, whatever little there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">NL: How long did you stay in Tatura?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">HS: I was interned altogether twenty months, considering the time in England, the few weeks in England and the boat and being released.</span> <span id="s939">But I was out on a working party one time in Tatura and came back, and when the gate opened, that friend of mine who just came to visit us a month ago, came to me and said, “Harold, you have a telegram and I didn’t want you to open it.</span> <span id="s940">I took the liberty to open it in case it was bad news.</span> <span id="s941">But it is good news.</span> <span id="s942">Your mother has arrived in the States.”</span> <span id="s943">That was in September, 1940 just before December and Pearl Harbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">NL: 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s946">1941.</span> <span id="s947">So we knew what was going on in Europe, that all the Jews were rounded up, and about the gas chambers and all of that.</span> <span id="s948">My friend, who had his sister still there and his parents, got terribly schizophrenic, had a nervous breakdown, later on had to go to a sanitarium, and to this day he is still very much on the nervous side.</span> <span id="s949">Because of what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s950">So, if we, we in the internment camp in Australia, knew what was going on in Germany, nobody can tell me that nobody knew what was going on in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">NL: Of course in September ‘41 the massive deportations had not yet taken place.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">HS: Well, they had started, because my mother already had in Frankfurt packed her bag in readiness for a transport, they were told.</span> <span id="s953">[There were transports from Germany to Lodz and Riga at this time.]</span> <span id="s954">The only thing that saved her was an Allied air attack on Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s955">The result was that the people in Frankfurt had better things to do than rounding up Jews and deporting them.</span> <span id="s956">She was supposed to go to Gurs, [A concentration camp in France.]</span> <span id="s957">I understand, in the Pyrenees.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">NL: To Gurs?</span> <span id="s959">I see.</span> <span id="s960">I know they were sending German Jews to Riga and Lodz in 1941.</span> <span id="s961">I didn’t know about Gurs.</span> <span id="s962">So she was saved from that?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s964">Everything was just a coincidence.</span> <span id="s965">It’s all a miracle that we are here today.</span> <span id="s966">And then, well, came December, and the war broke out with Japan, and after a while the Australian authorities remembered, “Ah, there are other friendly enemy aliens sitting behind barbed wire?”</span> <span id="s967">Under Australian law, you could not join the army as a foreigner and become a citizen.</span> <span id="s968">Under Australian law, you could join a non-combatant unit in the army, but you did not become a citizen.</span> <span id="s969">You had to wait your five years, as an inhabitant of the British Empire, no matter where, until they granted you citizenship, be it in Australia or anywhere else.</span> <span id="s970">I said to myself, I’m not going to sit here vegetating for the rest of my life for the war, and I am certainly not going back to England.</span> <span id="s971">What I had forgotten to tell you was that, after we had been sent to Australia, there was a tremendous outcry in the British Parliament about the internment of aliens, and there was a tremendous debate.</span> <span id="s972">Subsequently everybody got released, was returned to their homes, to their jobs; the people were allowed to join the Pioneer Corps, and some of them even joined Paratroopers, and they sent a Major Layton to Australia as a high commissioner to set things right for the people who were sent there.</span> <span id="s973">He interviewed every single person.</span> <span id="s974">This is quite a story.</span> <span id="s975">This man was born in Germany, and at an early date had moved to England where he changed his name, had joined the army and subsequently became, was put in charge of the Kitchener Camp.</span> <span id="s976">And that was Colonel Julian Layton.</span> <span id="s977">He was a very nice man.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">NL: He knew a great deal about Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">HS: Yes, of course, he was born there.</span> <span id="s980">I can’t vouch for it, but they say his name was Loewenstein in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s981">He had left Germany quite early and had become a British citizen.</span> <span id="s982">He, of course, had a marvelous position there as an intermediary between these poor people and the British authorities.</span> <span id="s983">So, he was then a Major Layton, and later became a Colonel Layton, and came to Australia, and whatever people had lost, they only had to tell him what they had lost, whether it was a hundred pounds or a suitcase or whatever.</span> <span id="s984">It was put down and, if it could be verified and was not too much of an amount, that was all refunded as much as possible by the British.</span> <span id="s985">On top of that, people were allowed to go back to England and join the Pioneer Corps.</span> <span id="s986">That was the beginning.</span> <span id="s987">And others went to Palestine.</span> <span id="s988">There are some interesting things to tell.</span> <span id="s989">One of the transports that went back to England was sunk in the Indian Ocean and everybody drowned.</span> <span id="s990">I had a couple of friends on that boat, too.</span> <span id="s991">It’s very hard to forget these things because these people were, you know you lived with them on a daily basis.</span> <span id="s992">One lived in the bunk next to you, or the other one was a little bit crazy and brushed his teeth every two hours, and, suddenly, you know, they all drowned.</span> <span id="s993">One was a Communist from Czechoslovakia who pulled me out of the river when I had a nose bleed.</span> <span id="s994">These are the little things.</span> <span id="s995">But the guy who was in charge of this garrison, he got court-martialed England when he came back.</span> <span id="s996">The O’Neil fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">NL: On the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s999">He got court-martialed and he died in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">NL: And what were the German Jews going to Palestine to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">HS: They were Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">Tape three, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">NL: This is tape #3, side #2, of an interview with Mr. Harold Stern, September 10, 1981, Nora Levin interviewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">HS: They were Zionists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠♠HS: Oh, they were Zionists...Apparently there were several transports all the time, but after I had left the camp I joined the army, I was not aware of this anymore.</span> <span id="s1006">Where I was in the army, we were all in one group, it was called the 8th Employment Company and we were all the people from those camps.</span> <span id="s1007">The 7th Employment Company consisted of resident aliens in Melbourne and Sydney, comprising the few Jewish refugees who were living in Australia then, and Greeks and Italians and Yugoslavians, what have you.</span> <span id="s1008">So there was a mish-mash of people such as you have never seen.</span> <span id="s1009">There were people who didn’t even know how to use a toilet, farmers from Macedonia...</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">NL: What did you do in the army, Harold?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">HS: Well, we did mostly transport work which is like you would be in a munitions camp and get shipments ready for New Guinea.</span> <span id="s1012">And one very important aspect of Australia is the fact, at least at that time, today it is different, in colonial times each state had its own railroad, and why it happened nobody knows, I guess, but each state had a different gauge.</span> <span id="s1013">So Victoria has a different railroad gauge than New South Wales, and South Australia has a different gauge than New South Wales.</span> <span id="s1014">Then you come to the border, and on the border of New South Wales and Victoria is a little town called Albury, quite a little town.</span> <span id="s1015">This is the point where the trans-shipments take place.</span> <span id="s1016">You have a platform.</span> <span id="s1017">On one side is the platform with the Victorian gauge, on the other side is a platform of the New South Wales gauge, and what happens is that, across the platform, you load from one train into the other train by means of dollies or hand-to-hand or whatever you have.</span> <span id="s1018">And, of course, with the war effort, this was a very important operation.</span> <span id="s1019">So we did a lot of that.</span> <span id="s1020">We were stationed in Albury.</span> <span id="s1021">Then there is another place called Tocumwal which was a munitions depot.</span> <span id="s1022">Then, we did quite a bit of work in and around Melbourne, being attached to warehouses where the Americans were establishing their headquarters, and different people were attached to various phases of storage and trans-shipment.</span> <span id="s1023">I remember, I had a very nice job for a while in a big depot with tools.</span> <span id="s1024">At that time, America had brought over a tremendous amount of material, and what we had to do is fill orders for different areas that went to New Guinea.</span> <span id="s1025">We would dip these, for instance, a heavy shipment of metal files, we would wrap these files in oil-proof paper, seal it up, dip it in hot wax, let it cool and then put them altogether in boxes.</span> <span id="s1026">We sometimes had to cut down the boxes.</span> <span id="s1027">It was a very nice job.</span> <span id="s1028">Got it ready for shipment to New Guinea and Rabaul.</span> <span id="s1029">I was in the army for 4-1/2 years, and it’s the price you pay for safety, I suppose.</span> <span id="s1030">We had quite a nice time in Melbourne.</span> <span id="s1031">We were not in any danger.</span> <span id="s1032">The Jewish community took us very much to heart when we came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s1033">The synagogues gave teas and receptions.</span> <span id="s1034">The universities opened their doors.</span> <span id="s1035">The correspondence courses flourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">NL: About how many Jews do you think were there, in the whole country?</span> <span id="s1037">Thousands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">HS: In the whole country, of course, there was quite a population, in Sydney and Melbourne.</span> <span id="s1039">There were not many refugees in Australia, and I can tell you why.</span> <span id="s1040">It was very difficult to get to Australia because you needed a certain amount of money, similar to Palestine, to get there, and very few people made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">NL: There were also immigration restrictions, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">HS: Very much so, and it was made very difficult because in my time the popular idea was that babies are Australia’s best immigrants.</span> <span id="s1043">This has changed so much today, but it is a totally cosmopolitan population in the big cities.</span> <span id="s1044">People come from all over and are very happily received and welcome, and it’s no longer as insular as it used to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">NL: Were you released or you released yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">HS: Well, we could volunteer for the Australian Army for the Labor Corps, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1047">It was later called Employment Company and, of course, we had to be utilized so, just at that time you had to join the army, there was a big shortage of work personnel in Australia, because everybody was in the army and overseas, and people had disappeared in Borneo, Malaya, and it was a pretty terrible time with a lot of setbacks.</span> <span id="s1048">Many of them were in Egypt and Palestine, too, with the British forces, so the country was pretty hard up for manpower.</span> <span id="s1049">That time, fruit had to be harvested.</span> <span id="s1050">So before we got into the army, we had to pick fruit in different areas of Victoria.</span> <span id="s1051">First we picked peaches and then apples, and then we were then allowed to join the army, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">NL: And so you were in the army until after the war’s end?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">HS: Oh, way after, because the release was by points, and they were applied in not too generous a fashion for us.</span> <span id="s1054">Anyway, our Captain was a Captain Broughton and for historical reasons, I think, he deserves a mention.</span> <span id="s1055">He was a wonderful, wonderful person.</span> <span id="s1056">He was a Maori from new Zealand, a very devout Catholic, who was a member of the Australian forces, a career soldier.</span> <span id="s1057">Being a Maori, he was looked down upon a little bit by his peers.</span> <span id="s1058">This man developed a father image for us and knew everybody personally, made it his business to know everybody personally.</span> <span id="s1059">This was a group of about five hundred people, approximately, who joined this unit.</span> <span id="s1060">And he just was the nicest guy.</span> <span id="s1061">He supported everybody, whatever they did in education, and he was so revered, he could ask anything from anybody and people would do it.</span> <span id="s1062">He was much better than his junior officers, who sometimes thought they were a little bit better than he was because they were Anglo-Saxon.</span> <span id="s1063">But he had more education and more understanding and feeling than you could ever hope to get from somebody who is that far away from European events.</span> <span id="s1064">He had fought in the First World War.</span> <span id="s1065">In the Battle of the Argonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">NL: And he was your commanding officer until the very end, until you were mustered out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">HS: Captain Broughton, I think...No, not to the very end, but almost to the very end.</span> <span id="s1068">They replaced him with somebody else who wasn’t half as nice or understanding.</span> <span id="s1069">He was too nice to us, and so he was released and he died a few years after the war somewhere in the Outback, at some station in the middle of Australia somewhere.</span> <span id="s1070">But nobody will ever forget him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">NL: I am glad you told us his story so now we have it preserved.</span> <span id="s1072">And so when were you mustered out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">HS: Well, let me think.</span> <span id="s1074">By that time, of course, we lived a great deal of time also in Melbourne and it wasn’t so bad.</span> <span id="s1075">The people who didn’t want to live in camp itself lived outside of camp in boarding houses or somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1076">We really lived a life which bordered on being a border-line soldier or border-line civilian, whichever way you want to take it.</span> <span id="s1077">The main thing is that we turned out for roll call and did our work during the day, and after that we were free to do what we wanted.</span> <span id="s1078">Once in a while we had to stay overnight in camp to be on guard or something like that, to keep up a military appearance, but the work was the more important part of it.</span> <span id="s1079">So in 1946 or ‘47, I was discharged, and I had a job waiting for me in Melbourne in a shoe store with friends of mine, who had a shoe store in the northern suburbs, and, in the meantime, I had applied for a landing permit for my mother to come in, and had received that.</span> <span id="s1080">My mother however, was not too willing to leave America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">NL: Where was she living in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">HS: She lived in New York, and she was working in a factory, and, had I known then the conditions under which she was working and existing, I would have insisted on her coming to Australia.</span> <span id="s1083">As it was, people told her, “Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1084">You are here in New York and you want to go to Australia?</span> <span id="s1085">Your son is a young man; let him come to America.”</span> <span id="s1086">By that time I had British citizenship, I was an Australian citizen.</span> <span id="s1087">I had spent my formative years in Australia, England, and I was very much in favor of...maybe not happy, but I knew nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">NL: You were comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">HS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1090">I was a little bit bored in Australia because there really wasn’t very much going on.</span> <span id="s1091">It was a little bit like the South here.</span> <span id="s1092">Very provincial, very waspish, very segregated.</span> <span id="s1093">You had either the country club or you had very poor people, and highly educated people or highly under-educated people.</span> <span id="s1094">Another thing was that the bulk of the educated...[tape jumps].</span> <span id="s1095">Because my mother felt she didn’t want to come to Australia, I felt this may be a good opportunity to come to this country, because on the German quota, I could then be a blood relative of my mother who had by that time become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s1096">I was able to travel right away and I came here and stayed here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">NL: You came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">NL: And you say you came on the German quota?</span> <span id="s1100">Or was there a DP quota?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">HS: No, no.</span> <span id="s1102">I was not a DP in that sense.</span> <span id="s1103">I was under German quota, number one, which was not being used right after the war.</span> <span id="s1104">It was in 1947, and then I was allowed relocation so, either way, I had it made, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1105">I flew to California and landed in Oakland, and my mother met me there and after a week or two, she went back to New York and I stayed in San Francisco for a while and then I went to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">NL: And you lived together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">HS: Not really.</span> <span id="s1108">She lived in a rooming house hotel on 79th Street near Riverside Drive and I didn’t stay there very long.</span> <span id="s1109">After I got myself a job I moved to another place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">NL: But you were in the same city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">HS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">NL: And then you eventually made your way to Philadelphia or did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">HS: I lived in New York for twelve years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">NL: What sort of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">HS: Well, you know how it is when you start out.</span> <span id="s1116">You are a perfect greenhorn.</span> <span id="s1117">Everything you do is wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">NL: You had to start from the beginning again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">HS: Yes.</span> <span id="s1120">It was very annoying because when I left Australia, I was at least a manager of a shoe store, and I knew my way around and I had good prospects.</span> <span id="s1121">What is more, I could have gone to college there under the G.I. Bill of Australia, as an ex-soldier, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1122">But here I was in New York, and I had to make a living, and see that my mother was somehow taken care of.</span> <span id="s1123">So, it was not a matter of pursuing my education.</span> <span id="s1124">I really hated it.</span> <span id="s1125">My relatives who, by that time, had been establishing themselves, were of no great help, because they were in fields where I didn’t fit in, and they would use their connections to ask people to employ my nephew or, “Can you employ my cousin?”</span> <span id="s1126">but really when you had arrived a little bit somewhere I found this very degrading.</span> <span id="s1127">I started out in my first job in a shoe factory, and you were working for these people who were also refugees but had gotten somewhere in the meantime, and they pitied you for being a new arrival, and somehow, something gets into the blood of refugees or new arrivals.</span> <span id="s1128">They think everybody, somehow they think that if you arrive, you have to go through the same thing and the same hardships that they themselves had.</span> <span id="s1129">They won’t give you a lift up at the middle of the ladder; it has to be at bottom of the ladder.</span> <span id="s1130">Their attitude is: we all went through it, you will make it if you are half-way clever or smart, and you will do as we did.</span> <span id="s1131">So you get no...big deal out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">NL: So it took a number of years to make an adjustment?</span> <span id="s1133">Thank you very much, Mr. Stern.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">HS: It was a real pleasure telling you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">NL: What a valuable and precious account.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">HS: Please call on me if you need any further details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">NL: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
