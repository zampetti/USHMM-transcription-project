Once, my mother was visiting him on the front, and he wanted to have a free day, and it was just a Jewish holiday, and the Rabbi asked my father whether he does it for religious purpose, or he just wants to have a free day, and my father told him sincerely that he wanted to have a free day so he didn’t permit him.</span> <span id="s54">And, from that time, my father was not religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">EB: He really turned him off.</span> <span id="s56">But your mother continued to observe...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">EK: Yah, my mother was very religious and she kept up all the holidays and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">EB: Did you have a religious education, you and your brothers and sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">EK: Of course we had Bar Mitzvahs, all three, and...but we were very, very liberal.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">EB: I see.</span> <span id="s61">When you went to school, did you go to a regular public school, or did you go to a Chader?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">EK: To a regular public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">EB: A regular public school.</span> <span id="s64">What was your first perception that there might be trouble coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">EK: We followed the political situation for years, and, as I told already, we knew what was happening in Europe, and we were afraid of it, and we tried to fight it, and, so we were supporting all the democratic actions.</span> <span id="s66">We were supporting the refugees.</span> <span id="s67">We were doing all what we could, and we believed that what is coming in Germany cannot happen in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s68">You see, we were an independent state.</span> <span id="s69">But, everybody was...all the top politicians, including Daladier, and all these people - they didn’t know what Hitler was.</span> <span id="s70">It was a tragedy.</span> <span id="s71">Everybody hoped that he can stop him any time he wants.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">EB: O.K. Now, what was the first thing that happened to change your life dramatically?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">EK: Well, first, it was the occupation of the part of Czechoslovakia on the border.</span> <span id="s74">As I told you, we had a farm in the Sudetenland and by the time my father was dead, my mother was on the farm alone, and, when it happened, there was some unrest in the place where we had the farm, and I heard about it in the radio, so I took the train and went to see her.</span> <span id="s75">In the meanwhile, there was upheaval and she escaped from the place where it happened...they injured the police there, and they made lot of things.</span> <span id="s76">So, I went in the middle of the upheaval and they imprisoned me in the school, and they threatened me they will send me to Germany, but after about seven or eight hours being in prison, the Czech army came and liberated us.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">EB: Were you imprisoned by people you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">EK: Sure, that was the German part of Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">EB: I see.</span> <span id="s80">Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">EK: The so-called Hemlein party.</span> <span id="s82">And, one day later, the Czechoslovakian Republic mobilized against Germany, and, then there was all the action that the...dealing with Hitler as Czechoslovakia guarantee by France, England and Russia, but it was a Munich dictate.</span> <span id="s83">The Czechoslovakia stayed completely alone.</span> <span id="s84">They dictate they should give up the territories where the Germans are living.</span> <span id="s85">So, then, there was evacuation of the whole territory, including our farm, and including everything what we had there.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">EB: And, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">EK: I was, by that time, working for a bank in Prague, so I was...my mother came and I was supporting her, and, in the meanwhile, my brother, who was a lawyer in Pilsen, he, also, was supporting her, so...we lost everything practically, before the whole country was occupied.</span> <span id="s88">Then, I was called to military service on the 1st of March, 1938...1939.</span> <span id="s89">In 1939, and on the 15th of March, hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s90">And, we were in Slovakia, and there was upheaval against the Czechs as there was again...it was the policy of the German “dividad imperi.”</span> <span id="s91">It means “divide and rule,” and the Slovaks were first against the Czechs and against the Jews, of course, and against their own...their own non-Catholic part of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s92">But, later, when the Germany army came to Slovakia, they found out that they make a mistake.</span> <span id="s93">it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">EB: And, at that time, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">EK: I was in Slovakia, and we were imprisoned in the barracks, waiting to go back to Czech...to Bohemia.</span> <span id="s96">So, then, we were sent back to Bohemia.</span> <span id="s97">I came back to the bank, but they said, “Due to the changed political condition, we cannot employ you anymore, if I was a Jew.”</span></p> <p><span id="s98">EB: I see.</span> <span id="s99">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">EK: And, therefore, I was unemployed.</span> <span id="s101">But, I knew languages.</span> <span id="s102">I was trying to give some lessons...English lessons and Russian lessons...whatever I could get, but it wasn’t enough, so I started to help as a Jewish counsel.</span> <span id="s103">First of all [ ... ] and then they paid me something.</span> <span id="s104">And, I stayed there till I was sent to the transports.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">EB: And, where was your mother all this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">EK: My mother was, all the time, in Prague with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">EB: I see.</span> <span id="s108">And, then, when you were sent...how long was that, before you were sent to the transports?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">EK: It was...it took three years.</span> <span id="s110">During the three years, my younger brother, who was a farmer, he was working as farm worker, with some farmer who completely exploited him.</span> <span id="s111">He didn’t have enough to eat and when he came home, he was eating too much, and he developed some digestion disease, and we couldn’t see our other brother who was in Pilsen.</span> <span id="s112">It was not allowed to travel from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">EB: And your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">EK: My sister was in Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">EB: With you?</span> <span id="s116">With your...</span></p> <p><span id="s117">EK: No, no...She was married.</span> <span id="s118">She was married and she has a girl, and her husband.</span> <span id="s119">He was also fired as he was a Jew.</span> <span id="s120">So, he tried to make some living selling different stuff, and, we were living together in an apartment.</span> <span id="s121">And then, by that time I am...was dating a girl whom our parents knew each other, and, in this bad time, you had nothing to do, so we fell in love and we married.</span> <span id="s122">And, it was in 1941 we got married, and we couldn’t live together.</span> <span id="s123">It was not allowed.</span> <span id="s124">She was living with her parents, and I was living with my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">EB: You mean, this was the law?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">EK: It was the law.</span> <span id="s127">You couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s128">Besides, it was not enough space there.</span> <span id="s129">We were living three families in three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s130">Every family had one little room.</span> <span id="s131">So, and...and they were living with two other families, also in three bedrooms.</span> <span id="s132">So we just me occasionally, and, after 8 o’clock you had to be at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">EB: A curfew.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">EK: Curfew, yes.</span> <span id="s135">So, we had a hard time to get together.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">EB: Yes, I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">EK: And, when it happened that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, we learned about it, and my father-in-law, who also was a bank manager, he said, “Now it is not long any more that the war will be over.”</span> <span id="s138">But he was wrong.</span> <span id="s139">The same day, some friend of his came to visit him, and, when he went back, the housekeeper saw him, and the housekeeper was a confidante of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s140">He was so excited about it that he took the steps fast, the staircase fast, and he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">EB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">EK: Yah, he got a stroke.</span> <span id="s143">On the same day what Pearl Harbor was, my father-in-law died.</span> <span id="s144">By the time it was that some of the friends came and told us that we should not give up everything to the Germans, and that we should give it to them, and they will keep it for us when the time will be right again.</span> <span id="s145">So, we gave them everything we could and after they got what they wanted, you never saw them again.</span> <span id="s146">And, but not everyone...some of the friends were really good friends.</span> <span id="s147">They brought us, once in a while, something what was not available for us as we were not allowed to have some fruit or vegetables and we were not allowed a lot of things to have.</span> <span id="s148">And, we had to give up everything, starting from the radios and the skis and warm clothes, and I cannot remember everything.</span> <span id="s149">We had always something to give up and were were not allowed to go to the parks and we were not allowed to travel any place.</span> <span id="s150">We were allowed to travel in the street car only in the last car.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">EB: Did you have to wear insignia?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">EK: Yah, we had to wear the David star, and we are not allowed to to to some stores.</span> <span id="s153">Only some stores were available.</span> <span id="s154">The food stamps were a lot less than was a regular person had a everybody got in his personal identification card a J, and everybody...every man was israel and every woman was a Sarah as a second...middle name, and so it was very difficult to go any place and when the anti-Semites wanted, they could report you.</span> <span id="s155">And, you couldn’t defend.</span> <span id="s156">You were sent to the Gestapo right away, and sometimes you never came back.</span> <span id="s157">And, I was working for the Jewish organization and it was pretty tough to communicate it.</span> <span id="s158">The Germans and even some of the Czech police were very nasty.</span> <span id="s159">We got... in ‘41 we got a message that the...all Jewish people from Pilsen will be evacuated, and, of course, my brother, my older brother, who was going to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s160">He was a very bright person.</span> <span id="s161">He knew...He was a musician and he was mentally very good, but physically, he was not too strong.</span> <span id="s162">So, we were worried about him.</span> <span id="s163">But, he was again working there, in the Juden Altesta.</span> <span id="s164">Then it happened, that there was a [...].</span> <span id="s165">That was the guy, the super S.S. who tried to kill everybody who was not a Nazi, and when it happened, it was a hunt about everybody.</span> <span id="s166">They came in every apartment.</span> <span id="s167">They were checking on you.</span> <span id="s168">Everybody who should be in place was there, whether there was nobody hiding who didn’t belong there, whether there was no weapons and they were looking for people and, luckily, once in a while I went to sleep with my wife in the apartment were she was living.</span> <span id="s169">Just that day, I was not there.</span> <span id="s170">Otherwise, I would not be here.</span> <span id="s171">And, so, then they sent for punishment a lot of Jewish transports directly to Poland.</span> <span id="s172">Normally the transports went through Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s173">That was a medieval town, like fortress, surrounded by the police, Czech police and by the S.S., so that nobody escapes.</span> <span id="s174">And, from that was just a first collect...camp where they collected...</span></p> <p><span id="s175">EB: A collection point.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">EK: A collection...for collection them for transporting them further to Poland.</span> <span id="s177">So, we stayed till Xmas, ‘42, and then we had to go all at once.</span> <span id="s178">And we were allowed to take 50 kilos of stuff with us.</span> <span id="s179">But, before...before...when we were concentrated in the camp, it was a fairground.</span> <span id="s180">We were concentrated there.</span> <span id="s181">When it happened, I was called to the S.S. to [...] that was the head of the Eichmann group.</span> <span id="s182">And, they investigated me and investigated me.</span> <span id="s183">I was standing there from the morning till the evening.</span> <span id="s184">They want...as I made some translation for the Czech group.</span> <span id="s185">I was making translations for the Czech group.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">EK: They must have found something that I did it, so they investigated me, who was sitting at the desk.</span> <span id="s188">Maybe they found there something and I was so confused that I said I was there sitting a year ago, and that helped me as...probably the paper what they found...it was a year later.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">EK: Well, they returned me to the transport.</span> <span id="s191">We went to Theresienstadt.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">EB: Now, you talk about we.</span> <span id="s193">Who was there with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">EK: With me was my wife, my mother, my brother, my mother-in-law, and that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">EB: I see.</span> <span id="s196">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">EK: Five people.</span></p> <p><span

id="s201">EK: We didn’t know it, just when we came to Theresienstadt we found out.</span> <span id="s202">And, my brother helped me to get a job in so-called Kleinefestung, it was called.</span> <span id="s203">The translation is small fortress.</span> <span id="s204">That was the S.S. prison, where the political prisoners were punished very badly, and I was working there in the garden as a farm worker.</span> <span id="s205">This group was protected against being sent back to Poland.</span> <span id="s206">But they were beating us so badly, but I felt that I have so survive it in order to save my family from being killed...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">EB: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">EK: So, I was working there 13 months and after 13 months, they transferred to me to...when my son was born, they transferred me to the kitchen, and I was working in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s209">There, around September ‘43, everybody was...September ‘44, was it ‘44, when everybody was sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">EB: To Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">EK: To Birkenau, actually.</span> <span id="s212">They said to us that we are going to build a new camp, where we can live together with our families.</span> <span id="s213">That was how they tricked you by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s214">They were very tricky and very sneaky, and that our wives will come after us.</span> <span id="s215">It was in ‘44, we knew what was happening in Europe, so it was just run for...for the time...and so, I went to Auschwitz, to Birkenau, alone.</span> <span id="s216">The transport of 1500 persons in a cattle wagon.</span> <span id="s217">We took some stuff with us.</span> <span id="s218">And we didn’t know that we were going there.</span> <span id="s219">We didn’t know anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">EB: Where you were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s222">Right after we passed the river Elbe, so we saw that we are moving to the right, to the East, instead of the the left, we knew that we are going to Poland.</span> <span id="s223">After two days of traveling, we arrived in the morning in a place which...where we would smell the chloroform and [ ...] and there were some people with striped pajamas running around and calling to us.</span> <span id="s224">“You are gesunt...you are gesunt.”</span> <span id="s225">You are rescued.</span> <span id="s226">We didn’t know what it means.</span> <span id="s227">They chased us out of the wagon, and said, “Leave everything in the wagon.</span> <span id="s228">It will be sent to you later.”</span> <span id="s229">But, we had such a small what do you call it...baggage.”</span></p> <p><span id="s230">EB: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">EK: But they cut it off, and they said, “You are not allowed to take it.”</span> <span id="s232">We were waiting in lines and lines until we came to a place where on the top was staying a man, S.S. officer, and we had to take off our hat and say either, “gesunt” or “krank.”</span> <span id="s233">Of course I was healthy, so I said, “Gesunt.”</span> <span id="s234">And, they sent me to the left and that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s235">EB: That was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">EK: That was good.</span> <span id="s237">Otherwise, I would be sent to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">EK: From the 1500, 965 went directly to the gas.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">EB: Did you know about it at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">EK: No.</span> <span id="s242">We didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s243">Even when we...later....heard that there are gas chambers, we couldn’t believe that people can be so inhuman that they would be worse than beasts, that they would kill each other because the beasts kill just to satisfy their hunger.</span> <span id="s244">So, we went....and then we waited and waited and waited until it was night and they chased us again on a place, where we had to give up all money, so we shouldn’t have any money left, but, they were looking for money.</span> <span id="s245">We had golden jewelry, but we allowed just to have a ring when you are married.</span> <span id="s246">Give up the ring and, strange thing, all canned food, we had to give up.</span> <span id="s247">And then, we are waiting again and we had to state everything, and you could just keep your glasses, your belt and your shoes.</span> <span id="s248">And, we went in front of...it was already cold...it was September night...and, in Poland, it was cold.</span> <span id="s249">So, we were going and the S.S. were looking after us, and, I hide a photograph of my family in the left shoe, under the...</span></p> <p><span id="s250">EB: Under the sole.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">EK: Under the sole.</span> <span id="s252">He must have immediately recognized it, as he came to me, took the left sole...took out the photograph, destroyed it, and then he beat me so badly that he destroyed my glasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">EB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">EK: But, it was my good luck.</span> <span id="s255">So, selection continued.</span> <span id="s256">They were looking after the people who wore glasses.</span> <span id="s257">They went...they came back to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s258">Saved...</span></p> <p><span id="s259">EB: One more time.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">EK: One more time.</span> <span id="s261">I was...It was a miracle.</span> <span id="s262">So we went to...they were checking first your mouth, whether you don’t hide anything there...your back, and you were lucky when they first looked at your back, otherwise you get the finger from the mouth.</span> <span id="s263">So, then they shaved us with dull razors, and we were full of blood and then they chased us under the hot showers - it was very hot - they burned our skin and it was...and they put some disinfectant on us and it was burning terrible.</span> <span id="s264">Then, we went to a guy who was throwing us pieces of...pieces of suit, like...like

people.</span> <span id="s357">The rest must be brought dead.</span> <span id="s358">We didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s359">But we found out later.</span> <span id="s360">So, that was...and we were working hard and after we came to the quarry on the fifth of December...fifth of October, ‘44, and by the end of November, I was already worn out so badly and...the people...twice a week they

Czech dentist.</span> <span id="s418">He was a prisoner, Jewish.</span> <span id="s419">Avery nice man.</span> <span id="s420">He always tried to help us.</span> <span id="s421">And, when it was about...I think...the 18th of January, he said, “Boy, I cannot save you any more.”</span> <span id="s422">He said.</span> <span id="s423">On the 19th, they tried everything on me.</span> <span id="s424">They don’t need me any more.</span> <span id="s425">You know what it means.</span> <span id="s426">You will be sent to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s427">What can I do?</span> <span

over by this time.</span> <span id="s438">But, I knew that the war will be over.</span> <span id="s439">It was just a matter of time to survive the time.</span> <span id="s440">And then I found...Yah, we woke up on the 19th and everything was crazy.</span> <span id="s441">And they told the camp what we heard.</span> <span id="s442">Everybody has to get up and go by feet.</span> <span id="s443">I couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s444">But they chased us out.</span> <span id="s445">It was a lot of snow and frost and by the time I was in the Krankenbahn, I loaned my great...so-called greatcoat to another friend...so-called friend.</span> <span id="s446">Now, when I came back, I told him I will now need the coat and he lost his somewhere.</span> <span id="s447">And, he didn’t want to give it to

underwear, nothing.</span> <span id="s452">Now there were a lot of stuff - underwear everywhere, and there was a lot of chaos and everybody was running around.</span> <span id="s453">There was a lot of food all over and they chased us and we were so-called commando krankenbahn.</span> <span id="s454">When we were standing already in the lines, the kapo said to us, “Who doesn’t want...who doesn’t think he will survive, step out, otherwise he will be shot during the march.”</span> <span id="s455">I thought it is no sense to march any more so I stepped out, and there was a kapo.</span> <span

it.</span> <span id="s460">The people went and we stayed there - about 110 people, I don’t know how many exactly, and they left 6 S.S. with us, which should have executed us when it was dark.</span> <span id="s461">It was in the Polish...The Polish were all over.</span> <span id="s462">The partisans weren’t.</span> <span id="s463">That they shoot us and it was like we should have been executed at dark, but when the dark came, the airplane came and they were bombarding us terrible and the S.S., they were afraid.</span> <span id="s464">They went to the bunker.</span> <span id="s465">They...they...they locked us in the camp and they went to the bunker.</span> <span id="s466">And, so we survived the night there.</span> <span id="s467">And, they should shoot us in the morning.</span> <span id="s468">But they slept, so we were still alive and the next day, the same repeated exactly.</span> <span id="s469">When it was getting dark, the airplanes came, starting bombarding the Austria...was not far from the place where we were.</span> <span id="s470">They went again in the bunker, and the next morning, there was a train coming by and there was a cattle wagon, empty.</span> <span id="s471">So they loaded us in the cattle wagon, I don’t know...one hundred and five people...and transported us ten days and nine nights without food, without beverage, without anything.</span> <span id="s472">In the cold winters of ‘45.</span> <span id="s473">And the people started dying.</span> <span id="s474">Some of the people.</span> <span id="s475">There is a sad story.</span> <span id="s476">The survival was so strong that they started killing each other.</span> <span id="s477">Eating the flesh ( Editor’s Note: We have no means of verifying this data.)</span>

us.</span> <span id="s490">Till we came to Brienyeneset - it was also in Sudetenland, in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s491">It is Czechoslovakia again, and there was this guy who saved our lives.</span> <span id="s492">He was a German Polish director of a factory which was producing some kind of war material, and he took us.</span> <span id="s493">And, he was unloading the dead bodies, he found us, too.</span> <span id="s494">And, he was very nice to us.</span> <span id="s495">He saved 1500 Jewish prisoners from Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">EB: Hum.</span></p> <p><span

id="s505">EB: And, so, now you were back in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">EK: I was back on...we were in Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s507">it was still a part of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">EB: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">EK: And we were there, and the S.S. were there, of course, and we were allowed to recuperate a little before we could work, as we were unable to work.</span> <span id="s510">So, on April, finally they found out that I am a farm worker.</span> <span id="s511">They had a garden there, so they let me work in the garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">EB: Oh, what a feeling that must have been!</span></p> <p><span id="s513">EK: Yah, but I was so...you know, when I went to the camp I had 150 lbs.</span> <span id="s514">When I came back I had only 70.</span> <span id="s515">I was just bones and skin.</span> <span id="s516">So, it was...I was not strong enough, so I was doing what I could do and we had S.S. there.</span> <span id="s517">Some of them were very nasty.</span> <span id="s518">And, when the front came close to Brumel.</span> <span id="s519">It was close to Brumel.</span> <span id="s520">This is the capital of Moria - a part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s521">We heard that Himmler sent so-called gas train.</span> <span id="s522">We should have been loaded on the gas train.</span> <span id="s523">They should have gassed us, and somehow destroyed our bones and the ashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">EK: We saw the train standing there for about two days.</span> <span id="s526">Shindler sent the train back, and he sent also the bad S.S. to fight on the front.</span> <span id="s527">He sent them to the West.</span> <span id="s528">Oh, the S.S. were afraid of the Russians, and, so, only the old so-called S.S. were there, and they were more human.</span> <span id="s529">Some of them even gave us a piece of bread once in a while.</span> <span id="s530">So, and...on the 8th of May, Herr Shindler invited all the people in the factory...all...and told us that it was...that Germany signed the unconditional surrender, that we shouldn’t be afraid, he would not leave us until we are again in good shape and he saved some materials for us and that we will...and that he gave us the material so we can have new clothes, and new underwear and that we are fitted before we go home that we are again in good shape.</span> <span id="s531">It was the 8th of May.</span> <span id="s532">And, so, we went to our barracks again.</span> <span id="s533">We were locked up.</span> <span id="s534">The next morning we woke up.</span> <span id="s535">No S.S. were there.</span> <span id="s536">Just the Jewish kapos were there and they told us we should stay where we are as the German army is coming back.</span> <span id="s537">We should stay in the lager with the...with the [...].</span> <span id="s538">Not to move.</span> <span id="s539">He even gave to the kapos weapons and told them to shoot when somebody would try to get in.</span> <span id="s540">So it happened.</span> <span id="s541">The army came close.</span> <span id="s542">Some groups came close to the camp and they shoot on them just in the air, but I admired what organization the Nazis had.</span> <span id="s543">They knew that there was some armed people when they were going by the camp, they came around the camp.</span> <span id="s544">So, we survived there.</span> <span id="s545">Two days, nobody came.</span> <span id="s546">We...and after two...three days there came the Russian and one of the Czech army and they told us that we are free, but we are not supposed to go any place.</span> <span id="s547">It is not safe, and after that, another group came and one of our...of our three...he was from Austria...he had a friend there who was an officer there...and he said, “We going back to Prague, so when you will...and we will sneak you out of the camp and you can go home.”</span> <span id="s548">So, on the 14th of May, we went with the Czech soldiers back to Prague.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">EB: My!</span></p> <p><span id="s550">EK: And we arrived

id="s562">I didn’t know that she survived.</span> <span id="s563">That she was in Thereisenstadt all the time, and she was all ready at this time to be transported, but my other brother asked he was sending the last transport and my mother wanted to go with him, but they refused to let her go with him.</span> <span id="s564">And, when he came there, he was sick.</span> <span id="s565">He had a hernia, and he was underweight and everything.</span> <span id="s566">So he brought himself sick and he went to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s567">The same happened with my wife.</span> <span id="s568">She came there with a 13 month old boy and they told her, “Get rid of the child.”</span> <span id="s569">She was strong.</span> <span id="s570">She didn’t.</span> <span id="s571">They took the child.</span> <span id="s572">They burned her alive, as they didn’t have enough cyclone.</span> <span id="s573">She went to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">EB: Your wife?</span> <span id="s575">I see, you were married before.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">EK: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">EB: And, your child was gone too.</span> <span id="s578">So you lost them both.</span> <span id="s579">Did you know that right away then?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">EK: I didn’t know until we came to Brementz.</span> <span id="s581">As one of the friends who was working with me in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s582">He arrived in the later transport, and he told me that...what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">EB: And so now, your mother was the only survivor, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">EK: My mother was the only survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">EB: Beside you.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">EK: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">EB: And you met again in Prague?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">EK: With my wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">EB: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s591">It was not so simple.</span> <span id="s592">As I was in Prague and I was looking after somebody, I was sure that my brother was strong, that he would survive.</span> <span id="s593">Then I found somebody whom I knew.</span> <span id="s594">He told me how it happened.</span> <span id="s595">He was very strong and it was two days before and they heard already the American army coming to liberate the camp.</span> <span id="s596">There was a small S.S. man, and he was yelling, and my brother just told to himself, “You will not yell long here anymore.”</span> <span id="s597">And, he understood Czech.</span> <span id="s598">“What did you say?”</span> <span id="s599">And he wanted to beat him.</span> <span id="s600">My brother just turned around and he fell on the ground and he started yelling and they shoot him.</span> <span id="s601">They shoot him and they trampled him to death.</span> <span id="s602">It was my younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">EB: So, there was nobody but your mother and you?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s605">But I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s606">I was expecting somebody was coming beside...We were a family of...with my relative like cousins and uncles, aunts...we were 56 people and only my mother survived and my cousin who was here in the United States.</span> <span id="s607">All others were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">EB: Everybody else was gone.</span> <span id="s609">How long, then, did you stay in Prague before you...</span></p> <p><span id="s610">EK: I stayed in Prague.</span> <span id="s611">Then, one day, it was just my birthday.</span> <span id="s612">I went for free soup to a place, and there I met the wife of my former boss, who was...when I was working for the Jewish community...and I had the bad task to tell her that her husband was executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">EK: Before we transported.</span> <span id="s615">And she told me, “So, when will you bring your mother home?”</span> <span id="s616">I said, “My mother?”</span> <span id="s617">She said, “You don’t know she is still in Theresienstadt?”</span> <span id="s618">So, the same day I wrote to her, I found out she was a nurse for my younger brother’s girlfriend.</span> <span id="s619">The girlfriend was the only one who survived in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s620">She was supported my mother.</span> <span id="s621">So she kept her there when she got the typhoid.</span> <span id="s622">Before when she got the typhoid.</span> <span id="s623">So she was nursing her there and I have to wait until the quarantine was over.</span> <span id="s624">So she came to...in the end of May, she came to Prague and we stayed there about a few more days, and we went back to our farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">EB: Oh, and what did you find at the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">EK: Everything was in bad shape.</span> <span id="s627">Stolen everything.</span> <span id="s628">Everything destroyed.</span> <span id="s629">You couldn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s630">All the tools and tractors and everything what we had was gone.</span> <span id="s631">So we had to start from scratch, and we had German laborers there.</span> <span id="s632">Some of them Nazis.</span> <span id="s633">But they had to work, and we were slowly fixing everything.</span> <span id="s634">There was enough food and, in a short time, I had back my 150 lbs.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">EB: I’ll bet.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s637">And then the Russian soldiers came there, and they were very nice to us at first.</span> <span id="s638">And then they were not so nice any more and they started to...to...to do bad things so we...even the Russians on the Russian side was complaining, so I went complaining to the officer and told him what was happening.</span> <span id="s639">And he said, “I will come this evening to see you.”</span> <span id="s640">Captain Lazar.</span> <span id="s641">He was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">EB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">EK: And he didn’t want that they knew that he is.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">EB: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">EK: So, he told us that he will arrange everything that we...that we aren’t bothered any more.</span> <span id="s646">Before we had a big [...] there and we had some soldiers there.</span> <span id="s647">They made orgies on the fourth floor...on the second floor...with the German girls.</span> <span id="s648">They were drinking and making noise and threatening us.</span> <span id="s649">We couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s650">After he moved in and we had a nice time.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">EB: Um, hum.</span> <span id="s652">And what brought you to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">EK: It was a long story again...</span></p> <p><span id="s654">EB: Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s655">Uh, huh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">EK: We stayed on the farm and we hoped that we will be able to...but then the Germans were evacuated and we couldn’t get any laborers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">EK: And I was not able to work.</span> <span id="s659">I was still...it was not my job.</span> <span id="s660">I was not at this time to take to the farm.</span> <span id="s661">So, we moved to Prague and we rented the farm to a person.</span> <span id="s662">Shortly after we moved, it was...we left in ‘47, and in ‘48 the Communists took over everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">EB: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">EK: So, we did just the right thing in the right time.</span> <span id="s665">So, ...</span></p> <p><span id="s666">EB: You know, is there a word, they call it “Beshert?”</span> <span id="s667">You were from the beginning.</span> <span id="s668">It was meant to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s670">Always, I don’t know whether it was God, or whoever...</span></p> <p><span id="s671">EB: Of course it was.</span> <span id="s672">Of course it was.</span> <span id="s673">And so, how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">EK: ‘Till March ‘47, and I went back to the bank where...</span></p> <p><span id="s675">EB: Oh, my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">EK ...where I worked.</span> <span id="s677">The bank changed, by that time, three times the name, but it was always the same bank, and my Jewish colleague and I..</span> <span id="s678">.</span> <span id="s679">just a few left...from about 200 or 300 Jewish employees...there were only a couple of them...I don’t know...then...</span></p> <p><span id="s680">EB: Uh, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">EK: And I started working there.</span> <span id="s682">One day I had to dictate some letters and then I saw [...] who had numbers also, and I started to dictate to her, and she was not too happy about it, and then I [...] departments.</span> <span id="s683">And I gave her just to type this and one day I talked to her and she said she has a small cottage close to Prague.</span> <span id="s684">I asked her what she is doing there.</span> <span id="s685">And she said she has it rented, and that she goes there over the weekend.</span> <span id="s686">I said that I would like to go there, too, so we had a date.</span> <span id="s687">And, it was just the way when the time changed that I overslept and I didn’t exactly know where she was, and I took the bus anyhow.</span> <span id="s688">And, I was talking with a guy in the bus and he saw my numbers and we started talking, and I said, “I am going to see a girl from the bank, and I exactly don’t know where she is.”</span> <span id="s689">And he said, “We will try out.”</span> <span id="s690">And, finally, I couldn’t find out the name, but then, “Isn’t it a Jewess...the little Jewess who came back?”</span> <span id="s691">I said, “Yes.”</span> <span id="s692">So I found her.</span> <span id="s693">She was so surprised that I found her.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">EB: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">EK: So, we had a nice time, and went for dinner to a nice restaurant there, and then we started dating.</span> <span id="s696">And, in three months, we god married.</span> <span id="s697">She had nobody.</span> <span id="s698">Just an uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">EB: So, you found each other.</span> <span id="s700">And, you stayed there then?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">EK: We were looking for an apartment.</span> <span id="s702">It was...</span></p> <p><span id="s703">EB: Where was your mother now?</span></p> <p><span

her.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">EB: Uh, huh.</span> <span id="s707">So you were free to go and marry and...</span></p> <p><span id="s708">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s709">And we had hard time to find....I had to live...I finally managed somehow that we got an apartment...terrible apartment.</span> <span id="s710">After...but, we didn’t get it until our son was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">EB: So, you did get your son after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s713">Then we had three children and when the Communists came we wanted to go to the West as we didn’t like the idea to live in a totalitarian state.</span> <span id="s714">But, it was not possible.</span> <span id="s715">It was too dangerous.</span> <span id="s716">It took us twenty years before we could come here.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">EB: So, you came around 1968?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">EK 1969.</span> <span id="s719">We defected in ‘68.</span></p> <p><span

then?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">EK: We came...our cousin, who was living in Lima, Ohio, he sponsored us.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">EB: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">EK: And, originally, we should come to Lima, but then we decided, especially since I am international banker, there was no international bank, and our two daughters...there was not a university in the place that should take a bigger city.</span> <span id="s727">So the HIAS found for us Toledo...Toledo, Ohio, and the people there were lovely.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">EB: So, this is where you spent time, and are you retired now and living here?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">EK: Yah.</span> <span id="s730">I am retired.</span> <span id="s731">I retired in ‘82 and I was waiting for my wife to retired.</span> <span id="s732">But now we are living here.</span> <span id="s733">We sold our house in Toledo.</span> <span id="s734">We are living here.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">EB: Thank you so
