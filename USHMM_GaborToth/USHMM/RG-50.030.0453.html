id="s89">I mean, cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: And in ma – in me – in Michalovce, what did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: My father was a broker with cattles.</span> <span id="s92">And he usually bought – he had people who are buying for him cattles and – how you call the small sheeps?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Lambs.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Lambs, lambs.</span> <span id="s95">And they were slaughtering there Michalovce – near Michalovce, and sending every week to Prague, to the capitol of Czechoslovakia, and he used to actually to travel almost every week to Prague where he was – he has his stall there, and he was selling there in Prague.</span> <span id="s96">So he wa – he had his apartment in Prague because many times he was staying there four or five days.</span> <span id="s97">And he had a yearly ticket to Prague by train because he was so often there.</span> <span id="s98">And usually when he came back from Prague, he usually always brought some presents for the children.</span> <span id="s99">He was very – both my parents, but especially my father, because he had – he could afford – he had brought always from Prague small gifts for us, for the children, and for my mother, too.</span> <span id="s100">And usually Sunday morning, used to come to our hose – house, the people from the villages who used to buy for him all those cattles and so on, and he was paying them.</span> <span id="s101">So many people remembered him very well.</span> <span id="s102">Even here in Detroit for example, Sidnu(ph) Greenburger, who is a member of B’nai Moishe remembers him very well, and when I came to this country and he taught me here, welcomed me.</span> <span id="s103">You know, Michu(ph), because they called me in Hungarian name, if you are a – a human being like your father was, I will tip my hat in front of you [indecipherable] because very few people in the world was a fa – a father and a human being like your father, because he actually helped survive in Czechoslov – in Michalovce and the other villages, people who make their living through him.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Non-Jews as well as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Only Jews.</span> <span id="s106">Some non-Jews too, because they were like helpers when they – because we – he used to send, almost every week, a whole railroad car full with cattles or lambs, and we had, for example, in Michalovce, a big – like a storage place, where during the winter, that people were – we – they used to cut ice from the river and we mare – during the winter we make in this big places, pieces of ice what he used during summertime when we als – he was sending the slaughtered cattles and lambs to Prague, so he put in a railroad – railroad car, and it was a one piece of ice – of straw – ice, then the cattles, with – because the bellies were open, they put with the bellies on the ice.</span> <span id="s107">Then again, like a –</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Layer.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: – a layer of ice, again with cattles, or lambs, and it was up to the ceiling from one side of the car, and the other side of the car, because it was few hundred.</span> <span id="s110">So – and usually it took in the afternoon, they finished it in the afternoon, they put to the – to the ar – ar – ar – ar – the ra – to the – no, no, to the train, and then with the train during the night, and in the morning at eight o’clock it was in Prague.</span> <span id="s111">So then they delivered immediately from the railroad to the stall where he was selling, and beside that, he had even people who were in Prague buying from him, the – they were commissioners.</span> <span id="s112">So in the one way, he was selling his own merchandise, how to say, cattles, what is left, what the commissioners didn’t buy in Prague from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: So – but he did business with non-Jews then?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: They were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: They were all Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: The – the commissioner’s mainly was – his name I remember, his name was Vitoslav(ph) Krauss, and the other one was Appelus(ph), but I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s117">And it’s very interesting that I escaped from Czechoslovakia act – in 1968 and ’69, after the Russian came in, I went from – I escaped illegally, with two suitcases.</span> <span id="s118">I left every [indecipherable] everything there for the government.</span> <span id="s119">Then [indecipherable] were sentenced in absentia to two years in prison because we left illegally – legally they didn’t let you.</span> <span id="s120">So we left like for vacation.</span> <span id="s121">It was very hard to get, because we went from Czechoslovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to – to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s122">From Yugoslavia to Austria.</span> <span id="s123">In Vienna we registered in the HIAS in the Jewish immigration office.</span> <span id="s124">There we stayed about for two weeks, and they send us to Rome, to Italy, where is the main concentration of refugees, especially of Jewish refugees on the HIAS.</span> <span id="s125">And by the way, I was there working in Rome, we stayed in Rome 15 months approximately, because I was working on hire – they hired me, after three months I started to speak Italian, because I had learned it in gymnasium when I went, so I learned very easy.</span> <span id="s126">So I was working one year in HIAS in Rome, like an interpreter.</span> <span id="s127">So I stayed 15 months, you know – and by the way, I used to go the first time, after 22 years to go to a shul, to a synagogue, because in Czechoslovakia, first of all, we to – under communism it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you going – secondly, there was no Jews, so I didn’t have the opportunity to go.</span> <span id="s128">So I went to a little shul there in Rome, and suddenly I took a prayer book and I found in the prayer book a card what was a ticket, a steady ticket, a year’s ticket for my father for the streetcars in Prague.</span> <span id="s129">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s130">And I had here the card, not long time ago, and I am very sorry, I cannot find.</span> <span id="s131">I was looking, and I don’t remember if I gave it to the Holocaust museum here in Detroit, or I put somewhere.</span> <span id="s132">And I had the card for many years, and I’m sorry, otherwise I would give the card to you, to show that it was – and when I was in Rome, and they called me the first time to the – I had – had the aliyah, to show – to called me to the Torah.</span> <span id="s133">And I was very fluent, I remember, because I wa – go back to how it was in Czechoslovakia and was praying.</span> <span id="s134">So I said the first brocha by the aliyah very fluently.</span> <span id="s135">And suddenly, when I had to continue, suddenly I stopped and I couldn’t get a word from my mouth.</span> <span id="s136">And they thought, the people who are standing next to me, they thought that, what’s happened?</span> <span id="s137">What’s hap – and it took me about two minutes to ga – get – continue because I was – I was so excited, and for me was – is so something that I cannot imagine, I couldn’t imagine that after so many years I’m standing in front of the Torah by a-aliyah.</span> <span id="s138">So then I told them, so they told me they can understand that.</span> <span id="s139">So that what it happened to me in Rome.</span> <span id="s140">And I wanted only to say that in Czechoslovakia, because it was very dangerous to have some prayers or to go to a shul.</span> <span id="s141">So I had the prayer book, and my father gave me the idea – we had the drawer in our dresser.</span> <span id="s142">And behind the back of the drawer, in the wall, in the back of the dresser was a little space.</span> <span id="s143">So I put the prayer book in back of the drawer, and besi – behind the drawer, I put a plywood, so when you opened the drawer, you couldn’t see nothing in the back.</span> <span id="s144">And from the back I made a little hole, a small hole that you can push down the – the plywood with a wire.</span> <span id="s145">So it was a small – and when I opened the drawer and I pushed the – with th-the wire the plywood, so the plywood came down and I took my prayer book.</span> <span id="s146">So at least on the high holidays, approximate, I knew where they are, so I was praying, because otherwise what – when my sister escaped from Czechoslovakia with her husband in 1948, and then my other sister with her husband in 1950, illegally, and I gave some money out, I helped them.</span> <span id="s147">So then it was very dangerous because the police came after me.</span> <span id="s148">I was in – even in custody for – for a few days, and they even slapped me because I didn’t want to tell them h-ho – which way my sister escaped and left Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s149">So, then I – so I knew that was genderus – dangerous to pray, so that’s way – and I knew that exactly, at least twice during the time in those year, in 1950 - ’51, maybe ’52, the secret police came during the day when we were in [indecipherable] my wife at work, they were checking my a – our apartment for certain things they will find, because – especially my wife, she realized – she opened, for example there, her underwear was, that it was put a different way back, or our other things what we had in our drawers, or in the – in our – in our closet.</span> <span id="s150">So that’s – we knew exactly they were secretly – they came to our apartment to check, and to make – if they will find something against me.</span> <span id="s151">Maybe they were more times than twice, but twice we knew exactly for sure.</span> <span id="s152">So when I – they took me many times, about three times I wa – I think, to the secret police, and they were even telling me, if I won’t tell how the – my sister went, and what connections I have with my sisters overseas in the west, that they will send me to Jáchymov.</span> <span id="s153">This was very a dangerous [indecipherable] it was uran-uranium – uranium m-mine, that they were sending the worst criminals or politically who are dangerous for them.</span> <span id="s154">And most of the people even died then in those mines, or if they after many years they were lucky, came back, their whole – their life – they were sick with – from the uran – from –</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Radiation?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: From radiation.</span> <span id="s157">So I was in very, very danger – so my wife helped me actually, this is – she –</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Well, I want to come back and ask you more about this, because this sounds similar to what you went through during the war even.</span> <span id="s159">You – you – you said you had – you davened in – in – in Rome.</span> <span id="s160">So you – you must have had a – a very good –</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Background.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: – education.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Background, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: [indecipherable] you – you went to cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: Yeah, eight years.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: So tell me what – tell me what that was like in – in Michalovce.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: In [indecipherable] cheder, that was a different – a little bit like here, because when we started in cheder when I was five and a half years old.</span> <span id="s168">So there was different, there in cheder was first grade, second grade, third grade, and each year you were more advanced.</span> <span id="s169">For example, your – and our teachers, we call them rabbis.</span> <span id="s170">And really, actually, the rabbis have beards and everything.</span> <span id="s171">And it was like Orthodox.</span> <span id="s172">And in first grade we started to learn the alphabet – the – the Aleph-Aleph-Bet.</span> <span id="s173">And then to – how to – to daven and how to read.</span> <span id="s174">Second gr-grade we started to learn a little the sidrah, the Torah.</span> <span id="s175">Then in third grade we had went and started to learn harasha(ph).</span> <span id="s176">In fourth grade we started to learn for example gemura(ph), and so far [indecipherable] tanakh.</span> <span id="s177">And so, then we came to the seventh grade, actually we were very highly educated in Jewish studies, starting like with this – all the – like I’m saying, the gemura(ph), tanakh with explanation, with Russia, and everything.</span> <span id="s178">So when I wa – get Bar Mitzvah, actually I could go almost to learn for a rabbi, really, because I was so highly educated.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: But you – you had a – a secular education as well?</span> <span id="s180">Y-You – you didn’t – you didn’t only have Jewish education?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, but the ga –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Did you go to public school as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: Yeah, pu – public school.</span> <span id="s184">That’s I – I think I mentioned in my – here in that interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Well, tell me what – what a day was like when you were – when you were a boy.</span> <span id="s186">What would – what would happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: What do you mean, when I started school?</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Well, what – would you go to cheder first?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah, I went to cheder first, because I started only few months before I started public school, because public school I started when I was six year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: So what time of the day would you go to cheder?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: In cheder, I get up at five o’clock in the morning every day, summer, winter.</span> <span id="s192">I took a small, like a can with warm coffee, and this was my – actually mine bread – my – my lunch.</span> <span id="s193">And we put – because in this time in cheder we had all – not always, but the heat, we put the wood, and I tell you how to cook –</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Stoves.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Stoves.</span> <span id="s196">So on the top it was – the stove was from metal.</span> <span id="s197">So we put on the top of the stove our cans with the coffee.</span> <span id="s198">So wh-when we finished, we finished about 7:30, so we took breakfast.</span> <span id="s199">We ate the breakfast, and immediately we went across the street to the public school, that started about 8:15.</span> <span id="s200">So actually, I had approximately half hour time between finishing in cheder, and going to public school.</span> <span id="s201">There I stayed in public school aqu – approximately til 12 o’clock.</span> <span id="s202">So I rushed home, 12:15, there I have lunch at home.</span> <span id="s203">And quarter to two I went back to the cheder, and stayed about til five o’clock, sometimes 5:30.</span> <span id="s204">And in this goes all the time about for seven years.</span> <span id="s205">And sometimes in wintertime I went early in the morning in winter, and I had to go through snow to that knee high, and I went to cheder.</span> <span id="s206">I don’t remember that I didn’t want, I don’t remember that it was closed because the weather, or something like that.</span> <span id="s207">In between this time, specially when I was 10 - 12 years old, I was – liked very much soccer.</span> <span id="s208">So between this time, I had to find some free time to play soccer too, because behind – we had the big house, two big gardens, with fruit, with vegetables, with everything.</span> <span id="s209">So a – and behind the big garden was the soccer field.</span> <span id="s210">So actually all my free time I grew up on the soccer field.</span> <span id="s211">And especially in later years, after 15 - 16 years old, I played for the club, for there in Michalovce, soccer.</span> <span id="s212">So, my life from the age five til about 13 was actually 12 hours a day, approximately, cheder and school.</span> <span id="s213">Even when I went in high school, when I was 11 years old, it was the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: When you went to public school, you must have been in school with non-Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh yeah, the public school –</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Did you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yeah, because I had neighbors was non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And soccer, you must have played soccer.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: And soccer, I played soccer with them, but most of my friends were the neighbors, because on our street most of the people, it was about, in our street on the bi – on the beginning of the street were the hospital in Michalovce, and after that there were the private houses.</span> <span id="s220">There were about maybe 10 houses or eight houses, and most of them were Jewish.</span> <span id="s221">So some of the people went with me, the same class, the same school, and some even Christian people, so I had – I had all the friends, Christian and Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: Do you remember any anti-Semitism in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s224">Maybe later, years, because I went some years to the gymnasium too, and there was when I was about 15 years old or so, there – here and there, some – between the – the children, between my classmates, here and there was some mention or something, that you are a Jew or something, but not so serious.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: No violence.</span> <span id="s226">A: No violence, no, no violence.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: What would you had done had it – had the war not come?</span> <span id="s228">You went to gymnasium, wha – where would you have gone from there?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: [indecipherable] the gymna – the gymnasium I didn’t finish exactly, because I have some – I had a professor who was very, very anti-Semitic.</span> <span id="s230">And not only myself, it was two other boys, who had very difficulties to study with him, because he was the principal there in our class for two years.</span> <span id="s231">So at – I had very difficult as I understand it even.</span> <span id="s232">I had so sharp that he called – he let – called my father that I was – I-I wasn’t behave or something.</span> <span id="s233">But it really wasn’t true because he went very much after Jews, and the other two guys didn’t fini – the one didn’t finish a year before, in the fourth grade, and the – the second one, his father was very, very rich, so he took him out and sent him to another city, to Košice.</span> <span id="s234">But my father said, I have no choice, so you know what, better – and he had the friend who had the very good store with hardware, and he was willing to take me there.</span> <span id="s235">And my father, what his plan was that I will work there like apri – aprinse –</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Apprentice.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: – apprentice for two years, and then he will try somehow, th – the boss where I was working, he will help th – my father, but he will buy for me a small store – End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: – Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic.</span> <span id="s239">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: So that – probably that he will try to buy for me a store in [indecipherable] because I will be familiar, and I will be a partner there, some kind of partnership.</span> <span id="s241">But it was later then in 1938 – I started there actually in 1936, I think.</span> <span id="s242">I mean, then in 1938 came – the Czechoslovak Republic was divided, especially in 1938, we saw what’s going on.</span> <span id="s243">It was Kristallnacht in Germany, and so on.</span> <span id="s244">So we saw that it was there – there gender – danger.</span> <span id="s245">So I was continuing to work in this store til 1940, when I went in the labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: I’m – I’m going to ask you about 1938 in a minute.</span> <span id="s247">Tell – tell me a little bit more about the household.</span> <span id="s248">Wha-What was a Friday night like at your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Friday night til the last moment, even when it was the Slovak Republic, and we – the family was still at home together, as normally every Friday evening, normal dinner like any Jewish house, with kiddish, with all the – even Saturdays too, Saturday noon, as long as we could afford.</span> <span id="s250">I mean, as long as it wasn’t so dangerous, especially 1940 and ’41, when they started to persecute the Jews, when they came in 1939 or 1940, the all – the laws against the Jews in Slovakia, what was actually a copy of the Nuremberg laws against the Jews, that the Slovak government accepted to be the same in 1939 - 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: This is the Zidovsky Kodex?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Right.</span> <span id="s253">This is Zidovsky Kodex, yeah.</span> <span id="s254">So then it was very hard, and it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s255">So we tried our best, I don’t remember exactly for how long, til what year, because that was the situation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Wa – was your family aware of the political situation?</span> <span id="s257">Did you – you remember Masaryk, for example?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: Oh very well.</span> <span id="s259">Masa – Masaryk was a pro – professor of philosophy.</span> <span id="s260">Actually, he was – the beginning, with his help was established the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, and he died in 1935.</span> <span id="s261">After him was the President Beneš.</span> <span id="s262">He was not – he was maybe a politician, but – but he ra – I think he wa – won – they blame him, and I think rightly so, because he actually – not that he helped, but he was afraid, and he sold actually, the Czechoslovak Republic in 1938 to Chamberlain and to Hitler.</span> <span id="s263">Because Chamberlain came to the Czechoslovakia, he made an agreement with Hitler, he – Chamberlain was very trustworthy, and he carries a piece of paper that Hitler guaranteed peace in the – in Europe, and guaranteed after the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia gave, with the help of Beneš, and actually Chamberlain was pushing him, gave the Sudetenland to Germany, and Hitler promised that’s it, and Czechoslovakia [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s264">And Chamberlain came to London, it was, and even today it’s somewhere a tape.</span> <span id="s265">He came down from his plane and showed a piece of paper, I brought peace to – to England, I brought peace for Europe.</span> <span id="s266">And he was very much mistaken, but actually, he brought not the peace to London, he br – brought the concentration camps to London.</span> <span id="s267">He was very naïve.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Do you remember reading about the Munich pact in the – in the newspapers, in –</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh yeah, this –</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Is that when you found out about this, or was it after the war that you –</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: No, we read, because it came out in the czecho – in Czechoslovakia, in the newspaper, there were – that was happened in – in Munich, actually in some newspaper who were – openly said that Czechoslovakia was sold.</span> <span id="s272">Other newspaper who went with more fascistic papers, they said, we saved Czechoslovakia, but it wasn’t true.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And – and what was your – people in your family, were they concerned about – about Hitler at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s275">And we tried, because my father still was traveling to Prague, so he tried in 1938, even he went to Prague when it was Slovakia and [indecipherable] that Germans were there.</span> <span id="s276">He still had the opportunity about twice to go to Prague, and he tried very hard to get paper for us, because he had his brothers there and they tried to get out us from Czechoslovakia, but it was almost impossible then already.</span> <span id="s277">So, I think I cannot blame him because he – I know that he tried in – end of 1938, because he saw the situation.</span> <span id="s278">He went to the American embassy, but it was hard, because it was co – very complicated to get the papers, first of all to get out from Czechoslovakia, and to get the visas from the American embassy, because there is – was a quota.</span> <span id="s279">They were sorting people who they let out even before 1938.</span> <span id="s280">So he didn’t manage it fe – he tried very hard, but it was impossible to – even he had, in 1938 was the World Fair in New York.</span> <span id="s281">So ra – his brothers sent him papers that he will come to the – to the World Fair, but it was before Munich.</span> <span id="s282">So, between this time came Munich and came the occupation, so it – he couldn’t get in for the World Fair.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Did – you think that the – the – the – the tone of – in Michalovce changed, I mean did – was there a [indecipherable] in Michalovce, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Very mu – immediately after – they started to make not pogroms, but anti-Semitic signs before March 1939 when the – it actually was hi – with the help of Hitler was established the Slovak Republic, and the – Hitler occupied [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s285">So – and after 1939, the 15 – starting 15 of March, started immediately against Jews in the newspapers, on the radio, all over.</span> <span id="s286">And they were starting immediately again with – they had black uniforms with high boots, and with the low – the caps like officers.</span> <span id="s287">And they were driving all over, screaming, and manifestations, egging Jews.</span> <span id="s288">So we have to hide, we had to – we were afraid to get out.</span> <span id="s289">And then later on, in later years, they made when they came in 1940 – I think 1940, started that you had to – the Jews have to wear the – the yellow star, and then it was curfew, and Jews couldn’t get out on the street after six o’clock in the evening, til six o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s290">So and it was – and later on we couldn’t go – go to a movie.</span> <span id="s291">For Jews was not allowed to go, for example, to a movie, or any public places.</span> <span id="s292">So they started actually, the end of 1939 - 1940, all the persecution of the Jews.</span> <span id="s293">And in 1941, when I was in labor camp, and this time all the Jews have to register, and that way they have specially the young people and the single people.</span> <span id="s294">So actually that’s way, they – my brother had to go to register in 1941, and I didn’t register because I was in labor camp, so that’s – I was lucky, when I come home in March 1942, they didn’t have my name, because I wasn’t registered, but my brother was registered, so immediately in March or in April, they took him to the labor camp – to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: But you didn’t register?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No, I didn’t, because I wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s297">I was in labor camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And – and when you came back from labor camp, you – you didn’t register –</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: Yeah, no, they didn’t – because the registration was in 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: So then they had all the names, so they didn’t go then after the people.</span> <span id="s302">Actually, maybe they didn’t know that some people were released in 1942 from – from labor camp.</span> <span id="s303">But then, as they went after the families in 1942, later on, so then I went – then we went to hiding with my father, with my mother.</span> <span id="s304">And then – and this time in 1943 or ’44, because there was – in 19-four – ni-nine – 1942 - ’43, they were safe in Hungary.</span> <span id="s305">The you – Jews were actually much freer, it sa – wasn’t the – the Jewish Kodex, what this was in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s306">So my – my father sent my mother and then my younger sister Lola to Hungary, to Uszura(ph), it was a – a city about – about 30 miles from Michalovce, because she had there her family.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Your mother was from Uszura(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: So, they were assured they were actually safe in Hungary.</span> <span id="s309">But what’s happened later on, in 1944, in May, they started to take with the – Horthy came in in Hungary.</span> <span id="s310">So they started to take the Jews from Hungary 19 my – April, May – in May 1944.</span> <span id="s311">So that’s when my sister and my mother went with her family in Hungary to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: To Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: To Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Remember Tiso?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Tiso?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s318">I remember.</span> <span id="s319">Tiso actually, like I wrote in this there, he made the agreement with Hitler that he will get rid for the je – from the Jews.</span> <span id="s320">Actually, there were – before, the prime minister in this time before was Tuka, then he died.</span> <span id="s321">Then he and Tiso actually made agreement special – Tiso, he went to Berlin specially to make an agreement with Hitler in 1940, I think it was, that Hitler will help him to get rid of the Jews in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s322">And he paid slova – the Slovak Republic paid for each Jew who went to concentration camp, they prayed – they paid to Hitler, I don’t remember exactly how many hundred dollars for each person.</span> <span id="s323">And so that’s what th-the – actually it started, the transportation of Jews from Slovakia, and he was very much involved, Tiso, and Mach, the interior minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Sano Mach.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Sano Mach.</span> <span id="s326">And – I wanted to say – and that’s why Hitler was sending to Bratislava Eichmann, and a German Slovak, the name was Carmasine(ph).</span> <span id="s327">They actually were organizing the transporting of the Jews from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s328">And Eichmann were – he stayed very much [indecipherable] for a month in Bratislava, who was helping Carmasine(ph) to make the transportation go.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Did you know about all this while it was happening?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: We were all – we knew only like we were talking between Jews, he heard this, he heard that, something like that.</span> <span id="s331">But we knew that Carmasine(ph) was helping, but for example, from eich – but how far and how much – how much, and Eichmann, I think we actually knew more after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: Had you heard of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Very much, later on, that you knew, because actually the whole propaganda was there that they are taking the young people, like for labor in Germany, in Poland – and in Poland.</span> <span id="s334">They didn’t mention – it wasn’t mention about concentration camp.</span> <span id="s335">We knew only later on because some news came from Poland that some people th-they don’t – aren’t alive any more, that immediately they went to – after few weeks or months, straight to the ovens.</span> <span id="s336">And then I don’t remember exactly, then we heard that they – when they came to Auschwitz, they are dividing people to the right and to the left, that people who go to work and people who go to the ovens, to the chamb – to the – but it was no – nothing official in the Slovak press, or something like that.</span> <span id="s337">They said always that the young people were – went to – to labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: But the – but the Kodex was public, the laws were public.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: The la-laws were publicked.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: D-Do you remember where you were when the war started, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: In Slovakia, I was at home, 19 – in Poland in September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And how did you find out about the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: It was in the paper, this was in the paper that the – the German, because the Poland started th-the war, so the – the German made attack, and they are continuing to occupy Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: But Slovakia wasn’t involved at that – at that –</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Slovakia was involved later on, in ’39, and the – there it has even – had even the name, the – the Slovak army, the Slovak, it was so cold [indecipherable] divízie, the first divis – division who they sent, certain – I don’t – cannot tell you exactly how many thousand people they sent to help to win the war with Hitler against the German, against the Russian.</span> <span id="s346">Then later on in the Slovak, they – even the people did realize, it was like, in the beginning like secret, but then they started to bring back injured or dead soldiers, then the Slovak people started to know that the – actually the Slovak army is in the war against the Poland and Russian.</span> <span id="s347">But in the press it was always written like heroes, because they are saving the freedom, they are saving the world, because they are fighting against the Bolsheviks, against the communists and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: So this was in – I mean, on the Russian front.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: On the – first on the Polish, but it was the – actually the Polish war was over in few months, so they went there – against Russia.</span> <span id="s350">But then it started again, actually the main involvement of the Slovak army was in 1941 in June when they started the war, the German against th-the Russian.</span> <span id="s351">Because before Stalin make the agreement, the so-called agreement with the German that they won’t fight to each other.</span> <span id="s352">But I don’t know how far Stalin or Hitler knew that it’s on-only – not evidently to – actually to gain some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Now what – when the – when the war started, did that have an effect on your family?</span> <span id="s354">In 1939, was there rationing, were – were people fighting –</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: It started, yeah, it started immediately the rationing.</span> <span id="s356">We get some so-called – how do they call?</span> <span id="s357">Stamps or something, but it was later on, but it was only maybe three or four items, main items.</span> <span id="s358">It wasn’t so bad, like for example, in Bohemia, in Moravia, or in Germany.</span> <span id="s359">But it started – but it – we – we couldn’t see tha – that it wasn’t enough, but it wasn’t plenty.</span> <span id="s360">So we didn’t feel the rationing so much in 1940 - ’41.</span> <span id="s361">Later on maybe on – when the war started in – with Russia, then it was harder.</span> <span id="s362">Then it was more rationing.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Wh-What – why – let me take back just a one step before.</span> <span id="s364">When the – when the Slovak Republic was declared in 1939, the – and the laws were passed right – right away – anti-Semitic laws were passed, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yeah, but officially was later on.</span> <span id="s366">When it came to Jewish Kodex, I don’t remember, it was late ’39, or beginning of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What kind of effect did that have on your family?</span> <span id="s368">Would – were people frightened, did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: Well, we were very frightened, we were very afraid.</span> <span id="s370">Some Christians even stopped to communicate with us.</span> <span id="s371">But later on, for example, when they started to take in families in 1940 – late ’42 - ’43, so we were hiding.</span> <span id="s372">We had the neighbor who we had to bribe him so he will be – well, because it was always said – always we had some echo, at night they will start to take the families.</span> <span id="s373">Or tomorrow.</span> <span id="s374">So we went immediately to our neighbor, and they were hiding in a basement there.</span> <span id="s375">He had potatoes, and we were hiding over the potatoes and he was covering these potatoes or so, with a blanket, and it was very – because to go down to the basement, it was like the floor, it was wood.</span> <span id="s376">So when you open the door, it was – you couldn’t see that there is a door to the basement.</span> <span id="s377">And we knew for example, many times they came to our house to look for us, and they didn’t find us.</span> <span id="s378">So many times then, later on when I came home from labor camp in 1942, they still continuing to take young people and single people to the labor – to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s379">So we had the Jewish neighbor, and there was a brother from our neighbor, he was single.</span> <span id="s380">His name was Alfred Salzman(ph).</span> <span id="s381">He lives in New York, he’s still alive.</span> <span id="s382">Then he went – so with him, I used to, especially summertime, because [indecipherable] father was planting field, corn, and wh-wheat, and so on.</span> <span id="s383">So we run always in the – the night in the field to ha – go in hiding.</span> <span id="s384">And we stayed there in two, three days.</span> <span id="s385">We had sa – for a piece of bread, or even sometimes water, some [indecipherable] not water, because we are afra – we were afraid to come back to our house because they were still taking young people.</span> <span id="s386">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: So would you hide with the family?</span> <span id="s388">Your family would go too?</span></p> <p><span id="s389">A: No, they – this time, 1942, they started to take the families late ’42, or in ’43.</span> <span id="s390">So that – then I was hiding with my family, but in this time, when they started to take families, my mother and my youngest sister, they were in Hungary already.</span> <span id="s391">And secondly, in this time, my father had the opportunity, so we had so-called – he bought a permission for the government, well you know, it was bribing, so it’s true, some people who had a-access to some in the ministry or so, that had the piece of paper that is a letters to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Sure – yeah, something like that.</span> <span id="s394">So we had the opportunity always two months, or three months to delay, actually.</span> <span id="s395">Even other families that taken already to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s396">But still, it was a little like – a little like a cover, or we felt a little shi – more secure there the other – other, but we didn’t know when it was safe.</span> <span id="s397">We got to recognize this permission what you had.</span> <span id="s398">So that’s where later on my father sent my mother and younger sister to a safe place, to Hungary.</span> <span id="s399">But then it wa-wasn’t worth the danger, we couldn’t – it wasn’t worth it.</span> <span id="s400">We couldn’t afford all the – they didn’t get the permission already, any permission.</span> <span id="s401">So then I was hiding with my father, with my other sister re – some different places.</span> <span id="s402">And then we went in ninet – in April 1944, because it was actually a few hundred kilometers, the Russian f – the front was approaching.</span> <span id="s403">So all the Jews from eastern Slovakia had to move, and to – from eastern Slovakia to the west.</span> <span id="s404">So they sent us, if you had to – and my f-father had someone in Bratislava, in the capital, a family who he used to make some a little business before the war.</span> <span id="s405">So we stayed there for a few days, and then we took an apartment in Bratislava for a few weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: This was a non-Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: No, this was a Jewish family, still a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s408">And we took an apartment in Bratislava, but then it was dangerous, especially in – after it was the partisan uprising in August 1944, in Banskebisatran(ph), Slovakia, so we have to leave Bratislava, and then where we went – I went with my father and my sister to Nová Vestu nad Váhom(ph), from there – then we went actually to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s409">And from Nová Vestu nad Váhom(ph), my sister disappeared, and I went, because it started then, the German came, occupied Slovakia, so I went there in the woods, and I went to the partisans.</span> <span id="s410">So that –</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Let me – let me take you back just for a second before we start with the – with the – cause I want to know about the st – the uprising, and your role in this.</span> <span id="s412">Just a couple of questions about, from 1939 to 1941, or so, some of the non-Jews that you knew, did – did – did you hear from any of them?</span> <span id="s413">Did they offer to help?</span> <span id="s414">Did [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Very few.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: – express any sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: Very few, very few, because most likely was Catholic – Catholic.</span> <span id="s418">And some people who were so-called Evangelical Protestants, they were actually always against the Slovak Republic because they were not only – not only because they – they were persecuting the Jews, but because they were – they were against the catol – Catholic religion, against the Catholic hierarchy, especially they knew that the priest actually, of a fascistic Slovak Republic is the president.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Tiso, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: A ca – Catholic priest.</span> <span id="s421">So that’s where they, if they could, if it wasn’t very risky, they had sympathy, most of them.</span> <span id="s422">But very few Catholics.</span> <span id="s423">And by the way, for example like I mentioned, what my father get a permission order to stay, they didn’t take us immediately to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s424">It was a very [indecipherable] one, because Tiso used to go to a small city in Slovakia, western Slovakia, it’s called Banovce nad Bebravou.</span> <span id="s425">And there he used to go Sunday morning, so-called, to pray the – the – in that church to make sermons or how you call it.</span> <span id="s426">So, in Catholic church.</span> <span id="s427">And there was a widow pharmacist, and I don’t know if it’s true, and they said that she was his girlfriend.</span> <span id="s428">So – and people had access to this pharmacist, to this woman, and she took the money and through her people get permission there, they can stay longer in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s429">So actually it was a secret, but people are talking that his girlfriend actually was helping Jews, because she had access to get so – and how far it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: How did you find out – who – who asked you to come and report for the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span

soldiers, but for two or three weeks, but immediately they transferred, they organize the labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: So you got a letter in the mail?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: And send u – and send us to work immediately.</span> <span id="s437">We started to work on the roads, to make roads, improvements and – and to dig at the edge of the road, how do you call them, the –</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Ditches.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Ditches, and then later on, we went – for example, was disasters, flooding or something like that, we went to help.</span> <span id="s440">And then when we – they sent us to stone pits, you know, when they ra –</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Quarries.</span> <span id="s442">Quarries.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q: Quarries.</span> <span id="s445">Stone quarries.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A: Right, stone quarries.</span> <span id="s447">This was very hard labor for many –</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: So you went first to Jelene?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Jelene, yeah.</span> <span id="s450">To the – actually to the military barracks.</span> <span id="s451">And from there they transfer – they transferred us to labor camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Wh-Where else?</span> <span id="s453">Where was the next one, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: The next was – we – we stayed in Jelene for about for three months, and from there they sent us to the mountain there like I mentioned, to the border of Slovakia and Moravia, it called Yarvonik(ph) and there we were wor – were working on the roads, make new roads there.</span> <span id="s455">And there we were – because it was a little – the mountains was, even in August, September was cold, raining, and we had to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: And – and was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: N-Not in the beginning.</span> <span id="s458">When we were in Jelene we had food like the military, normal food.</span> <span id="s459">But later on we – it was much less.</span> <span id="s460">And then [indecipherable] from Jelene, they send us first to Vrutky.</span> <span id="s461">They were – they thought they was a military actually, where they had collected military clothing and military shoes, and we were just preparing the military clothing for the Slovak army who went to the front.</span> <span id="s462">But it was a na – only few weeks only, and they were send us there to the Moravian border.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And then where?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: From there –</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Were you in Nováky as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: No, Nováky I was later, it was in 1942 already.</span> <span id="s467">There we went – then we went to [indecipherable] far from Slovakia.</span> <span id="s468">There again we were doing there building from military barracks.</span> <span id="s469">From then I did, I stayed about for three months, then they send us, I don’t exactly the name or the year, but it was in 1941, I think, they send us to Svätý Peter.</span> <span id="s470">It was in the mountains where – the Tatra mountains, and there we were working on the roads again, and then we were working in the pits, you know, in the – how do you call it, the – the stones we were –</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Quarries.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Yeah, we were breaking stones and so on.</span> <span id="s473">It was – this was the hardest labor what we had maybe all those two years.</span> <span id="s474">And from there we went for a few months to Plaszów, to a military barrack, and we were helping there clean up, the closing what came – [indecipherable] it was in 1941 - ’42 – closing and the military equipment, what they brought back from the front, from the Russian front, that they were cleaning.</span> <span id="s475">And from there, I went back again t – again to Svätý Peter, and for a few days, which was only a few days all the time a few weeks to Nováky, then I-I – I went actually back on the later day w-weeks to [indecipherable] where from there I went – I went home, but they released us in 1942 in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Now this was – was this all Jews?</span></p> <p><span

id="s485">This is tape number two, side A. Let – let me ask again a little bit more about the labor camp.</span> <span id="s486">Did people die there?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Get sick, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s488">All right, I didn’t – what I know about maybe three or four cases, but the – I don’t remember how far it was in connection on from the – yeah, we had some, for example, s – there where I was working the pits, or how you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Quarry.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: In the quar – there were some – very often some very serious injuries.</span> <span id="s491">And on other occasions were injuries or sicknesses.</span> <span id="s492">But in two occasions I know that – two or three occasions I remember that people died, but I – I don’t remember how far it was connected with work, what we were doing, or – because sometimes it’s true in some places where we were – oh, what is that – not far [indecipherable] in a village, I think it was Baltar(ph) or something like that.</span> <span id="s493">And there we had like a – it was a – it was a guardist(ph) who were – or in other places I can remember were sometimes even beaten or kicked or something.</span> <span id="s494">And many – that was very often that we heard from who were in charge for – of us, against Jews, and anti-Semitic this – all the time.</span> <span id="s495">And we forget sometimes some people – I wasn’t – I cannot – I don’t remember that I was, but some – some people were beaten or kicked or something, or pushed.</span> <span id="s496">I-I was pushed ma – or something, or – too, but I don’t remember that I was beaten, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But the guards were Hlinka -- Hlinka guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Oh, the members of the Hlinka guard, they were fr-fr-from the beginning, they had military uniforms, they had in – like a – like I say the first grade in the military [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Epaulets that the lieutenants –</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Yeah, ra – tha – not the [indecipherable] lower down lieutenant, but – so they were in charge, but later on actually were in civilian, but they were me-members of the Hlinka guard.</span> <span id="s501">They never were – there – I don’t remember they – if they wore, because they were worn the Hlinka – Hlinka guard uniform, but they were members of the Hlinka guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: The Ludacs(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yeah, the Ludaci.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: When you were taken to the labor camp, what di – how did – how did you go?</span> <span id="s505">Did you go by train, by truck –</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yeah, by train, yeah.</span> <span id="s507">There I received a in – like invitation [indecipherable] that I have to be there in Jelene on this and this day and so on.</span> <span id="s508">So they were waiting for us on the railroad station.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: When you left home, what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Very sad.</span> <span id="s511">Because we knew – we knew already, it was in 1940, that the Slovak Republic that this anti-Semitism, and they are going against the Jews.</span> <span id="s512">So actually, not me, not my family knew what will happen to me.</span> <span id="s513">And we had very few opportunities then even to write home, to let know.</span> <span id="s514">So it was very hard.</span> <span id="s515">But in one way actually, the labor camp saved my life, because if I would be home like my brother, I would be registered, and I would g-go to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s516">Yeah, and I want to mention one other thing what happened to me.</span> <span id="s517">In 1943, yeah, in this time was still safe in Hungary, my – my mother and my sister were all there.</span> <span id="s518">And my wife – my father actually, made arrangement that I will go to Hungary too, because it was safe.</span> <span id="s519">And so he found some – a Christian guy who, my f-father paid him, who would take me over the border, because the border wasn’t far away.</span> <span id="s520">And really, I went with him, he took me over the border, he took me there, we had to go through a small river, so f – deep in the water, about maybe 25 or 30 feet wide.</span> <span id="s521">So I had to go – I took off my clothes and go so far in water, and I was in Hungary already.</span> <span id="s522">So he took me there in a small village to a house, and he told me, you have to wait here, and a other guy will come, and we’ll take you to Uszkurat(ph), where my mother was, it was about maybe 15 miles or so.</span> <span id="s523">And so I was waiting, it was about three o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s524">And suddenly about six o’clock in the morning, instead of the guy who would take me to Hungary came the Hungarian police, and they immediately took me and took me back to the border to Slovakia.</span> <span id="s525">And when they ha – they took me to the Slovakian border, to the Slovakian police, they brought me back to Michalovce and put me in jail, because I wa [indecipherable] and they put me in jail.</span> <span id="s526">There were other people, about 30 of them, young people, Jews, who were preparing like they are cou – almost like a transport to – or to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s527">And there was in Michalovce, th-this jail was only – where was the main office, the city hall, there was a basement, and there were keeping only those people.</span> <span id="s528">And there was alway like who used to be a guard, like a – like a – what [inaudible] there, who used to be there, yeah, a civilian person.</span> <span id="s529">And suddenly, the day that they brought me, it was a day before a national holiday.</span> <span id="s530">It was in July, I think, where there was a national religious holiday, a Christian holiday.</span> <span id="s531">And they put in the basement immediately my – there – some people saw me when they brought me to Michalovce, that the police take me – took me to the – there to the jail.</span> <span id="s532">So immediately they tak – talk my father.</span> <span id="s533">So – and in this time, something happened with my – I had my shoe when was walking so much, and my heel, I had some damage [indecipherable] my heel, you know, some blood and so on, and it suddenly get the red.</span> <span id="s534">So I-I get some infection.</span> <span id="s535">And my father, when he heard that I back in jail, he had somebo – because close to our house was the hospital, and he had – had a doctor who he was very close.</span> <span id="s536">So I – he gave me some money, and the next morning, because it was a holiday, he came to the jail and told this guy, listen, I heard here you have a – someone who had some infection.</span> <span id="s537">I have to check him.</span> <span id="s538">So, he gave immediately, because my father gave some money to the doctor, he gave a little money to this guy, he let him in.</span> <span id="s539">He get – take a look at me, and he really saw – I can you show me, even today I have a scar, and he showed – took a [indecipherable] and he showed the guards and said, look, this is red and swollen, I have to take him immediately to the hospital to take – to open it.</span> <span id="s540">And you can tell the g – the – the Hlinka guard or someone that I took him out and they can see him in the hospital.</span> <span id="s541">So he took me to the hospital, immediately he opened it.</span> <span id="s542">He made a big – a big bandage on it.</span> <span id="s543">I don’t even remember if he freeze it or not, but probably, because I felt some pain immediately.</span> <span id="s544">And he put me in a room, and immediately aft – in the afternoon, there came two guardists(ph), one [indecipherable] police, and what immediately called the doctor, the doctor went with he – with them to the room, and they told him – he told them, look, I cannot leave him, he has temperature – and I really had temperature, because it was really an infection [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s545">And I cannot even open the wound.</span> <span id="s546">I have here the papers of what I wrote down, what I did to him.</span> <span id="s547">And you have to wait til take, two or three days til he can get out, or I will see what’s happen, because it’s so dangerous that he can die even, a so dangerous infection.</span> <span id="s548">So it took I don’t know how long because they were arguing with him there in the office.</span> <span id="s549">So they let me down.</span> <span id="s550">And every five or six hours came a guardist, or a policeman to check if I am there.</span> <span id="s551">And can you imagine?</span> <span id="s552">I swear to you that it’s true what I am telling you.</span> <span id="s553">The next morning, when it was right after the holiday, early in the morning, all the 29 people too – they took away – that went to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s554">And after the war, I met only one of them.</span> <span id="s555">He was originally from Lithuania, but he lived in Slovakia after t – about two years, about three years.</span> <span id="s556">And he told me, as far as he knew, immediately in 1942 – for – for – 1943, 22 people, they’re shot or died in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s557">And he survived, and ya – as sla – as far as he knows, he said, I don’t know if someone else survived.</span> <span id="s558">So then I stayed in the hospital about 10 days, and then they let me go because the – the older people left already.</span> <span id="s559">So – but they had my name, so that’s where I went war – in hiding and so on.</span> <span id="s560">And I was suspicious because they had my name that I tried to go to Hungary.</span> <span id="s561">So that’s a other story what – I don’t know if I told the whole story.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: You changed your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah, and th-this time, it was end of 1943, again, it was a Bratislav priest, not far in the village, who for money gave you a Christian birth certificate, and then for other money, my father bought Christian papers for me, for him, and for my sister.</span> <span id="s564">So actually – then when we left from Michalovce in 1944, in April, actually I always what I’m – in Bratislava sometimes they make identifications.</span> <span id="s565">They stopped you on the street even, during the day, show identification.</span> <span id="s566">So I showed Uri Benko(ph), present identification card with a picture, with – with a birth certificate, with a citizenship, with everything, all the papers that I need to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: What was the name again?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Uri Benko(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: Uri Benko(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: And I’m fir – you know, and I lived to – under this name, even like a partisan, even in – in hiding.</span> <span id="s571">And I was very sorry because when I was liberated, and I – after the second or three days, I met some people who I knew before, even Christian people and some Jewish people started to come from – from labor camp already.</span> <span id="s572">It was in April, in May.</span> <span id="s573">And I said, what the hell I need this paper, I throwed it, I threw it there.</span> <span id="s574">Oh, I don’t want nothing to have it.</span> <span id="s575">And I – I feel very sorry because today it would be a very documentary [indecipherable] because it would be really true that – as to what I am saying, that I lived on these papers.</span> <span id="s576">And you know what happened, I have a other story what – I don’t know if I – I told that.</span> <span id="s577">When I was liberated, just April the 4th – last week, it was 52 years I was liberated.</span> <span id="s578">And I don’t know if I told you the story; I was caught twice by the German in 1944 and 1945, I don’t know if I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s579">If you want I can tell it to you again, the story.</span> <span id="s580">In 1944 in October, I was – end of October, or beginning November.</span> <span id="s581">I was with a – one group of partisans.</span> <span id="s582">They had – because this was woods, and there were – you know, this is a place there in the woods, what you have for example, five, six houses, then you have woods, you have nothing, and then again so few houses.</span> <span id="s583">They call it in Slovak Kopanitsa(ph), I don’t know how to translate in English.</span> <span id="s584">So, and they sent me down, because then in the little [indecipherable] village, it’s called Kriener(ph), that was the name of the village.</span> <span id="s585">And there were two brothers, Christians.</span> <span id="s586">They were Evangelics, not Ca-Catholics.</span> <span id="s587">The one was – had the bakery, he was collaborating with the partisans, so he baked bread for the partisans, and always send it, or we came down and took from him bread.</span> <span id="s588">The other brother had a little grocery store, and by the way, he was buying, it was in the fall, he was buying fruit; apples, plums [indecipherable] pears, and they made – and it – that was like a small factory, what they made from the fruit some mušt, you know, for drinking, you know, what it – how you calling –</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Cider-y –</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Cider, something like that.</span> <span id="s591">And they really was – even the – most of it went for the army.</span> <span id="s592">And in October, I came down around six o’clo – after six o’clock, and on the end of the village, because I had to go to him, to this guy for some information I needed, and I’m supposed to be there about half an hour and then go back.</span> <span id="s593">And they – on the end of the village were soldiers, German soldiers already, identification.</span> <span id="s594">So I show the identification, and he says, yeah but, this is after six o’clock, I have to te-ta-take you inside – it was a school, there is the kommandatura, to make proof that you are – so – and I went there, there was a captain, a German captain.</span> <span id="s595">And, identification ev-everything, and I – he said, what I’m doing there?</span> <span id="s596">And I said what I am doing, I am here and buying fruit with this and this guy, and they are buying this [indecipherable] for the – for mušt and for [indecipherable] for the Slovakian, the German army.</span> <span id="s597">You know what he did?</span> <span id="s598">And this guy, this Christian guy knew me, he saw me once, cause I was there one evening with two other guys, we need some information from him.</span> <span id="s599">And he let [indecipherable] this guy, he didn’t know for – what he is calling for.</span> <span id="s600">And he came in this – yeah, first of all, he ca – he asked me, the German captain if I understand German.</span> <span id="s601">And I said no.</span> <span id="s602">And he said how come y-you knew – he knows that I had German study in the school.</span> <span id="s603">And I said, yes, we had German, but it was many years ago, but usually we didn’t – there were very few conversations, so now I forgot.</span> <span id="s604">He gave a German soldier who actually was from the Sudetenland, so he spoke a little Czech.</span> <span id="s605">So he was the translator, so I had always a little – and I spoke fluently German.</span> <span id="s606">So he always – the captain ask the soldier to ask me certain question.</span> <span id="s607">So I – I had always a few seconds or a minute maybe, time to think about the answer.</span> <span id="s608">So, before the questions, he questioned me about for 15 minutes or 20 minutes or so.</span> <span id="s609">And he asked me what I am doing, so I said this guy – this guy – I am buying all on those hills fruit, and we make mušt and all the say – cider for the army.</span> <span id="s610">You know, he glad to call this guy, he came in this room.</span> <span id="s611">When he saw me he almost collapsed, because he knew actually who I am, he knew that I am with partisans.</span> <span id="s612">So he ask the following question, this guide – this guy.</span> <span id="s613">Tell me, is it true that this guy who stays here, he is buying fruit with you for the army?</span> <span id="s614">You can imagine, he says yes.</span> <span id="s615">Immediately they let him go, and he let go the notary from the city to check my papers if they are not false.</span> <span id="s616">And the notary, he is to – still, because this is the – where the partisans were, and I was staying, mostly was 85 or 90 percent not Catholic.</span> <span id="s617">They were Evangelics, Protestants.</span> <span id="s618">The notary came and the – and the commandant, the captain showed him the paper, are these really papers, are not false?</span> <span id="s619">And the notary said no, they are correct, they are hundred percent real.</span> <span id="s620">And they let him – they let me go, they told me listen, even it’s only seven o’clock, but I let you go because I told them where I live, because I cannot let you here during the night.</span> <span id="s621">And I said okay.</span> <span id="s622">It was about seven o’clock in the evening, or 7:15.</span> <span id="s623">They [indecipherable] soldier, they [indecipherable] me to the guard there, and let me go.</span> <span id="s624">A second time, it was April the 13th, 1945, I came again the same place, and they – it was in five o’clock or 4:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s625">No, I mean, I’m sorry, in the afternoon about five o’clock, I made the – because I thought that six a – after six o’clock I cannot be there.</span> <span id="s626">So he says, I still – I have to take you to the kommandatura, but in this time there’s other arm – other – I don’t know, hi-higher than a captain, I don’t know what it was.</span> <span id="s627">It was the army who actually were moving back because the front was coming, it was very close.</span> <span id="s628">You could hear the shooting and everything.</span> <span id="s629">So he took me there and he showed – and I thought – I told him that I didn’t know that I’m with all – because I lived there and there, outside, and I wanted to visit, I wanted to buy some food still, because there was no food, because there wasn’t stores, because there were places what you have no stores, nothing, five six houses, nothing else.</span> <span id="s630">So – and in – by the way, both cases, I was lucky that not the one, not the first one didn’t tell me to pull the pants down.</span> <span id="s631">I wa – I-I don’t know, it was a miracle.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: There – there were other – you – you’d heard of people being – being asked to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: I heard – I know – if heard or not, but I knew that the – the Germans all knew that we are circumcised.</span> <span id="s634">So he told me, you know what, everything is okay, but you know that six o’clock is curfew.</span> <span id="s635">You – I cannot let you go, six o’clock I’ll let you go.</span> <span id="s636">So, and I thought myself, yeah, six o’clock, but I heard the ger – Russian can be here in an hour or in a day.</span> <span id="s637">What will happen if I will stay?</span> <span id="s638">They will – I have to run away.</span> <span id="s639">They will shoot me, because they wouldn’t take me or let me go, or something like that.</span> <span id="s640">So – and I have to show you that [indecipherable] I was near a school, near where the kommandantura was, and here was – oh sorry – here was the road, and here was the building of the school.</span> <span id="s641">[inaudible] And here was a free space, about maybe five feet, about here.</span> <span id="s642">And here was the building.</span> <span id="s643">And the entrance for the building was here.</span> <span id="s644">And all the time at night, a mili – a na – German soldier, he was – he was in charge there during the night, he was walking all the time, from here to here, from here to here.</span> <span id="s645">And I heard – yeah, and they put me in a basement, it was – the windows was straight with the ground.</span> <span id="s646">And he was – I was walking, and it was about so far – no, it can’t be – like from outside to the – not even to other building, could be ma – maybe –</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: Hundred feet, maybe.</span> <span id="s648">50 yards.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: 50 yards, or ma – probably 40 yards, 50 or 40 yards from here to here.</span> <span id="s650">So I heard – when – and when he came here, you know what, the German [indecipherable] stopped, you know, his – his boots, turn around, and again.</span> <span id="s651">So when I heard –</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: This was a sentry?</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: A s – a sentry.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: A guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yeah, yeah, a guard, yeah.</span> <span id="s658">And I heard that he is turning, so I – I opened the window, because it was no –</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Bars.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: – no bars, nothing.</span> <span id="s661">I opened the window, and I took my shoes both together, and put over my shoulder, and why – and then I opened – so I heard when he is turning, so barefoot, I went – I jumped here.</span> <span id="s662">And here was a fence.</span> <span id="s663">It was about so high, with concrete.</span> <span id="s664">And then after that was like wires, you know, like –</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: Barbed wire.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Barbed – not barbed wire, not barbed wire, a fence, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Just a fence.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: A fence.</span> <span id="s669">So the whole fence was about so high.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: About five feet.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">A: Fi-Five – yeah, about five feet high.</span> <span id="s672">So I run here, I jump the fence, and run over this – the street here.</span> <span id="s673">And after the street, one – a small like a wood, wood with trees.</span> <span id="s674">And after the – after the road, about maybe 60 or 70 feet from the road was a small – not even a river, but some water was flowing, maybe – not even – maybe six or seven feet [tape break] I fell down in the water, and you know, you fall in the water, get the noise.</span> <span id="s675">And he must probably be here, because he heard that something jumped, and it was about maybe 12:30 or one o’clock after midnight.</span> <span id="s676">So he immediately started to scream, halt, halt, halt.</span> <span id="s677">And so ma – and there when I was on there, on – on the water, so I went like – like this, and through a small – it was like a small here, like about so high.</span> <span id="s678">So I jumped over it, and run in the wood, and I immediately heard the bark of the dog, and three or four more soldiers screaming halt, halt, halt.</span> <span id="s679">And the – the dog was barking.</span> <span id="s680">And I thought they were running this way, and when the dog went to my steps, and he came to the water, he lost –</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Lost the trail.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Th-That – the –</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: The scent.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: The scent, yeah.</span> <span id="s685">So this was – I was lucky, because otherwise they would go after me.</span> <span id="s686">So they didn’t know – because it – it was wood, and usually the German was very afraid to go into woods.</span> <span id="s687">That’s why the partisans survived, because they stayed in wood.</span> <span id="s688">So maybe there were three or four, th-they didn’t know what’s next to it.</span> <span id="s689">So that’s – I was lucky, it took me about two hours til I went back to the woods because I know the – the trip.</span> <span id="s690">Ti – I went back to my ba – to my battalion, or how to call it.</span> <span id="s691">And there in – there in – and they were Russians, they were a – we were in this, a battalion about 140 people.</span> <span id="s692">And we were – even they be – knew they didn’t trust me, they don’t even to shot me.</span> <span id="s693">The Russians, who knew my name, because they told me that I was suspicion that I am a spy because I was with the German.</span> <span id="s694">I supposed to come back in the evening, so I must be a spy and so on.</span> <span id="s695">And it took me til they get drunk, and I had to drink with them.</span> <span id="s696">And you know, they used to burn, to make their own alcohol there – in there.</span> <span id="s697">It was so strong, and it was stinking, not smelling, stinking.</span> <span id="s698">So and ha – then in the – in the – and I had to drink with them.</span> <span id="s699">So they were half drunk, so I was – took wi – you know, put like – like behind my throat you know, but something still went down on my throat, and you – for days and days I couldn’t feel if I eat bread, or if I eat meat, because all my thing was so burned that I didn’t feel appetite, nothing.</span> <span id="s700">And then in the – early in the morning, suddenly – and more drinking, was drinking, suddenly the guard came immediately, because the Russian are close, so then the Russian – and the German was running back.</span> <span id="s701">So the Russian – the Russian army circled us and the ru – and the German m-m-militar – the German soldiers, too.</span> <span id="s702">So actually, we were s –liberated, the partisans and the German soldiers –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Were surrounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: – were surrounded by the Russian.</span> <span id="s705">And then was – what’s happened, I went down to the village, and the Russian, the carriages were coming.</span> <span id="s706">You know, Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s707">And I was standing there and looking and looking, and suddenly they stopped.</span> <span id="s708">In the one carriage was two solders.</span> <span id="s709">And I am looking, looking, and I saw a familiar face.</span> <span id="s710">You wouldn’t believe that it’s true what I am saying.</span> <span id="s711">And I say – and the guy starts looking at me, I am looking at him, and I said, in Russian, because I spoke fluently Russian, was with the Russian seven months.</span> <span id="s712">I said, are you Ambil(ph)?</span> <span id="s713">He says, da.</span> <span id="s714">I says me too, I say yeah.</span> <span id="s715">He jumped up from the carriage, the people were – they were civilian people and the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s716">They were looking, we were hugging, crying, like little – like children.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: So who was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: He was a guy from our city.</span> <span id="s719">I went together to school with him.</span> <span id="s720">His father was a tailor, very poor people.</span> <span id="s721">And he escaped in 1939 – 1940, because their family were very communists.</span> <span id="s722">He escaped to Poland, he gets to Russia, he went to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s723">He was fighting for three and a half years in the Russian army, and can you imagine that he came ri – this – no, no, no, it was later what I am talking.</span> <span id="s724">No, because – oh, I am talk – he escaped in 1940 – four – when we were in labor camp together.</span> <span id="s725">And he fa – escaped from labor camp.</span> <span id="s726">He went to Poland, to Russia, to the Russian army.</span> <span id="s727">And then – meanwhile, we didn’t see each other after that, because he went farther with the Russians.</span> <span id="s728">In 19 – what was it, what – 1987 or ’88, we had a reunion in Israel from the Sixth Battalion labor camp, and he was there, and we met after – after almost 50 years we met in Israel.</span> <span id="s729">And he was very sick, he had cancer.</span> <span id="s730">And after two days or three days – he – he lived in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s731">And he had to leave Israel earlier, that was the whole reunion, because he stayed about for a week.</span> <span id="s732">And just about four or five years ago, he died.</span> <span id="s733">And his name was – he had the other name, whatever, his really Jewish name was Emil(ph) Furst(ph).</span> <span id="s734">And here – and here – and he wrote some books.</span> <span id="s735">He wrote a book about [indecipherable], about our battalion.</span> <span id="s736">I have the book somewhere.</span> <span id="s737">[inaudible].</span> <span id="s738">So, it’s a other story what I didn’t tell there.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: This was the first time you’d seen anybody from home in –</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: No, after the war – after the war I met some people who are from –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: I mean, when you s – when – he was the first you saw when he was on the truck and – and you had just –</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: Yeah, he was the first one who I saw, a familiar face.</span> <span id="s743">It was April the 14th, 1945, a day actually when I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: So – a-and you were liberated in Krainey(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Krainey(ph), yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s747">Q: U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic.</span> <span id="s748">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s749">You were –</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I think – I think this story is valuable too.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: You were liberated from the – from the labor camp – from the labor camp, you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: From the labor camp they let us go, after two years, they let us go –</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: [indecipherable] 1942</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: 1942 March.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: When you came t – when you came back home in 1942, in March, di-did – did you know that – were they starting to deport people then, in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Immediately, immediately in 1942, in April [indecipherable] and my brother was one of the first transport to an – to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s757">That the – the first people were – they started to take, like I mentioned, the young people, and the single people.</span> <span id="s758">It started in March, April 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Now wh-when you came home, I – they must have been thrilled to see you, right?</span> <span id="s760">You hadn’t – you hadn’t corresponded very much.</span> <span id="s761">What happened when you came home?</span> <span id="s762">What was it like coming back to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: I no – I knew that I came home to uncertainty.</span> <span id="s764">And I was thinking if it wouldn’t be better if I would stay in labor camp, because other people – I came with the first people who took to labor camp in 1941.</span> <span id="s765">The second time what they stayed – took the young people in labor camp, it was in 1941.</span> <span id="s766">So those people stayed til 1943, two re – two years.</span> <span id="s767">Some – some disappeared, some got the – then we saw already, we knew that – what’s happening actually.</span> <span id="s768">Some people escaped from labor camp.</span> <span id="s769">Some people still stayed here and there.</span> <span id="s770">Some people were in hiding, some pe – different ways, so disappeared, actually, the – the sixth battalion, in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: But your mother was still home when you came home?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Yeah, we – she was still home til 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: So what was that like once you saw your mother after two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: I was – I was, I think once or twice for two years – for – in the two years what I went home for a few days.</span> <span id="s775">Like they let me, for a day or two, get a little – especially when they were close in Chermedly(ph), because this was about only 25 miles from Michalovce.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Was there a Judenrat?</span> <span id="s777">Jewish council?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Yeah, in Michalovce [indecipherable] even I think when the still ta – started the con – to take the concentration camp, was like a Judenrat, and even the name of the president [indecipherable] was Mr. Lang(ph).</span> <span id="s779">And even my father, because my father was, before the war, very much involved in Jewish – in Jewish, like organizations.</span> <span id="s780">And even he was, I think at the beginning, he was a member of the yood – the Jewish – the Judenrat there, in 1940 – 1940 - ’41.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">Q: Th-The Jew-Jewish organizations, were they al – they were organizations then in [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: [indecipherable] Zionist organization was the Hashomer Hatzair, was the Betar, and was Mizrachi.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Was there a Maccabee as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Maccabee as well, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did you belong to any of these?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I belonged to – to the Mizrachi one, wa – one time, and then to the Hashomer Hatzair, but I belonged to mostly – it was ret – I don’t remember exactly the name, it was like a sport organization.</span> <span id="s787">And we had our soccer club, that’s what – what – what I – where I belong.</span> <span id="s788">But it was still only a Jewish club.</span> <span id="s789">And we played some games like [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: And di-did those continue even during the – during the –</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: During the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: [indecipherable] ’46?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Da – yeah, no, as soon as they started the Slovak Republic actually, especially as – a second [indecipherable] out, and second, it was dangerous, because they said all Jewish organizations are Bolsheviks.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q: D-Do you remember the name Alex-Alexander Pressberger(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Yeah, the familiar – fa-familiar fa – some – in charge of some –</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: In Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yeah, something.</span> <span id="s798">But I never met him or – I heard about him.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: What about the organization called Prukopna(ph) Skupina?</span> <span id="s800">Prukopna Skupina.</span> <span id="s801">The –</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: In Slovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: In Slovakia.</span> <span id="s804">The Jewish organization.</span> <span id="s805">The working – working group.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: The [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yeah, Pratsovna(ph).</span> <span id="s809">Práca na Skupina(ph), yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Do you – did you know anything about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: Well, I heard that they existed, but I – I never le – was connection, or I never needed from them and asked them.</span> <span id="s812">But I heard of Pratsovna(ph) because in Slovak you pronounce it Pratsovna(ph), not Práca, that’s a – that’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: So what about ra – Rabbi Weisman, had you heard of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Dov – Dov ra Weisman – Weisman, Rabbi Weisman, also of Bratislava, so [indecipherable] from the other side of the country</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: You – you said you went into hiding –</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Actually – actually I went in hiding actually from after – immediately after I came home from labor camp, til 1944, til we relocated to Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: How did that work?</span> <span id="s820">How did you find places that you hid – hiding in attics and in basements, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Attics.</span> <span id="s822">Even at home I was upstairs, you know, in the attics, and it was – again, you couldn’t see that it – because it’s very slow – very low it was, so you hardly can stay there.</span> <span id="s823">And there I was hiding many times.</span> <span id="s824">But I mentioned with Alfred Salzman(ph), because he was a neighbor, and we saw, during a small window for example, at – early in the morning, or at two o’clock in the – a-after midnight, the guardists that came after me, looking for me.</span> <span id="s825">And I was hiding over there and they were standing and looking around all over, and looking for me.</span> <span id="s826">And you can – you can feel it, how it wer – my feeling, I was chittering, you know.</span> <span id="s827">And then we stayed for example, even in wintertime for many days and nights.</span> <span id="s828">And secretly they brought us early in the night, some food or something like that.</span> <span id="s829">And then from the other side it was hay, you know?</span> <span id="s830">So we were hiding inside, in the hay.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: They came to look for you specifically –</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Specifically, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: [indecipherable] you weren’t registered.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: They – in this time they knew that – they knew alrea – and a – in this time, after ’42 - ’43, they knew that people were thrown from labor camp.</span> <span id="s835">And you know the Christian neighbors, they rented – you didn’t have to register, because the Christian neighbors, they [inaudible], yeah, like our – our neighbor, like I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: It was just the one neighbor.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s839">So sometimes you would run from one place to another?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah, outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: So you wouldn’t hide in – in the barns, or just randomly?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Randomly in his hou – in his basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: In ju – du – in his basement, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Or in the attic there in our house.</span> <span id="s845">Because this was a separate building, not to our house, a separate building, and we had that for the – what we need for our kettles or something like that, la – like a magazine.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: And it was small, and it was a smaller, like hiding place, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Ha-Had you – at this point had you heard of Sered?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: What did you hear about that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: That is a concentration for Jews in Sered and Nováky, and actually, in Sered, I think, or in Nováky was a hospital where they st – kept some – all the Jews, some sick Jews, til they realized it, then they sent them anyhow to concentration camp, or some died there in Sered or in Nováky.</span> <span id="s852">But this was like a camp where they were holding the – the people who later were sent anyhow.</span> <span id="s853">So we knew about Sered and Nováky, that’s what I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: And what – and the – tell me about when your – when your father decided your mother should go to U-Uzhhorod, which is also Ungvár.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: How did that – how did that decision affect you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: Very hard, because we never knew – we knew what had happened and my father still believed that something will happen, some miracle, and they will – and they will let us be, or they will – they will – somehow he will save us.</span> <span id="s858">And then he said, in the – when he thought were really bad [indecipherable] then we will go to Hungary too.</span> <span id="s859">But with – with this time, what – we saw what’s happening then in Hungary, we couldn’t go because it was all the same danger, like in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s860">And then we heard that they remove anyhow, all the Jews to a safer place in western Slovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Di-Did you hear The-Theresienstadt as well?</span> <span id="s862">Has anybody said –</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: Later on, later – because in this time when we heard from Auschwitz and we from concentration camp, we heard il – some far – someone called us that our brother died in – in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s864">So we heard that are concentration camp, but was in later, in 1944 or something like that.</span> <span id="s865">And by the way, this like, is not hear because I – I don’t know if you want to put on tape.</span> <span id="s866">About four years ago, my wife said – alee – that we are reading the – we are receiving a Czech newspaper, it comes from New York, what are news from Czechoslovakia and so on.</span> <span id="s867">And one day we saw a article there that some Jews who are even outside Czechoslovakia and who can prove that they were in concentration camp, or in the army with th-the Russians always there, England.</span> <span id="s868">They can get some compensation, because the Germans sent some money to the Czech re – Czechoslovakia, and it will be like some compensation because they were in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s869">So my wife said, look, maybe – and she was – she was very fluent in Czech corresponding as a – because she was a clerk in Czechoslovakia – and by the way, we have a Czech typewriter.</span> <span id="s870">I don’t know how it happened, but we bought away from a – during a friend or so on, we had the Czech writer, because the alphabet in Czech is a little different.</span> <span id="s871">So she says, you know what?</span> <span id="s872">I will try to write application for some people.</span> <span id="s873">Maybe they will get.</span> <span id="s874">And I do – I thou – I mentioned to my brother-in-law, and he said to a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s875">So we wrote application, and really was happen, and we had t-to write the first application to the Ministry of Defense.</span> <span id="s876">They will prove – they could prove if you have – that you were like persecuted in a labor camp.</span> <span id="s877">And then they give a paper, so-called law number 255.</span> <span id="s878">This is a law, a Czechoslovak law what recognized that you were persecuted, and you were eligible in certain advantages.</span> <span id="s879">For example, like I have the 255, I – and I get because I worked in Czechoslovakia more than 25 years, I have pension, because I am eligible on normal pension.</span> <span id="s880">And I’m better, if I get the normal pension, that I will get compensation through the Germans.</span> <span id="s881">So we wrote them, and I received the 255, and then we made the application for the Czechoslovak Social Security, because they give the money.</span> <span id="s882">And th-that proved tha-that he was persecuted and were receiving the money.</span> <span id="s883">And in the pens – you have to have a affidavit from a doctor that he has certain illnesses, and he has – he has invalidity, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 – and he gets certain amount of money.</span> <span id="s884">And we have about five people already.</span> <span id="s885">And some get 35 dollars a month, some get 60 dollars a month.</span> <span id="s886">And in one occasion he get 110 dollars a month, and were received through backwards for half a year, or year, or th-th – thousand dollars, or 1200 dollars, besides what – and they receiving every month, even today.</span> <span id="s887">So – and I needed addresses for certain concentration camp, because you have to prove that th-they were in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s888">So I went here, to the Holocaust Museum, and get out maybe 30 or 26 addresses, even from small concentration camps.</span> <span id="s889">And what the people told us, there were this concentration camp, this cencontra – well, from the [indecipherable] from the concentration camp, they were sent to work in a factory.</span> <span id="s890">The factory actually received people to work from the sod – concentration camp.</span> <span id="s891">It was for a hundred people, 150 people.</span> <span id="s892">So I went there into the da – and suddenly, when these people received the money, he said – the one friend told to the other friend you wouldn’t believe, we are almost 50 people, what we made applications from – beside that, two years ago came new laws in Czechoslovakia, so it’s more complicated.</span> <span id="s893">You need more proof, more papers.</span> <span id="s894">So I went to the library in the Holocaust Museum, I took all the addresses, because we had to write to all those concentration camp.</span> <span id="s895">We write in Polish, we write in English, we write in German.</span> <span id="s896">And to the international cross in Arles, and in all over.</span> <span id="s897">And all the peoples are coming, so there are proof there were some da – and I’ll have to translate from English to Czech, from German to Czech, from Polish to Czech, from Russian to Czech and I am doing all these things, and I have – I’m translating.</span> <span id="s898">I am going to notarize my signature that I translated.</span> <span id="s899">So you cannot imagine what a work, what we would – if you – if you would know that it takes so long, we wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s900">And you know what, we don’t take money from those people, and we are doing this free.</span> <span id="s901">Some people when they receive the paper gave us, I don’t know, they gave us 20 dollars or so, or nothing, we don’t ask the money, because they see how much work it has.</span> <span id="s902">So what I wanted to say, I went to the con – to the labor – to the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s903">Suddenly I saw a thick two books.</span> <span id="s904">And I saw people – can you stop for a moment?</span> <span id="s905">I bring you to show you something.</span> <span id="s906">[break] It runs?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: So, actually, I can be very grateful and thankful for all those people, to my wife, because it was her idea, and s-she makes the lot, a lot of work.</span> <span id="s909">She spends hours, hours of her free time with all those papers and everything.</span> <span id="s910">And so I went to the Holocaust Museum, and in there find two books, and that’s what the book says.</span> <span id="s911">You can read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: [indecipherable] from Auschwitz</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Yes, in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: – fragmented death books from Auschwitz, remnants, edited by Vidacza(ph) from the state museum at Auschwitz at Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: And here you know what?</span> <span id="s916">There I find the name of my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s918">Judikovic, Des – Deseter(ph)</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s920">That’s – this is the date when he was born, and there he died.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Born on April 4th, 1924, Michalovce –</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: – and died on July 6th, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: And I went to ma – a rabbi, and he wrote me down when I have [indecipherable] right after –</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: The 21st [indecipherable] 5702.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: So there you see the feeling what I had, and I said to myself, all those work what we are doing, it was worth it that I went there because this is something – you cannot imagine what it means to us.</span> <span id="s927">What – what – what – what the – suddenly, it happens that we had to make this, otherwise I wouldn’t go to look for addresses or something.</span> <span id="s928">I was in the Holocaust Museum many times, but the – I would go to look for something, and this a – I went there, and this what I found.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: What does it do for you, to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s931">Because at least – and for my sister too, because they knew at least – because we had different stories, he died there, he went there.</span> <span id="s932">And now we know exactly what happened to him.</span> <span id="s933">At least we know that he didn’t suffer two or three years there.</span> <span id="s934">And I know, for example, my father, you know ma – I-I didn’t say when, my father – it happened when my father they took to concentration camp from Nova Nestu(ph) like I told you, it was in October, and I met some guy from our city, who went with the same transport from Sered to Auschwitz with him, but he was a tall guy, he was much younger, he survived.</span> <span id="s935">Co – and I met him, and he saw my father when Mengele sent him to the left, immediately, in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s936">He saw – he – he said it was few, maybe 20 or 25 people in front of me.</span> <span id="s937">But he survived because he was a strong guy, he was four – in the 40s or so, so he went – they put him the – to go to work.</span> <span id="s938">He – then he came to United States this guy, and I met him, he wa – when I came to United States here, but he died already.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: What happened to your other sister?</span> <span id="s940">One sister –</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: Yeah, Lola – Lola, she wa – went from Hungary together she went with my mother to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s942">She went to Auschwitz, she was in Dresden, she was in – what do you call that – not in Poland.</span> <span id="s943">I was in – visiting there, because I was in Auschwitz twice, and I was – Stutthof, she went to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s944">I was there, and I look the concentration camp, but it’s nothing left, only – only the – the oven is there and some grounds where the barracks were standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: And you had another sister, who your father managed to get –</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Oh, she se – she – she [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Tell – tell me about that, th-the –</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: She has – she get married in –</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: But she became a nanny, you said.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: No, no, th-this was – this was the other sister, the – what she doesn’t want to talk about, because she was a nanny, and then she disappeared from there.</span> <span id="s951">Either they caught her and I don’t – she – I tell you the truth, I really not mean on my other sister, nobody knows exactly what happened to her, because she says, please, don’t talk to me about.</span> <span id="s952">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Okay, but you – but you saw her once during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: Yeah, but it was in – immediately when my father – that where was – she was a nanny, but then I didn’t see her any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: You said in – when you talked to them, people in the museum, you said that you saw her in the street, she had a stroke –</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: Yeah, but that – that – that was in October.</span> <span id="s957">From this time then, I didn’t see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: But – and you said that this was an example of a feeling of a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: What – what kind of feeling was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: That the – the feeling was in this moment that maybe we’ll see each other the last time.</span> <span id="s962">So, what can I say, a feeling is.</span> <span id="s963">I said, I – I remember I thought to myself, I would like to know if we would know at least if someone for us – from our – both of us will survive.</span> <span id="s964">What can I – because I saw – in this time I saw th-the – the other situation there.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Did you have that feeling at other times?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: During the war, many times.</span> <span id="s967">Like a – I – I never thought that I will see someone from my family again, or if they – someone will survive, if they will see me.</span> <span id="s968">Because actually, especially when I was [indecipherable], people were dying next to me.</span> <span id="s969">I was only the lucky one that I survived.</span> <span id="s970">Or, for 17 days in wintertime, in January, we didn’t have food, we didn’t have what to eat.</span> <span id="s971">So – and we were hiding, we were – we lived on the – in the woods, and it was the pa – the trees, you know, under the trees, was free place around, was snow.</span> <span id="s972">So we were sleeping under the trees where the snow was blown out.</span> <span id="s973">And we had a ration of so-called bread, but actually it was crumb from dark, black bread, because it was old bread, it was in – smelled with – the whole thing.</span> <span id="s974">So we received a cup of the old bread, because you couldn’t slice it, it was crumbs only, it was so old.</span> <span id="s975">So that cup of this crumbs, so-called went for two or three days.</span> <span id="s976">That’s – that’s all, and water – instead of water we ate snow, for 17 days because we are – we were circummed –</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Surrounded.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Circumround.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Surrounded, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: We could – we couldn’t move out because the Germans, so this is the other part of that.</span> <span id="s981">So I never was thinking that I will survive if I will – if I will survive for the next hour, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Do you remember the last time you saw your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">A: When she left from Hungary to us in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: What – what did you say to her?</span> <span id="s985">Did you say anything to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Yeah, in this time we were saw that we will come after you, we will see each other and [indecipherable] back, will come back.</span> <span id="s987">You know, it was hard, we were crying and so it, you know, we leave then – with some member of the family are leaving – leaving you, it was uncertainty.</span> <span id="s988">You don’t know what’s happened to you, what’s happened to her.</span> <span id="s989">It was hard, it was hard every day to be with her.</span> <span id="s990">She don a – and you have a household, and you don’t have a mother.</span> <span id="s991">So, it wa – it was hard for my father too, it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: It must have been very difficult for your father when your mother left.</span> <span id="s993">So who – who was left at home, just you and your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: Me, my father and the sister, you know, who – already who doesn’t want to talk about.</span> <span id="s995">And actually, she was in this time about 15 years old, and she was holding, or keeping the whole – whole household, cooking and washing and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So he tried to take care of each of you, he got – he took care of your mother and your sister –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: – and he was trying to take care of Heddy as well.</span> <span id="s999">He got her a place someplace.</span> <span id="s1000">After they left, tell me th – tell me then what happened next, in 1943.</span> <span id="s1001">You – you went into hiding then with your father –</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: Ah, because I was a – yeah, my – our – our father too.</span> <span id="s1003">But still, my – we had til the – in this time certain ti – certain times, like permission to stay, but actually it was only for my father.</span> <span id="s1004">It says that for the family, but you can never guarantee because they were – first of all, all the time, even later years, in ’42 - ’43, after young people, because they know – they needed for work.</span> <span id="s1005">If someone was working there around vaca – concentration camp for one year, it don’t – they didn’t care if survive or not survives.</span> <span id="s1006">So – especially when someone came concentration camp, for example, women with children.</span> <span id="s1007">Women were better when they came in concentration camp by theirselves.</span> <span id="s1008">But you know how it was, every mother goes with their children because they immediate – in Auschwitz they divided the men separate, and women with children a – separate women by itself.</span> <span id="s1009">So they saw a woman with children, they immediately sent to the oven.</span> <span id="s1010">So, it was – and then women realized, even it was heartbreaking, so they let the children, separate the children, and they survived, because they didn’t go with the children, otherwise they would go to the chimney – to the oven, too.</span> <span id="s1011">So the children – anyhow, very few survived.</span> <span id="s1012">And my sister [indecipherable] was here.</span> <span id="s1013">She went from Hungary to concentration camp and she was lucky, because she went with some cousins.</span> <span id="s1014">And she was, in this time she was 14 and a half years old.</span> <span id="s1015">And so the women were – they were – the SS came many times to look for children, so they were hiding her in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1016">And they were – they were so malnutritious they don’t – didn’t have any food, so other women brought pieces of bread only to get here to give her, or I don’t know, if they found something, a little milk or something.</span> <span id="s1017">And she wa – but she was her – she was lucky that she was always – her – her – her body, her looks, more older than she was, actually.</span> <span id="s1018">Even today, she is tall – taller.</span> <span id="s1019">So that – and she went to work, she was working with the other women in [indecipherable] manufacture, hard working.</span> <span id="s1020">And many times other women, especial the cousins, took the hard work instead of her because they worked, for example in [indecipherable] to do certain amount of work, and she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1021">So the other people were – even when they know that they’re going – looking for children or for something.</span> <span id="s1022">Or even so to look around, they didn’t see her.</span> <span id="s1023">So they were hiding her in concentration, many time.</span> <span id="s1024">And like I’m saying, they bought certain food for her, that she survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: Wha – wa – while you were in hiding, you – you – you didn’t go to any more labor camps, you weren’t caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: No, no, and I never came out – that was only from four – 1940 to 1942.</span> <span id="s1027">If I would go in a labor camp, or if someone, for example to Nováky or to some people they took there, and they were working, they were standing there, they were staying in no – Nováky, they were working there for weeks and months.</span> <span id="s1028">Then – but they – they sent them anyhow to concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: But you were separated from your father, and he went to Sered.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: Yeah, th – but no, th – I was separated mainly after they caught him in October then in 1944, then we were separated.</span> <span id="s1031">Even before I was few days in beginning of – in the end of September and the beginning October, I was actually the partisans already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Tell me how you ma – hooked up with the partisans.</span> <span id="s1033">How did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I went to – normally I wa – I made the – I-I didn’t want – I want to be a free country, I want to be help, to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s1035">And this time the – when I came to the first partisan, most of the people were Slovaks.</span> <span id="s1036">It was about 75 or 80 people, and there were about maybe 10 or re – 12 Russians.</span> <span id="s1037">And they were Russians who either escaped from labor camp, or escaped from the [indecipherable] some out from the army or so.</span> <span id="s1038">So – and then later on, actually these Russians, because mostly about six or seven of them were officers.</span> <span id="s1039">So then, they made a special battalion and other Russians started to come, because actually – and when the uprising came in August 1944 to Banská Bystrica, the Russian sent some Russian people to help for alph – uprising.</span> <span id="s1040">So actually many Russian people then stayed there, even the Russian army told them to stay there and help through the uprising.</span> <span id="s1041">So hundred and hundred of Russian people stayed there in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1042">So that’s where I get there in – sometime November or so, with the Russian.</span> <span id="s1043">But you know, with the partisans in this time were so – we were, for example, one battalion.</span> <span id="s1044">And suddenly we were in fighting with the German and they were – we were overpowered.</span> <span id="s1045">So suddenly, like we disappeared, 10 people here, three people there, 40 people there.</span> <span id="s1046">So it took time, even weeks sometimes to get put together again.</span> <span id="s1047">Sometime it happened that, for example [indecipherable] occasion sometimes in December, I was with about 16 or 18 people.</span> <span id="s1048">We were wandering about for three weeks, til we find the other bigger – larger group.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Q: How did you find them to begin with?</span> <span id="s1050">They were in – they were in the forest, in yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: In the forest, in the woods, they’re all over there.</span> <span id="s1052">And then they used to come to the small, you know, like [indecipherable] to the houses, what was separate, six, eight houses.</span> <span id="s1053">And those people were always helping the partisans, because those were mostly all Protestants, not Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: And these were Slovakian partisans at first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: So you joined the partisans.</span> <span id="s1057">Do you get a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">A: Oh yeah, automatic pistol.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: So you – you didn’t – you – were you – what – what was it like the first time you went into some sort of combat with the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: Frightening.</span> <span id="s1061">I remember the first time I had the shooting, I’m telling you, you couldn’t cut my – couldn’t cut [indecipherable] in my – my body.</span> <span id="s1062">It was frightening, but you know, in this time, actually, when you live this kind of life, you don’t later on, believe me, you don’t think about living and dying.</span> <span id="s1063">You forgot.</span> <span id="s1064">You are – you’re – you’re – End of Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: – continuation of a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic.</span> <span id="s1067">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1068">Did you think about that when you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: You mean whe – you mean – oh, here and there I thought it would be nice to survive, but I said I – many times I thought to myself, what if – how it will if I survive, and nobody from my family?</span> <span id="s1070">Because in this time I knew very well what’s going on in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1071">So thi – by the time – and it was – I even met in January, or in February, two Russian guys who escaped from a concentration camp in Poland.</span> <span id="s1072">Because mary – many Russian soldiers were in concent – labor camps and in concent – even concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1073">They were separate like other – like, for example, from Jews.</span> <span id="s1074">And they came, I talked to them about – maybe for 10 minutes or so.</span> <span id="s1075">It was – it was winter in 1945, I remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1076">Then – because the Russian – the Russian kommandatura, what we had there, they sent them back, they disappeared, I don’t know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Among the partisans – was there any anti-Semitism among the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Oh yeah, very much so.</span> <span id="s1079">Especially from the Russians.</span> <span id="s1080">And I had, for example, when I was – the last few weeks what I was with the partisans, especially I think I mentioned there in the thing, I was a captain, a Russian, his name was Mosalchuk(ph) or something like that.</span> <span id="s1081">He was – he must be a white Russian like we used to say [indecipherable] anti-Semitic, and later on, I f – I feel sorry, I mean, it was a captain, and I thought always that he must be Jewish, because he was all the time so nice to me.</span> <span id="s1082">And he – maybe he was suspicious.</span> <span id="s1083">He knows me – he knew me [indecipherable] call, you know, I – short name for Uri.</span> <span id="s1084">And I was afraid this time you know, because I didn’t trust much the Russians, because I saw what they are doing, even on their own people, even with their partisans.</span> <span id="s1085">If something was – say they did something wrong, he didn’t hesitate, he shot him.</span> <span id="s1086">He didn’t hesitate.</span> <span id="s1087">He [indecipherable] probably drunk or something, or he didn’t do right what he’s supposed to do.</span> <span id="s1088">He didn’t take a shot – take – shot him, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1089">And so I thought that he was Jewish, and he maybe thought – and I said to myself, no, after the war, I return.</span> <span id="s1090">But I lost sight of him about a week before we were liberated, and I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1091">Never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1092">He got lost somewhere, it was about a week or 10 days, some time end of March.</span> <span id="s1093">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: How did the – how did the anti-Semitism manifest itself?</span> <span id="s1095">I mean, what did th – what did they do, just –</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: Oh, well, ma-many times he said to – oh those Jews, you know, yahvrai(ph), yahvrai(ph), yahvrai(ph).</span> <span id="s1097">Even he didn’t mind nothing, yeah, he was drunk, or na – he was hard drunk, he was – all – all the Jews, for example, he said, sitting at home, and we have to fight.</span> <span id="s1098">So bet-between discussions or something like that.</span> <span id="s1099">Oh, here and there, heard the ra – the name, yahvrai(ph), yahvrai(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: And it was different from day to day, I mean, did the – did you get –</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: No, it was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1102">No, it was occasional.</span> <span id="s1103">It wasn’t like day to day, not at all.</span> <span id="s1104">But still, you could feel some that – you know how it is, you are betwee – the su – you don’t have to listen to words, you can – you have to feel it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: And – and as a – as a fighter, was it – did you have specific assignments?</span> <span id="s1106">Did you attack trains, did you attack soldiers?</span> <span id="s1107">Did you –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: I was involved in one train attack, but if you put only mines, we go – went down, we put only mines, and then it was like for timing, you know.</span> <span id="s1109">So we were far away to the timing, because we knew the train will come, about in four or five hours.</span> <span id="s1110">But they – and they can displace wa – no personal trains, only – what – how did that –</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Military trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Not only military.</span> <span id="s1115">For example, trains that were for – for sending supplies</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: Mater – material, so – so we had to go back, we had to go far away, but we knew that it was the – the rail was damaged.</span> <span id="s1118">It was [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1119">And most of the time what we were fighting, we were actually all the time moving.</span> <span id="s1120">To tell you the truth, most of the time we tried not to be involved in the fight with them, because most of the time they were – we were – we overpowered, because they – we were, for example, 60 people or a hundred people, they were a few hundred.</span> <span id="s1121">And they had heavy armament we didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1122">We had some machine guns, th-the light machine guns.</span> <span id="s1123">Maybe one time we had, one or two, the heavy machine guns.</span> <span id="s1124">But we lost, for example, in a fight.</span> <span id="s1125">We have dead bodies that are – so, it was hard.</span> <span id="s1126">Sometimes we regret that we have even only rifles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Were there other Jews in the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No.</span> <span id="s1129">I had the one time it was sometime – this is another story.</span> <span id="s1130">Some times in November, it was a Jewish guy whom I knew from home.</span> <span id="s1131">He was in a city not far from Michalovce, Medzilaborce, and his father was a pharmacist.</span> <span id="s1132">And he was with me like a partisan, and we were in a fight sometimes in end November or December.</span> <span id="s1133">And he was like so far like from here to the TV.</span> <span id="s1134">And he got a bullet here straight in the chest.</span> <span id="s1135">And I don’t know how you call this bullet.</span> <span id="s1136">This was a bullet what took apart your body.</span> <span id="s1137">And he was in – died next to me, I saw he wa – and usually, when someone died, even it was a German or a Russian or a – or a Slovak or so, usually, especially it was close to a village or so, and they knew already they went, because the people used to go to the forest there and so they saw some dead people, so they buried them.</span> <span id="s1138">They buried them there, or they took them to the cemetery.</span> <span id="s1139">Anyhow, so I don’t know here – where he was buried.</span> <span id="s1140">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1141">Life you know, the – the li – the human life is so unpredictable.</span> <span id="s1142">And in 1946, I met his sister, she survived the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1143">She was a year younger than he was.</span> <span id="s1144">And it was hard for me, and I met her in – in Prague.</span> <span id="s1145">And she somehow – I don’t know if she knew us, we were talking and talking, and then we were talking about the brother.</span> <span id="s1146">And he was – she was really suspicious that I knew about him, or she [indecipherable] us.</span> <span id="s1147">And then I told him, you know, Vera, I was with your brother during the war.</span> <span id="s1148">And she hold my hand and she says, Mitu(ph), tell me what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1149">I couldn’t talk for a moment.</span> <span id="s1150">And I told her, you know, I am sad to tell you, that in November 1944 he was hurt and he died like a partisan.</span> <span id="s1151">She hugged me.</span> <span id="s1152">And that was in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1153">We were crying.</span> <span id="s1154">Can you tell me where he is buried?</span> <span id="s1155">And I told her, Vera, I am sorry to tell you that I cannot tell you, because I know it was in the forest, it was like out of the forest, it was like a free space, but usually the people were – are buried, those people, I cannot tell you, but I know it was about 10 kilometers from Kleiner(ph), 12 kilometers.</span> <span id="s1156">But I ge – well, it was very hard.</span> <span id="s1157">And the next year, in 1947, I think she moved there to Australia.</span> <span id="s1158">And I don’t know what happened to – then with her, she – I don’t – she got married there.</span> <span id="s1159">So tha-that’s was the other story, sad story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1162">Maybe some people, if someone would – I would meet, or someone would – someone come along from Medzilaborce, they will remember the name for sure.</span> <span id="s1163">Because there in Medzilaborce, this is a – a smaller city than Michalovce, but was some Jews, maybe sa – some hundred Jews for sure.</span> <span id="s1164">Very religious city, it was, a very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s1165">It was opposite like in Michalovce I think there were more Orthodox like [indecipherable] everything for Ashkenazi or something.</span> <span id="s1166">You know, this is how to – you know, can’t remember everything, ever what’s happened.</span> <span id="s1167">For example, just few days ago, I don’t know, we were talking about with my sister, and she mo – she mentioned someone who survived, and we were together in 1947 or ’48.</span> <span id="s1168">And I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1169">I long time never even remember that he survived.</span> <span id="s1170">And we were talking also someone, so, you know, I’m still wondering, you know, I still think it’s a plus, and I feel til tod – til today, 52 years af-after the war, 55 years or somewhat, and I still remember so – little things I saw.</span> <span id="s1171">Things what – it’s better maybe fo – I will forget, but I – it cannot be forgotten because this what you are doing, this is for generation, generation, we are – can be only grateful that it will stay somewhere.</span> <span id="s1172">And some people, in 50 years, a hundred years will take a look and listen to this what happened.</span> <span id="s1173">Because otherwise, even today, people don’t believe that something like that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: This may be a good place to stop for now.</span> <span id="s1175">I’d like to talk to you again, about after the war.</span> <span id="s1176">But maybe we could stop for now, and then I’ll – I’ll come back and we’ll talk some more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: This is a other story.</span> <span id="s1178">If a – if I – you know, I – I mentioned to you how I became to – to this country.</span> <span id="s1179">What – to – to – to what we go – went down.</span> <span id="s1180">You know, that the other border from Slovakia to Hungary only, you wouldn’t believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1182">We – we’ll – we’ll set up a time and come back soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: Okay, give me a call any time.</span> <span id="s1184">And see two and a half – because it’s still a long time and with no question, all this – this what we went through, not only myself, all those people, it left on your brain even mentally.</span> <span id="s1185">In normal circumstances, I would remember more about the war, or knew about, but it was so many things that happened, that you don’t know what’s important, what’s not important, if you remember.</span> <span id="s1186">Now it came to my mind maybe in a year or so, or so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: D-Do you think about some of these things regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Oh many times.</span> <span id="s1189">And you know, after the – after the war, it was a nightmare.</span> <span id="s1190">It wasn’t one night that I didn’t dream that I’m again in [indecipherable] in the labor camp, that I am caught by the German.</span> <span id="s1191">That all – now I saw my father, he came fr – home from labor camp, I saw.</span> <span id="s1192">It was night of the night.</span> <span id="s1193">Even when we came – when we escape from Czechoslovakia, you cannot imagine how many times I had the dreams, oh they caught me on the border, oh I am again in jail, or something.</span> <span id="s1194">And you wake up, you are wet, sweating.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Not – not now, but – now very seldom, but still it did very – happen.</span> <span id="s1197">Just about a week or two weeks ago, you know, when I told to my wife, you know that we were together again in the Auschwitz museum, because I was there with my wife.</span> <span id="s1198">And I was so scared that you ho – you were holding me, I says, not to go farther, not to go farther.</span> <span id="s1199">And I said, I have to, I have to.</span> <span id="s1200">And suddenly I woke up.</span> <span id="s1201">So – something.</span> <span id="s1202">I was just thinking a moment ago what I wanted to tell you, oh my gosh.</span> <span id="s1203">Yeah, for example [indecipherable] yeah, for example, the first time, I forgot to mention, when they caught me, it was outside the village, around – about maybe a kilometer or so.</span> <span id="s1204">And suddenly – they caught me when – because German army, about 30 German are exercising outside the city.</span> <span id="s1205">So when they saw – saw me that the guard caught me to make identification, the – about 10 or 15 German soldiers are standing a-around me, and they took me to the kommandatura.</span> <span id="s1206">And people, the people who lived there, Christians, were standing, because it was some buildings already [indecipherable] they were standing outside.</span> <span id="s1207">It was beginning of the – and they saw I wa – I was in this time in plain, civil clothing.</span> <span id="s1208">And they saw the German soldiers are hi – holding a civilian guy and going with him to the kommandatura.</span> <span id="s1209">So the Christian people, some women, were standing outside, started to – the crossing, you know, praying for me.</span> <span id="s1210">They were – they knew that they see it, and they knew that partisans are around, and they knew a civil human being, between them – German soldiers that they knew that I’m certainly a partisan, and that is the end of me.</span> <span id="s1211">So people were standing and th – the outside, and praying for me, like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: Did you think you were gonna survive at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No, no way.</span> <span id="s1214">No way.</span> <span id="s1215">I – I-I was – I was only thinking – I was only thinking, believe me, I remember like today, I was thinking, it’s question, if they will shoot me here, or they will send me to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1216">That’s it, the two questions what I got.</span> <span id="s1217">This I remember like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Are there – are there certain things that touch off the memories more tha – more than other things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Well, maybe – for example, I was in hiding – actually, I was in hiding two years, give or take, from 1942 til 1944, til we went to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1220">All the time you were thinking, what will be next?</span> <span id="s1221">How long?</span> <span id="s1222">And this, you know, we-went for a wedding last year to Los Angeles, his – his niece [indecipherable] married in Los Angeles, you know, wa – Arthur Salzman(ph).</span> <span id="s1223">And so we met again, we met a few times in New York.</span> <span id="s1224">But then we didn’t see each other maybe seven or eight years.</span> <span id="s1225">And we met again.</span> <span id="s1226">The first thing we see each other, we’re hugging, because that’s – and the first thing oh, and you thi – immediately for relatives who – for American people, so – but this guy, this what we survived.</span> <span id="s1227">This is my body.</span> <span id="s1228">And I said, not true, because you are my body, cause we were hiding for more than a year together.</span> <span id="s1229">He is older than I am, he is in the a – 82, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: You went to Banya(ph) Bystrica.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: – for the Slovak [indecipherable] for the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: What – what – what did you think about when that happened?</span> <span id="s1235">Or did you – you went with the partisans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I thought more – I think – I-I thought, oh, this is the end, this will be – pretty soon be the end of the war, because I saw all those people, hundred – thousands of people, everage – everybody excited.</span> <span id="s1237">They was standing on a – on a truck, and give everybody a rifle.</span> <span id="s1238">Everybody a rifle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: So what was it like in Banya(ph) Bystrica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: It was [indecipherable] immediately came the Czechoslovak flags, and came Czechoslovak signs.</span> <span id="s1241">Our freedom is here, and – against the German, you know, signs, against the Slovak army.</span> <span id="s1242">But after about six weeks, and went immediately to the forest, and fighting against the German.</span> <span id="s1243">But then, end of October, the German put thousand of tho – thousand military with heavy weapons, with tanks and everything.</span> <span id="s1244">That’s when they liquidated the uprising.</span> <span id="s1245">That’s where everybody who – some people, especial Christian, went home.</span> <span id="s1246">Some went to the forest, some went in – that’s what it started to make separate partisan battalions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: So that’s when you joined the partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Yeah, they – that’s – and then after Banská [indecipherable] sometimes in October, November I went again with my father and my sister to Nova Mest(ph).</span> <span id="s1249">There I stayed for a few days and then I went in October, end of October again to the partisans, because I heard they are not far away in the forest, so I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Wi – I – I’m sorry, was your father with you in – in Banya(ph) Bystrica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1252">He was in Bratislava.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: He was in brat –</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: And from Bratislava, he came to Nova Mesto(ph), that where he stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Until he was taken away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1258">All right.</span> <span id="s1259">Why don’t we stop for today?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">End of Tape Three Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: This is a continuation of a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic, on April 14th, 1997, at his home in Southfield, Michigan.</span> <span id="s1263">The interviewer is Sidney Bolkosky.</span> <span id="s1264">This is tape four, side A. Can we go back just for a moment to – to – to have you tell me a little bit more about the Slovakian national uprising in Banská Bystri-Bystrica.</span> <span id="s1265">You were – you were part of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">A: Later on.</span> <span id="s1267">It was the end of sometimes – a month later, like it started – started about the – exactly the 29th of August, 1944.</span> <span id="s1268">And in this time I was in Bratislava with my father.</span> <span id="s1269">And then he left – w-we had to leave because they had said that the German will occupied – will occupied Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1270">So, after a few weeks, sometimes end of – middle of [indecipherable] the 15th or 20 of Sep-September, we left Bratislava and went to Nova Mesto(ph), where we stayed, I stayed for a few days with my father.</span> <span id="s1271">And then I went for about two or three days to Banská Bystrica, and from there they send it, or they told us to go to the forest.</span> <span id="s1272">Then I started, about the end of September, I think it was – yeah, the last week September, with a group.</span> <span id="s1273">But this was only – only few Russian, some Slovak, some – even I think about two or three Czechs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Partisans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: Partisans.</span> <span id="s1276">And then I wa – actually when I started.</span> <span id="s1277">And then later on, it was end of October.</span> <span id="s1278">In October the – the German came in and started to occupy Slovakia, and they took over all the ruins and everything in Slovakia, special in western Slovakia, where the – was the most of the upr-uprising, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: And was there – was there fighting in Banská Bystrica?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: In Banská Bystrica most of the time, specially the fir – i-in September and in even beginning of October, mostly they were organizing, there was the – the main ga – kommandatura the – the – from the partisans, the – how they call them?</span> <span id="s1281">The – all the – I mean, all the high officers and everythi – who – who were organizing the uprising, because the – from Banská Bystrica, they were organizing the uprising, who it was part in eastern Europe, not far Michalovce where I lived, it was in the mountains abou-about 15 or 20 kilometers from north of Michalovce, it was a small group.</span> <span id="s1282">The most of them they were in the higher Tatra in the mou – mountains, and the lower Tatras in the mountains.</span> <span id="s1283">So the whole organization was a – the – from Banská Bystrica, they made the whole – like – they organized from Banská Bystrica, from all the time.</span> <span id="s1284">And beside that, in Banská Bystrica was the first actually Czechoslovak – so-called Czechoslovak government in exile, and many high ranking officials came from London, and then the Russian started to drop munition and weapons from the air, first from the air and then even many times they landed in Banská Bystrica, there touch outside from Banská Bystrica, or they brought a we-weapon the Russian, or [indecipherable] for the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: But this was – was this before the Germans were there, or –</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Yeah, before the German, before the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: So this is the Slovakian army –</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">A: Yeah, bu-but it was because as soon as was the uprising August the 29th, actually the whole, especially in the middle Slovakia, and western Slovakia, the so-called – the freedom fighters, and the democratic like organization of they called, like the first Czechoslovak, like a government, took over all the – the – actually they – they were – they were – they took over the power there in Slovakia – most of the Slovakia’s [indecipherable] most of the part of Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1289">But then in October it started the German came in, and it started to occupy Slovakia and they took it over, so all – actually all the uprising and all the partisans and even the – all the – the – the high officers and the government of-officers pull out from Banská Bystrica, and everything went to the forests, to the mountains.</span> <span id="s1290">That was sometimes in October, I don’t remember exactly because it was – it took many, many days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">Q: You told me last time that you – you and a friend were together, his name was Hirschkovitz(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">Q: – and that – that he got shot next to you.</span> <span id="s1294">Do – do you remember what the circumstances were about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Oh yeah, actually I was with him about for four or five weeks, only it was end of December and in January, in January, because what we were in a fight, it was end of January, and that’s – I remember the place what I ha – I – if I would go there, but I don’t reme – you know, remember the name at wa – I was in the forest, in the so-called kopanice(ph), I – I don’t know how to call this in English, it was a places when it was forest, then it was five, six houses.</span> <span id="s1296">There was again forest, then again some houses.</span> <span id="s1297">And then not far away a little, in the mountains there, it was about – I can say about so – almost eight or 10 miles from the main road [indecipherable] right there in the mountains, in the forest.</span> <span id="s1298">There where he died, it was a – like a – a clear space out of the woods, and there where he died.</span> <span id="s1299">And not far away, about maybe four or 500 yards were some – about four or five houses.</span> <span id="s1300">So probably those people took care of him and buried him somewhere, but I am – I don’t – I don’t know where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: But you were fighting against the Germans at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Yeah, yeah, it was against the German, yeah.</span> <span id="s1303">Because sometimes – actually from end of September when I started with the uprising, til the fourth of, or third of – the fourth of April, 1945, most of the time I was with different groups or – of partisans, because many times we were fighting, and we were, for example 80 or a hundred people, and suddenly they – the German overpowered us, so we dis – disappeared from each other, we dispersed.</span> <span id="s1304">So, then we had to look for each other and sometimes I didn’t even find some people because they went to other group, and I didn’t even know what’s happened, if they survived, or not survived.</span> <span id="s1305">So that, for example was about maybe four or five times that I had to look for a group, and I was, all together about with three or four different groups, because where I found a group, so I took part with them.</span> <span id="s1306">I didn’t look for the group what I was before, because I didn’t know even they exist, because it were – we were a group, for example, 70 - 80 people.</span> <span id="s1307">So five or six people went there, 10 went there and some died, so it was dispersed, so we catched where we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: W-Were you there still under false papers?</span> <span id="s1309">Did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Yeah, I wer – the whole time I was living for tha – they didn’t know my original name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: So they didn’t know that you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s1312">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: So partisans [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1314">Did Hirschkovitz(ph) –</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Hirschkovitz(ph) knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: This is the only guy who knew that I was Jewish, he knew fr – where I’m from and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: Di-Di – it s – it seemed – you mentioned him, so I thought it – it had made a – some serious impression.</span> <span id="s1319">Was he close – near to you when – when he was shot, is that what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Oh, it a – it was about maybe 15 or 20 feet from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: And ne – and what happened when he was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: So he – he stayed there.</span> <span id="s1323">We had after – because we were in a fight, so we had to move.</span> <span id="s1324">So I left.</span> <span id="s1325">When I left he still was there, so if they buried him the same day or next day, I don’t know[indecipherable] to because I never came back on this place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: But you s – you saw him, you s – you knew he was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yeah, I saw him, I saw him, he get the – like a – a bullet what it tur – tore apart his chest.</span> <span id="s1328">I don’t know what to call – how to call this kind of a bullet.</span> <span id="s1329">It was against the Geneva Convention to use these kind of bullets, and they used it, the German used it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: You went back with the partisans, then – then you left them and went with your father, is that what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: I left my father there because I went with the partisan til sometimes end of September, so here – he – he stayed there in Nova Mesto(ph) in this apartment, and we decided that I will see what the – the situation, and I will check how the connection, that someone will come and pick him up, and I – I wa – I even had family who was willing for a small [indecipherable] not in the part – in the forest to – for to keep him, to hide him, because my father had some money with him too.</span> <span id="s1332">So – and we tried, and then we were fine, because we had the other family, his name was Farkos(ph), who was a neighbor of ours in Michalovce.</span> <span id="s1333">And I knew that he is there hiding already in the forest, so our plan was that on – my father will come there, we’ll stay for a few days there with this family, with a Christian family.</span> <span id="s1334">And then he will probably go there with the Farkos(ph) couple, this is the – he and his wife.</span> <span id="s1335">Then – and they s – the Farkos(ph) couple even survived, and they went after the war to Israel, and they died then in Israel.</span> <span id="s1336">And his sons, he had one, two, three sons, they still live in Israel, and I met them – no, four sons actually, because the fifth son, th-the – he died in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1337">So – and I met them when I was in Israel about eight years ago, 10 years ago the first time.</span> <span id="s1338">And then I met them about three or four years ago when I was in Slovakia when we had the reunion with people from the labor camp.</span> <span id="s1339">And then in Michalovce they dedicated a plaque on a building, it was the official – the – not the city hall, the – the – the – what is more than the city – I-I mean, the around all the – how you call the office?</span> <span id="s1340">Actually [indecipherable] there – there – there was a – there were the – we had in Michalovce the big synagogue, because we have many of them like I mentioned before, and this were the biggest synagogue, and this were destroyed – actually damaged during the war, and then nobody want to take it over, so they turned it down after the war.</span> <span id="s1341">And there, on these plates, they build the building on the district – the office of the district of Michalovce, and there they dedicated a plaque in Slovak and in Hebrew that it – there on this place was a synagogue for the Jews who were – who were killed in the concentration camp during the war, and I think even they say the – no, not – the numbers, I think th – are not there, how many of them.</span> <span id="s1342">But that’s – and this – I have saw here a picture for it.</span> <span id="s1343">I – maybe it will be [indecipherable] these pictures here.</span> <span id="s1344">I have got – I have to check, I will check –</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: Y-You left your father wi-with – in this – with this family –</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">A: With a Christian, yeah it was a wind – a widow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">Q: And you were gonna – you were gonna come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: N-Na – no, I don’t – I don’t say I come back, I said that I will send someone, a Christian, you know, from – over from the mountains, who will pick him up and bring that to the forest, that he go to – go in hidin – into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: And what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: And, it was the exact date when they has – the guy has to come, and like I – I came down there, because the guy came to me, and he said, he went there to the apartment and my father wasn’t there already.</span> <span id="s1351">And the woman told him that he – because he’s supposed to come – to come around six – 6:30 in the morning.</span> <span id="s1352">And he couldn’t wait, he was afraid because the German were – were making razzias all over, and were looking for Jews to take to the concentration – because it was actually one of the last – the last aktions, what the German were looking for Jews to take concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1353">So he was afraid, like the guy told me – the women told him, that he was afraid that they will came in to pick him up.</span> <span id="s1354">So he left her apartment around five o’clock in the morning, that means about one and a half or two hours earlier than he’s supposed to be there.</span> <span id="s1355">And wh-when he came, like I mentioned already, he came to there – because it was not far on the outskirt of the city of Nova Mesto(ph), and all – exactly out of the outskirt was a military barracks, and he went this way out of that city, because he knew actually where he’s supposed to go, where he’s supposed to – the guy is supposed to take him.</span> <span id="s1356">So there they confronted him, they wanted identification, even he had Christian papers.</span> <span id="s1357">So, you know, they immediately saw on him that he was [indecipherable] so they took him inside in the – on the kommandatura.</span> <span id="s1358">And there they saw actually – they saw that he is Jewish, and so they took him then to Sered, and from there they took him to the concentration camp where he [inaudible] yeah, to Auschwitz, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: And – and you heard about this when you get – when – from this man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">A: Yeah, but he died, he di – I hi – I heard from him here in the United States when I came in 1960 – in 1971, so – and my sister told him that it – talked to him, because he was from the same city from where we were, he was from Michalovce, and he said that he went with the same transport, and with the – he came to Auschwitz, so he was a – he was a tall guy, and he was much younger with my – than my father, so they took him to – Mengele too – took him to the right side for work, and my father went a few, maybe 10 or 15 people in front of him, Mendele – Mengele took him to the left, to the oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Q: When your father didn’t – didn’t come back with this man, what did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: I-I actually met this man – I heard about him, but I met him actually here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1363">Then when he told me that my father went –</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: But th-then, did you think that he had been taken away by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah, because – yeah, because the – the guy who came from this woman, they told him – she told him that probably went to there, because if he didn’t [indecipherable] and I didn’t find him, not during the war, that means from end of October or so til after the war, so I knew that he went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: What were you thinking at – or at all about your rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: So, we were waiting because then, after – few weeks after the war, I was waiting, I went back to Michalovce, and was looking.</span> <span id="s1368">So then I saw a – after few weeks, my one sister came back, Haide(ph), some times in June, I think.</span> <span id="s1369">And then I heard someone came from Budapest, that my younger sister is alive.</span> <span id="s1370">So we were waiting for it, you know, after few days or few weeks, the other sister, who lives here in Detroit, Tullulah(ph), came back, so we met together in Michalovce, but we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s1371">And then we had – if I can continue now after the war, we had the aunt in Vranov, this was about 35 miles from Michalovce, she was a first cousin of my father.</span> <span id="s1372">So she heard – they were looking and someone – I don’t remember how – if she heard about us, or we heard about her.</span> <span id="s1373">Actually, we went there to Vranov, to her, with her.</span> <span id="s1374">We stayed there from – for awhile, and she says that we can stay there, we will look if someone from the family will come back or not.</span> <span id="s1375">So then I had a friend in Michalovce who was me – who was we – with me together in labor camp.</span> <span id="s1376">And he told me that he has a uncle in Liberec.</span> <span id="s1377">This is about 65 miles north of Prague.</span> <span id="s1378">And he has a wholesale store here they gave him back, the Czechoslovak government, because he had this wholesale store before the war, in hardware store and plumbing supply.</span> <span id="s1379">So – and this was my profession what I was working during the war.</span> <span id="s1380">So he somehow connected with him, and he told me he was looking for someone who is responsible, and who is – who can trust for – and who can trust, may – and I can get the job there.</span> <span id="s1381">So I went there and introduced myself, and he hired me.</span> <span id="s1382">So it was in January – exactly in January 1946.</span> <span id="s1383">And between the – this time what we in – in Vranov, in Michalovce, we went to Prague end of the year to look for someone if we were – some on the Jewish organizations, if they will give some on the Red Cross, if they will give some – some i-information about our family members, but we didn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s1384">So my sister went back to Vranov.</span> <span id="s1385">They were there for a few months, and I stayed the Liberec already, I started to work there.</span> <span id="s1386">And then – but I [indecipherable] and then in – in Prague, I met some cousins from Slovakia, from Orlich(ph), who were in Prague, stayed in Prague, and one of them was – one brother of this cousins, he was in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, and he came to Prague, was sometimes in middle s-summer, sometimes in August or September.</span> <span id="s1387">So – and because he was ma – a soldier in the Czechoslovak army in Russia, he was fighting through the front and everything.</span> <span id="s1388">So they had advantages that they gave those people who was in the concentration camp, or who was fighting against the German, like partisans or – or in the military, that he can get certain stores or factories, what it – after there was took over from the Germans.</span> <span id="s1389">So this two cousins actually were received, they get a store in Jablonice(ph).</span> <span id="s1390">This was about eight miles from Liberec.</span> <span id="s1391">It was a store what – with china, you know, with glass, china, so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1392">So then my sisters came over to Jablonice(ph), sa – first they stayed with me in Liberec for many, many months, maybe a year or so.</span> <span id="s1393">And I – in ma – my sister, yeah, she stayed in Liberec the whole time.</span> <span id="s1394">And then my younger sister started to date, actually it was the brother of my cousin.</span> <span id="s1395">And they get married in 1948, and my sis – other sister, she started to date her next husband, a Mr. Joe Dushinski(ph).</span> <span id="s1396">So she get married, and they stayed in Liberec til end of 1950 or the 1950s, when they escaped from Czechoslovakia and went to Germany, from Germany to Canada and from Canada to the United States.</span> <span id="s1397">My younger sister Lola, when she got married in 1948, end of 1948, yeah.</span> <span id="s1398">He went – they went, I think with the Haganah to Germany and to France, to Paris where they stayed there about I think for two years or so, I don’t remember exactly.</span> <span id="s1399">And then they made corresponding because we had many relatives, first cousin, aunts and uncles here in the United States.</span> <span id="s1400">So actually, they helped them, that after two years or so they gave them a – th-they received a visa to Canada.</span> <span id="s1401">They stayed there for a few months or so, and then they received a visa, they came here to the United States.</span> <span id="s1402">Between this time, my other sister Haide(ph), with her husband, they escaped [indecipherable] money, I gave some money because he have to like bribe and give money for someone who knew the way to go to the border, to german – to east Germany.</span> <span id="s1403">And they went to Berlin, and from ber – from east Berlin to have – to have tams – again for money, they went to west Berlin, and waiting for the papers the same way they received from our relatives the paper, the visa, because they were first cousin and uncles.</span> <span id="s1404">They went to Canada, they came to Windsor, ma – first to Halifax, I think.</span> <span id="s1405">They stayed there from Halifax to Windsor, and then after I don’t know, for I think it was in 1952 or ’51 or something like that, they came to the United States, to Detroit, because here in Detroit, we have the – a cousin here, who was born here in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: Now, wha – when you were living – living in Liberec with your sisters, did you talk about what went on during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: About wha – what happened during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A: With who?</span> <span id="s1410">With –</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: With your sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: Then – then I actually, because even [indecipherable] and then actually the older sister – the younger sister told me how she was to concentration camp – camp, how she survived the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1415">And the other sister was – she was in hiding, she was in camp somewhere, all over there.</span> <span id="s1416">She didn’t want to talk.</span> <span id="s1417">I don’t want – I don’t know, even today – actually – and I – I probably know certain things what I – I have suspicions but I cannot tell because I am not certain what’s happened with her, so – I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1418">She doesn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s1419">If she have – after – years after the war, if I started to talk her, she was shaking and she was – so, I let her, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: What was life like there then, after – right after the war.</span> <span id="s1421">I mean, what – for the next five years or so?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: The – after the war it was – everybody was thinking, because it was really a democratic government.</span> <span id="s1423">President Beneš, who escaped in 1939 to London, he came back.</span> <span id="s1424">First came Košice, 1945, they established a new democratic Czechoslovak government.</span> <span id="s1425">Then, after a few weeks, they came to Prague with a big celebration, everything, because it’s again the new Czechoslovak government.</span> <span id="s1426">But what had happened, the Russians, actually Stalin, even during the war, and it was the fault of the American government of Roosevelt, actually, and Truman, that they would trust – they trusted to Stalin, and even in 1945 they made the agreement in Tehran, Stalin with Churchill and Roosevelt, that how far the American army, when they will liberate Europe and Germany and other, how far they can go.</span> <span id="s1427">Because actually Prague, and the mostly part of Czechoslovakia, the American army was actually on the outskirts of Prague, and the Russian didn’t let them farther to go, and the Russians were far away, because they said it was agreement between Russia and the United States.</span> <span id="s1428">So the American army had to pull back, move west approximately to the city of Posen in Czeska(ph) Budavitsa(ph) and then they stayed.</span> <span id="s1429">And the people were waiting til the Russian came into Prague, because Stalin wanted political reasons it was, that Czechoslovakia would be influenced later on, ac – or – ma – with the – the gover – the – under a communist government.</span> <span id="s1430">So actually then it was big celebration that the Russian army liberated Prague and liberated Czechoslovakia, because the true was that the whole Slovakia and Moravia, the Russian army liberated.</span> <span id="s1431">So it was then, and it went to the history that the Russian army celebrated Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1432">Even the true is that the American army cel – liberated mo – the biggest part of the Bohemia of Czech – o-of the Czech part of Czechoslovakia, but the Russian didn’t let them go farther.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Did you know this then?</span> <span id="s1434">Did you know all this then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: After many – after the year, til it was in 1946 - ’47, but not later, because later, when in av – February the 25th, in 1948, the communists took over the government.</span> <span id="s1436">So then actually, was it all over that only the Russian army and the Russian people liberated Prague and Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1437">So it started to work the communist propaganda and it just – everybody to believe that it was only the Russian and Russian and Russian and from – excuse me, from this time out it was all thing – everything what the American did what – everything wrong, and everything – they wanted to – to take away everything from Czechoslovakia, from the factories and everything, because – so, it wa – the – sta – the Russians started – the Russian and the communist government started to br-brainwash the people in the Czechoslovakia, and most of the people believed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q: Did you believe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A: Well, sometimes no – s-sometimes yes, sometimes no.</span> <span id="s1440">Sometimes I suspicious, but especial later on, when we had the opportunity to listen in hiding to the Voice of America, the – on radio, suddenly it – then it opened our eyes.</span> <span id="s1441">Then – then we knew what really the true is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q: Well – well, life under the communists then, wa – was it – was it awful, was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Actually, it was no much different like under the German, only this was – the difference was, they didn’t went straight on not – the – after the Jews, but they went – if they heard something, everybody was afraid to openly to say tha – his opinion.</span> <span id="s1444">Everybody what – End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic.</span> <span id="s1446">This is tape four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: It was so far that even a – a neighbor who didn’t like a neighbor, or a – so he started to – to have against him personally, and he went to the secret police or to the police and said, look, this – my neighbor, he said the – the Russian were stealing our liberation and he praised the American, it was enough.</span> <span id="s1448">Immediately came the secret police, took him away.</span> <span id="s1449">And many people even disappeared, exactly never heard about them.</span> <span id="s1450">And so the people were afraid.</span> <span id="s1451">One neighbor was afraid the other neighbor.</span> <span id="s1452">The people started not to trust even their closest friends, because this time the secret police started to look for informants.</span> <span id="s1453">So you never knew even your next neighbor, or your next guy who was working with you in the office or factory – actually, the people didn’t trust.</span> <span id="s1454">And it happened that even children went to the police and told to the police that something for own – own parents or something.</span> <span id="s1455">And it was that they disappeared or they went to jail, and very seldom that they came back.</span> <span id="s1456">So it was a terror, actually.</span> <span id="s1457">It – it was sometimes worst than under the German.</span> <span id="s1458">And then, even it was so far that Stalin send advisors, his advisors – it was like secretive, what knew only later on, civilian advisors, not even to the government, but even to – into factories, and it started the end of 1949, that it started a trial against people, against communists who were in high positions even before the war in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1459">And even during the war, who were suffering, who were in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1460">But Stalin wanted to get rid of them because he was afraid that probably they were a little more moderate.</span> <span id="s1461">And then it came actually, it so-called the month of 1950, when the – it was then, it was the communist government in Czechoslovakia, that they went after people who di – they didn’t trust, even if – if – if no reason, but they didn’t trust, they took them and they started big trials in Czechoslovakia and they took actually what was the biggest trial, 14 people who were in high positions, even in th – after the war, in the communist party, or in the government, in the communist government.</span> <span id="s1462">And they made the trial that they were Trotskys and they were spies against Russia, against the – Stalin, against [indecipherable] government in Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1463">And they had the big trial, and they – beti – between these 14 people were, I think, 12 or 13 Jews.</span> <span id="s1464">And I think 12 of them, or 13, they’re sentenced to die.</span> <span id="s1465">They were hanged, or they were shot.</span> <span id="s1466">All Jews, no ba – event, they were shot between th-that [indecipherable] so-called the Slanksy(ph) trial.</span> <span id="s1467">He was a Jew but he was a big, high position in the communist party even before the war already.</span> <span id="s1468">So they get rid of all the Jews.</span> <span id="s1469">About two survived, but all the Jews were liquidated, what was – they all was – all were high ranking communist officials.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Did you feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">A: And then it started – yeah, I’m sorry, you have the question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">Q: Did you feel that this kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Ah, that’s what I want to continue.</span> <span id="s1474">I felt immediately, because in this time, in 1949 and 1950 – 1949 already, they took me – the police came to me and they took me to the police.</span> <span id="s1475">They were asking me what happened with my younger sister, with Lola.</span> <span id="s1476">So I told them that in 1948, I – they disappeared, I don’t know nothing about them.</span> <span id="s1477">They didn’t believe me.</span> <span id="s1478">They kept me there about for a day or so.</span> <span id="s1479">They let me go, but they called me many times.</span> <span id="s1480">I was about four or five times there on the police, asking questions, a – who – ho-how many relatives I have in America, where I have relatives, what I am doing, what I – my corresponding is, with whom I am corresponding and so on.</span> <span id="s1481">And then in the 1950, my sister Haide(ph) what – she left Czechoslovakia, that was a nightmare for me, because then they took me again to the police, and they hold me for a few days, two t – three days.</span> <span id="s1482">Even in that it happened that I get pushed to the wall.</span> <span id="s1483">Then even a day – a slap my fa – I get a slap on my face that I ha-hold my own hand.</span> <span id="s1484">I don’t know if I even told my wife some ta – this.</span> <span id="s1485">Then they let me – this wasn’t so easy because I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1486">They told me that I knew how my sister, both sister left Czechoslovakia and til I won’t tell them, they will keep me and they will send me to Jáchymov.</span> <span id="s1487">That was a uranium mine, when they put the ra – uranium from mines, and all the uranium was sending to Russia, because they made that – probably the atomic bomb or so.</span> <span id="s1488">And usually people who went – that was people who were sent to Jáchymov to the uranium mines, that was criminals, that was poli – who were politically – politically no-not trustworthy, and very few people came back from there.</span> <span id="s1489">They died.</span> <span id="s1490">And if after many, many years someone came back, his health was completely – they get – they have cancer when they came back, most of them died, and very few survived more years in there, they let her go after fef – 15 or 20 years, or sometimes it happened where they saw someone get very sick and had some connections, so they let him go, but still – they let him go home, but after many year – after a few years died because of cancer from the uranium, from the exposures to – to radiation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">Q: When – when they – when you were being questioned by the police, did – did that bring back memories of when you were being held by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">A: Very much so.</span> <span id="s1493">And I can tell you, I have to mention maybe that they let me go after a few days or so, if – it was because my wife, she was working in an office, and her president of the office wi – because it was a – for the – the main office for all the restaurants there, it was about 1500 people.</span> <span id="s1494">He had some connection, the – her boss had some connection with the police.</span> <span id="s1495">So my wife probably told him, so he actually, through my – my wife, through him, heard that the police let me go.</span> <span id="s1496">But that’s later on, like I mentioned, my wife later on couldn’t keep high position jobs because they knew that her husband has relatives in America, so they didn’t trust her.</span> <span id="s1497">So then, later on she was only like a clerk, because before she was in a higher position, like a – in charge of the personnel department, from all the people.</span> <span id="s1498">Then they – they – she couldn’t keep this job, because they didn’t trust her.</span> <span id="s1499">So actually, they put her in a lower position there.</span> <span id="s1500">But they needed her because, I have to tell, she was a very good clerk, she was very smart and very capable to do things.</span> <span id="s1501">And her boss was great, because she did many work what she – he’s supposed to job – do.</span> <span id="s1502">So actually, he didn’t have to work so much, and other people who were in charge.</span> <span id="s1503">So actually, they used her to work more because the-they knew that she has to if she wants to keep even the lower job.</span> <span id="s1504">So but – like I mentioned before, we knew that after years and many times the police were watching us specially.</span> <span id="s1505">And like I mentioned before, the last time, we knew exactly the – why they came to our apartment when we were at work and were checking well – if they will find some letters or something, some material what they can use special against me, that I am in connection somehow with my sisters, or with relatives in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: You mean they searched – they searched your house while you were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Re – re – they searched our house.</span> <span id="s1508">Maybe they were mare – money – more times, but twice we knew exactly because w-we, like I mentioned, in our closets we recognized, we knew, because w-we knew – we heard that they are doing this kind of work, the secret police, so we – exactly on purpose, we put certain things in our closets that we could then recognize that something – someone was there.</span> <span id="s1509">And so the – actually, all those years, we were living with my wife, we couldn’t travel so much like we would like to.</span> <span id="s1510">And they were watching – they were watching us, all our steps.</span> <span id="s1511">Because we were feeling and we saw suspicious people around us, along the – outside our apartment and so, because they were watching who is coming to our apartment.</span> <span id="s1512">Maybe they are watching where we are going, with whom we are friends, with whom we are in connection.</span> <span id="s1513">So that was [indecipherable] that was the reason – and in 1968, then – my sister – I’m a little too far a-ahead, but in 1968 is when my sister’s family – because here in the family, like I think I mentioned, was a Bar Mitzvah in the family and a wedding in the family, here in Detroit and in Chicago.</span> <span id="s1514">So, after – they sent me airline ticket, and I – invitation that I could come to visit.</span> <span id="s1515">But they – I knew in advan – yeah, between the older [indecipherable] once a year and twice a year, my sister – I received a letter from one sister, from the other sister.</span> <span id="s1516">But in this time, in Czechoslovakia they had the qui – equipment, because someone told me later on after years, that they could read the letters who wanted – who – special letters who came from the western countries.</span> <span id="s1517">So actually, before I got the letter, and it was a certain stamp, a letter stamp on the envelope, so actually they, under the secret police, maybe in Prague already, or in Liberec, they actually read all the letters what I received.</span> <span id="s1518">So they knew what they – what th-they are writing.</span> <span id="s1519">And this taught me – someone later on af – sometime in the 60s, I think he was in the secret police, I am not sure, but I knew he – I went to school with him.</span> <span id="s1520">And he – one day he was drunk, and I met him, so – and he started to talk and I was asking him, so I felt between his word what he was talking, that that – that’s what the police, because he told me actually, they said, look, we knew everything, what’s going on everybody, because we knew in a – everything what’s going on because we had equipment what we [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1521">So, in 1968 when I came here, it took me a lot of work, because I couldn’t get the visa to America before I get the permission, a paper from the police in Liberec that they let me go for a visit.</span> <span id="s1522">So – and it took again th-the boss of my wife, he talked to someone of the police, so that’s where I could get the permission, and I went with the permission to the American embassy in Prague, that’s when I could get the visa.</span> <span id="s1523">But they never let go a couple together, special when they didn’t have children, and we didn’t have children.</span> <span id="s1524">So actually I knew in advance because when my sisters wrote me that they will invite us, so I told them in advance, they cannot – we couldn’t get both of them.</span> <span id="s1525">If I will lucky, I will get probably, but they had to pa – send the invitation only for one person, for me.</span> <span id="s1526">And that’s what happened.</span> <span id="s1527">And I knew for exactly because they told me, you know, in the police when I went with – with the invitation what I received from my sister, I went to the police, as they told me, immediately.</span> <span id="s1528">But it’s – if we will decide, it will go only to you, not – but not your wife.</span> <span id="s1529">Because they knew we didn’t have children.</span> <span id="s1530">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">Q: So was – was this a lib – a kind of liberal thaw in the – wa-wasn’t there a period when things got better in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">A: Only in 1967 - 1968.</span> <span id="s1533">It was a little bit – the worst years were in th – from 1949 til 1962 - ’64.</span> <span id="s1534">Di –</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">Q: Was this the dub –</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">A: Especially the years from 1940 – 19 – 1955 - 1956.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Was this the Dubček years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: The Dubček came only nine – in the spring of 1968.</span> <span id="s1539">Then we felt a little more breeze about the more liberation [indecipherable] or so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">Q: You think that’s why they let you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: No, it was on the list because it was in August nine – no, in July 1968.</span> <span id="s1542">So, if it would be – actually, if it would be the – a year before, or two years before when it was really the strict communist government, not Dubček, I hardly could get permission from the police to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: When did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: I met her in nine – in end of 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: And what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1546">A: Bozena.</span> <span id="s1547">My wife Bozena, her name was – maiden name was Shimkowa(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: And you met her in 1948, and when were you married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: In October 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: T-Tell me a little bit about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: So, I dated her about a year, and I really liked her.</span> <span id="s1552">I – even I was not so very young, but I fell in love because first of all I wa – I – she was very much interested in things like I was interested.</span> <span id="s1553">For example, we would [indecipherable] talk, we would like one day to travel, because I like to travel, and she had the same.</span> <span id="s1554">And she like very much art, culture, theaters, operas.</span> <span id="s1555">And that was – I always liked and just I read some material about that.</span> <span id="s1556">So we started – we started to gay – to go in theaters to o – special an opera tim – ba-ballet together.</span> <span id="s1557">And then we started – I bought a tent and [indecipherable] I think we were – we were dating already, that we would like to ca – go camping.</span> <span id="s1558">So that’s what I started – we started to do that.</span> <span id="s1559">And I saw that we have common interests.</span> <span id="s1560">We started to go dancing, so – and then I – I mean, I saw that she’s a very smart girl, nice.</span> <span id="s1561">So I knew what kind of position has, because she had the position that really was very capable to do this kind of work.</span> <span id="s1562">So – and I was by myself, by – actually not, my sister was still living there.</span> <span id="s1563">So that’s when I married her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: It must have been hard to leave her when you went to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Yeah, for visiting?</span> <span id="s1566">Yeah, I-I was – when I went to the United States, I was certain that more, more, more, because the Dubček were in charge already that many more they – the western countries will help Czechoslovakia to get more rid of the communist-like government, that it will be some imperialistic government, or more democratic government, so that I will come back.</span> <span id="s1567">I didn’t – I didn’t go to United States with this that I will stay here, because if it would be a year before, I would do that, because I knew under communist that I-I would be glad to get rid of the communist government, but now, if starting in spring of 1968 it goes always farther, farther, more liberalization, more democratic things started to come.</span> <span id="s1568">So everybody thought it will finally get again a democratic Czechoslovak Republic.</span> <span id="s1569">But in – with th – in this time, and [indecipherable] in the United States, it was for six weeks what I get the permission.</span> <span id="s1570">That means the third or the second of September I was supposed to go back, and that was even my airline ticket.</span> <span id="s1571">But in thi-this time, end of August, the 21st of August, I think, th – the communists, the Russian and the army from Hungary, from East Germany, from Romania, from Poland, occupied Czechoslovakia, so they closed the borders.</span> <span id="s1572">So I was in the United States, my wife was actually over there.</span> <span id="s1573">So, what I have to do?</span> <span id="s1574">So – and my wife was in this time in Yugoslavia, on vacation with her cousin, be a – with a 10 years old boy.</span> <span id="s1575">So, she immediate – when the Czechoslovakia occupied, so she immediately went from Yugoslavia back to Czechoslovakia because the parents of the boy were afraid that – what’s happened.</span> <span id="s1576">So they – she went back to Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1577">I was in the United States, she was over there.</span> <span id="s1578">And then when what’s happened, so my relatives all, they told me look, we are going to the immigration office.</span> <span id="s1579">You will stay here, because what’s happened there.</span> <span id="s1580">We will do everything possible that your wife will come here too.</span> <span id="s1581">And then, because I told them, I don’t want to stay here if she is there, I am here.</span> <span id="s1582">So my brother-in-law went with me here in Detroit to the immigration office, and they told me – I didn’t speak English, so he was the interpreter.</span> <span id="s1583">They told me yeah, we can make now because this situation is, it will be easier that I could stay here, and we will make everything possible if she can get out from Czechoslovakia, that she will receive immediately visa.</span> <span id="s1584">But we cannot guarantee how she will get out from there.</span> <span id="s1585">So I said look, I will go back, I will do – if I will be there – because it ose – and they said don’t worry, they will let her go as soon as we’ll go to phone her, we will write her.</span> <span id="s1586">She will get the permission, she will get out.</span> <span id="s1587">And I said look, if the Russians are – if it would be a government under Dubček, it will be different, but this is a government the Russians are there.</span> <span id="s1588">And I know what it means to live under communists.</span> <span id="s1589">So never they would let her go – maybe after awhile or so.</span> <span id="s1590">And I said, I cannot – I cannot stay here, I cannot let her there because she doesn’t know all those ways how to go sh – there.</span> <span id="s1591">She has no experience in this kind of thing, and I have to go back.</span> <span id="s1592">The-They were crying, they were bul – everything, my relatives.</span> <span id="s1593">And I went back.</span> <span id="s1594">And when – interesting enough, one of my nephews – because I – one nephew, he had Bar Mitzvah in July here.</span> <span id="s1595">So I was at the – the other nephew, his Bar Mitzvah supposed to be in April next year.</span> <span id="s1596">And he was crying and crying, and said, Uncle Mitu(ph), you are here at the Bar Mitzvah for Stanley, and you won’t be here on my Bar Mitzvah, and I will – and I told him, Irwin(ph), I promise you, I will do everything possible.</span> <span id="s1597">When I will be there, I will make all the possible things – if I couldn’t be here on your Bar Mitzvah, I will be here with you on your wedding with your aunt, with my wife.</span> <span id="s1598">I make this your promise.</span> <span id="s1599">And so I went back, but I couldn’t go straight to Czechoslovakia, so I flew from here to Yugoslavia, because I had to change my airline ticket, and I went to the place where my wife was on vacation, she wasn’t there any more.</span> <span id="s1600">So I went back by train to Prague, and then I met my wife and saw – and I told her the story and I said, I will try immediately I told her, I will try everything.</span> <span id="s1601">We have to go back and we have to go to America.</span> <span id="s1602">We cannot stay because it will be a terror here.</span> <span id="s1603">So, she didn’t want for, she was crying and so on.</span> <span id="s1604">But then later on th – I was working on her [indecipherable] and then she saw too what’s going on, how it goes, the situation.</span> <span id="s1605">So and then we made, sometimes in March, we start with a little more, not so strict like it was the first month.</span> <span id="s1606">So we went to – to police, we ask for a permission to go to Hungary for vacation.</span> <span id="s1607">Yeah, when I came back, people – friends what I met on the street, they didn’t even greet me to welcome me or something.</span> <span id="s1608">Everyone only showing knock on the head that I was so st – they didn’t te – tell me anything, only to show me that I was stupid that I came back.</span> <span id="s1609">So then we was working in mat – thr – thr – again through ma – through this – her boss, and we get permission to go to Hungary because we had some friends.</span> <span id="s1610">And then we had to bribe in the bank, because you ca – to go to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1611">If you wanted to go to Yugoslavia, you had to get a permission from the bank, that the bank gave you currency, Yugoslavian currency, that you go to a vacation for Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1612">So that – we bribed some clerk in the bank, because it was always a committee who was deciding if they allowed you, if they give you the money, Yugoslavian money that you go – can go to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1613">So that’s what it happened, I-I get the permission to go to yu – th-the money to go into Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1614">So I went again to the police, I had the permission to Yugoslavia, actually [indecipherable] needed.</span> <span id="s1615">I get the permission there, because I had the per – the money from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1616">So I get the per-permission from the police that I can go.</span> <span id="s1617">They put up a – a stamp in my passport that I can go Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1618">And then we have to bribe someone on the police to a – a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s1619">We gave money to him, he gave some money to a policeman.</span> <span id="s1620">So he gave permission to us that we can go to Yugoslavia through Austria.</span> <span id="s1621">And it was for 48 hours.</span> <span id="s1622">And I had the cousin who still lives in Czechoslovakia, in Košice, and she told me that if I can get the permission to Austria, to Vienna, then I can go to HIAS, to a Hebrew immigration office, and then I can stay and they take care of me to get out from Europe, anywhere.</span> <span id="s1623">So that what we did to, what I’m saying it’s very simple, but it took much of nerves, a lot of weeks, almost all our money what we got.</span> <span id="s1624">It cost us money what we bribe.</span> <span id="s1625">And it was nerve breaking til we get all those papers and everything.</span> <span id="s1626">So only one cousin of my wife, and my cousin in Košice, they knew that we are preparing to leave.</span> <span id="s1627">Even she told me my cousin in Košice, as soon as wa – we were b – lucky and come to Vienna, that I have to write her, and they may – they – they will make immediately steps that they will come after us to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1628">But in between this is a other story, her husband changed his mind, he didn’t want [indecipherable] this stay there.</span> <span id="s1629">And he wa – he felt sorry til today for visiting last few years them, he felt sorry all the time that he didn’t came after us.</span> <span id="s1630">Then when we – so we – yeah, and then it happened in May the 30th, 1940 – 1969, actually we left Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1631">And where we lived in the apar – I had a car already.</span> <span id="s1632">In this time I bought a car, it happens – this is other story, how it was difficult.</span> <span id="s1633">It was permission from the company, but we had the car.</span> <span id="s1634">We had the – we had the application for a new car two years before, because it take always a committee who decided who will get the car, because it was har – very had to get the car, a permission to buy a car, if you had the money.</span> <span id="s1635">And you have – you had to put down 60 percent of the price of the car in a bank.</span> <span id="s1636">It was blocked in a bank that you had the money.</span> <span id="s1637">So I had the car about for a year or so.</span> <span id="s1638">That’s about half [indecipherable] almost a new car.</span> <span id="s1639">And so we were preparing, we – so I parked my car in front of the building, it was on a main street.</span> <span id="s1640">And the day before – and we had all the permissions and everything.</span> <span id="s1641">So a day before, to the evening, we started to take some stuff, what we will need for the vacation, and put in the car.</span> <span id="s1642">Because I had the garage, so we are leave the car over the ma – overnight in the garage.</span> <span id="s1643">And because we wanted to leave early in the morning, as soon as possible.</span> <span id="s1644">So – and then we – and I knew from the time when we came back from – when I came back from America, special then in the months after new year, February, March, we were watching, again by the secret police.</span> <span id="s1645">And then I was – when we were taking down all the stuff into the car, and then not far away, maybe 60 or 70 yards, it was a corner, a building, and there was a restaurant.</span> <span id="s1646">And we saw that some guy in rain clothes – in plain clothes that’s – was go – walking around.</span> <span id="s1647">And sometime he stopped there, reading a paper, went inside in the restaurant, and from the restaurant was a window straight to our apart – to the car where – where I was parking.</span> <span id="s1648">It was about 70 yards.</span> <span id="s1649">And then again he came out, he ge – went around the corner, and again get the newspaper, and then to the restaurant.</span> <span id="s1650">So we knew exactly, because we knew all those kind of things what they are doing because all the secret – so we knew immediately that someone is watching us.</span> <span id="s1651">So if I describe you, or if you – I can’t [indecipherable] it wasn’t so smooth.</span> <span id="s1652">I will try to be really short.</span> <span id="s1653">And around mor – in the morning, around 4:30 or five o’clock, it was May the 30th or the 31st – the 31st, we left Liberec and went on the way to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1654">So we stopped during the night in a little town – you stop?</span> <span id="s1655">It then – then it was Bratislava, it was on the border, actually on Czech and Moravia.</span> <span id="s1656">And then we stopped during the night in a camp, to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s1657">And then [indecipherable] that we will go [indecipherable] so me, my wife – End of Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mikulas Judikovic, on April 14th, 1997 at his home in Southfield, Michigan, and the interviewer is still Sidney Bolkosky.</span> <span id="s1660">This is tape five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">A: So my wife was afraid to tell her mother that we are leaving, and that we are trying not to come back, because she knew, and I knew too, that if she would tell her mother that she is not coming back, she would start to cry and to scream, and she didn’t – she wouldn’t never let her go.</span> <span id="s1662">So we di – she didn’t tell her mother.</span> <span id="s1663">We stayed overnight in this camp.</span> <span id="s1664">In the morning there was about a two hours drive to Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1665">There we stayed na – about a half a day.</span> <span id="s1666">And then we went from Bratislava, it was very close, about maybe 10 or 15 kilometers to the border.</span> <span id="s1667">And usually, at the border to the Hungary – to Hungary, it was you came to the border, and the Slovaks took only the papers, you were straight on the road.</span> <span id="s1668">There was a – there was a soldier who took the papers, identification, if you had permission, he let you go.</span> <span id="s1669">But when we came to the stor – soldier, he took our papers and everything, showed the name, and suddenly he send us around, up to the main building, where the customs were.</span> <span id="s1670">So we knew immediately that something is not kosher.</span> <span id="s1671">So we went there, and we saw when we were there the soldier took our identification and then we thought that have to go up, we saw a custom guy was standing in – at the door there.</span> <span id="s1672">And came out a other custom and he probably told him, because he showed downstairs, he said probably, those are the people.</span> <span id="s1673">We come upstairs and he took our papers, and – both of them, they were standing – where are you going?</span> <span id="s1674">And I said that we’re going to Hungary, that we’re going to Yugoslavia, so on.</span> <span id="s1675">And he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1676">Drove – drive your car behind the building.</span> <span id="s1677">So I knew immediately it’s not goo – good.</span> <span id="s1678">So I drove the car behind the building.</span> <span id="s1679">There was a – the long table, and he said okay, but we would like to see what you have in your car.</span> <span id="s1680">Take out everything from your car.</span> <span id="s1681">So we took out everything on the car, or took – or put on the table.</span> <span id="s1682">And we had our tent, we had [indecipherable], we had a stove, everything like we go for vacation to – for camping.</span> <span id="s1683">And what we had in suitcase, everything out.</span> <span id="s1684">And then he took out – and that car had the engine in the back, you know it was – and the – the – the trunk was in the front.</span> <span id="s1685">So, he took the front – he took out our spare tire.</span> <span id="s1686">They took – pull up the battery from the trunk.</span> <span id="s1687">And it took about an hour, all this checking and everything what they did.</span> <span id="s1688">And people down on the road, other people were traveling and they left.</span> <span id="s1689">Everybody were looking up because they saw from – from the stree – from the road that we are standing, and customs are standing there, and with all the stuff there.</span> <span id="s1690">And can you imagine that where the glove department is, there was – I found out that was a little, like space.</span> <span id="s1691">And it come to my mind what I had at home with my prayer book.</span> <span id="s1692">So – and I found out – so there I hide some papers, what – her birth certificate, some other papers.</span> <span id="s1693">[indecipherable] had a few krones(ph), some money and other documents what we had, what we knew if they will find it, it’s finished.</span> <span id="s1694">They were let – they knew that something is wrong, that we taking some money with us [indecipherable] because they checked our – our purses, our – our – my – my wife’s purse and everything.</span> <span id="s1695">So if they would find these kind of papers, what we – why I need papers, my documents, what I went to school, or when my wife – wife does – so there I was hidden, but it was so narrow, that later on when I had to take it out, I scratched my hand, because it was very hard to take out.</span> <span id="s1696">And they opened the glove department, they looked behind, but didn’t realize, because it was something like hidden, so they didn’t see that this is – this is actually a – a secret space there.</span> <span id="s1697">This was – they were lucky.</span> <span id="s1698">So after about an hour they didn’t find – they didn’t find the space there.</span> <span id="s1699">After about an hour or so, and even – you know I said it’s – I – I have to – to mention, my wife used to make iyer(ph) cognac, natur – because she liked it, so here and there she tried to st – you know what’s iyer(ph) cognac is now?</span> <span id="s1700">This is a – a liqueur, this is made from eggs – eggs and liqueur, you know, and it’s very – so sweet, you can hardly get drunk or so.</span> <span id="s1701">And the oth – on the way, she usually lit – taked a – from the – from the bottle, a taste, and til we came there to the customs, she was a – a little so in good mood, you know.</span> <span id="s1702">And suddenly when it was all over with the checking [indecipherable] everything was outside, and suddenly she stepped like this and she said, gentlemen, could you tell me please, what are you looking for?</span> <span id="s1703">Maybe I can help you.</span> <span id="s1704">And I said, be quiet.</span> <span id="s1705">We don’t be th – nasty to gen – because I saw that they – they were a little so – not so – so straight, like they were before when the – they were so strict, they were talking to us like we were some robberies or something, or criminals.</span> <span id="s1706">And then in to the end, after an hour, both of them were so – a little softer.</span> <span id="s1707">And I told her [indecipherable] quiet, don’t – and okay, so – and she says so, can I put back the – yeah, you can.</span> <span id="s1708">So okay, so [indecipherable] and so she started slowly with here, and I said, take everything through it in.</span> <span id="s1709">If they would let us go, we will be – as soon as we can be away from it better.</span> <span id="s1710">Okay, then I help her, we started to threw it only in the car and everything.</span> <span id="s1711">And then they told us, come – come with the car in the front of the building, stop there.</span> <span id="s1712">Because they had all the papers, everything.</span> <span id="s1713">So, I stopped there and so they let you go, but then he stopped, and I said okay.</span> <span id="s1714">They gave the papers, and I said, you know when – and when you went from Czechoslovakia, you had to fill out a piece of paper, what you are taking out.</span> <span id="s1715">And then you had to show on the border when you come back, if you brought it – everything back and what you brought back.</span> <span id="s1716">And I said, but yo – I have the passport and the papers, I don’t have the paper what it says when I come back and show the – the – for the customs what I took out and what took back.</span> <span id="s1717">And he says, I gave it to you.</span> <span id="s1718">And I said, but I don’t have here.</span> <span id="s1719">Yeah, and th – and then my wife says, oh, maybe yeah, I think I have here between the papers, I have it.</span> <span id="s1720">So – and I said, because we have to – and I told them even, I – we have to be back because my wife has some examinations, she went to – to a college school and took courses, she took – and I said, three days later she had the examinations, so we have to bring back, and I don’t want to have some troubles when I come back.</span> <span id="s1721">I gave it to your wife.</span> <span id="s1722">Again.</span> <span id="s1723">Well, she says, maybe I as – my wife said, maybe I have here.</span> <span id="s1724">So we went, we came, yeah, and we stayed there on our seaside – not seaside, it was a big lake where we have friends who usually we stayed o – for vacations every year.</span> <span id="s1725">So we thought we will stay there for a week or 10 days with them.</span> <span id="s1726">So we stopped there, and we say we are going to Yugoslavia and we will stay for a few days.</span> <span id="s1727">Who said – and the la – the – our friend says oh, that’s good, good, good, we’ll stay – and then during the night I couldn’t sleep, it was from Saturday to Sunday, I remember like today.</span> <span id="s1728">And I said, you know what – I told my wife, I think so – I would stay not one more day, because if they made those search on the border, they immediately sent a cable to Liberec that we went to the gi – border, they let us.</span> <span id="s1729">And if we will stay in Hungary, this is still a communist country, they can make immediately there’s a stop in Hungary, and they send us back.</span> <span id="s1730">And I said, today is Sunday, they – the office is in Liberec closed.</span> <span id="s1731">So better if as soon as we’ll go away – okay, my wife didn’t want to, so [indecipherable] says, that’s okay, we go.</span> <span id="s1732">So I turned to my friend, listen, you know we wanted better we will stop more days in Yugoslavia, and then we will come back sooner, we will stay with you when we come back, because it doesn’t say that – we want so – at least two or three days or so, and I says no, we better because they said it’s a nice weather there in yugo – okay, so we went.</span> <span id="s1733">We came to the border on Hungary and Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1734">They stopped us, they told us the Hungarian customs, wait in the car.</span> <span id="s1735">So we wait in the car.</span> <span id="s1736">We wait five minute, 10 minutes, 15 minutes long, nobody came out.</span> <span id="s1737">So then I said oh, this is not good.</span> <span id="s1738">And I said because maybe from Bratislava they sent a message to the Hungarian border to stop us and to check us.</span> <span id="s1739">So it took about 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s1740">Other people were coming down, other customs let them go, only to [indecipherable] and us they st – we were sitting in the car from 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s1741">And then suddenly they came out, they pull up the hood, they pull up the hood for the engine, they pull up the hood from the trunk.</span> <span id="s1742">And there were – in front of us was a boss, you know people were standing, came around, people standing around, you know, they were nose – no – no – mousey – nosey to see what’s going on.</span> <span id="s1743">So it took about five, 10 minute here.</span> <span id="s1744">He took everything back up, something he took out, then put back, you know the Hungarian customs.</span> <span id="s1745">Then said – take the steps.</span> <span id="s1746">Okay, you can go.</span> <span id="s1747">We can – and immediately was the border, it was only a small river, a bridge.</span> <span id="s1748">We came – immediately was the Yugoslavian customs.</span> <span id="s1749">Came to Yugoslavian customs, I show them the paper, open the window.</span> <span id="s1750">Immediately, okay, you taking, what you are going, for how long, I said oh, he gave the stamp.</span> <span id="s1751">We left .</span> <span id="s1752">Well, we came to Yugoslavia, so we went to the seaside, about – and we thought that we will stay there til we will go to Austria, we will stay about for a few days, a little, to relax.</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">Q: In Dubrovnik?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: No, it was very close to dubr – yeah, th-the – next to the – between dubr – Dubrovnik and Split.</span> <span id="s1755">And then we stayed about for three, four days in a camp, and I said to my wife, you know, I am so nervous.</span> <span id="s1756">Better if here the opportunity come, we will go to Vienna, to Austria.</span> <span id="s1757">We will see what happen maybe there we will go.</span> <span id="s1758">And then my wife said okay, because she saw in everything what was going on, all these borders.</span> <span id="s1759">And I still – I said I didn’t even trust – I didn’t trust the Slovaks, I didn’t trust the Hungarian, and you know what?</span> <span id="s1760">I don’t even trust Yugoslavian.</span> <span id="s1761">Ega – even Yugoslavia, it was in even this time more liberal and many people escape after the Russian came into Yugoslavia from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1762">So okay, we went, immediately we went to Austria, we came to the Yugoslavian side on the border.</span> <span id="s1763">They – after – w-we stayed about four days there in Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s1764">They gave us the stamp only through the window, I didn’t have even to get out.</span> <span id="s1765">Then we came to the Austrian side, they pull up the – the – the thing to – on the border what they have there, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">Q: The barrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">A: The barrier and they – only there came the Austrian soldier or custom, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1768">And he want the passport, he wanted the visa.</span> <span id="s1769">And – and you know what he wanted?</span> <span id="s1770">He wanted the international insurance of my car.</span> <span id="s1771">So that’s – I sh-show him I had, and then he let us immediately go.</span> <span id="s1772">I cannot express what I said on the tape, what my expression was.</span> <span id="s1773">If you can stop for a moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: And I told to my wife, you heard the big jump, the big noise [indecipherable] and I – she says, no, and says, what happened?</span> <span id="s1776">How a big stone fell from my heart.</span> <span id="s1777">And I said, now even President Husák can lick my behind.</span> <span id="s1778">So – because now we are finally in a free country, and we are free.</span> <span id="s1779">Can you – and I started to cry, you know, I started to cry.</span> <span id="s1780">So that – that was a so – then, we came to Vienna, it was sometime late in the evening, and it – the next day it was a holiday in – in the Austria.</span> <span id="s1781">So we stayed in a camp.</span> <span id="s1782">The next day we went immediately in the morning to HIAS, and I registered, and then was – I spoke German.</span> <span id="s1783">And then was on HIAS in the office a woman, make a registration, and so on.</span> <span id="s1784">And I had my papers, I took out my birth certificate and so on.</span> <span id="s1785">And he was still proof if I am really Jewish.</span> <span id="s1786">And he said – he asked me the question, so if you are Jewish, where is the – what is the highest holiday in our religion?</span> <span id="s1787">I said, Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s1788">And I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1789">When I got up in the morning, you know what was my first word – word?</span> <span id="s1790">[speaks Hebrew here].</span> <span id="s1791">You know what it means, that translation?</span> <span id="s1792">Thank you God – God upstairs hermelek(ph), the king of all the holy works, and so on.</span> <span id="s1793">And I said, do you believe me?</span> <span id="s1794">I – I didn’t talk about the pull down the pants.</span> <span id="s1795">Yeah, so – and the women – we were laughing.</span> <span id="s1796">She says, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1797">And she says, don’t be mad, because we had, after the Russian came in, we had many people, Christian who came here and they said that they are Jews, because they knew that the Jewish organizations take more care of them than the Christians in their o-organizations, you know, the Catholics and all these organizations.</span> <span id="s1798">Say, Christians came and they had – and the woman told me, we had many occasions that Christians came to us, and we had to send them, give them the address we had, the Catholic organizations.</span> <span id="s1799">So – and we stayed there, but now you could see in Vienna, people who were escaping from Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s1800">Left cars on the street, left cars on the airport, because they couldn’t sell.</span> <span id="s1801">Everybody was glad to get rid, because they – as soon as they get permission go to Canada, to Australia, to Sweden, to America immediately.</span> <span id="s1802">They di – they left everything there.</span> <span id="s1803">And I had almost a new car, so – and I told this guy who asked me about the high holidays, you know, I said, do you know what?</span> <span id="s1804">I have almost a new car, and I would like to get some money, because we don’t have money, we don’t have currency, nothing.</span> <span id="s1805">If someone would give me some few shillings, some few hundreds, or some dollars or so.</span> <span id="s1806">He says, you know what?</span> <span id="s1807">I have a friend, he has a dealership, maybe he will buy because he’s a Czechoslovak guy and sells Czechoslovak cars, wa – running, because Czechoslovakia was exporting some cars to Austria.</span> <span id="s1808">So I went there, yeah, we stayed there in – in the – yeah, and they ga-gave us a address where we can go to stay a few nights til we’re – that transport, because they started to, in this time were people, many people came from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia, from Poland, many people.</span> <span id="s1809">So they made always a transport train – car, went straight to Rome, because in Rome, the HIAS was the main concentration, the main office.</span> <span id="s1810">So after a – the second or third day he told me, you know what?</span> <span id="s1811">Go show – there he gave me the address.</span> <span id="s1812">Show the car, he probably will buy from you.</span> <span id="s1813">So I went there, he liked the car, so he – he bought the car.</span> <span id="s1814">So at least I didn’t have to leave the car.</span> <span id="s1815">He gave me, I don’t know how many hundred dollars.</span> <span id="s1816">So at least we had [indecipherable] some money.</span> <span id="s1817">And I left the car with everything there, so I said, at least something.</span> <span id="s1818">And then, usually after three or four days they make – they had the – had th-the 30 or 40 people, some a – sometimes even 70 people, so they made two rail cars, and send to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1819">And – yo, and everybody has to go immediately, HIAS sent you to a doctor, he was a Jewish doctor, originally from Poland, but he lived in Austria for many years already, like for a check-up if you are capable, if you are able to go to take the [indecipherable] to go, or [indecipherable] to go to Rome.</span> <span id="s1820">And we went there, and I started to tell him a little bit the story, what I went through, the few days.</span> <span id="s1821">And I said, you know doctor, I’ve ba – ba – ap – appealed to you.</span> <span id="s1822">We – my wife is not so healthy and I – you know, always this nervous break, what was.</span> <span id="s1823">If you can give her some medication and to check her up more and after three or four days, if something really was happened, because she has kidney problems – problems, and it was true.</span> <span id="s1824">And he told he – he started to talk to my Yiddish.</span> <span id="s1825">And he says, in Yiddish, you know, tell me the truth, Vienna is a nice city.</span> <span id="s1826">Probably you want to stay to see the city.</span> <span id="s1827">And I telled him, you know what, it’s one of the reasons too.</span> <span id="s1828">A-And he said, you know what?</span> <span id="s1829">I give you, you will stay two weeks in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1830">Stay, but you know, and I thought to my wife – to myself, better to tell the truth straight and what happens, happen.</span> <span id="s1831">And he – then he told me, you know, I like you because you told me that you liked to stay in Vienna.</span> <span id="s1832">So then we – we stayed in Vienna for two weeks, so we looked a little, and at least it helped us, special me, get a little – a normal feeling, a normal life, because no – otherwise, I was on the bottom, really.</span> <span id="s1833">I was completely eshi – exhausted – exhausted.</span> <span id="s1834">So then we stayed there, and then we, after two weeks they send us to – to Rome.</span> <span id="s1835">There we registered in the HIAS, and immediately – it was very good organized there, and immediately they gave us – because in Rome there were all over signs that say, lease apartments, special for refugees becal – twas meant – so, we took out an apartment.</span> <span id="s1836">And the hia – HIAS, actually Joint, gave the money that what we paid for the rent, and they gave some pocket money that you can buy some food or something, minimum, but it was enough.</span> <span id="s1837">And after three months or so, because when I went in Czechoslovakia gymnasium, I learned Latin, we had the subject Latin.</span> <span id="s1838">So after three months I started to speak Italian.</span> <span id="s1839">So then was the – the – the president in HIAS was a Romanian woman who spoke – spoke Hungarian.</span> <span id="s1840">And then as – she saw that I spoke Italian, I spoke Hungarian, and I spoke Polish, and I spoke Russian, I spoke Czech.</span> <span id="s1841">So – and the other woman my – my – who was in charge, my caseworker, she was a Romanian too, and she spoke – spoke Hungarian too.</span> <span id="s1842">So said one thing to other, and I talked to them, so they hired me that I was a interpreter in HIAS for all those people, because many people came, special from Poland, from Hungary, from Romania.</span> <span id="s1843">So I was working one year approximately on HIAS like a interpreter.</span> <span id="s1844">So, me, my wife actually stayed in Rome 15 months.</span> <span id="s1845">And between this time it helped a lot, because we received money like refugees, like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1846">And beside that, Joint paid me like a employee on HIAS.</span> <span id="s1847">So we started to travel a little bit in Italy, and I spoke Italian.</span> <span id="s1848">So actually in – was in – my job was there.</span> <span id="s1849">At least once a week, sometimes twice a week, I went to the railroad station in Rome every – in the morning, around eight o’clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s1850">And always came one railroad car, or two cars, it depends how many people came.</span> <span id="s1851">And in ad – in advance, I had all the names who is coming, how many people.</span> <span id="s1852">And I have to tell you, I – some Italian police were accompanying each car from the border to Rome, that nobody can come in in those car.</span> <span id="s1853">No Italian police to check if regular or not.</span> <span id="s1854">And when they came to Rome to me at those stations, they knew me already, all those people.</span> <span id="s1855">I [inaudible] have to tell you, I gave them money, because I had – I – I had the envelope from the Joint, from – I gave the two guys envelope and I told them – they told me, buongiorno Mikula, buongiorno.</span> <span id="s1856">A come sta, how you feel and so on.</span> <span id="s1857">I said, buongiorno signore, I gave them the envelope, arrivederci.</span> <span id="s1858">And that’s was I took over all the people I took them to HIAS for registration.</span> <span id="s1859">There they get all – they received all the instruction farther, and then I was working [indecipherable] people to give adva – adva – advice, to help them what I have to do.</span> <span id="s1860">And then I took all the pa – what someone had introduce on different consulates, you know for the visas or so on.</span> <span id="s1861">So I went with them to interpret on the – on the consulate because I spoke Italian there.</span> <span id="s1862">And then I took all the passports, and all papers, translation, everything, to all those consulates for what – for – for verification, because usually they get permission, the Italian government gave permission for refugees for three months.</span> <span id="s1863">Who stayed longer, I had to go to the police, I had to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get permission.</span> <span id="s1864">So that’s what I did for HIAS, what I went then – and then all the transport, what all they sent for example, many people to Canada or to us, or I accompanied these people to the airport.</span> <span id="s1865">And sometimes people came illegally to – they send them from Belgrade or from Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1866">So I went to the airport, I took over those people and took to the – not to the e-exit with other people, but to the – to the Italian police, you know, to the commandant of the airport.</span> <span id="s1867">And he knew everything, so he gave the permission, and then when I took them to HIAS, you know, because those people didn’t have visas.</span> <span id="s1868">So that’s what I – I did.</span> <span id="s1869">I did a lot of this kind of things what helped people actually to come to Italy and then to help them to – to make translation, that – like a [indecipherable] a translator to them, even privately with the – with the – when they were looking for apartments, and so on.</span> <span id="s1870">So I was busy enough, but during the weekend I could go out, so I can relax a little bit, so that’s – we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: Let me – let me just take you back for a second to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: I – I might even remember all these details and everything, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: You said that when you – when you were stopped at the border, and you had hidden your papers, you thought of the – the prayer book that you had hidden during the war.</span> <span id="s1874">After the war, did you – did you go back to practicing Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1875">A: I went, and in the begin – the first year, you know, this prayer book, the – I don’t know what’s happened, because maybe the – if something – because yeah, all the furniture, all the clothing, everything what we – when we left Czechoslovakia we had to leave there, and the government took it over.</span> <span id="s1876">Even they gave it to someone or someone – someone bought it.</span> <span id="s1877">So an – for example, it was – and they took here and we – we were – after awhile when they saw that they – we didn’t came back, they sentenced us, me and my wife to two years in prison in ab – in absentia, because we left illegally.</span> <span id="s1878">So that means if we would go back during those period, there it was the communist, first we will go in jail, maybe they will for two years, maybe th – even more.</span> <span id="s1879">So when they started to liquidate – before they started liquidate all our furnitures, and everything, so my wife’s mother went to the police.</span> <span id="s1880">She wanted to get at least the couch what we had.</span> <span id="s1881">She had to buy it, and it took her a lot of work.</span> <span id="s1882">She get, and she had to pay the police to get the couch what belongs to her daughter.</span> <span id="s1883">So she has – I told her – later she had enough guts even to go to the police, first of all.</span> <span id="s1884">So then the first – the first – 1946 - ’47, I used to go to a shul in Liberec.</span> <span id="s1885">It was a small minyan, few Jews.</span> <span id="s1886">But then when, special from 1948, it was very dangerous to show that you are religious, or you are keeping the – the – your faith, special Jewish faith.</span> <span id="s1887">Even Christians, Christians were, under communism, were afraid to go to a church.</span> <span id="s1888">They didn’t go, even they were religious.</span> <span id="s1889">So then – and when I came back, in 1991, after 22 years, to Czechoslovakia, and I went to Liberec – so the first thing Friday evening I went – because I have a friend of mine, a Jewish guy who lived there, and I ask him, do you still have prayer, do you have some Jews here and so on.</span> <span id="s1890">He says, hardly we make a minyan on Friday evening.</span> <span id="s1891">So I said, I-I came there, and I came there Friday evening and made the minyan til we were about 10 or 11 people with – including me.</span> <span id="s1892">And later – so then – oh, and this time was more, the later and later years, in 1933 - ’34, it was hardly a minyan.</span> <span id="s1893">So and some people told me, you know, I remember when I had about, in 1946 – ’47 a old guy, so I remember you used to come, and so on.</span> <span id="s1894">And then later on they had very few re – Jews.</span> <span id="s1895">And then they came, for example, for the high holidays, they came Jews from cities or from villages who were about 10 - 20 miles away from Michalovce, so they came for the high holidays [indecipherable] little like one room what they have there.</span> <span id="s1896">From somewhere they get a Sefer Torah and a – all.</span> <span id="s1897">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">Q: Was that during the communist regime?</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1900">And then he says, for example, even Friday evening when they don’t have a minyan, so they pray even eight or nine people, and they have sa – two or three women, so said, we take the women like a minyan.</span> <span id="s1901">And then i-in last few years, I was there last time about two years ago, yeah, two years ago, because I went every year there, Friday.</span> <span id="s1902">And then later years I gave him I – a sum of money, I spent them some – left them some dollars to help him.</span> <span id="s1903">And they were very grateful always.</span> <span id="s1904">And now finally they’re – after – after 1990, when it was [break] In 1991, there in Liberec [indecipherable] the whole house, so there was some apartments.</span> <span id="s1905">Upstairs they were renting it.</span> <span id="s1906">Downstairs, they had two rooms with everything, with Torahs and everything, with some curtains.</span> <span id="s1907">And now, after about two or three years ago, they decided, and there in Liberec, where the German 1938 on Kristallnacht, they destroyed a beautiful, beautiful, nice, big synagogue, they – the Czechoslovak government and the Jewish organizations from Prague gave some money, and they are starting, I think, last year to build so-called library.</span> <span id="s1908">But the main part of the library will be a Jewish synagogue with everything like a normal synagogue.</span> <span id="s1909">Two years ago I say – I-I – they showed me the whole plan, even they have in – on tapes, pictures how the building will – will look, and it will be a bi – because now it is there a parking lot.</span> <span id="s1910">So on the same place where the – a st – beautiful, in the center of the city, next to the big theater, and t-to city hall, actually, behind the corner, there will be built a new – a li – a new, big library, but the main part will be a beautiful, nice synagogue.</span> <span id="s1911">So I am looking forward next – no, this year in – in September, I am going there, so – to Liberec so – because I will be in Prague and I will be staying in a spa.</span> <span id="s1912">We are going there almost every year, there is a spa not far from Liberec, about 15 miles.</span> <span id="s1913">It’s for arthritis and it helps us, so there we are going every year.</span> <span id="s1914">So I will go there, I will talk to my friend, and I’ll look how far, what this – because last year I couldn’t go there, I – even I was in the Czech Republic, but wait, I was there?</span> <span id="s1915">Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, but it wasn’t started yet, so I hope that started.</span> <span id="s1916">And even he called me last year, and they received a van, because they have like a small community there now, about 15 people, about eight or nine families who live there.</span> <span id="s1917">And they received a van, a used van from Germany, but they didn’t have papers.</span> <span id="s1918">So one day he wro-wro – I’m sorry – he wrote me a letter that if a – if I can ge – get someone papers from here, from General Motors, because it was a General Motors van, because otherwise the police in Liberec, they couldn’t get Czechoslovak papers for the va-van because it was a present and they don’t have the papers.</span> <span id="s1919">So I called General Motors here.</span> <span id="s1920">General Motors send me in Canada – what

Europe representative, so gave me – they gave me – they – in Czechoslovakia they gave me his address – the address of this office, they gave me the phone number, and I called him up, that it will be

today about that.</span> <span id="s1942">So, if we – if we don’t – if we don’t have to, here and there, it reminds us what happened, certainly, but it – not to send it that’s in – that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Have you told anybody else about this – your experiences, have you talked about them before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: No, only this woman what I showed

Handelman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: And she’s a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: So you’ve told schoolchildren about –</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s1973">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">Q: Is – is there anything in particular – well, you s – you said last time that yo-you had nightmares occasionally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">A: You know it’s happened, I just told that the day before yesterday, my wife, just last week I was again in Europe and I was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1976">But, I was not this kind of Germany, it was like after the war Germany.</span> <span id="s1977">And I said – and I woke up that I was afraid that I thought some hakenkreuzer(ph) somewhere.</span> <span id="s1978">And that’s was all, but it was a – were only a few days ago, but for years I didn’t have [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1979">I had many some years ago, or maybe a year or so, that I was under communists in Czechoslovakia, that I had some dream, that I – we went – we went [indecipherable] for vacation, suddenly it was communism.</span> <span id="s1980">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Are there experiences, or moments during the day that – that trigger memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: Oh yeah, those – these come more often.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: What</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: The – how it was.</span> <span id="s1985">For example, a – for example a wa – how it was actually, how come that when I was working for example, between two groups til I get two groups, and it tooks me a few days and in wintertime, just few days in winter reminds me that I went in so deep snow and helped the guy where I was staying with him to go to the forest and make wood, you know, how you call –</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Chop the wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Chop wood, yeah.</span> <span id="s1988">Just came few days there to my mind in a deep snow in January.</span> <span id="s1989">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: So you were in the partisans then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah [indecipherable] few days I left.</span> <span id="s1992">So – but not so often, here and there.</span> <span id="s1993">For example I was working for – a few days ago on a movie.</span> <span id="s1994">I was looking – oh a few days ago when they – they repeat “Schindler List,” so I was watching it.</span> <span id="s1995">My wife wouldn’t – she didn’t want to – to watch it a second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: She gets upset over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1998">So it comes in many times, but experiences what you cannot forget, and like I said many times, and I saw people that are not satisfied, that’s this and this.</span> <span id="s1999">And I said to her, first of all, ye – all what I met here i – one thing is the best – not what I met, what I’m say – telling them, this is the wa – the best country in the world and I’m [indecipherable] people, they don’t appreciate enough that – they don’t appreciate enough, they don’t realize what country they were born, or wa – which country they are living.</span> <span id="s2000">They have the opportunity to live in a country like United States.</span> <span id="s2001">And I said, and I – something and someone [indecipherable] and I said, you know what?</span> <span id="s2002">Thanks God, every morning I said thanks God, one more day alive.</span> <span id="s2003">And if someone would tell me 1944 – ’42 - ’43, that I will be one day 30 years old, I would tell him he is crazy, because I was looking if next hour I will be still alive, not what will be in a few years.</span> <span id="s2004">So I – and I talk to my wife, and she knows that, hear me tell all this, the whole, the – the main thing, to be healthy, to take the life like it goes and take advantage as much as possible, and live your normal life and that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: And travel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: And travel.</span> <span id="s2007">Oh, that’s what – we like to travel, we like to go to – not – not too much to movies, but to operas, to – to ballet, we still are going even now, here and there, to Masonic Temple, to Fox theater.</span> <span id="s2008">And – and museums.</span> <span id="s2009">Every year, at least once a year we are going here in Detroit to the art museum.</span> <span id="s2010">At least once a year we are going to the zoo.</span> <span id="s2011">And where we

id="s2014">A: And the immigration.</span> <span id="s2015">So that’s – we went there because it was very interested – very interesting.</span> <span id="s2016">And I saw there people who came to this country are the people who live, for example, mostly from Poland, even they showed them some from Czechoslovakia, and from Hungary.</span> <span id="s2017">Really they showed how the people lived there and I – so I closed my eyes and I saw my li – how I lived at home in Czechoslovakia before the war.</span> <span id="s2018">That’s what they showed us there.</span> <span id="s2019">So it was very entertaining, we were very glad that we enter.</span> <span id="s2020">And now we are going, next week we are going to the art museum again, because here is a exhibit about the i – ivory exhibit there, and very [indecipherable] very nice.</span> <span id="s2021">And be wi – this time we took a – a walk, even we had there many times, a little there.</span> <span id="s2022">We like paintings

Delta, and the first time we had years ago with pa – what does –</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: Pan-American?</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Probably it’s Pan-American.</span> <span id="s2037">And maybe they give too mu – and we didn’t need so many miles like we need today, maybe that’s why they went bankrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: Have you been to the museum in Washington, the Holocaust Museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: No, we – two years ago, even we paid the money to go to Washington, it was a group from Temple Israel.</span> <span id="s2040">And we came to the airport and we couldn’t go because something was wrong with the plane, so we had to go back there, and we got refi – refunds for the money, and for – but, we are planning to go.</span>
