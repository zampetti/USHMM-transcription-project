persons camps were the camps to which the survivors of the holocaust who were found alive on German concentration camps on German soil and on Austrian soil were placed after they had been liberated by the advancing allied armies.</span> <span id="s3">In other words they were camps were these survivors lived and the main Jewish survivors until the time came for them to migrate to other countries where they had chosen to live for the remainder of their lives.</span> <span id="s4">Their sojourn in the camps began after they had been moved out of the concentration camps soon after their liberation and they lived in the camps until they left for the countries where they had chosen to</span></p> <p><span id="s5">go.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: There were a good number of displaced person's camps and they varied both in size and in nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">For example (um) there was a displaced person's camp in Stuttgart which in reality had no appearance as a camp.</span> <span id="s8">It was a series of (um) what we would call apartment houses which had been taken over by the American Army and to which (um) the amy had placed Jewish survivors from German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s9">On the other hand, there was a ki.</span> <span id="s10">.</span> <span id="s11">, there was a DP camp like um L___berg, where there were when I visited it over 6,000 survivors and which had been a large camp for military purposes which had been used also by the foreign workers who had come to Germany to help the German effort in industry during the war.</span> <span id="s12">So there are all kinds Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 2 of Displaced Person's camps.</span> <span id="s14">Um in addition, there um groups of survivors who lived in a place that could not be termed a DP camp.</span> <span id="s15">For example, there were some Hungarian Jewish women who had been liberated in a from a concentration camp in Germany and who had gone to an um small town in Northern Germany nearby where they just lived together in whatever kind of housing they could find.</span> <span id="s16">They lived as um a group.</span> <span id="s17">I don't know whether you could call them a DP camp, but in essence it was.</span> <span id="s18">So as I said at the outset there were different kinds of DP camps as to the number of them I'm not exactly sure.</span> <span id="s19">Perhaps 20 more or</span></p> <p><span id="s20">less.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: That's um a difficult question to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">And I'll tell you why.</span> <span id="s23">Perhaps at the um time of the liberation of the German concentration camps, there may have been a total of 50,000 Jewish survivors in the American zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s24">Remember that Germany immediately after the defeat of the German army was divided among four conquering armies and were governed by the British, the Russians, the French, and the Americans.</span> <span id="s25">The largest zone in Germany was the American zone.</span> <span id="s26">and there were about 50,000 Jewish survivors in the American zone, but Jews kept coming in to the American zone of Germany, day by day, and soon the number was not 50,000 but 80,000 by soon I mean in a period of um a month, six weeks or more.</span> <span id="s27">I am now speaking only of the American zone in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: It was a very difficult problem that had to Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 3 be dealt with.</span> <span id="s30">And a problem that had been unforeseen by the American military authorities who had long planned for the kind of governance they would establish in a defeated Germany.</span> <span id="s31">The um American plans called once Germany would be defeated, for the liberation of course of all those found in German concentration camps.</span> <span id="s32">And for the return of all those survivors to the countries from which they had come.</span> <span id="s33">And that was to be done within 90 days, so the plans called for.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">And indeed after the concentration camps had been liberated, the American military authorities worked efficiently and within 90 days the um the Belgians, the French, the Greeks, the Poles, whoever um whoever were found in the concentration camps who wanted to go back to their homelands were sent home.</span> <span id="s35">But the military planners had not foreseen the fact that there would be Jews in the concentration camps, they would be the largest number and there would be people who would not or could not return to their homeland.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">They could not because their homes and their businesses in their native countries had been seized by their former neighbors.</span> <span id="s37">They knew that if they returned and tried to reclaim their homes and businesses that they would be set upon, attacked, and perhaps even killed, and indeed, that did happen with the few Jews who did go back and who tried to regain what they had once owned.</span> <span id="s38">So, most of the Jews didn't want to back because they could not.</span> <span id="s39">There were no homes for them to return to.</span> <span id="s40">In addition, they would not, because, the lands where they had lived and at the moment I am thinking particularly of Poland as well as the Baltic countries, that they knew that their former neighbors in many cases had reported on their whereabouts to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">That they could not live among those people who were responsible for their having suffered during the years of the war in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s42">And who had been Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 4 responsible for the fact that their nearest and dearest ones had been killed either on their native soil or in the concentration camps later.</span> <span id="s44">They knew that the countries from which they had come were now lands where the soil had been polluted by the blood of their loved ones, the very air had been polluted by the smoke of the concentration camps that had come out of the crematorium where members of their families had been burned.</span> <span id="s45">At least their bodies had been burned.</span> <span id="s46">So as I said at the outset, they could not return they would not return.</span> <span id="s47">They wanted to live elsewhere.</span> <span id="s48">So the American army found these people who would not go anywhere who could not go anywhere, and no plans had been um ar arranged for such people beforehand, because the problem had had not been foreseen.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Long pause</span></p> <p><span id="s50">JWB: JUDAH NADICH: The conditions of course varied from camp to camp.</span> <span id="s51">But by in large I think the following conditions were pretty much accurate or if not all the camps most of the camps.</span> <span id="s52">Firstly, the housing was inadequate, that is they were crowded, the survivors were crowded in the housing.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">There were not enough beds and mattresses to go around.</span> <span id="s54">In addition, many of the structures were poor wooded structures that would not be good enough for the oncoming winter.</span> <span id="s55">In some of the structures and some of the buildings, the um water supply was insufficient, and there were often leeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">So generally, the housing was not what it should have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Secondly, they weren't getting enough food.</span> <span id="s58">These were people who had been malnourished for years under the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 5 Germans.</span> <span id="s60">They were now suffering from malnutrition and they weren't getting enough calories.</span> <span id="s61">When more calories were added very often those calories came from the wrong sources.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">They were given a lot of potatoes and bread.</span> <span id="s63">Sometimes, even that wasn't good, the bread was stale the potatoes were rotten.</span> <span id="s64">So, food was a problem.</span> <span id="s65">In addition, um they lacked all kinds of things for which to occupy their time.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">They had um no means of doing any kind of work.</span> <span id="s67">Um those who had been musicians before the war and who were very anxious to get their hands and fingers on a musical instu.</span> <span id="s68">.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">instrument again didn't have those.</span> <span id="s70">Uh even those who wanted to spend some time um exercising, sports, using what we call um in American soccer ball to play with, didn't have those things.</span> <span id="s71">Of course, uh some people might say those are unimportant things.</span> <span id="s72">But for people who had been without everything for years, every little thing was important.</span> <span id="s73">Uh their clothing lacked much to be desired.</span> <span id="s74">Their clothing was was poor.</span> <span id="s75">It certainly was not enough for the oncoming winter.</span> <span id="s76">They needed umb warm clothing of all kinds.</span> <span id="s77">Uh beginning with underwear, and going all the way up to uh overcoats.</span> <span id="s78">And hats and caps.</span> <span id="s79">Their shoes were in bad condition.</span> <span id="s80">They needed shoes of all kinds.</span> <span id="s81">They needed medical attention, although I uh must say at this point that doctors, Jewish doctors among the survivors as soon as liberation took place, tried to take care of their fellow uh now liberated uh inmates of of the the former concentration camps.</span> <span id="s82">But they didn't have medicines, they didn't have medical instruments or surgical instruments.</span> <span id="s83">Uh the teeth of the survivors were in terrible condition.</span> <span id="s84">They had had not dental care all through the years of the war and their teeth needed immediate uh inspection and treatment.</span> <span id="s85">Uh there were dentists among the survivors who would have been glad to go to work on that, but they had nothing with which Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 6 to work.</span> <span id="s87">Uh in addition, uh they needed materials from which to make uh false teeth for example, bridges and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">I'm just telling you that which comes to mind at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">But the most important things they needed were better housing, better food, better clothing, and other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">(SWB interjects....) Oh, I've excuse me, I've left out one of the most important things.</span> <span id="s91">That is when the war when the war was over and they were transferred to concentration camps to to uh DP camps.</span> <span id="s92">Among the survivors there were none Jews.</span> <span id="s93">Many of those non Jews were victims of the Germans.</span> <span id="s94">They were sent home as I told you a little earlier, within 90 days after liberation.</span> <span id="s95">There were other non Jews who did not go home, who were they?</span> <span id="s96">They had come from Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s97">Most of them had come to Germany willingly as volunteers, to help in the German war effort.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Since many of the Germans who had worked in the factories, most of them were now in the German armed forces, there was need for additional industrial workers to take care their places.</span> <span id="s99">And many men and women had come from the countries of Eastern Europe as volunteers.</span> <span id="s100">They got good pay, they received good food, add .</span> <span id="s101">.</span> <span id="s102">adequate housing, and they worked in the war effort.</span> <span id="s103">But as soon as the Germans lost the war, they pronounced the war, they pronounced themselves survivors and they were placed into displaced persons camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Now, the problem with that was first of all, there was a built-in anti Semitism on the part of almost all of these non-Jewish workers who had come to help the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Secondly, they had been well feed all through the years of the war, and if efforts were now to be made to give more food to the Jews suffering from malnutrition they would only pour oil on the fires of anti-Semitism and would lead to disputes and conflicts and who knows what else between the Jews and the non-Jews in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s106">So one of the first Working

position as advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish Affairs, was to see to it that his orders of late August, I believe August 22nd, should be carried out, namely the orders to establish DP camps in which the sole inhabitants would be Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s108">So that was a very great need that had to be taken care of at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">JWB: JUDAH NADICH: Oh yes, Umb, there were certain camps, particularly, in Bavaria, under the supervision of the American Third Army, commanded by General Patton, like Feldafing and Landsberg, where the camps were locked, and where the Jewish inmates were permitted to leave camp only by means of a pass system that permitted a small percentage of them to go out of the camp on these passes and of course they returned to the camp before the end of the day.</span> <span id="s110">The Jewish survivors in the DP camps could look beyond the barbed wire that surrounded their camp, they could see German civilians walking on the roads, they knew that the Germans had been the enemy of the American Army, yet the Germans were free to come and go as they please, but they who had been liberated by the American Army did not have that privilege.</span> <span id="s111">They were confined behind barbed wire to a DP camp with only a small percentage permitted to go out for a few hours each day.</span> <span id="s112">Moreover, psychologically, they had been behind barbed wire in German concentration camps, now liberated they were still behind barbed wire.</span> <span id="s113">I think that may have been among the first if not the very first complaints that I heard when I met with a committee of Jewish survivors in the Feldafing--???</span> <span id="s114">Displaced persons</span></p>

NADICH Page 8</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Long pause</span></p> <p><span id="s119">SWB:</span></p> <p><span id="s120">NB: Dean Earl Harrison of the umb Law School of the University of Pennsylvania was appointed by President Truman to umb examine the conditions in the DP camps.</span> <span id="s121">During the month of June, 1945 newspaper correspondents, foreign correspondents, in Germany had umb sent back stories to the American press that there were Jewish survivors of the Nazi Nazi concentration camps living in Displaced Person's Camps under the American army who's living conditions were abominable.</span> <span id="s122">And that created quite a stir, evidently, in the United States and President Turman as I said appointed the Dean of the Law School of the University of of Pennsylvania, Dean Earl G Harriman, Harrison , excuse me, to umb examine the camps and to report to him to see whether or not the reports of the umb war correspondent were accurate.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Umb, Dean Harrison came to Europe and he was accompanied by Dr. Joseph Jay Swartz who was a Euro European Head of Operations for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s124">And he visited the camps in Germany in the American Zone and he came back to umb Washington and submitted his report.</span> <span id="s125">The uh report caused a number of cables to go from Washington to General Eisenhower's Headquarters in Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s126">Uh first uh General Marshall who was Chief of Staff got in touch with umb General Eisenhower and told him that he soon would be getting a summary of the report of Dean uh Earl Harrison that it it was not a good report that it did not put the American Army in a good light.</span> <span id="s127">And then umb I believe it was on August the 10th, I'm certain of that date, August the 10th, General Eisenhower got a cable from the Secretary of War, umb his Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 9 name was Secretary Stimpson who gave General Eisenhower a summary of the umb Harrison Report and said that the Report contained some very damaging descriptions of conditions in the Displaced Person's camps administered by the American Army and what did General Eisenhower expect to do to correct the situation, but also told him that in do course he would be receiving the entire Har ah Harrison report.</span> <span id="s129">Uh that uh report was a reason for the creation of a position that was rather unique in the History of the American Military.</span> <span id="s130">The creation of an advisor to a Commanding General on Jewish conditions in the area of Command of the General.</span> <span id="s131">General Eisenhower sent back a cable the day after he had received the Stimpson cable to say that he was creating a position of Advisor to General Eisenhower to himself on Jewish Affairs to be filled by an American Army Jewish Chaplin.</span> <span id="s132">And that was the reason for my being order to uh fly from Paris where I had been stationed for about a year to Frankfurt to undertake my new responsibilities.</span> <span id="s133">Long pause</span></p> <p><span id="s134">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: One of the questions uh in my questionnaire that I had prepared for myself before visiting any of the DP camps was precisely that where did these people want to go assuming that there would be no barrier to going to lands they had chosen.</span> <span id="s135">Between 70 and 75 per cent of them said they wanted to go to the country then known as Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Others chose other countries, United States, Canada, Australia, countries in South America.</span> <span id="s137">Usually because they had realities living in those countries to whom they could</span></p> <p><span id="s138">go.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">SWB: Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 10 JUDAH NADICH: They could not go because they had no means with which to go.</span> <span id="s141">They had no funds, they didn't have decent clothing on their backs.</span> <span id="s142">They were many of them weak because of malnutrition.</span> <span id="s143">And in addition, there was the obstacle of immigration laws that limited the number of people that could arrive in any of these before mentioned countries.</span> <span id="s144">Great Britain had been appealed to just uh a short while before the time that about which I speak by President Truman to grant special visas to 100,000 of these people.</span> <span id="s145">Great Britain didn't act upon General Truman's request.</span> <span id="s146">American immigrations laws were strict and permitted for very small numbers to come from the lands of Eastern Europe.</span> <span id="s147">And most of people in the concentration camps were Jews who had come from Eastern European lands.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">So there were all kinds of reasons for their not being able to go forthwith to go to the countries of their choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: I can't tell you about umb Bergen-Belsen I can't answer that question because Bergenbelsen was under British Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s150">I wasn't allowed into the British Zone of Germany unless I requested special permission.</span> <span id="s151">I had more than enough to do with my responsibilities in the American Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s152">All that I can tell you in answer that I question is that I had gotten requests uh from London from uh a number of leaders of the Jewish Community in that city to send to them copies of the military orders creating by post and its duties to them in London so that they might request uh uh General Montgomery to create a similar position that is Advisor to the Commanding General on Jewish Affairs for the British Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s153">General Montgomery</span></p> <p><span id="s154">refused point blank.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

officer in charge together with an _______ and one or more people sent by the JDC (The Joint Distribution Committee).</span> <span id="s159">These officers frequently and their superiors that is captains and majors above them had little knowledge what had transpired during the years of the war and particularly no knowledge whatsoever as to what had happened to the Jews during the war.</span> <span id="s160">For the most part, very few of them knew anything at all about the umb treatment _______the Jews by the Nazi's.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">I'm sorry to say that some of them uh had a little bit of anti-Semitism within them which was to have been expected.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Because members of the American Army were uh a broad cross section of the American people.</span> <span id="s163">I think that in 1941, uh the year that uh war was declared in the United States, in December of that year, there was far more anti-Semitism in the United States than there is in 1995.</span> <span id="s164">There had been uh anti-semitic perchers and speakers on the radio, there was no television then, but on the radio, week in and week out.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Like Father Coglin (?)</span> <span id="s166">Gerald L. K. Smith and others, and I'm sure that their words spoken week in and week out had an effect.</span> <span id="s167">So to come back to the subject, there was anti Semitism on the part of some if not all of American Military officers and even more, there was little knowledge on their part and some cases they were doing a job that they didn't like doing, that they didn't want to do because it wasn't strictly speaking a military position, something that they had expected when they entered the army.</span> <span id="s168">So very often, the umb military men placed in charge of camps provided problems.</span> <span id="s169">Mind you, some of them were good hearted people, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP 2/8/95 RABBI JUDAH NADICH Page 12 and they tried to do what they thought was best, but they were young men.</span> <span id="s171">They were dealing with people who not only had suffered greatly under the Germans during World War II, but who before the war, many of these survivors had been prominent people in their home cities.</span> <span id="s172">They were older mature people, and yet they were lorded over by perhaps a young lieutenant in his early twenties who thought that he knew what was best for them.</span> <span id="s173">In addition to this, I must say that the orders that inundated from General Eisenhower's Headquarters in Frankfurt were not always translated into action in the field.</span> <span id="s174">And that was a source of many</span></p> <p><span id="s175">problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">SWB:</span></p> <p><span id="s177">LN: There were many Americans, many military Americans who were of great help.</span> <span id="s178">And that should be underscored.</span> <span id="s179">There many Americans who overlooked military regulations in order to help the survivors.</span> <span id="s180">In addition, the umb divisions that first liberated the camps, did everything that they possibly could to help the strickened men and women and even some children whom they found in the concentration camps that they had liberated.</span> <span id="s181">I know that American army medical men and women worked around the clock to help save the lives of the survivors in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s182">Many of them they could not save.</span> <span id="s183">They were too far gone and they died in the hands of their American rescuers, but doctors, surgeons, nurses worked 24 hours a day after their units had captured a concentration camp in order to help save the Jews whom they could possibly save.</span> <span id="s184">So all praise to them, and to the many other American military people who helped saved the lives of many Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s185">May I give you just one interesting example.</span> <span id="s186">In Austria, Southberg, I called upon Working transcript: not spell checked or

Austria.</span> <span id="s190">But there weren't many like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: No they were not.</span> <span id="s192">And if I go back a little bit when I was still stationed in Paris.</span> <span id="s193">The uh Jewish underground that had just begun to operate in conquered Europe and in liberated Europe, one of their leaders came to see me and to say that there were about some six hundred Jews who were to be moved across the S-------L________ boarders, from Germany into France and down to Marseilles where they were to be put uh aboard a so called illegal ship that was to try to run the British Blockade and to land these people, these survivors in Palestine.</span> <span id="s194">He came to see me because he lacked food for the people who were to be aboard ship for who knows uh a week, ten days, two weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">It had come to my attention that there were warehouses, American Army warehouses in Paris full of of survivor food kits that had been dispatched to Paris for forwarding through Switzerland to American prisoners of war in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">The war in Europe was now over.</span> <span id="s197">These prisoner of war packages were no longer needed.</span> <span id="s198">American military prisoners of war were sent home at once, as soon as they were liberated.</span> <span id="s199">These uh food packages were being stolen regularly and they were appearing on the French black market.</span> <span id="s200">I went to the American Quartermaster General in Paris, asked him if I could remove these prisoner of war packages from these several warehouse because a number of Jewish survivors were being moved from one place to another.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Working

<span id="s203">He quickly signed the order.</span> <span id="s204">He understood what I was asking him for.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Long pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: I had gotten a request from the Jewish Agency representative in Paris to try to get some food for a shipment of people who were being brought across the S_______L_______ boarders from Germany into France down to Marseilles where they were to board so called illegal ships to try to run the blockade put up by the British and to get these survivors into Palestine.</span> <span id="s207">I had learned that there were American prisoner of war packages in several American military warehouses in Paris which were no longer need because our prisoners of war had already been sent back home.</span> <span id="s208">I went to the QuarterMaster General at Headquarters in Paris.</span> <span id="s209">I told him that a group of Jews had to be moved, they were survivors I explained, had to be moved from one place to another.</span> <span id="s210">That they required food for the journey that there were these warehouses of American military of war packages in our warehouses in Paris, packages that would no longer be needed, that were already being stolen.</span> <span id="s211">That were already appearing on the French Black Market.</span> <span id="s212">I asked him would he not

David Ben-Gurion.</span> <span id="s329">And throughout his talk, there was sobbing, there were tears, and as the conclusion there were cheers.</span> <span id="s330">It was a scene that I shall never

Wise sent a cable through the American Embassy in London to Army Headquarters in Frankfurt asking General Eisenhower to appoint a Liaison Officer to coordinate the various efforts at helping the Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s369">That came to Army Headquarters at Frankfurt on the 7th day of August 1945.</span> <span id="s370">General Eisenhower replied on August 9th, two days later, saying he could not appoint a Jewish Liaison Officer.</span> <span id="s371">There were Liaison Officer's at Eisenhower's Headquarters, but they represented, each one, a different nation.</span> <span id="s372">There was a French Liaison Officer, there was British Liaison Officer, a Polish Liaison Officer, a Czech Liaison Officer, but the Jews are not a nation.</span> <span id="s373">So he rejected Rabbi Wise's request.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">The very next day on August th 10th, he got the cable from Secretary of War Stimpson, asking him what he was going to do about the report from Dean Earl Harrison and its critical report, the critical umb remarks about the American Army's care of the Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s375">So General Eisenhower replied that he was going appoint an advisor on Jewish Affairs, not a Liaison Officer, an Advisor.</span> <span id="s376">And on August 22nd he issued an order that despite the fact that Jews had come to concentration camps with the nationality of their native lands, Polish nationality, Lithuanian nationality, whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">That they were now to be regarded as stateless people, and therefore were to be

"stateless persons."</span> <span id="s380">Now General Montgomery, when he was asked by the leaders of the London Jewish Community to appoint an Advisor on Jewish Affairs, replied that he couldn't.</span> <span id="s381">Because he then he would have to appoint a Catholic Advisor, and a Protestant Advisor, and therefore he didn't appoint a Jewish Advisor.</span> <span id="s382">So the problem of "who were the Jews" reared its head throughout the discussions of what to do with the Jewish survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">JWB:</span></p> <p><span id="s384">long pause JUDAH

and honestly, that there was not a recommendation that I made to him to improve the lot of the Jewish survivors in the DP camp's that he did not address affirmative, at once.</span> <span id="s387">By issuing an order to rectify the situation.</span> <span id="s388">I uh call you attention particularly to the fact that hundreds, thousands of Jews, were coming into the American Zone of Germany from Poland, in particular, and from other Eastern lands.</span> <span id="s389">These were Jews in many cases, in most cases, who when Russia entered the war had been uprooted from their homes and their cities and cou and towns.</span> <span id="s390">And trucked back of the Russian lines all the way to Asiatic Russia, in order to keep them out of the battle zones.</span> <span id="s391">Now they

countries' where their families had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s394">So they began moving at first on their own, across across the S__________F______borders, from Poland into Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia into Austria, from Austria into the American Zone of Germany.</span> <span id="s395">The question was, "what to do with them?"</span> <span id="s396">Technically speaking, they were not defined as DP's.</span> <span id="s397">DP's according to army regulations on the orders, rather, were Jewish survivors found in concentration camps on German soil or on Austrian soil and who where then placed in DP camps in Germany and Austria.</span> <span id="s398">So these Jews arriving from Poland and Baltic countries were technically not DP's.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">What to do with them?</span> <span id="s400">They were coming across the borders and soon questions started coming into Eisenhower's office.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Uh we discussed the matter, I recommended that they be admitted to our DP camps which eventually would be emptied.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">And they would go to other countries.</span> <span id="s403">And Eisenhower issued an order saying that they were to be admitted and I don't know exactly how many were saved in this fashion.</span> <span id="s404">But I think it have been 80,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s405">On the other hand, Montgomery turned back such Jews as they tried to enter British Zone of Germany and issued orders that they were to be turned back by force.</span> <span id="s406">But you see the contrast between</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Eisenhower and Montgomery.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Long pause.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">What does what does he shoot when he.....</span></p> <p><span

the Jews in uh Bavaria, particularly in Zeldezing???</span> <span id="s413">but also elsewhere was that they were not allowed to leave the camp as they would like.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">But only a small percentage would be permitted to leave each day with a pass system.</span> <span id="s415">And they objected to that because despite the fact that they were now liberated, they still didn't enjoy freedom to come and go.</span> <span id="s416">They could look outside of the con the DP camp and see the Germans, the the former enemies of the Americans walking freely, but they the victims of the Germans whom the American's had liberated were not free to come and go as they please.</span> <span id="s417">And of course they objected vehemently to the barbed wire around the DP camp.</span> <span id="s418">It reminded them of the barbed wire around the German concentration camp.</span> <span id="s419">And one of their first requests to me was to try to do something to have the barbed wire removed and the pa pass system abolished.</span> <span id="s420">That was incorporated in my report to General Eisenhower through General Smith and orders were issued to have the pass system abolished and the barbed wire removed.</span> <span id="s421">Well, next I west from Frankfurt to Bavaria, to visit the DP camps, Zeld_____in particular as well as Lansberg and the other camps.</span> <span id="s422">The barbed wires was still there and the pass system was still in existence.</span> <span id="s423">I came back to Frankfurt and I reported in due course to General Walter Beatle Smith, General Eisenhower's Chief of Staff.</span> <span id="s424">I visited him, I reported to him most of the time because General Eisenhower was often on field visits to the troops and General Smith would then report to Eisenhower when he returned.</span> <span id="s425">I was told afterwards, by General Smith, that orders were issued to General Patton to come and report the

o'clock, and I didn't know of this at the time, I walked into the ______room that lead into General Eisenhower's office, and there I saw General Patton, sitting with his shiny helmet on, his ivory handled pistol worn on each side.</span> <span id="s429">And his highly polished belt and straps.</span> <span id="s430">And I quickly beat a retreat.</span> <span id="s431">He glared at me and I knew what was healthy for me...I got out of there.</span> <span id="s432">Afterwards, General Smith told me that General Eisenhower asked General Patton, "George, why aren't you doing something for those Jews?"</span> <span id="s433">And Patton, thinking that he was talking to his old West Point buddy said, in a half laughter, "Why the hell should I?"</span> <span id="s434">And, Eisenhower replied, with anger, "Well, goddamit, and for no other reason...and because I have ordered you to help those Jews."</span> <span id="s435">Not long afterwards, General Patton was removed from command of the Third Army and he was ordered to command the 15th Army which consisted only of a Headquarters without troops.</span> <span id="s436">The Headquarters was a B_________in Germany.</span> <span id="s437">I know that books about Patton and the movie about Patton showed that he was ordered out of the Third Army because, supposedly he slapped a soldier in a military hospital in Sicily for malingering???</span> <span id="s438">But, to my mind, there has always been a question.</span> <span id="s439">"Why was Patton punished a couple of years latter for something he had done in Sicily?"</span> <span id="s440">My own thought is that he was punished because he had transgressed, he had violated a direct order from a superior officer which is something that an American Army Soldier knows he must not do.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">SWB: JUDAH NADICH: See, I no longer was acting as a chaplin, once I was assigned to the post of Advisor to Eisenhower.</span> <span
