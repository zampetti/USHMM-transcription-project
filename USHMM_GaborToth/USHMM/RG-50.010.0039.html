GLASHOW: He had a practice in New York which was almost totally Irish because he [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: At any rate, finally I spoke in Yiddish to these people.</span> <span id="s16">When I spoke German, they didn’t cooperate with me.</span> <span id="s17">So then I broke it down into Yiddish and they thought maybe I was telling the truth.</span> <span id="s18">Eventually they believed me -- some of them.</span> <span id="s19">They were so fearful.</span> <span id="s20">They were afraid to walk out of their doors even when we broke down the doors.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You are talking about the camps now?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: The camp.</span> <span id="s23">But I met many people of Jewish origin who didn't believe I was Jewish when I told them I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s24">They couldn't believe that a Jew was an officer in the United States Army.</span> <span id="s25">They were so brainwashed they thought there were no Jews permitted in the Army.</span> <span id="s26">This is true of Jewish people in North Africa as well.</span> <span id="s27">They looked like Arabs.</span> <span id="s28">We spoke Yiddish to them.</span> <span id="s29">We could communicate in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s30">When I spoke German they got frightened.</span> <span id="s31">I mean all over the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">MRS. GLASHOW: But, unfortunately my husband’s Yiddish is based on German so his Yiddish comes out sounding more like German.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: At any rate, I would like to make an opening statement.</span> <span id="s35">Q: Yes, please do.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: At the time of the liberation, I was a captain with the 307th Airborne Medical Company.</span> <span id="s37">My name is Dr. Samuel Glashow, and I have consented to giving the following interview concerning what I saw in Ludwigslust, Germany around March and April of 1945, while serving as chief dental surgeon with the 82nd Airborne Division.</span> <span id="s38">And I understand, Mrs. Singer, that you are associated with Emory University in the study of the Holocaust and in obtaining as much first-hand information as you can.</span> <span id="s39">I will try to be as helpful as I can.</span> <span id="s40">I will supplement anything I have to say with my diary entries of that period.</span> <span id="s41">Major Raymond A. Wurtz of the 82nd Division was my superior officer.</span> <span id="s42">He was the Division Dental Officer at the time.</span> <span id="s43">We are now both not active in dental practice and have decided to put our experiences together in book form, and that is when you got in touch with me.</span> <span id="s44">I feel that the information that he and I have may give you some other insights into the concentration camps that we saw.</span> <span id="s45">I will only talk about one.</span> <span id="s46">We have notes and pictures, as well as the day- to-day diary that Major Wurtz kept.</span> <span id="s47">I gave you his address.</span> <span id="s48">He will be available to one of your people whenever you are ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: That’s marvelous.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: If you wish, if you ask me questions, I’ll answer them if you want to conduct the interview that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Maybe we’ll start with a couple of questions and then as you get going, I’ll let you tell me....</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s53">I don't want it to sound too contrived, but I'll answer your questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: How did you first hear that there were concentration camps and that you were going to be entering the area of these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I had been with the 82nd Division since 1942.</span> <span id="s56">We had made seven combat missions and there was action a great deal of the time of these three years, and I didn't know that concentration camps existed.</span> <span id="s57">I was completely naive.</span> <span id="s58">I didn't know they existed at all, and the first time I saw a concentration camp was in Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s59">This was a few months before the war was over, before VE day, and when we occupied Ludwigslust, we did that for the purposes of receiving the surrender of the German Army.</span> <span id="s60">The entire German Army surrendered to my division in the palace of Ludwigslust.</span> <span id="s61">When we got there we still didn't know about these concentration camps.</span> <span id="s62">We were put up in a house where officers lived and enlisted men went, and we heard stories that there was a terrible camp about nine or ten miles from the</span></p> <p><span id="s63">house.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: When you say stories, was it from other soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Yes, from other officers.</span> <span id="s66">They asked if I had seen the situation up in this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s67">I said, "What is a concentration camp?"</span> <span id="s68">I didn't know that the Jews were gathered together and tortured and so forth.</span> <span id="s69">That was my first experience with concentration camps.</span> <span id="s70">As I say, I was busy doing division duties, company duties, and my time was completely occupied.</span> <span id="s71">But I finally got into a jeep with Major Wurtz and two enlisted men.</span> <span id="s72">At this time General Gavin was bringing in food for these people who were still able to eat.</span> <span id="s73">We got German rations at the warehouse and dark bread and canned meat, and the people ate it so ravenously, some of them died from the excitement of grabbing for that food.</span> <span id="s74">This was the first thing I saw.</span> <span id="s75">It was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: Tell me what happened when you and the enlisted men were coming close to the camp and all you knew at that point was that such a horrible thing....</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: It was an unbelievable thing.</span> <span id="s78">When we were in camp, we had very little duties to do.</span> <span id="s79">We were sort of waiting for something to happen, because in that area the shooting was over and negotiations were being made.</span> <span id="s80">We heard that the German generals were coming to sign a peace with General Gavin, who was my general.</span> <span id="s81">And all of this was higher echelon.</span> <span id="s82">I was a company grade officer.</span> <span id="s83">This was most of the field grade officers who knew about this.</span> <span id="s84">At that point Major Wurtz was in Division Headquarters, and that’s where he heard about the camp.</span> <span id="s85">He was my best friend and he told me, “Sam, I understand that there’s a horrible camp where they tortured people and so forth and these are all Polish people and Polish professionals -- the doctors, dentists, teachers, etc.”</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: So you took a jeep with Major Wurtz?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: I took a jeep with two enlisted men and Major Wurtz.</span> <span id="s88">We drove into the camp and we saw this area surrounded by barbed wire with two big gates that were torn from the hinges by our troops that first saw it.</span> <span id="s89">In the camp there were people huddled around near the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Very skinny, looked like walking skeletons.</span> <span id="s91">Many of them had black and white uniforms on like prisoners.</span> <span id="s92">I was told that in this barracks there were all Jews, about 200 Jews, and the rest of them -- there were about 4,000 people there -- were all Catholics, Polish Catholics.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Professional people.</span> <span id="s94">I walked into this Jewish place.</span> <span id="s95">I spoke to them in German and they didn’t cooperate.</span> <span id="s96">They were afraid to talk to me.</span> <span id="s97">They thought it was some kind of trick.</span> <span id="s98">They didn’t even know I was an American, even though I had an American flag on one of my arms.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: What did you feel when you went in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: I couldn’t believe what I saw and what I smelled.</span> <span id="s101">There was a stench of rotten meat.</span> <span id="s102">These were dead bodies.</span> <span id="s103">There were piles of dead bodies stored like firewood.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: In the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Inside of the barracks, right out in the open.</span> <span id="s106">Rotting meat.</span> <span id="s107">You could see they were people.</span> <span id="s108">Many of them were naked, and none of them had shoes.</span> <span id="s109">And then we walked inside and saw these skinny people who were still living.</span> <span id="s110">We realized they were starving and we had nothing but some candy bars which we got in a ration, so one of my enlisted men who walked in with me gave a candy bar to one of these people.</span> <span id="s111">He grabbed it and ran away and gulped it down so fast that he became unconscious.</span> <span id="s112">He probably tried to swallow it before someone else would take it away from him.</span> <span id="s113">These people were like animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">They were so degraded.</span> <span id="s115">There was no goodness.</span> <span id="s116">There was no kindness.</span> <span id="s117">There was nothing of that nature.</span> <span id="s118">There was no sharing.</span> <span id="s119">If they got a piece of something to eat, they grabbed it and would run away in the corner and fight off anyone who came near them.</span> <span id="s120">And when they broke these pieces of bread that we later brought in, people would fall to the floor and eat crumbs off the floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did any unit of the Army prior to your arrival provide food?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: There was no food provided.</span> <span id="s123">As we found out later, there were certain German troops who were in charge of the town of Ludwigslust, and they would bring the garbage of the city and dump it into this place.</span> <span id="s124">People would rummage through the garbage.</span> <span id="s125">No meals, no food was given, [unintelligible] garbage.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: You must have arrived several hours after the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I arrived there about a day after it was opened by other infantry soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: You arrived 24 hours after our troops actually liberated the camp.</span> <span id="s129">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: And in those 24 hours no member of the armed forces or no unit provided food for these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: We didn’t know they existed.</span> <span id="s132">General Gavin didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s133">He found out the same time I did, maybe a few hours before I did, because while I was here, a truck of food came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: In other words, this took a few hours to get the machinery rolling to bring food in?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Right.</span> <span id="s136">There were no German guards there.</span> <span id="s137">There were a few people who seemed to be bosses, but they weren’t German.</span> <span id="s138">And these people who were telling us that they had trouble getting food said they were like overseers of this group.</span> <span id="s139">I don’t know what you’d call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">They were people who looked in a little better shape than the people...I will call them inmates.</span> <span id="s141">I don’t know what else to call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: They were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: They were prisoners, but these who were better fed didn’t seem to be that skinny and scrawny.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: They were working for the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s146">That’s right.</span> <span id="s147">And they didn’t seem to be as afraid of us as the inmates themselves who thought it was some kind of trick.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: The prisoners were very afraid of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: Very afraid of all, and very afraid of me.</span> <span id="s150">And very afraid of Major Wurtz.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: How did you feel when you came to help?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: You must remember that I was in combat and saw many people killed, many Americans with their legs blown off.</span> <span id="s153">I saw my commanding officer with his face shot off by a mortar shell, with his eyeglasses on his helmet.</span> <span id="s154">I’ve seen and treated thousands of those fellow Americans from my division and other American divisions, even some German prisoners who were wounded.</span> <span id="s155">I’ve seen all kinds of gore and blood and intestines and what not.</span> <span id="s156">I never saw anything like this.</span> <span id="s157">When I walked out of there, my feet were full of rotten feces, meat, garbage, and the smell was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s158">We couldn’t believe what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: What was the feeling toward the prisoners?</span> <span id="s160">Did you think of them as human beings?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: No I didn’t.</span> <span id="s162">They didn’t even seem to be human.</span> <span id="s163">I didn’t associate them with human beings at all.</span> <span id="s164">They looked like dying animals, and many of them had black and white uniforms on and hats.</span> <span id="s165">I have some pictures you can see.</span> <span id="s166">Some of them had round hats, which was like a rabbi’s hat, in black and white.</span> <span id="s167">And none of them wore yellow stars or stuff like that, which I heard they had to wear.</span> <span id="s168">At this point, information started coming through that there were worse camps than this in Belsen and Auschwitz and so forth.</span> <span id="s169">But I didn’t see the other camps.</span> <span id="s170">The only camp I have ever seen is the only time I saw conditions that were so horrifying that they were not believable.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">When I went back to my own area and told others about it, I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s172">I went back again and again.</span> <span id="s173">I must have been there fifty times, trying to do what I could.</span> <span id="s174">General Gavin, at this point, got very angry, and he is a very strong and very powerful man, very brave man.</span> <span id="s175">I’ve seen the person next to him shot through the head, and he continued walking.</span> <span id="s176">His aide was hit by a sniper.</span> <span id="s177">The reason I mentioned it is that this man who is afraid of nothing and has seen everything you could believe was horrified and angry.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: Did the prisoners start to respond to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: After a while some of them started to talk to me.</span> <span id="s180">They believed because of what we did after our first experience.</span> <span id="s181">That first time when they took the hard bread and meat and couldn’t swallow it, some people actually died trying to eat.</span> <span id="s182">And our medical officer suggested that we make some kind of a soup, a diluted soup, and we told the people to dip the bread in the soup.</span> <span id="s183">And we gave them sweet chocolate, hot chocolate, before we gave them regular food.</span> <span id="s184">In the meantime, General Gavin was busy accepting the surrender of over 100,000 troops and we had only 8,000 soldiers in the entire 82nd Division.</span> <span id="s185">I only had 300 men.</span> <span id="s186">My 300 men had over 50,000 German prisoners who surrendered to us.</span> <span id="s187">We didn’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s188">While this was going on, we were trying to help these people.</span> <span id="s189">That wasn’t our primary purpose.</span> <span id="s190">I took time off from my various duties and went to this camp and spoke to some of these men.</span> <span id="s191">These men lived in wooden-like pallets which started on the floor and went right up to the ceiling.</span> <span id="s192">They may have been about 10 people high.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">They had to climb up to get in the top level.</span> <span id="s194">They kept the women separate from the men, and the women were not treated quite as bad.</span> <span id="s195">They only had four layers -- they had more room and some of them had blankets.</span> <span id="s196">The men had nothing.</span> <span id="s197">The men were in worse shape than the women.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: That was what time of year?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: April.</span> <span id="s200">Maybe end of March and April.</span> <span id="s201">It wasn’t warm.</span> <span id="s202">There was no snow anymore at that time.</span> <span id="s203">Pretty cool weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Was anybody guarding the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: When we first came into the camp, they had about three or four of these overseers who sort of....</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Who were also prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: They were prisoners, but they were well fed.</span> <span id="s208">When I came back the second or third or fourth time -- I don’t remember -- I saw about a dozen of some of the inmates who had regained some strength by eating surround one of these overseers and they were beating him.</span> <span id="s209">They got sticks and stones, and they were hitting him and beating him and had him on the ground.</span> <span id="s210">I went over and he said he was one of the bad people.</span> <span id="s211">In other words, he worked for the Germans.</span> <span id="s212">He wasn’t German.</span> <span id="s213">He was a Pole, but he was treated better, and then they took after him in their anger and we had to take him away, then separate the people at this point.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Were any American troops then stationed in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: We put American troops all around the camp to prevent harm to the inmates, but no one was harming them.</span> <span id="s216">We went into town.</span> <span id="s217">We saw some German people, and they said, “Oh, that’s not true.</span> <span id="s218">There is no such thing.”</span> <span id="s219">General Gavin got so angry about this that he called out his soldiers and rounded up all the people in this town.</span> <span id="s220">Thousands of people were lined up from age of 10 up, and they were marched into this place.</span> <span id="s221">Many of the women started to cry and didn’t know that things like this were happening.</span> <span id="s222">These people were affluent people.</span> <span id="s223">Ludwigslust was like the Scarsdale community.</span> <span id="s224">Many of them had marble homes, beautiful homes, all well fed, and the houses were well stocked with everything you can imagine, even beautiful books.</span> <span id="s225">I even found telephone books, recent telephone books from the United States.</span> <span id="s226">I found my name in the telephone book in a German house.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Did you believe that they could live in a small town so close to the concentration camps and not know?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: I couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s229">No.</span> <span id="s230">General Gavin had shovels given to all these people.</span> <span id="s231">They had thousands of people, and he went to the center of town -- like the Times Square of N.Y. -- and he had them dig up the streets and they built a cemetery for 400 people.</span> <span id="s232">Then they had to walk about 9 or 10 miles to the camp, and they had wheelbarrows, and they carried parts of bodies -- some of them weren't complete -- and they put them in graves.</span> <span id="s233">They used old parachutes and old blankets to wrap these parts of bodies, and we put them in graves.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Common graves [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: No.</span> <span id="s236">Individual graves.</span> <span id="s237">Every grave had a cross on it.</span> <span id="s238">We didn't know who was Jewish and who was not Jewish, but they were all piled into heaps so that on about every fourth cross we put a Jewish star.</span> <span id="s239">We built the cemetery in Ludwigslust, and as far as I know it is still standing in the center of town.</span> <span id="s240">General Gavin had all these people in front of him and we had a service.</span> <span id="s241">Our chaplain, who was a Protestant, gave a Jewish service, a Catholic service, and a Protestant service.</span> <span id="s242">We didn't know what they were.</span> <span id="s243">His name was Chaplain Woods.</span> <span id="s244">This might be of interest to you.</span> <span id="s245">He is still alive and still active.</span> <span id="s246">He said such barbarity was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s247">He said he saw it with his own eyes, and he still can't believe that he saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: It's so inhuman that it's hard for a human being....</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: No.</span> <span id="s250">As I say, there was no more shooting at this time.</span> <span id="s251">The Germans were in the process of surrendering, It wasn't the end of the war yet.</span> <span id="s252">They were still fighting on the outskirts where the Germans were fighting the Russians, and they were retreating to us because we treated them better than the Russians.</span> <span id="s253">They wanted to surrender to us rather than surrender to the Russians.</span> <span id="s254">So it was about two months before victory in Europe, VE Day.</span> <span id="s255">In these two months it was a very transitory time.</span> <span id="s256">We had over 100,000 German soldiers.</span> <span id="s257">There were only eight prisons.</span> <span id="s258">They piled their guns and German generals came in fancy cars, which the GI's promptly took away.</span> <span id="s259">Privates and enlisted men were taking Mercedes or whatever they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: What were your instructions from the Army on treatment of the German prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: We were overwhelmed by the number of German prisoners.</span> <span id="s262">We were told to try to separate the SS from the Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s263">This we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: And how did the instructions differ as far as the treatment of one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: The SS troops had a number tattooed under their armpits.</span> <span id="s266">This was a blood type.</span> <span id="s267">The Wehrmacht didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s268">If the SS were wounded he got better treatment than the Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: When you had an SS prisoner, was there difference in treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s271">There was a big difference in treatment.</span> <span id="s272">General Gavin had a very strict treatment.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I would like to know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: They were all disarmed at this point.</span> <span id="s275">First thing we did was tell every SS soldier, in German and in English, to turn in all things made of metal.</span> <span id="s276">Everything.</span> <span id="s277">Even a nail file.</span> <span id="s278">All weapons.</span> <span id="s279">Of course, all knives, all watches, all cameras.</span> <span id="s280">Anything made of metal whether it was spy glasses or whatever had to be turned in.</span> <span id="s281">When we found an SS, we had one American soldier with a gun to guard him until he was secured in a safe place.</span> <span id="s282">On the other hand, we would have maybe a 1,000 Wehrmacht with 2 guards, one in the front and one in the rear.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">They didn’t even need guns.</span> <span id="s284">The Wehrmacht didn’t want any part of anything.</span> <span id="s285">But the SS still caused trouble, even after they surrendered.</span> <span id="s286">They would pick up something and cause damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: So you had one soldier guarding each SS man.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Right.</span> <span id="s289">Until we could put him into a safe area with a..</span> <span id="s290">.</span> <span id="s291">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s292">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: You asked me how we treated the various German prisoners.</span> <span id="s294">We separated the SS from the Wehrmacht, and we usually separated them by a tattoo that the SS had under their armpits, blood type.</span> <span id="s295">The Wehrmacht didn’t have that.</span> <span id="s296">We segregated these people, and we put the SS under very heavy barbed wire enclosure with many guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">The Wehrmacht had very few guards.</span> <span id="s298">We had no barbed wire enclosure.</span> <span id="s299">What we did is we got a piece of rope and we tied it around trees and enclosed a large area and told them to make their own shelter.</span> <span id="s300">We had no facilities to help them.</span> <span id="s301">We had some blankets.</span> <span id="s302">We gave them all the blankets we had.</span> <span id="s303">We didn’t need our shelter head.</span> <span id="s304">We gave that to them which they built tents with.</span> <span id="s305">Some of these German soldiers were female.</span> <span id="s306">They lived together with the men.</span> <span id="s307">They cooked for themselves, whatever they could.</span> <span id="s308">They built fires.</span> <span id="s309">We gave them some of our rations.</span> <span id="s310">We didn't have enough at that time to give them.</span> <span id="s311">We shared our rations with them until finally we got rations brought in.</span> <span id="s312">And they had to cook them and prepare them themselves.</span> <span id="s313">Now as far as the SS, it was General Gavin's policy that an SS soldier would get less than 1,000 calories of food per day once we had food brought in for all the prisoners.</span> <span id="s314">They were put on a diet that was calculated to make them sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Oh!</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: This was American policy, General Gavin's policy.</span> <span id="s317">And he said the only way they'd get out of this camp as long as he is in command is buried because they have an incurable disease like Tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s318">As far as he was concerned he was putting them all on a starvation diet of 900 calories, no more.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Was General Gavin's anger mostly by the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s320">A: General Gavin worked quickly on his own.</span> <span id="s321">I don't think General Gavin ever saw a camp like this even.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Yes, but was his anger and his policy toward the SS prompted by having seen the camp or was it prompted by the general war attitude?</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: We always had a respect for the fighting ability of the SS.</span> <span id="s324">The SS were always better fighters than the Wehrmacht, and we had the same respect that we would have for a rattlesnake.</span> <span id="s325">We respect the rattlesnake by keeping away and being careful, but they're dangerous.</span> <span id="s326">The Wehrmacht soldier was not considered dangerous once they were captured.</span> <span id="s327">But an SS was still, in our opinion, a rattlesnake.</span> <span id="s328">I think this, plus the fact that General Gavin was so outraged by what he saw in that camp, is what prompted his action which was unilateral.</span> <span id="s329">It wasn't an army policy as far as I know.</span> <span id="s330">It was his own policy.</span> <span id="s331">What happened after we left a few months later to occupy Berlin I have no idea.</span> <span id="s332">They were still in those camps all over the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What were your own feelings toward the German soldiers after having seen what they had done?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: The German soldiers, the Wehrmacht, were a pathetic group of people.</span> <span id="s335">The ones that I found.</span> <span id="s336">The ones that I’ve seen.</span> <span id="s337">I don’t mean when we were fighting against them, when they were shooting at us and we were shooting back at them.</span> <span id="s338">I don’t mean that.</span> <span id="s339">We just felt that they were our enemies and they had to be destroyed.</span> <span id="s340">That was my attitude.</span> <span id="s341">Now once they surrendered, my attitude was also different towards the Wehrmacht than towards the SS.</span> <span id="s342">An SS was still a rattlesnake.</span> <span id="s343">The Wehrmacht was a captured enemy and to be treated according to the rules of the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s344">We believed in the Geneva Convention.</span> <span id="s345">We know that the SS soldier did not believe in it.</span> <span id="s346">At this time many of us were very angry.</span> <span id="s347">If we found a soldier who still had a knife after we had told him to turn it in, he was shot.</span> <span id="s348">My men, my medical people, would just as soon shoot a prisoner as to bother taking care of them.</span> <span id="s349">They were very angry people.</span> <span id="s350">We lost a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s351">I lost many of my friends.</span> <span id="s352">When Captain Wurtz became Division Dental Officer, I became Chief Dental Officer, Chief Dental Surgeon of the 82nd.</span> <span id="s353">He became Division Dental Officer which is an administrative job.</span> <span id="s354">My job was more active.</span> <span id="s355">In combat I would take care of lightly wounded troops and see to their welfare.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: Coming back to that anger, was part of that anger also the feeling “were you one of the people who did this damage in the concentration camp?”</span> <span id="s357">or was the anger [unintelligible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I think that General Gavin had a terrible anger against the inhabitants of Ludwigslust, because he didn’t believe the fact that they didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: How about yourself?</span> <span id="s360">Your own feelings?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I had no feeling towards these people at all as human beings.</span> <span id="s362">We occupied their houses.</span> <span id="s363">I would use up all their facilities.</span> <span id="s364">In fact, when it was cold we’d break furniture to warm ourselves.</span> <span id="s365">They were a little bit less than human beings as far as we were concerned.</span> <span id="s366">The Germans who allowed this to happen, I felt, were guilty of a crime.</span> <span id="s367">I felt that the SS people were guilty of a crime.</span> <span id="s368">I didn’t feel that the Wehrmacht were as guilty of a crime as the other two groups -- as the civilians who permitted this camp to exist in their vicinity and the SS troops who always were considered dangerous and subhuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When General Gavin took the civilians from the town and took them to camp with the wheelbarrows and made them bury the dead, what were the reactions of the civilians who had to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: The civilian people kept protesting the fact that they knew nothing about it and many of them cried and said, "We didn't know what was going on" and they were begging us to go easy on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Did they feel in any way responsible, remorseful?</span> <span id="s372">Did they have the human feelings of sadness?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: They didn't admit to responsibility, and the only sadness that they showed, I think, was horror at what they saw.</span> <span id="s374">I think had they won the war, these people would have all been exterminated without any remorse on the civilians' part.</span> <span id="s375">I don't think they had any remorse.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">They were all brainwashed to the fact that these people were subhuman species.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: And they had to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: And for the benefit of the German Reich, the best thing would be for</span></p> <p><span id="s379">them to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: What you are saying to me is that whether they knew or didn't know, they didn't feel guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: There may have been exceptions, but the overwhelming majority of the German people didn't care what happened to Jews; they couldn't care less.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: So they must have been angry at the American troops for making them face up to the [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: This is strange.</span> <span id="s384">The German people that we saw not only in Ludwigslust, but in many cities, wanted to be our friends.</span> <span id="s385">They said, "We are your true friends.</span> <span id="s386">The Russians are your enemies."</span> <span id="s387">This is what they constantly told us.</span> <span id="s388">They said, “A lot of things that you saw are not really our doing.</span> <span id="s389">Your true friends are the Germans and your true enemies are the Russians."</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: How did most of your soldiers feel about that?</span> <span id="s391">A: We laughed at them.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: I know you did, but I was wondering about the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: I was in this little bar or pub where the Germans were serving some kind of German beer, and I was talking to a German who was the proprietor.</span> <span id="s394">And he said, “You know, the Russians are building tank traps facing you.</span> <span id="s395">They think that you are going to keep going into Russia.</span> <span id="s396">I can even tell you where they are.”</span> <span id="s397">And he gave this information to an intelligence officer and he said, “You know, we are really your friends.</span> <span id="s398">If the Americans and the Germans got together, we could destroy the Russians.”</span> <span id="s399">Then I said, “You know that I’m a Jew.”</span> <span id="s400">He began to laugh.</span> <span id="s401">He said, “Those Jews are the cause of this whole war.”</span> <span id="s402">He didn’t believe that I was Jewish, and when I insisted on that he became terrified.</span> <span id="s403">He thought we would kill him.</span> <span id="s404">At that point we were all armed.</span> <span id="s405">When we first joined the division, the medical troops were not armed, but when we saw what happened in Malmedy, where unarmed medical soldiers were shot through a red cross they used to wear on their helmet, General Gavin had a conference with all the medical troops and said it is your option to wear a red cross or not.</span> <span id="s406">If you wear a red cross, you can’t carry a gun.</span> <span id="s407">If you don’t wear a red cross or a medical insignia, you can arm yourself.</span> <span id="s408">I would say 95% of the medics took off their red cross after Malmedy, and they were armed and they stayed armed until we were ordered to disarm in Berlin when we became occupation troops.</span> <span id="s409">At that time we used to meet with the Russians and they were supposed to be disarmed too.</span> <span id="s410">It was a period of celebration.</span> <span id="s411">Even at Ludwigslust, some Russians came to parties between the Russian officers and the American officers, and it was a feeling of happy companionship.</span> <span id="s412">This happened for a long time until the Russians were replaced by party-type soldiers and then there was a period of animosity between Russians and Americans.</span> <span id="s413">But I’m saying we felt a kinship to the Russians, and we didn’t believe the stories that the Germans were telling.</span> <span id="s414">We were laughing at them and we didn’t believe the fact that they didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s415">We knew that the German public, the majority of the German people, wanted the destruction of the Jews.</span> <span id="s416">They were so indoctrinated that it would be better for them.</span> <span id="s417">There may have been some who were sincere in trying to fight the Nazis.</span> <span id="s418">But I don’t believe I have met any, and I have met thousands of Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Among the people in your company, were there any people who had very violent or strong reactions to the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: You must remember my men had spent three years in active combat, and they were not interested, except in helping these people and then that's the end of it.</span> <span id="s421">They were more interested in finding girl friends or finding whiskey or having a good time gambling.</span> <span id="s422">There was no such thing as a moral commitment to anybody at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: They were protecting themselves from something horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: The soldiers at this point were happy that there were no guns being fired and there were no more casualties.</span> <span id="s425">We carried out our orders in that we made sure that the SS didn't escape and the Wehrmacht had the basic needs and the concentration people had enough to eat and medical attention.</span> <span id="s426">I didn't give any of them dental attention.</span> <span id="s427">We had no dental facilities at that point, but their teeth were horrible too.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">That's understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: You were part of a large company.</span> <span id="s430">A: We had 300 men at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Did all the men go to the camp to see?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: I think everybody went there eventually because when they came back we each could tell someone else a story.</span> <span id="s433">I went through this big gymnasium where they kept air rifles and Nazi insignia.</span> <span id="s434">I brought back some of these flags and showed them.</span> <span id="s435">I brought back one of these air rifles.</span> <span id="s436">They looked like real weapons.</span> <span id="s437">They were made in Czechoslovakia and there must have been hundreds of them there.</span> <span id="s438">I took one down and I sent it back to this country.</span> <span id="s439">But what would happen was there was a gym where some of the people in the camps would parade around.</span> <span id="s440">I don't know what they were doing, exercise or whatever, and there was a balcony around there where young German teenagers around 13 or 14 were brought up there and given these guns with BB’s.</span> <span id="s441">They were encouraged to shoot into this walking group of inmates, who were mostly Polish, and some of the people had eyes put out.</span> <span id="s442">This was to let the young people know that they weren’t shooting at real people.</span> <span id="s443">It was just like they were shooting at snakes or mice.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">They are vermin.</span> <span id="s445">Anyway, when they heard these stories, a lot of our soldiers went there and they collected air guns for trophies and flags that they sent home.</span> <span id="s446">I have a few in the house downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: But actually all of the people from your company did see the camp?</span> <span id="s448">A: Right.</span> <span id="s449">Unofficially.</span> <span id="s450">There was no official visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: But they all did go?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Right.</span> <span id="s453">Especially after that parade which was a week after we got there.</span> <span id="s454">We had a parade of the Germans carrying the dead and a ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: They were very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s457">Very upset.</span> <span id="s458">All of the American troops witnessed that.</span> <span id="s459">And I think there was a lot of curiosity too of what was going on.</span> <span id="s460">Because even at this point some of the people in the camp were afraid to go out of camp.</span> <span id="s461">Some of them did go out, but it was very few and we had to take them in trucks and bring them and find out where they lived and try to take them as close as we could to where they came from.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What did you do about the Polish Jews who came all the way from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Good question.</span> <span id="s464">We negotiated with the Russians that if we bring them up to their area they would take them, so we separated those people who wanted to go.</span> <span id="s465">It was all voluntary at this point.</span> <span id="s466">There was no established policy as far as I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: There were no DP camps yet or Red Cross?</span> <span id="s468">The Red Cross hadn’t taken over yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A: Not yet.</span> <span id="s470">The Red Cross wasn’t there yet, and there were no DP camps and we didn’t know what to do with them.</span> <span id="s471">We tried to make them as comfortable as we could, and we spoke to some of these Russian officers.</span> <span id="s472">They said, “If you bring them up to us we’ll take them from there.”</span> <span id="s473">There were truckloads of people who voluntarily went.</span> <span id="s474">What happened to them I have no idea.</span> <span id="s475">They went in those trucks, and we gave them clothes and blankets and a bundle of food to take with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Were there any people among your people in the company who didn’t react violently to this?</span> <span id="s477">Was there anybody who said, “Who the hell cares what happens to the Jews?”</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s479">There were a number of people.</span> <span id="s480">Q: There were?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Most of my company, not the officers, but most of my enlisted men came from places like Virginia and Georgia and they were crackers and some of them were bootleggers.</span> <span id="s482">Many of these people joined the 82nd Division because we got extra pay for jumping.</span> <span id="s483">I used to get $100 a month extra which was a lot of money in those days.</span> <span id="s484">Some of the men I had could not read very well.</span> <span id="s485">Some of them could not read at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: And their reaction....</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: And they couldn't care less.</span> <span id="s488">If they had a girl and a bottle of whiskey they were happy, or a good crap game.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: Did any discussion ensue?</span> <span id="s490">A: Amongst officers, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q: Among the officers and the men who tried to convince them...?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A: The men had seen worse among their own friends.</span> <span id="s493">If your own friend has a broken leg, it’s much worse than a Jewish skeleton.</span> <span id="s494">That part didn't sink in at that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: So there were no arguments between the officers and the men.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: No.</span> <span id="s497">Not at all.</span> <span id="s498">Officers and men don't really talk that much together.</span> <span id="s499">Q: But among the officers, the feeling was pretty much like...?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: Most of the officers in my company were college people, because in order to become a dentist or physician, you had to have a college education.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: Did you see any difference between Jewish officers and the non-Jewish officers in their reactions to what you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: I'll tell you something about that.</span> <span id="s503">The 82nd Division had very few Jewish officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Was Dr. Wurtz Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: No.</span> <span id="s506">He’s a Catholic.</span> <span id="s507">He’s German.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: This is very interesting then.</span> <span id="s509">You are American-Jewish.</span> <span id="s510">He is Catholic-German.</span> <span id="s511">And yet you became very close.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: We’re best of friends.</span> <span id="s513">I would say he’s my best friend and he says that of me.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Did this joint experience tie you closer together as friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: You must remember that we were under constant threat of being killed, and we each lost good friends who were killed and maimed.</span> <span id="s516">This had a bigger impact.</span> <span id="s517">It was unbelievable at that point it didn’t get into your consciousness.</span> <span id="s518">I think my reaction was stronger later on than it was at this point.</span> <span id="s519">Our purpose was to take a wounded soldier and make him function again as quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s520">If we couldn’t make him function, we sent him to the rear somewhere where he got other treatment.</span> <span id="s521">Our whole purpose in being was to make sure we had people who could shoot a gun all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: And you [unintelligible] were asked to do medical work?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Right.</span> <span id="s524">Of course, if you are in combat, you can’t carry dental equipment.</span> <span id="s525">It’s too heavy.</span> <span id="s526">We had dental equipment which was dropped by airplane.</span> <span id="s527">We set up clinics, like in Holland.</span> <span id="s528">We went in by glider and parachutes, and we dropped in trunks, dental kits, chairs, and everything else.</span> <span id="s529">But we had emergency facilities, and our biggest function was to do medical work.</span> <span id="s530">I was in charge during the Bulge of a small enclosure that had 400 people who had either chest, belly, or head wounds and couldn’t be moved.</span> <span id="s531">I was just trying to make them as comfortable as we could.</span> <span id="s532">We had no doctors, no M.D. at all.</span> <span id="s533">We were that way for three days during the Bulge until a Dr. Davis came in and he was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s534">So what we did was the lightly wounded men would get first priority.</span> <span id="s535">We needed every man.</span> <span id="s536">It was very cold, so as soon as he got warmed up with a hot drink and patched up a little....</span></p> <p><span id="s537">[End of Side One.</span> <span id="s538">Conversation resumes on Side Two with an inaudible conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Glashow and Lorrie Mell.</span> <span id="s539">The audible portion of the conversation resumes as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: Do you feel it should be taught in grade schools, high school, college level, any level?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">MRS. GLASHOW: It must be taught as the history of the world.</span> <span id="s542">I mean this existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Under what subject do you teach this?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Under history, your wife says.</span> <span id="s545">Would you feel there should be separate courses on the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">MRS. GLASHOW: No.</span> <span id="s547">Then you must talk about the Holocaust that happened in Cuba.</span> <span id="s548">Basically there was one in Uganda on a small scale.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: No, no wait.</span> <span id="s550">Then tell about the history of slavery.</span> <span id="s551">It should be taught the same way as slavery is taught.</span> <span id="s552">It could be part of world history.</span> <span id="s553">I don’t think it should be segregated as a separate subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">MRS. GLASHOW: You can't because if you segregate it as a separate subject [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s555">It has to be taught as a whole.</span> <span id="s556">After all, we Jews are part of history.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: I think in a study of history certain events are very important.</span> <span id="s558">Like in a study of history, the birth of Christ becomes an important event in his lifetime, because it affected so many people.</span> <span id="s559">Depending how far back you want to go, I think the Holocaust is just as important as W.W.I, just as important as far as I am concerned as the American Revolution, where we get freedom from England.</span> <span id="s560">It should be taught as an event.</span> <span id="s561">It's that important.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: I want to go back to something -- those funeral services where you said the chaplain performed services for all three religions.</span> <span id="s563">Did he also conduct any Jewish services for the survivors in the camp?</span> <span id="s564">Did he take it upon himself to go into the concentration camp and say can we say kaddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: He didn’t know how to say kaddish.</span> <span id="s566">Q: No.</span> <span id="s567">I mean....</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: We got a volunteer -- a Jewish person who said it.</span> <span id="s569">Q: From the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: He wasn't a theologian, he was just a person who could say it.</span> <span id="s571">Q: An American in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: An American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: And he conducted services?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Right.</span> <span id="s575">He was an enlisted man.</span> <span id="s576">I don't know his name.</span> <span id="s577">Q: With the help of the chaplain.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: The chaplain helped him and gave him a free hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What were your personal feelings during that burial ceremony?</span> <span id="s580">Did you have any strong religious, Jewish feelings at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: No religious feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: No religious feeling.</span> <span id="s583">Were you a religious person at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: I had a Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s585">I went to Hebrew school six years, and I believed in God.</span> <span id="s586">But I wasn’t a Temple goer, and I joined the Temple only when I had children and I wanted them to have a Jewish education.</span> <span id="s587">I didn’t join Temple Israel until my first child was three years old.</span> <span id="s588">We started him off in Hebrew school.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: So when you listened to those Jewish services at the burial time or any time you had no identification with that whatsoever?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: It had no affect on me.</span> <span id="s591">I couldn’t identify with those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Did you ever wonder how these people could still pray to God after what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: They didn’t pray to God.</span> <span id="s594">Most of the people I saw were [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s595">Q: And the few hundred Jewish ones that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A: None of them were religious.</span> <span id="s597">Not one of them made any mention of God or of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: And when that volunteer American soldier conducted the...?</span> <span id="s599">A: That was for dead people.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Dead people.</span> <span id="s601">But in the camp for the live people.</span> <span id="s602">No one?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: No one.</span> <span id="s604">There were no services for the live people.</span> <span id="s605">The only thing that the live people wanted was something to eat.</span> <span id="s606">They didn’t want to go anywhere.</span> <span id="s607">They just wanted to have something to put in their mouth.</span> <span id="s608">I think it was basic survival.</span> <span id="s609">These people who were in this camp at this point were no longer human beings.</span> <span id="s610">They may have become human beings later, but they were no longer human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">They cared nothing about religion, art, music.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: Did you have any idea how long some of them had been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Yes, some of them were there over a year.</span> <span id="s614">It seems like in 1944...this has to be checked though.</span> <span id="s615">The Germans were friends of the Russians.</span> <span id="s616">When did they split up?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: [Unintelligible].</span> <span id="s618">They made a pact in 1940.</span> <span id="s619">A: I don't remember the chronology too well.</span> <span id="s620">Q: I don't either.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: After they split up, Germany had a certain part of Poland which they controlled.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: That's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: And Russia had half of it.</span> <span id="s624">What happened in Russia I have no idea, but when [Germany] took physical control of Poland, they put their people in there and they started rounding up the Jews and putting them in various camps and rounding up certain Polish people.</span> <span id="s625">I don't know why they were rounded up, but they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Polish intelligentsia had always been a threat to communism.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: They locked up the Polish people and put them in concentration camps -- the intelligentsia, the professionals.</span> <span id="s628">They put the Jews in extermination camps, waiting to be delivered to places where they can exterminate them more efficiently.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: You are talking about the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: The Germans had control of Poland.</span> <span id="s631">There was no more fighting in Poland, when the line was more or less established.</span> <span id="s632">From that point on before the big war that they had with Russia, they moved the people out.</span> <span id="s633">Most of the Jewish people were moved out in freight cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Cattle cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Some of these Polish people that were in this camp marched from wherever they were in Poland on foot, hundreds of miles, and they were treated very poorly.</span> <span id="s636">Many of them who fell were left there to perish.</span> <span id="s637">They weren't killed, they were left to perish, and the survivors who actually reached there were those who walked from some place in Poland to this place in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Did you have any Polish people in your company who were able to communicate with the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: No, all my Polish people were very tough people, very rough people.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">I did not have the finest type of people in my company.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Were they at all concerned about their countrymen being in the concentration camp?</span> <span id="s642">Did they show any interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: No, none at all, the only thing they were interested in was having a good time and not getting killed, and doing their duty.</span> <span id="s644">They didn't care about world conditions.</span> <span id="s645">They didn't believe anything they heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: How about the Jewish soldiers in your company?</span> <span id="s647">Did they show...?</span> <span id="s648">A: Very few Jewish soldiers, maybe six.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: And those six, did they show any more interest in the Jewish people in the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: No.</span> <span id="s651">I had...there was one Jewish dentist who I remember very...his name was S-A-U-E-R.</span> <span id="s652">Captain Sauer.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Q: Where does he live?</span></p> <p><span id="s654">A: I remember when we were in Africa, before we got into our first combat, he was a very rough officer, very tough.</span> <span id="s655">He was Jewish.</span> <span id="s656">He went to the Mediterranean, he went swimming in the Mediterranean.</span> <span id="s657">It was very hot -- we were in the desert -- and what we'd do was spend the day in the water and then go back to training, train at night.</span> <span id="s658">So I remember talking with him, and he said he's not going to wear his dog tag any more.</span> <span id="s659">I said why?</span> <span id="s660">He said there's Hebrew on it, and if they catch me, they'll probably torture and kill me, and I suggest you do the same thing.</span> <span id="s661">I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s662">I had a dog tag made without religion on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Did he show any more interest, any interest in the Jewish ... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: He was very brave.</span> <span id="s665">He was killed.</span> <span id="s666">He was killed saving somebody, and I don't know, maybe, I don't know if you want to hear this story.</span> <span id="s667">There was someone crying out in pain.</span> <span id="s668">We were all pinned down and we couldn't get up.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: During the Bulge.</span> <span id="s671">And there was a Protestant, a young Protestant Chaplain who stood up and tried to go over to this crying person; everybody told him not to get up, instead of having one wounded, we'll have two, or whatever.</span> <span id="s672">And he went out and was shot in the chest and fell over backwards.</span> <span id="s673">We were able to get him back and I am the one who treated him.</span> <span id="s674">I put something in the hole, it missed everything important, he said "Am I going to die?"</span> <span id="s675">I said, "You're lucky, you'll probably be back."</span> <span id="s676">We got him to the rear, he came back two months later in time to go into Holland.</span> <span id="s677">He got a Victoria Cross from the British Government for bravery, and that's nothing to do with the story.</span> <span id="s678">Captain Sauer, we called him "sewer" and we named him just for a gag.</span> <span id="s679">He used to be the friendliest driver we'd known, they called me Glass Gow and they called him Sewer.</span> <span id="s680">Anyway he got up....</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Why did you call him...?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s683">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Anyway, he got up and went to this wounded man and he was working on him when a machine gun opened up and hit him in both legs, and he fell over.</span> <span id="s685">He was yelling; he was in pain.</span> <span id="s686">A lot of brave people can't control their yelling when they’re hurt, and they cry and cry, and we had to wait until it got dark so we could sneak out and get him back.</span> <span id="s687">We found [unintelligible] he was unconscious [unintelligible] alive.</span> <span id="s688">One leg, we had to cut it off.</span> <span id="s689">There was nothing on any more.</span> <span id="s690">The other leg was still attached [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s691">I never see these people, I don't keep in touch with them, I just treat them and [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s692">We get them back to some collecting company and then they sent them off somewhere else.</span> <span id="s693">We understood that he got back to this country to [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s694">At this time both his legs were gone and he was making a [unintelligible] or something, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s695">His wife and mother came to visit him, and they began to cry and the story we got was second or third hand.</span> <span id="s696">[Unintelligible] using very foul language he said “If you’re going to cry, never come back.</span> <span id="s697">I never want to see you.”</span> <span id="s698">And he got a clot and he died in the hospital; that's the end of this Captain Sauer.</span> <span id="s699">What I wanted to bring out, these people were interested in doing their job, they were brave beyond measure, I mean, he didn’t have to do it.</span> <span id="s700">He [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s701">I didn’t get up [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s702">[Interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s703">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: The point is most of the people I saw there were Polish Catholics and I couldn’t communicate...I couldn’t speak Yiddish to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: There were only a couple of hundred of Jewish people A: There were only about 200 Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: And with those people I could communicate in Yiddish, but I couldn’t communicate with the Poles.</span> <span id="s708">When I spoke German to the Polish people, they clammed up and they thought it was some kind of a trick.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: The Jewish people, so you did not communicate too closely with.</span> <span id="s710">In other words, there was no rapport.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: The first day or so they believed that something strange was...they didn’t accept me.</span> <span id="s712">Whether they accepted it or not was not important to me.</span> <span id="s713">I didn’t see any relationship between me and them.</span> <span id="s714">I couldn’t put myself in their position.</span> <span id="s715">I couldn’t imagine that “me” in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Q: Also, I think what had happened in your case, as far as I can see at this point, you had [unintelligible] three and a half years.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: We were just a few days away.</span> <span id="s718">Q: Watching....</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: As a matter of fact....</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: A: few days away from [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: I was slightly wounded only a short time before this, a few miles away across the river.</span> <span id="s722">I injured my hand, and one of my friends was killed at the same time that I was cut, hurt.</span> <span id="s723">He was blown apart.</span> <span id="s724">I mean, these are the things which were real.</span> <span id="s725">I could put myself in his position when he was blown up.</span> <span id="s726">I could put myself in the position like commanding officer, like Major Houston, when he had his head blown off.</span> <span id="s727">I could put myself in Captain Sauer’s position, and he had a leg short off.</span> <span id="s728">These things I understood, but these people in the concentration camp, I did not understand it.</span> <span id="s729">I did not understand my whole time in the army.</span> <span id="s730">It wasn’t until later that the enormity of this crime dawned on me.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: I think you had three and half years of watching death and suffering and pain, and your friends in pain, and I think there is a point at which any other suffering that you may look at is either going to become identified or something you can’t absorb any more, because this was a different kind of horror, and as you yourself said, after awhile, you said “We have to forget about it or...”</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: As a matter of fact, this horror was of such a nature that I couldn't wait to get away and get that smell out of my nose and wipe that dirt off my feet, and yet I went back.</span> <span id="s733">Maybe it was a morbid curiosity, I don't know what it was.</span> <span id="s734">I went back a number of times, took time off from my other duties to go back, not for any humanitarian reasons, I don't know why I went back for.</span> <span id="s735">I don't know, maybe to get a souvenir or bring it back so I have something tangible to think about that.</span> <span id="s736">I didn’t believe in cameras.</span> <span id="s737">I wasn’t a camera person, I didn't take pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: It's like a morbid compulsion to go back and see.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: I went back and the third time I took one of these air rifles and I took it and sent it back home to the states.</span> <span id="s740">I took six Nazi flags and wrapped them up and sent them home to my parents.</span> <span id="s741">My parents didn't like it, but they kept it for me.</span> <span id="s742">I still have them in the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: But the horror was a different kind of horror that you couldn't identify with, but you wanted almost to run away from it, and yet you were compulsed to go back a few times and then you wanted to forget about.</span> <span id="s744">Do I read you right?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s746">I did forget about it for a short time after we left there.</span> <span id="s747">I put it out of mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: When did it hit you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: When the war was over and I was a civilian.</span> <span id="s750">It took me a few years to get over the war.</span> <span id="s751">When I was discharged from the army in 1946, 1 couldn't find a place for myself.</span> <span id="s752">I wasn't at home with my parents.</span> <span id="s753">It was my house.</span> <span id="s754">We had a big home.</span> <span id="s755">It seemed like it was cramped.</span> <span id="s756">I just didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s757">I couldn't associate with anyone unless they wore a uniform.</span> <span id="s758">And I didn’t trust people in uniform unless they were 82nd.</span> <span id="s759">The only people I trusted were people who had an 82nd patch on their arm.</span> <span id="s760">I knew I could depend on them and I could turn my back.</span> <span id="s761">I couldn’t turn my back even on an American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Many American soldiers....</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: There was that much of a closeness that you developed with your own, and that explains your identification with your buddies and [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: As a matter of fact, when I first came home, I felt undressed when I wasn’t carrying a gun.</span> <span id="s765">I felt that...I had a gun.</span> <span id="s766">I would wear them.</span> <span id="s767">My father would say what are you doing?</span> <span id="s768">And I don’t feel comfortable [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: What does a nice Jewish boy do at home with a gun?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And these things I had to get rid of.</span> <span id="s771">I had 23 pistols and my father said to get them out of the house.</span> <span id="s772">My wife eventually...my brother [unintelligible] sold all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: I see you have....</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: There was a lot on the wall, but they are not on now.</span> <span id="s775">I took them off intentionally.</span> <span id="s776">I took off some of the things in this house.</span> <span id="s777">I figured you would be in this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Some of the things on the wall I took off, a number of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Because of my coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s782">I didn’t want to maybe antagonize your sensibility.</span> <span id="s783">I didn’t know....</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s785">What did you have on the wall?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Certain remnants from the war [unintelligible] killed people which I didn’t think were suitable [unintelligible].</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: I think you could have left them.</span> <span id="s788">A: These people were killed in anger.</span> <span id="s789">Q: I think you could have left them.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: The people that I’m talking about were ki lled in anger.</span> <span id="s791">You know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: In other words, not in combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: Yes, in combat, but face to face, if you know what I'm trying to say.</span> <span id="s794">How shall I say it?</span> <span id="s795">This wasn't a deliberate hurting of somebody, it was something kill or be killed.</span> <span id="s796">It was not taking a healthy person, tying him up and hurting one way or another, or starving them to death.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: It was combat.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Or breaking his glasses, or doing deliberate mischief to a human being, which is always incomprehensible to me.</span> <span id="s799">They think it's a joke....</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: A prank.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: A prank.</span> <span id="s802">Taking a firecracker...something that's harmless.</span> <span id="s803">Even though it might scare the wits out of you, still it’s not going to cause you to lose a leg or an eye or to die.</span> <span id="s804">In other words, this that I saw was something that I could not comprehend.</span> <span id="s805">I saw it, and after I saw it a number of times, the only thing I wanted was to forget about it.</span> <span id="s806">It wasn’t part of my existence, part of my living.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: But it did come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: After a long time, I got sick after the war, and I had to convalescence in Florida for awhile before I got back to normal, before I went back to work.</span> <span id="s809">And then when the [unintelligible] was over, I started to talk to other people.</span> <span id="s810">I got the same reaction that I am getting now, horrified feeling of could this have really happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Did you really feel ... ?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yes, and then the more I saw, the more people were shocked by some of these stories, I at that time contributed a lot of weapons to a collection.</span> <span id="s813">I don't know if you are aware.</span> <span id="s814">They were collecting guns for Israel.</span> <span id="s815">They wanted guns that worked.</span> <span id="s816">I happened to have a lot of guns, it was an illegal thing that we would give to people... Q: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Were you aware of the weapons?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: Yes., at that time I wasn't, I read about it after.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Anyway, one of these people who was a friend of my wife’s mother was very active in [unintelligible] was collecting guns through different channels for Israel.</span> <span id="s820">Q: They were shipping them?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yes, I had patients who used to be on these ships, and make illegal arms shipments to Israel, in order to survive.</span> <span id="s822">There was [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s823">Anyway, at that time, again, the revival of the stories of what we saw became more vivid as time passed, in retrospect.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Because of the enormity of it.</span> <span id="s825">Also it became probably completed after you heard of what happened in other concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Right.</span> <span id="s827">And then I saw my brother’s pictures and I saw Ray’s pictures.</span> <span id="s828">[Unintelligible] Sometime I asked him if he [unintelligible] show it to my parents.</span> <span id="s829">[Unintelligible].</span> <span id="s830">I wanted to show it to them.</span> <span id="s831">Anyway, then as I saw the reaction of normal people, not soldiers, civilians like my own family, the size of the crime became greater and greater and it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s832">This Holocaust [unintelligible] a very good means of showing to a lot of people that had no knowledge.</span> <span id="s833">It didn’t really tell why it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: You mean the movie.</span> <span id="s835">You’re talking about the TV show.</span> <span id="s836">1</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: And it is very hard for me now to get the why.</span> <span id="s838">To get the why.</span> <span id="s839">All right, you take away the Jewish guys’ money, but why degrade him?</span> <span id="s840">Or the Polish guys?</span> <span id="s841">Why degrade them and why make them suffer?</span> <span id="s842">If you are going to kill them, kill them.</span> <span id="s843">[Unintelligible] and forget it.</span> <span id="s844">But why have this decaying meat?</span> <span id="s845">I still don’t know why.</span> <span id="s846">I saw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">[Brief interruption in tape.</span> <span id="s848">Conversation resumes as follows.]</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q: ....still wanted to check on is...this is my own question.</span> <span id="s850">If you would meet a real Nazi now, what would your feeling be?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: It wouldn’t be friendly.</span> <span id="s852">I wouldn’t shoot him, but I wouldn’t be friendly.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: What would your feelings be?</span> <span id="s854">Like if you could legally kill him you’d like to?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: In other words, that feeling has subsided.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">1Ms.</span> <span id="s858">Mell is referring to The Holocaust, the made-for-TV movie produced and aired by NBC</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: I wouldn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s860">I wouldn’t have him as part of my friends or acquaintances.</span> <span id="s861">I wouldn’t want anything to do with him.</span> <span id="s862">At this point I wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s863">If I felt like killing him I wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: I know you wouldn’t, but I mean would you have the feeling like he has no right to live if he’s the kind of man....</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: There are some people like that.</span> <span id="s866">I still would feel that way toward him.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: And during the Eichmann trial, for instance, were you hoping they would eventually kill him?</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: When the Eichmann trial began, I wasn’t sure he was guilty.</span> <span id="s869">When it became clear that he was guilty, I thought he should be executed.</span> <span id="s870">Not tortured, but executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: That is in line with your thinking generally.</span> <span id="s872">In other words, war killing is bad enough, but this torturing is...</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I think anyone who had a direct hand in...a person in a responsible position should all have been executed unless they were found guilty in a court of law.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: I would still like to ask you a couple of questions about your political views.</span> <span id="s875">Did your political affiliation with a party or the general attitude of views change in any way as a direct result of your war experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: As a direct result, meaning a year or two after the war, I had no affiliation with any party.</span> <span id="s877">I was happy that I survived, and I was looking for pleasure, but I was very cynical and I had a cynical attitude towards life for a number of years.</span> <span id="s878">That’s why I didn’t get married until much later than the average person.</span> <span id="s879">I met my wife when she was 16 years old, and we got married when we were 28.</span> <span id="s880">When she was 28.</span> <span id="s881">I was much older than she, but the reason I was attracted to her was because she was a very naive and innocent person and I thought that she didn’t live long enough to become cynical yet.</span> <span id="s882">She is still an idealist.</span> <span id="s883">I was an idealist when I entered the war.</span> <span id="s884">I volunteered.</span> <span id="s885">The only way to get into the 82nd was to volunteer.</span> <span id="s886">I wanted to do as much as I could to destroy the Nazis, as I felt they were my personal enemy.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Did you feel that as Jew or as a human being?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I felt that as a Jew and as a human being.</span> <span id="s889">I wasn’t that religious a Jew.</span> <span id="s890">I didn’t [unintelligible] as they taught me to do.</span> <span id="s891">I didn’t go to the synagogue on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s892">I didn’t say prayers before eating.</span> <span id="s893">We used to celebrate the high holy days.</span> <span id="s894">My parents used to go to Temple.</span> <span id="s895">I didn’t go.</span> <span id="s896">I didn’t work on those days, for instance, and I didn’t eat...we had kosher food.</span> <span id="s897">We had kosher-style food, but I felt more close to Jewish things than to non-Jewish things.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: There was a Jewish identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: I had a Jewish identification, but as far as...a political thing, I was very cynical.</span> <span id="s900">I thought that the politicians would do things for their benefit at the expense of the rank and file, mainly soldiers.</span> <span id="s901">I mean it is O.K. if 100 soldiers got killed if one politician got a little medal or commendation or money.</span> <span id="s902">In other words, it was a cynical business and this business of staying alive and getting a certain amount of pleasure out of life I thought was more important than aligning myself with a political party.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Have you lost any of that cynicism over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s905">The cynicism was lost by the time I got married.</span> <span id="s906">And I wanted my children to be brought up as Jewish...the people, the warm Jewish people, and as a consequence for a time we kept a kosher home until it became very difficult and then we had a kosher-type home, where we observed the holidays.</span> <span id="s907">I conduct the services of the various holidays, but I can’t read Hebrew so I do it in English.</span> <span id="s908">When my oldest daughter was here, she read enough Hebrew and she conducted the services in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s909">My oldest daughter is married and is now in Oregon, speaks Hebrew fluently.</span> <span id="s910">She went through all the schools and she’s the highest winner of different awards.</span> <span id="s911">She has all kinds of encyclopedias that she won.</span> <span id="s912">In other words, Susie can read Hebrew and the other children...my son can read the prayers in Hebrew so we do have a Hebrew identification or a Jewish identification.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: How did you feel about the Viet Nam war?</span> <span id="s914">The Cambodian executions?</span> <span id="s915">All these horrible things that have happened since.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: About the Viet Nam... having been four years in an active division, when the war over there developed, I volunteered my services to General Ridgeway, who was one-time commander.</span> <span id="s917">He was my first general in the 82nd Division until he went up higher and higher.</span> <span id="s918">I was, at that time, in the 77th Division Reserves in this city.</span> <span id="s919">There was a General Ochs Adler, who used to publish the New York Times.</span> <span id="s920">He was the commander of that division and I thought I would be going overseas, but we never did so I wrote a letter to General Ridgeway, and he answered me that the only way I could get into service would be through Surgeon General's office, and he doesn't know where I'd be assigned.</span> <span id="s921">I said the only position I would volunteer for would be in his command and straighten out the dental situation he had there lilke I did for the 82nd.</span> <span id="s922">He wrote me and asked...but the way I felt about the war as it developed, I felt that the policy of this country -- the president, etc., all the way down -- was not to win the war.</span> <span id="s923">In other words, I felt it was wrong to go into war unless you were going to win it.</span> <span id="s924">If the war is important enough to be fought, then it is important enough to be won, and I thought the attitude of the American people from the president down was wrong during the Viet Nam war.</span> <span id="s925">I didn't know enough about the Viet Nam war to say that the war was wrong, but the way we conducted the war was wrong.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Do you feel now that the war was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: If we didn't plan to win the war, we shouldn't have gotten into the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Once we were in the war and during Johnson's Administration, for instance, the time...he had, I think, the right idea was to win the war, but there was such a backlash of opinion at that time and the casualties, which were high anyway.</span> <span id="s929">We lost a great number of people in that war.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Did you feel at any point after the war that it was wrong?</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: I felt we would have lost less people if we went into it wholeheartedly.</span> <span id="s932">There would be less American deaths if we went into it wholeheartedly, and the war would have been over, and we would have gained the reason for going into the war to begin with.</span> <span id="s933">Now we have large casualties...forget the money.</span> <span id="s934">We had large casualties and deaths and crippled human beings and we still lost the principle for what we were fighting for.</span> <span id="s935">We lost whatever advantage we would have had had we won the war.</span> <span id="s936">And we still paid the full price, so we got nothing from that war.</span> <span id="s937">Therefore the war was wrong.</span> <span id="s938">Whether we should have gotten into the war in the first place is a question I can't answer.</span> <span id="s939">If the problem of communism is as real as some people say, then we should have been in the war, and we should have won it.</span> <span id="s940">Not only that, if the threat of communism is as great as some people think it is, then we should have continued World War II and gone into Moscow, and then imposed a benevolent society in the world, rather than have to face a virulent enemy, potential enemy, which is Russia now.</span> <span id="s941">In some ways, what the Germans said to me right after World War II is over was right -- that our real enemy is Russia, and it looks like that may be true.</span> <span id="s942">That's the way it may seem to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: I think I....</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: You say...the question you asked me...and I think you mean about some of the atrocities that were committed in Viet Nam while the American Army...were horrible, I think were unforgiveable, and I think that proper authorities were not punished.</span> <span id="s945">I think Lt. Calley was a pawn.</span> <span id="s946">The wrong person was punished, and I don't believe that he was as culpable as his captain, his major, colonel, general, all the way up.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: What I'm hearing you say really is that war is a horrible experience, war is war, combat is combat, but you can take that....</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I don't believe in war as a solution to a problem, If we are in a war, if our attitude is not to win, not to engage in that war to begin with, even though [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s949">That’s not the point; the point is if you go into it, you have to win.</span> <span id="s950">If you don't plan to win, don't go in.</span> <span id="s951">Suffer the consequence.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Across the board you are against any kind of atrocity, of course?</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: I'm against any atrocity.</span> <span id="s954">I don't care what the excuse is.</span> <span id="s955">I'm against any torture of another human being, regardless of what the excuse is.</span> <span id="s956">I’m not against the death penalty.</span> <span id="s957">If a person commits a horrible, despicable crime, like rape, murder, kidnapping, that man should be exterminated in my opinion, if it's true beyond any shadow of a doubt.</span> <span id="s958">I am not interested in the fact that someone may say he is temporarily insane.</span> <span id="s959">I want him exterminated, just like I would a mad dog.</span> <span id="s960">I don't want to cure that dog and have him endanger someone else with rabies, I want the dog exterminated and want the murderer, the rapist, the kidnapper eliminated right away, not to torture him, but put him out in a painless way as quickly as possible, once it is established beyond a shadow of aa doubt that he did commit this crime.</span> <span id="s961">In other words, I am not against the death penalty.</span> <span id="s962">I think the death-penalty...in the Jewish religion we believe that an eye for an eye, a life for a life, and in our Ten Commandments or whatever it is, it says that.</span> <span id="s963">I don't know where that appears, not in the Ten Commandments, I think, somewhere in our history, that if you kill somebody, you deserve to be killed.</span> <span id="s964">An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life.</span> <span id="s965">It also means that there are some cases where murder which is understandable in a fit of passion or rage - in a family affair where...there are extenuating circumstances, which may have a lesser sentence, but I think a person that robs another human being and hurts them or kills them should be exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: I have a couple more questions and I'm sure you're exhausted.</span> <span id="s967">A: I’m not exhausted.</span> <span id="s968">I’ll be happy to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: I really feel badly about having put you through this feeling that you....</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: The only way to talk about what I saw there...right now...again, it’s on my mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Do you feel that the Nazis’ problem was primarily a Jewish persecution or a persecution of the human being?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: I think the Jewish people in Germany were persecuted, not because they were Jews so much as because Hitler needed a scapegoat.</span> <span id="s973">Hitler needed someone to blame their miseries on, and the Jewish people being affluent and having lots of nice things, it would be nice to take these nice things away and give them to the rank and file for their vote or for their vote of confidence, whatever you want to say, and have an excuse for all the trouble that Germany had after that point.</span> <span id="s974">Instead of six million Jews, it was six millions blacks that they had they would pick on the blacks the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Do you feel it was primarily a Jewish persecution problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No.</span> <span id="s977">It was primarily looking for a scapegoat, and the most convenient and easiest one was the Jews because they didn’t fight back.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: Do you feel that we have to do something today that this won’t happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Yes, yes we have to do something.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Obviously you consented to the interview so....</span></p> <p><span id="s981">A: Like what we are doing right now, by making people aware of the potential persecution of people, like the human rights question as President Carter talks about.</span> <span id="s982">There are such things as human rights, and these human rights have to be protected in a very stringent</span></p> <p><span id="s983">manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Do you feel that having gone through what you did helped you formulate such a strong feeling for human rights?</span> <span id="s985">That maybe if you hadn’t seen what you did you would not have such....</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: I think my experience with the 82nd Division -- actually where I spent all my time in the Army -- has shown me that there are things that are wrong that can only be corrected with force.</span> <span id="s987">That force could be economic force, it could be a show of force, or it could be actually destroying snakes, enemies that can no longer be spoken to.</span> <span id="s988">You can’t discuss morality with a rattlesnake.</span> <span id="s989">You can’t discuss morality with a rabid dog, so these...there are certain people, both black and white in this country, whom you can't discuss morality with, and they have to be treated in a brutal way, which you may say is brutal.</span> <span id="s990">They have to be exterminated, because there is no other ....</span> <span id="s991">these people will rob and rape and kidnap and kill.</span> <span id="s992">The only way to solve this problem is to kill them.</span> <span id="s993">There are terrorists all over the world today, like in Italy, who kidnap people who think they can get them money for [unintelligible], whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: And those you would want to kill?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: I think there are terrorists all over the world, especially those who endanger and kill other human beings, should be executed.</span> <span id="s996">Not tortured, but executed in a legal manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: But the ones who are alive should have civil rights.</span> <span id="s998">The rights of morally decent human beings should be protected.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Civil rights is something that mu st be protected by those in power, in any country, in any area of the world.</span> <span id="s1000">I think the rights of the human being is more valuable, let us say, than the preservation of capital, more valuable than having luxuries.</span> <span id="s1001">I think that is one of the most important possessions that any human being has, the human rights.</span> <span id="s1002">In other words, there is a very strong question here, and the answer has to be strong.</span> <span id="s1003">I don't think it’s the business of the U.S. to go into Russia and fight to eliminate problems there that we can't solve unless we go into a major war.</span> <span id="s1004">There are lots of Jewish people in Russia whose rights are being violated, human rights, and it would be the height of folly to declare nuclear war to protect them.</span> <span id="s1005">The height of folly.</span> <span id="s1006">Any other means, whether they are economic, whether they are moral, whether they are religious, whether they are academic, or in any way, whether they are artistic, I think that until the Russians prove that the human rights are respected, we should not deal with them in a monetary manner or intellectual manner, or an artistic manner.</span> <span id="s1007">We shouldn’t share our dancing or Olympics or any of that.</span> <span id="s1008">We shouldn’t cooperate with them until...we shouldn’t cooperate with any nation that violates the human rights of other human beings, whether it be on our own continent or whether it be on a foreigncontinent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: We just had some good news last week.</span> <span id="s1010">The Katz family with their little baby is being let out of Russia....</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: You mean for treatment.</span> <span id="s1012">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: And that was directly related to the visit of the American officials.</span> <span id="s1014">A: It is very important that the people that make the noise must not be partisan.</span> <span id="s1015">There must not be Jews fighting for Jews.</span> <span id="s1016">There must be Catholics and Protestants fighting for Jews.</span> <span id="s1017">There must be Jews fighting for Catholics and Protestants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: People fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1020">All the noise that’s made by Jewish organizations only is not enough.</span> <span id="s1021">For instance, the voice of Moynihan, Patrick Moynihan, has more impact than the voice of Sam Glashow or the voice of Rabbi Gelb.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: The voice of Sam Glashow can do a great deal as being part of the collection and will be taught and used for study -- what happened, why it happened, how it affected people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">[One of Mr. Glashow’s children comes in.</span> <span id="s1024">There is an interruption in the tape.</span> <span id="s1025">Conversation resumes as follows]</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: I got two of my children working since I stopped working temporarily.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: It was very nice meeting you and your wife and your four children, and I can’t thank you enough because....</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: My kid lives in Oregon, and I understand that they have snow there.</span> <span id="s1029">She is telling me they haven’t had snow there in years, and this year they have snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: We are all working so that it won’t happen in your lifetime again.</span> <span id="s1031">A: [Speaking to child] We’re talking about the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">CHILD: [Unintelligible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: [Speaking to child] You saw part of the movie.</span> <span id="s1034">What was your reaction?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">CHILD: I thought the Germans...you know how you said that Hitler needed someone to take out his problems on.</span> <span id="s1036">I think that’s what really happened because he had a lot of problems and he didn’t know how to get rid of them.</span> <span id="s1037">So he tried to take them out on somebody.</span> <span id="s1038">I thought the torture was terrible, and if anything happens like that again, I wouldn’t like to see it.</span> <span id="s1039">I’d rather die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: [Speaking to child] It’s better tha n dying to do something to avoid it.</span> <span id="s1041">When a person dies, he can’t do anything any more.</span> <span id="s1042">The body’s still alive if he can prevent [unintelligible].</span> <span id="s1043">So you don’t say you’d rather die.</span> <span id="s1044">You’d rather fight again.</span> <span id="s1045">I’d rather heard that than say die.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: And that’s what your father is trying to do.</span> <span id="s1047">CHILD: I’d rather die than be tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: [Speaking to child] Why don’t you say you’d rather fight so it doesn’t happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">CHILD: No.</span> <span id="s1050">If it happened, I’d rather die than be tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: [Speaking to child] Then if you die you’re not helping the people that are being tortured.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q: What your father is trying to do is help us to record all this and so we will make sure that children learn it in school, the people know what other people are capable of, so they won’t let it happen again.</span> <span id="s1053">If you die, then you can’t do anything to prevent it from happening.</span> <span id="s1054">You can’t stop the bad person from doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: [Speaking to child] If you die fighting the bad person to prevent it, that’s O.K.</span> <span id="s1056">But if you die like you give up, that’s not O.K.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">CHILD: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: [Speaking to child] I think at age 9 you know quite a lot.</span> <span id="s1059">A: I understand that point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: I understand it was so painful that you would rather die than watch it....what she’s saying</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: That’s exactly what she said.</span> <span id="s1062">In her own mind she means it.</span> <span id="s1063">I want to correct that attitude.</span> <span id="s1064">Better to die fighting to stop it or prevent it, then your death has meaning.</span> <span id="s1065">You know what I mean.</span></p></body></html>
