Hello.</span> <span id="s29">My father was born on October 6, 1889, and my mother was born June 13, 1887.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q. Now, were they both born in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s31">A. Yes they were born in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q. And do you know whether your grandparents had been immigrants or were they born in Germany too?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A.</span> <span id="s34">They were born in Germany as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q. Were you an only child?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A.Yes, I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q.</span> <span id="s38">What language did you speak at home?</span> <span id="s39">I am supposing German, but was there any 2nd language?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A. No.</span> <span id="s41">Just German.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q.</span> <span id="s43">So would this mean that your parents did not know Yiddish at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q.</span> <span id="s46">So can you describe the apartment where you lived?</span> <span id="s47">How many rooms, of what kind of furniture?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A.</span> <span id="s49">We lived in a small town, the house was over 100 years old.</span> <span id="s50">It actually belonged to my great grandfather; it was a typical small town structure.</span> <span id="s51">How many rooms, it had two bedrooms upstairs, living room, dining room, kitchen, no indoor plumbing.</span> <span id="s52">It did have electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q.</span> <span id="s54">How common was it to have electricity in your town in 1930?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A. I think most everybody had electricity in my town in 1930, not plumbing, but electricity.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q.</span> <span id="s57">So this was a house, not an apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A.</span> <span id="s59">It was a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q.</span> <span id="s61">So was there an outhouse in the garden?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A.</span> <span id="s63">There was an outhouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q.</span> <span id="s65">Did your family keep any maids?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A. Not in my time.</span> <span id="s67">They had maids before I was born.</span> <span id="s68">My mother was a professional dress maker.</span> <span id="s69">And she always had 2 apprentices in the house.</span> <span id="s70">But there was no other help.</span> <span id="s71">A maiden aunt lived with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q. Your mother worked out of the home.</span> <span id="s73">So the apprentices, they were learning her craft?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A. My mother worked out of the home.</span> <span id="s75">And they were learning the craft.</span> <span id="s76">My mother was actually a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q. Was she selling her clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A. Yes, she was selling them, she had a thriving business.</span> <span id="s79">In those days people didn’t go to a store to buy clothes, especially not in a small town.</span> <span id="s80">Clothes were made to order.</span> <span id="s81">That was her business.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q. Now, were these clothes made for a special occasion, or were they every day clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A. No, these were everyday clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A.</span> <span id="s85">The fact that your mother worked.</span> <span id="s86">Did you feel like that she did that to bring income, or was it assumed that she would work?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A.</span> <span id="s88">That was her profession.</span> <span id="s89">She trained for years in that field.</span> <span id="s90">I supposed she certainly helped to learn how to do that.</span> <span id="s91">My father was a cattle trader.</span> <span id="s92">We had a farm with a couple of cows and that is what he did.</span> <span id="s93">And he tended the fields.</span> <span id="s94">And she was at home, that was her business.</span> <span id="s95">That is what she chose to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q. Was the farm spatially located in a different place than the house, in a separate place from the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A. Yes, in Germany the farms were on the outlying areas, and all the houses were in town.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q.</span> <span id="s99">So I am guessing he wasn’t the only farmer in the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A. Oh no, it was a farming community.</span> <span id="s101">It was a very small town.</span> <span id="s102">There were maybe 300 people.</span> <span id="s103">There were more cows than people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s105">Was your father the one to go into the business of farming?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A. Oh no.</span> <span id="s107">That farm belonged to my great-grandfather and maybe beyond that.</span> <span id="s108">That farm belonged to my mother’s family.</span> <span id="s109">He came into it from another community.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q. I see.</span> <span id="s111">When he came into it, did you know if he already had training in agricultural activity?</span> <span id="s112">Or was that new to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A. I really don’t know much about my father’s family.</span> <span id="s114">I would imagine because he also came from a neighboring small town, also a farming community.</span> <span id="s115">So I would assume that yes.</span> <span id="s116">But I really don’t know much about that side of the family at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s118">Where both your parents Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A. Yes, Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q. Orthodox, where there any other Jews in this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A.</span> <span id="s122">There was one other family.</span> <span id="s123">Yes.</span> <span id="s124">I don’t remember their last name.</span> <span id="s125">It was a very complicated thing.</span> <span id="s126">They were a rather strange family.</span> <span id="s127">They had no children.</span> <span id="s128">These people living there.</span> <span id="s129">There was an old mother and a son and a daughter.</span> <span id="s130">Neither one of them was married.</span> <span id="s131">So I did not have much contact with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q.</span> <span id="s133">So would they go to some sort of place where they had a minyan?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A. Yes, in a neighboring town, there was a synagogue about twenty minute walk.</span> <span id="s135">About 10 Jewish families lived there.</span> <span id="s136">So that was where the two families in my town would go to worship.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q. Do you recall the name of this town?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A. Yes it was Hofheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q. Ok.</span> <span id="s140">Hofheim.</span> <span id="s141">So I am assuming that your family kept Kosher.</span> <span id="s142">They kept the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A. Oh yes, strictly Kosher.</span> <span id="s144">They were ultra-orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q. Ultra-orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A. Yes, ultra-orthodox, and I didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q. Can you describe what you mean by ultra-orthodox?</span> <span id="s148">What kind of rituals did they keep?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A.</span> <span id="s150">They kept every ritual.</span> <span id="s151">They kept Kosher.</span> <span id="s152">My father went to synagogue Friday night and Saturday, every holiday was kept.</span> <span id="s153">They prayed 3 times a day.</span> <span id="s154">My father put on tefillin every morning.</span> <span id="s155">Strictly- orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q. Your father would have side curls then, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A. Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q.</span> <span id="s159">He would have worn side curls?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A. No.</span> <span id="s161">He did not.</span> <span id="s162">And my mother did not wear a wig.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q.</span> <span id="s164">So they did not have a special way of dressing, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A. No.</span> <span id="s166">They were not Hassidic.</span> <span id="s167">I think that the German orthodox Jews were different from the Polish orthodox Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q. Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A. I am assuming that the village knew that your family was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A. Yes, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q.</span> <span id="s172">Did you feel that you were treated differently because of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A. Well, I felt different because first of all when I was a youngster, school was 6 days a week and I could not go to school on Saturdays.</span> <span id="s174">Also on Thursday afternoons, I had to go to Hofheim for Hebrew lessons, so I was taken out of class.</span> <span id="s175">And also the fact that I could not eat at anybody’s house, and the fact that we did not celebrate Christmas or Easter.</span> <span id="s176">So yes, I felt different, and I resented it, and I made up my mind at a very early age that were two things I would never do, to live in a small town and be orthodox.</span> <span id="s177">And I kept to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q.</span> <span id="s179">You kept it.</span> <span id="s180">Okay.</span> <span id="s181">So when you said that you could not eat at other’s people house, did this mean that you were invited to other people’s houses, that you were friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s183">I had friends at school and they would say, “Come over for lunch,” but I couldn’t eat there.</span> <span id="s184">And I felt excluded, no question about it.</span> <span id="s185">But once, you know when Hitler came into power, the whole thing changed.</span> <span id="s186">That was another story.</span> <span id="s187">But before that you know, I felt I had friends and I had no problem socially, and my parents certainly didn’t.</span> <span id="s188">They were part of community.</span> <span id="s189">My grandfather was one of the grand old gentlemen there.</span> <span id="s190">He was very influential in the community and he was very well respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q.</span> <span id="s192">So you feel like your family was integrated in the community?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A. Oh definitely they were.</span> <span id="s194">They were Germans first.</span> <span id="s195">The fact that they were Jews, that was like being Catholic or Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q.</span> <span id="s197">Did your grandfather or anyone in your family hold any influential position, like in the mayor’s, office, or the civil service?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A. No, not officially.</span> <span id="s199">But he was certainly influential in the community in his time.</span> <span id="s200">And I didn’t find that out until later, when I went back to Germany and the townspeople told me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q. Can you tell me his name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A. His name was Ulius Stern.</span> <span id="s203">He died in July 1930, the same year that I was born, in August.</span> <span id="s204">The townspeople told me that when he died, there was a formal procession from our house to the Jewish ceremony, which was quite a distance.</span> <span id="s205">Everybody was dressed in formal clothes and top hats.</span> <span id="s206">And my teacher who was the most anti- Semitic person in the town in my time, he led the procession.</span> <span id="s207">I mean, I was absolutely flabbergasted when I heard that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q. Do you have any way of making sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A. No, I don’t, but this was before Hitler came in to power when the attitude towards the Jews in Germany was very cordial.</span> <span id="s210">Jews held high positions in every field, medicine at universities.</span> <span id="s211">The attitude only changed when he came into power.</span> <span id="s212">My family lived that area for at least 300 years, and they were totally integrated into the community until that time.</span> <span id="s213">Hitler’s power began in Bavaria, and that is where I lived, and the attitude changed overnight</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A. Now, would most of the villagers have been Catholics.</span> <span id="s215">Or was it a mix?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q. No.</span> <span id="s217">Most of the villagers were Protestant, there were 2 Catholic families.</span> <span id="s218">They were somewhat ostracized as well.</span> <span id="s219">I think they would have been next.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q.</span> <span id="s221">Now you had the feeling they had been ostracized.</span> <span id="s222">Do you recall anything in particular that made you remember it that way?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A. Well I think what I remember is that they also had problems with neighbors and attitudes, nothing like the Jews suffered of course.</span> <span id="s224">Definitely, I think if I remember it was a long time ago, and I was just 9 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q. Would this have been people talking behind their back?</span> <span id="s226">Was there anything specific that gave you the sense that there was hostility towards them?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A.No, that just seemed to be the talk.</span> <span id="s228">I cannot recall anything specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q. Were there any Catholic children in your school?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A. Well I am sure these people had children.</span> <span id="s231">I don’t remember their names or specifically who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q.</span> <span id="s233">So you don’t have any memory of the children being treated differently in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A. No, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q.</span> <span id="s236">So you said that your teacher was the most vocal anti-Semite in your town.</span> <span id="s237">Was this person a gentleman or a lady?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A. No, it was a man.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q.</span> <span id="s240">Did this man ever say anything in school or outside of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A. Absolutely, he was Gestapo, he wore the uniform, and he was the one who threw me out of school.</span> <span id="s242">There was a big portrait of Hitler hanging in the school.</span> <span id="s243">It was a one room schoolhouse.</span> <span id="s244">Grades one to eight.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q. So, all the children were in the same room, and they were all taught by the same teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A. Yes, they were all taught by the same man.</span> <span id="s247">And as he entered the room every morning, we had to salute this portrait, not me but the children had to salute this portrait.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q. Of Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A. I was not allowed to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q.</span> <span id="s251">What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A.</span> <span id="s253">This was 1937 or 1938 was the year that it started.</span> <span id="s254">Actually it stated earlier 1937, they started harassing the Jews, breaking window, and they started to make life miserable.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q.</span> <span id="s256">So you’re saying, they started, was this your village or in the region?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A.</span> <span id="s258">This was Germany in general.</span> <span id="s259">That was a year before Kristallnacht, which was in November 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q.</span> <span id="s261">Did anything like that happen in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A. Well yes, they broke windows on Kristallnacht in Hofheim.</span> <span id="s263">In the adjoining town the synagogue was destroyed, Jewish businesses were ruined.</span> <span id="s264">They never made it to us, because supposedly they got tired out.</span> <span id="s265">So we did not suffer any destruction during that time, but it started earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q.</span> <span id="s267">That was what I was going to ask.</span> <span id="s268">How early did it start?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A. I would think if I remember correctly, 1937, mid-1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q. And had you started school at age 6 or earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A. No, 6.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q. So, from first grade on, this was the same teacher the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A. Yes, he was there for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q. And from the first day, the children were supposed to salute.</span> <span id="s275">Is that right?</span> <span id="s276">But you were the only one who was told not to?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q. And do you remember the teacher singling you out in other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A. Yes he was constantly harassing me, and of course the Hitler youth was very active in this town.</span> <span id="s280">He was the one who was in charge of it and of course, I could not join.</span> <span id="s281">He poisoned the whole atmosphere.</span> <span id="s282">There is no question about that.</span> <span id="s283">The ultimate outcome was that he threw me out of class, in front of everybody.</span> <span id="s284">And I have never forgotten it.</span> <span id="s285">That was such a traumatic experience in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q. Do you remember the date when he threw you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A.</span> <span id="s288">It was 1938; I don’t remember the exact date.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q. Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A. Pardon me?</span> <span id="s291">No, I should remember his name, but I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q.</span> <span id="s293">Now you said his actions poisoned the environment but at the same time you said you were invited over to your classmates’ houses and families.</span> <span id="s294">So were there certain classmates that weren’t part of this environment.</span> <span id="s295">Can you explain that to me?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A. Well.</span> <span id="s297">This didn’t happen until the latter part of 1937, so I am talking about friends from when I was a little girl, from prior to going to school until the latter part of 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q. And then did things change for you significantly socially?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A. Yes, because I think people were afraid to be friends with me at that point.</span> <span id="s300">Because I think that the town in general became very anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q. Do you remember anyone in the town doing or saying anything in public?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A. Not really, except the teacher, who humiliated me at every opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q. Do you know what kind of things he said?</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A. Just that the Jews were not welcome, and I could not be part of the Hitler youth, and I couldn’t salute, not that I wanted to.</span> <span id="s305">I just could not be part of the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q.</span> <span id="s307">Did he make you sit in a special place in the classroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A. No.</span> <span id="s309">There was really no special place.</span> <span id="s310">It was one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q. Do you recall your parents discussing the situation worsening?</span> <span id="s312">Do you remember them being worried or scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A. Yes of course, that is why they sent me to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q.</span> <span id="s315">So when do you first remember them starting to get worried?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A.</span> <span id="s317">They first started to get worried when they broke all of our windows, imprisoned all the German Jewish males.</span> <span id="s318">Also, I don’t remember if it was 1937 or 1938 when they imprisoned all the German Jewish males.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">That would have been Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A. No, it was before Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s321">It was... I keep forgetting... A Jew was accused of killing a German and that was the excuse to imprison all German Jewish males.</span> <span id="s322">And my father was imprisoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q.</span> <span id="s324">How was he was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A.</span> <span id="s326">They came to the house and took him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q.

Do you remember when he came home-what month this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A. No, I don’t</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q. Would this have been early 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A.

I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q.</span> <span id="s368">So your father resumed his work.</span> <span id="s369">I am guessing somewhere in the middle of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q.</span> <span id="s372">Did anything happen before Kristallnacht that you can remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A. No, nothing aside from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q.</span> <span id="s375">So then, tell me how you remember Kristallnacht, or how you remember hearing about it.</span> <span id="s376">What was the first thing you heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A. Well, the first thing I heard about it, is from my parents’ friends who lived in Hofheim, and who had businesses.</span> <span id="s378">And we went to visit and we saw the destruction.</span> <span id="s379">I remember it so clearly.</span> <span id="s380">One of the families had a shoe store.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q.</span> <span id="s382">These were Jewish families.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A.</span> <span id="s384">These were all Jewish families.</span> <span id="s385">Most of them in Hofheim had businesses.</span> <span id="s386">A shoe store, a furniture store, I think a linen store.</span> <span id="s387">They had small stores.</span> <span id="s388">And I remember the shoe store so specifically.</span> <span id="s389">Where all the shoes were thrown all over the place and boxes, and furniture was hacked to pieces and of course the synagogue was totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s390">They burned it.</span> <span id="s391">I remember that very clearly.</span> <span id="s392">And then we were told that the reason that they didn’t get to us is because they were tired out.</span> <span id="s393">That was the reason given.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q. And this was the first information you had about it.</span> <span id="s395">So basically the night that it happened, your family was unaware that it had happened.</span> <span id="s396">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A. Well we didn’t hear until after it had happened.</span> <span id="s398">Because it happened the same night all over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q.</span> <span id="s400">Did your parents have siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A. Had what?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q. Siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s404">My mother- there were six in the family.</span> <span id="s405">My father, I am sorry to say, I only know of one brother, that I used to visit as a child.</span> <span id="s406">I don’t know how many siblings he had.</span> <span id="s407">If I remember correctly.</span> <span id="s408">I don’t know if it was actual true information or not.</span> <span id="s409">I heard that there were two marriages and that it was a mixed family.</span> <span id="s410">But I don’t really know anything about it.</span> <span id="s411">I don’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s412">I don’t know that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q.</span> <span id="s414">So your mother had quite many siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A. Yes, everybody lived in Germany, but they all moved away from the town.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q.</span> <span id="s417">The only person who remained was my mother and the eldest daughter who was totally, profoundly deaf.</span> <span id="s418">She was unmarried, and she lived with us.</span> <span id="s419">My mother took care of her.</span> <span id="s420">I remember she had a stroke.</span> <span id="s421">It was 1937.</span> <span id="s422">Just before the trouble started that is how I remember it was 1937.</span> <span id="s423">I had gone shopping with my mother and she was lying on the floor bleeding from her mouth and nose.</span> <span id="s424">She had had a stroke.</span> <span id="s425">My mother took care of her until she died at home.</span> <span id="s426">But all the other siblings moved away.</span> <span id="s427">One aunt lived in Frankfurt, one aunt lived in Bayreuth, one uncle lived in Loire and another uncle lived in Saarbrucken, and my mother was the only one who remained in the South.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q.</span> <span id="s429">If I remember correctly, your mother was born in 1887.</span> <span id="s430">Is that right?</span> <span id="s431">And you were born in 1930.</span> <span id="s432">She was 42 when you were born.</span> <span id="s433">Is there a reason that you were born that late?</span> <span id="s434">Apparently from the stories I heard from family, she was married for about 10 or 15 years, and obviously she couldn’t conceive, and they never thought that she could have children, so everyone was shocked when I was born</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A. Ok, so there are other family members throughout Germany, and then you see what happened in the neighboring town during Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s436">Would this have been a few days after?</span> <span id="s437">That you were in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A. No the next day, yes, yes, the very next day.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q.</span> <span id="s440">So how do you remember your parents’ reactions, what were they saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A. Well, they were very scared, that is when they started proceedings to get me out of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q. Were they in contact with your mother’s siblings?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A. My uncle, my mother’s younger brother, had immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">Q. Do you know why he decided to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A. For the same reason.</span> <span id="s446">His wife was a very intelligent woman, and she saw the writing on the wall.</span> <span id="s447">They had a very profitable business in the Saar territory which was once under French rule, and then became German.</span> <span id="s448">And they were very well off, and she knew to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q. My other uncle, his children immigrated to Palestine in 1933.</span> <span id="s450">And they emigrated in 1935, my uncle and his wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A. My mother made arrangements for my emigration to Belgium with the Kindertransport through my uncle.</span> <span id="s452">My uncle made the arrangements in the United States with some organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q. Can you tell me your uncle’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A. My uncle’s name was Jacob Stern.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q. And his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A. His wife was Helena Stern.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q. And do you know what kind of business they had in the Saar region?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A.</span> <span id="s459">They had a clothing department store: children’s clothing, men’s clothing, ladies’ clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q. Were they able to find this type of work in the United States in 1936?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A. No, when they got to the United States, my uncle bought a chocolate factory, and he worked there, and when the war broke out, it was difficult to get sugar and flour, so he sold it.</span> <span id="s462">So he when he was in his 40s, he learned to be a diamond cutter.</span> <span id="s463">And that is the business he was in.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q. Do you know whether your uncle and his wife were able to take any assets with them when they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A. Yes they took their money and when they got to the U.S. they invested the money, and they took their furniture and silver and china and other stuff.</span> <span id="s466">Because they got out early enough, in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q.</span> <span id="s468">So he was the one who made arrangements for your emigration?</span></p> <p><span id="s469">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q. Do you know whether this was your mother’s idea or his idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s471">A. I am not sure how it came about, but I think what happened is that my father’s brother, whom we were friends with and in touch with, they had a son who was a year older than I and they also had family in New York.</span> <span id="s472">And I think that is how it actually started.</span> <span id="s473">My mother heard it from them and contacted my uncle in New York, and then he took care of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q.</span> <span id="s475">You don’t know the details of it of what he had to do to take care of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A.</span> <span id="s477">There was some kind of organization, Jewish organization, I really don’t know who.</span> <span id="s478">The Jewish Committee, I guess.</span> <span id="s479">Because they were the one who were supposed to take care of us in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q. Do you know whether he had to pay to get you on a list?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A. To pay?</span> <span id="s482">Oh sure, definitely there was money involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q. Do you know whether your mother needed to send any funds with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A. I don’t know who paid for it, whether my uncle paid for it, whether my parents paid for it, I don’t know those details.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q. Now, how did your mother explain to you what was going to happen, or your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A. Somehow I understood, I knew that I had to get out.</span> <span id="s487">The day that I was dismissed from school, I knew that I could not stay there, even though I was only 8 years old.</span> <span id="s488">And then my mother told me that this was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q.</span> <span id="s490">How did she tell you, how did she explain it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A. Well she just told me that the situation was getting worse, and that I had to leave in order to save me they had to send me away.</span> <span id="s492">That is the only time emotionally that I didn’t even cry.</span> <span id="s493">I just somehow, I just instinctively knew, somehow I still remember the feeling until this day.</span> <span id="s494">I left on the last Kindertransport which was in July, 1939.</span> <span id="s495">War broke out in September.</span> <span id="s496">Of course, the borders were closed, and I went to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A. Where did the Kindertransport leave from?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q.</span> <span id="s499">It left from Frankfurt, my aunt lived in Frankfurt, and my mother and I went to Frankfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A.</span> <span id="s501">So your mother was the person who accompanied you?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q.</span> <span id="s503">So you had to say “goodbye” to your father at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A. Yes at home.</span> <span id="s505">And I remember he gave me a ring, a little gold ring as a going away gift, and I had a chain with a “chai” medallion on it and on the train to Belgium, the German soldiers came around and collected all the valuable gold and silver that the children were wearing and it was summertime so the window on the train was open a bit, so I took off my chain and I took off my ring and I threw it out.</span> <span id="s506">I did not want them to have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q.</span> <span id="s508">You were a very headstrong nine year old.</span> <span id="s509">That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q.</span> <span id="s512">How many children on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A.</span> <span id="s514">The train was full of kids, I don’t know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q. I want to hear about the train but before, can you tell me what you packed?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A. My mother packed.</span> <span id="s517">I had a valise that I carried but then she packed a huge, I don’t even know what to call it in English.</span> <span id="s518">It was like a basket, but it was luggage.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t know if you have ever seen this, but in those years when people made trans-Atlantic crossings on ships they carried these huge trunks made out of basket material and it had leather straps and it was full of clothes, beautiful clothes, and my mother made all new dresses.</span> <span id="s520">In the meantime that thing got lost, I never got it.</span> <span id="s521">So I went well equipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q.</span> <span id="s523">Did you take clothes for all seasons?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A. For all seasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q.</span> <span id="s526">Did you take clothes for summer and winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A. Yes, winter coats and sweaters and summer stuff.</span> <span id="s528">Of course, I went in the summertime.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q.</span> <span id="s530">What did she say to you about when she would see you again?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A.</span> <span id="s532">She said she was hoping that we would be reunited, but I don’t know whether.</span> <span id="s533">What actually happened is that my parents could have immigrated to the United States.</span> <span id="s534">My uncle made umpteen affidavits.</span> <span id="s535">But they didn’t believe what was happening to them.</span> <span id="s536">They could not understand.</span> <span id="s537">They were citizens of that country, they were abiding citizens, they were part of the community.</span> <span id="s538">And then someone comes along and tells them that they are not.</span> <span id="s539">And they just could not believe it.</span> <span id="s540">That is the reason they never got out.</span> <span id="s541">And then in 1942, my uncle made arrangements for them to go to Cuba, but they wouldn’t go because the Belgian authorities wouldn’t release me, and they wouldn’t go on their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q. Do you know what ship they would have gone to Cuba on?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A. I don’t know.</span> <span id="s544">All I know was in 1942, before they were deported.</span> <span id="s545">And then one other point finally in 1942, when they decided they should get out, and then the embassies closed.</span> <span id="s546">There was no other way to get to the United States at that point.</span> <span id="s547">And so it was just not to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q.</span> <span id="s549">So you get to Frankfurt, and you get to the train station.</span> <span id="s550">Do you remember a lot of children?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A. Yes lots of children.</span> <span id="s552">And I also remember my mother had made me a sandwich, and it was a smoked beef sandwich.</span> <span id="s553">And I kept rehearsing in my head, when I was waiting at the station on the train, that if a German soldier came along and asked me what I was eating, I would tell him it was ham.</span> <span id="s554">Because it looked something like ham.</span> <span id="s555">Yes, of course, the train was full of children.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q.</span> <span id="s557">Now I find it amazing that you have these ideas and this independent spirit.</span> <span id="s558">Did your mother give you any tips or coaching on how to behave?</span> <span id="s559">These ideas were coming from you yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A. No, that is just the way I am.</span> <span id="s561">And I am 81 years old and I am still the same.</span> <span id="s562">I don’t listen a lot.</span> <span id="s563">I’m very emotionally independent.</span> <span id="s564">Not so much physically, my husband takes very good care of me, but I am emotionally independent.</span> <span id="s565">I always had to be that way.</span> <span id="s566">If I weren’t, I would have ended up in some psych ward.</span> <span id="s567">That is just a personality trait.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q.</span> <span id="s569">So let’s get back to the train station.</span> <span id="s570">Do you remember leaving your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A. Yes, I remember leaving my mother and not crying, and I cry very easily even to this day and that is the only time there was real drama in my life, and I didn’t even shed a tear.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q.</span> <span id="s573">What about your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A. I don’t remember that she cried.</span> <span id="s575">I don’t think she would have.</span> <span id="s576">She was kind of stoic, a stoic person.</span> <span id="s577">I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q.</span> <span id="s579">Did she give you any rules to abide by?</span> <span id="s580">Any indications of things that you should follow, principles, suggestions?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A. Well, I just think she said to be a good girl.</span> <span id="s582">To listen, to follow rules.</span> <span id="s583">I don’t remember anything specific, she was giving advice that a mother gives to a child, I would imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q. Do you remember if the children around you were rather unruly?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A. No</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q.</span> <span id="s587">They were silent, they were well behaved.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A. Everybody was scared to death.</span> <span id="s589">They wouldn’t dare do anything.</span> <span id="s590">The German soldiers were parading up and down the train, throughout the whole trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q. Where there any adults on the train that were coordinating the trip that would not have been soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A. Yes, certainly there were chaperones, people, and adults taking us to where we are going.</span> <span id="s593">We were going to a specific place, to a Jewish home in Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q. All the children in the train station?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A. Well I can’t say all the children, but a good part.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q.</span> <span id="s597">So you knew where you were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A. Yes, I knew where I was going, and my parents knew where I was going, and my uncle knew where I was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s600">So you get on the train and how many children are sitting with you in one compartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A. I don’t know, it was a regular train, I don’t know how many children were in the compartment.</span> <span id="s602">There was somebody sitting next to me, and there were two people facing me, but I couldn’t tell you the number.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q.</span> <span id="s604">So did the Germans succeed in taking anything from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A. No, I had only those two things, a little ring with a red stone I remember I had the chain with the “chai” on it.</span> <span id="s606">And I just took them off and threw them out, so they didn’t get anything from me, because that is all I had.</span> <span id="s607">I don’t remember that we had any money.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q. Do you remember how long it took to cross the border?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A. No, I don’t remember that either.</span> <span id="s610">I remember we stopped in Aachen, which is a border town between Germany and Belgium.</span> <span id="s611">I remember that we stopped there for some time but I couldn’t tell you how long the whole journey took.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A. Do you remember feeling different once you were outside of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q. Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A.</span> <span id="s615">What was going on in your mind throughout this trip?</span> <span id="s616">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q. Well I was scared, I was going to miss my parents and my life, wondering what life was going to be like in this strange…Don’t forget we had to learn a new language.</span> <span id="s618">We didn’t speak French or Flemish.</span> <span id="s619">We had to learn French.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A.</span> <span id="s621">So what was your destination in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q.</span> <span id="s623">We were going to Zune(?)</span> <span id="s624">.</span> <span id="s625">There were two Jewish homes, the one for boys and the one for girls.</span> <span id="s626">The one for girls was in Zune(?)</span> <span id="s627">, which was a suburb of Brussels and the boys were going to a home in a different part of Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q. And this was a Jewish organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s630">And my cousin he went before I went.</span> <span id="s631">I went on the last transport, and he went before.</span> <span id="s632">And he was in the boys’ home.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q. Do you remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A. His name was Gerard Eckmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q. And how much older was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A.</span> <span id="s637">He was a year older, and he was an only child also.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q.</span> <span id="s639">So you get to Belgium and what happens next?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A. Well we get to Belgium and we get taken to this home and we have to settle in dormitories (they settled us) and we put our luggage and clothes away.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q.</span> <span id="s642">How many children were in this home, in the room that you were sheltered in?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A. I don’t remember how many and I don’t remember how many in the home either.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q.</span> <span id="s645">Now all of the children spoke German, so you could speak among yourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q.</span> <span id="s648">Did any of the adults speak German?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A. No, everybody that was there spoke German; the adults spoke German because they had to communicate with us.</span> <span id="s650">But then we went to school right away and we learned French very quickly.</span> <span id="s651">And then I was only in that Jewish home for two months.</span> <span id="s652">In September, 1939, they transferred me and a few other girls to a non-Jewish home in Middelkerke that was on the coast in Belgium.</span> <span id="s653">Why they did that, I have never been sure.</span> <span id="s654">They said it was for health reasons.</span> <span id="s655">And I was fortunate I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q.</span> <span id="s657">This was September 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q.</span> <span id="s660">Did you remember hearing about the war breaking out?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A. I was fortunate I was there because the two Jewish homes, on May 10, 1940 when war was declared in Belgium, all the Jewish children were evacuated to Nice, France and many of them did not survive including my cousin.</span> <span id="s662">So we were very fortunate that we were transferred to this non-Jewish home, and the Jewish committee who was responsible for these children totally abandoned us, they just forgot that we were there and we were very upset, because we did not want to be there, we wanted to be with the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q. Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A. And they totally abandoned us and this home called the Foyer des Orphelins, they took care of us.</span> <span id="s665">Nobody paid for us, nobody acknowledged our presence, and that’s how I survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q. Was it a state institution or a religious institution?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A. No, It was a private institution supported by voluntary contributions.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q. Any religious denomination?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A. No, everybody was Catholic in Belgium, so of course the children were Catholic.</span> <span id="s670">This was an annex of the main orphanage which was situated in Molenbeek [I think she is referring to the location of the Brussels orphanage], and they had 5 separate campuses.</span> <span id="s671">So that at the beginning of the war, on May 10, 1940 when they started to bomb the sea coast, that home closed on the seashore and we were evacuated to Brussels.</span> <span id="s672">That is where I spent the war years.</span> <span id="s673">I actually spent the war years in Brussels in this orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q.</span> <span id="s675">So you were sent by mistake from the Jewish orphanage to the Foyer des Orphelins, but you were not the only one, there were a couple of other girls with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A.</span> <span id="s677">There were about 10 Jewish kids there.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q. And did the 10 Jewish kids also get sent to Brussels with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A. Yes, everybody got sent to Brussels, and they took care of us all those years, without any compensation or acknowledgement by the Jewish community that we were even there.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q.</span> <span id="s681">Did the institution or the adults know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A. Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q.</span> <span id="s684">This would have been on your paperwork.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A.</span> <span id="s686">We couldn’t go to school during the war.</span> <span id="s687">The older children... At the age of 15, everybody in Belgium at that time had to carry an identity card.</span> <span id="s688">And the kids who were older than myself who were 15 and more, on their identity card was big a red stamp that said” Juif”, which is “Jew” in French and they had to carry that, consequently, they didn’t go out very much, because if they go on the street car or are stopped on the street, that would be it.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q.</span> <span id="s690">So you and the ten other Jewish children are sent to Brussels in 1940.</span> <span id="s691">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A. 1940, May 10, 1940, when the war broke out in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q. Can you describe what life was like during that time what did you do during the day.</span> <span id="s694">You couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s695">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A.</span> <span id="s697">We went to school until 1942.</span> <span id="s698">From 1942-1944, the liberation, September 1944 we did not go to school.</span> <span id="s699">For three years, we did not go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q.</span> <span id="s701">In the two years that you went to school, was this state school you went to?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A.</span> <span id="s703">A public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q.</span> <span id="s705">Did the pupils or teachers know that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A. I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s707">I don’t know, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q.</span> <span id="s709">Did you make any friends during those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A. Oh sure, the kids from the orphanage.</span> <span id="s711">We were all friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q.</span> <span id="s713">But not the kids at the school from outside the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A. No, not the outside kids.</span> <span id="s715">There was no opportunity.</span> <span id="s716">We couldn’t go outside the orphanage and meet with friends.</span> <span id="s717">We were pretty much confined to the orphanage.</span> <span id="s718">We couldn’t go out on our own.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q. Were you able to pick up French in those two years?</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A. I spoke French, I picked up French immediately.</span> <span id="s721">I mean, by that time we were fluent.</span> <span id="s722">I forgot German by that time.</span> <span id="s723">You know, children learn languages very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q.</span> <span id="s725">The adults around you then were not speaking German to you anymore.</span> <span id="s726">There were no chaperones who spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A. Everyone was speaking French.</span> <span id="s728">French or Flemish.</span> <span id="s729">The language spoken at the orphanage was French.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q.</span> <span id="s731">Did you speak any Flemish?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A. No, I never picked up that language.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q.</span> <span id="s734">So those two years that you spent in school, do you remember which grades they were, which classes you were in, which grade?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A. I was nine, I guess four and five.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q. O.k. so you go to school for two years, you don’t get to go out much.</span> <span id="s737">Do you remember anything else about that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A. I remember that it was actually a happy time.</span> <span id="s739">We were treated extremely well, we were taken care of, we had shelter, we had clothes, we had food, and we did not suffer the sense that a lot of other people suffered.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q. Were you aware of other people suffering?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A.</span> <span id="s742">There were shortages of food.</span> <span id="s743">People had problems buying food.</span> <span id="s744">Certainly we were aware.</span> <span id="s745">It was war time.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q. Were there any shortages at the orphanage?</span> <span id="s747">Were there foods that you didn’t get?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A. No, the food wasn’t plentiful, but it was certainly enough, we didn’t starve.</span> <span id="s749">During the war we ate mostly potatoes, and carrots and rutabaga and those root vegetables.</span> <span id="s750">We had very little meat, or eggs, some kids got eggs if they were needy medically.</span> <span id="s751">We had milk that turned sour most of the time because there was no refrigeration.</span> <span id="s752">We had bread.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t know how really on earth we even ate it.</span> <span id="s754">They were not allowed to bake white bread, not that white bread is good for you.</span> <span id="s755">It had to be bread baked with I don’t know what kind of flour, but I remember when you broke it , there would be strings, and we did not have butter, we had this God awful margarine stuff, and so also there were mice so there would be holes in the bread.</span> <span id="s756">But we never starved so it wasn’t the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q.</span> <span id="s758">How many children were at this orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A. 60.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Q.</span> <span id="s761">Did you get to know most of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A. Yes, we knew all of them.</span> <span id="s763">The ages ranged from about 2-18, once they turned 18 they had to move to another facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q. Were there other war refugees such as yourself and the other Jewish children, or were these mostly children whose parents had either abandoned them or died?</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A. No, either parents had died.</span> <span id="s766">My best friend, her mother had died and her father was recruited into the army.</span> <span id="s767">So he placed his children into this orphanage.</span> <span id="s768">And they remained there for the duration of the war.</span> <span id="s769">The others most of them were really orphan children, the parents had died, one parent or two parents.</span> <span id="s770">To my knowledge, they were not abandoned.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q.</span> <span id="s772">After you left Germany were you able to correspond with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A. I was able to correspond with my parents until 1942.</span> <span id="s774">April 1942 was the last letter I received from my mother.</span> <span id="s775">In it she told me that they had to leave.</span> <span id="s776">Where to she didn’t know.</span> <span id="s777">And that was it then I found out from myself from a woman who was the librarian in the high school in the neighboring town, the daughter of a Lutheran minister, who took it upon herself to assemble a history of the Jews of that whole area.</span> <span id="s778">I find out through her that my parents were gassed in a truck in Poland somewhere.</span> <span id="s779">According to her, they didn’t even get to a camp.</span> <span id="s780">That is how I went back to Germany actually, it was through her.</span> <span id="s781">She had incredible information that she had amassed.</span> <span id="s782">She had done this all on her own.</span> <span id="s783">She had exhibits in the different town.</span> <span id="s784">She wanted to educate young people and to remind old people of what happened.</span> <span id="s785">And that is how I originally got back to Germany.</span> <span id="s786">She had placed an ad in the Afbau, which is a German newspaper in New York, and she was looking for me.</span> <span id="s787">And my cousin’s aunt saw the ad, gave it to my uncle, who forwarded it to me, and I wrote to her, no my uncle had already passed away, my cousin’s aunt forwarded it to my cousin and my cousin forwarded it to me here , and I wrote to her and that year my husband and I were going to Israel, my husband is a dentist and there was a dental convention there and we went to Israel and her name is Kordula Kapner, and we met Kordula in Ber Sheva, and she told us about what she does, and invited me to come and be a keynote speaker at one of her exhibits that October or November I forget exactly when, and I was working at the time, and I got a week off, and I went to Germany and I spoke at her exhibit.</span> <span id="s788">And that is when I found out a lot of stuff, and she gave me a lot of information and she has an incredible amount of information about that whole era, she has lists, deportation lists, it is unbelievable what she has amassed.</span> <span id="s789">And then subsequently I went again.</span> <span id="s790">She had another exhibit in my town in my school, where I went to school, and I went again and I spoke there, and I met lots of people, younger people, older people, a lot of the older people were gone already naturally, and I am still in touch with a couple, they are both physicians, and they just erected a memorial stone to all the Jews of the town from the 20th century.</span> <span id="s791">I am just in correspondence now via email, and so I learned a lot from her.</span> <span id="s792">And we are still in touch.</span> <span id="s793">Though not as often.</span> <span id="s794">And then I went back to Germany again and I took my daughter and my grandson.</span> <span id="s795">We just visited.</span> <span id="s796">I just wanted them to see where I came from and learn something first hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q. Sure.</span> <span id="s798">Now you said you were able to correspond with your parents from 1939-1942, was there a sense in their letters that the situation was deteriorating.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A. Yes, absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q.</span> <span id="s801">So they were quite open about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A. My mother said that they took away her sewing machine so she couldn’t work anymore.</span> <span id="s803">They had put them in a poorhouse; they took away all their possessions.</span> <span id="s804">They confiscated their land.</span> <span id="s805">My father couldn’t work and then the last one was that they were going, but they didn’t know where they were going.</span> <span id="s806">Yes, I thought definitely that it was deteriorating.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q.</span> <span id="s808">So in this time were you able to correspond with Jacob, your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A. No I couldn’t correspond with the United States.</span> <span id="s810">There was no correspondence between Europe and the United States.</span> <span id="s811">There was no correspondence with anybody after my parents were gone.</span> <span id="s812">There was no correspondence between the United States and Europe at this time or Europe and Palestine at the time.</span> <span id="s813">My other half of the family was in Palestine.</span> <span id="s814">Not that I was close to them as I was with my uncle in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q.</span> <span id="s816">What was your cousin’s name?</span> <span id="s817">Was it Gerhardt?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q. Were you able to connect with him during that first year?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">A. No, I never connected with him.</span> <span id="s821">We were not in touch with the boys’ home.</span> <span id="s822">Then I was away from Brussels, I went to the coast, so there was no way to be in touch with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q.</span> <span id="s824">When did you go to the coast?</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A.</span> <span id="s826">In September, 1939</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q. I thought you had left Brussels a second time, because you were in Brussels during the war.</span> <span id="s828">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A. Well I first went to Brussels, and then from Brussels I went to the coast, and then from the coast I went back to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q.</span> <span id="s831">So you are in school from 1940-1942, so who makes the decision that you can’t go to school anymore, who tells you?</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A. Well the Germans decreed that Jews couldn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s833">So the authorities of the orphanage abide by those rules and told us that we couldn’t go to school anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q.</span> <span id="s835">So how do your days look, in 1942 without school?</span> <span id="s836">How do you keep yourself busy?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A.</span> <span id="s838">We spent most of our days pasting ration stamps.</span> <span id="s839">You can’t imagine how many ration stamps.</span> <span id="s840">There were 4 or 5 homes with 60 kids in each home.</span> <span id="s841">That’s a lot of kids, that’s a lot of ration stamps.</span> <span id="s842">That is what we did.</span> <span id="s843">We sat there all day pasting stamps.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q.</span> <span id="s845">So I am not familiar with the ration stamps, what did have to you paste the stamps on?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A.</span> <span id="s847">They had these huge books, where you had to paste the ration stamps, I suppose they had to present them to buy food and that is what you pasted the stamps on.</span> <span id="s848">That took days and days.</span> <span id="s849">I mean we didn’t do it all day, we had to clean, keep the home clean, between the cleaning, the cooking.</span> <span id="s850">No the cooking was central, but we had to do the dishes.</span> <span id="s851">We kept busy.</span> <span id="s852">And sewing, we had to do mending.</span> <span id="s853">In those days you didn’t throw things out, you mended them.</span> <span id="s854">A lot of mending for 60 kids.</span> <span id="s855">We had to take care of the youngest children.</span> <span id="s856">I guess you could call it babysit.</span> <span id="s857">We kept busy, we were not bored.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q. And the non-Jewish children were still going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s860">Everyone was still going to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q. Was there any hostility from the non-Jewish children at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s862">A. No there was no hostility, no open hostility.</span> <span id="s863">But later I found out, much later on that some of the girls were angry because they treated us better than they treated their own, the Belgian kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q.</span> <span id="s865">In which way was this visible?</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A.</span> <span id="s867">They took us out, they took us to a movie occasionally, and sometimes they took us to visit their own families.</span> <span id="s868">They just showed favor.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q.</span> <span id="s870">Why do you think this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A. I don’t know, I guess they liked us better.</span> <span id="s872">(Laughing) Later on, I didn’t know when I was there, but later my friend, who I was very close to, she told me, because I went back to Belgium when we had reunions.</span> <span id="s873">She told me that this is what they said, they were very resentful of the fact that they felt that we were treated better.</span> <span id="s874">And in fact we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q. And the adults never told you why they were treating you differently?</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A. I don’t know, maybe they felt sorry for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q. And there was absolutely no hostility on the part of the adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A. No.</span> <span id="s879">None, whatsoever.</span> <span id="s880">Well, I shouldn’t say that.</span> <span id="s881">There was no actual hostility, but the staff at the home at the seashore; they weren’t particularly fond of the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q.</span> <span id="s883">How was this known?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A. Well, I guess their attitude that also came out later.</span> <span id="s885">We were too young to sort of be aware of that.</span> <span id="s886">That sort of came out when were older and understood more of what was going on.</span> <span id="s887">And those were good times, I hated it there, I was under a lot of stress, I became physically ill, I used to throw up all the time and they used to make me eat the vomit.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q. Oh my God, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A. And they used to humiliate the kids, not just me.</span> <span id="s890">When they kids wet their beds, they would parade them out and put their bed sheets on their heads.</span> <span id="s891">They were very mean.</span> <span id="s892">Those two matrons, whatever you want to call them, they were extremely mean people.</span> <span id="s893">They were almost like sadists.</span> <span id="s894">But we didn’t have that experience once we got to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q.</span> <span id="s896">How much time did you spend on the shore, how many months?</span></p> <p><span id="s897">A. From September to May.</span> <span id="s898">How many months is that 5, 7 months?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q. Too many.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A. And we hated it.</span> <span id="s901">Every day of it.</span> <span id="s902">We hated the Jewish committee for leaving us there.</span> <span id="s903">Every day we planned to run away.</span> <span id="s904">Except we didn’t know where to run.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q. And you don’t know why they sent you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A. I don’t know.</span> <span id="s907">Supposedly for health reasons are what they said, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q.</span> <span id="s909">You have no memory of being sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A. No I wasn’t sick.</span> <span id="s911">I was small, but I was always small.</span> <span id="s912">I am still small today.</span> <span id="s913">I can’t see any logical reason to be honest with you that I could see today.</span> <span id="s914">It was just luck.</span> <span id="s915">Had we not been there, I wouldn’t be here today.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q.</span> <span id="s917">So let’s go back to 1942, you’re all keeping busy.</span> <span id="s918">By the way, the other children, the non-Jewish children who still get to go to school: did they have to do chores similar to you, all the sewing and cleaning that you all had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A. Well yes to a certain point.</span> <span id="s920">Of course they weren’t there so they didn’t have to do as much.</span> <span id="s921">But sewing for sure.</span> <span id="s922">There was a sewing session every week, we all sat around a table and had to mend the clothes.</span> <span id="s923">That was a joint effort, that wasn’t just us.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q.</span> <span id="s925">What kind of holidays did you observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A. Holidays, you mean Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q.</span> <span id="s928">Did you observe Jewish holidays?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A. No, we never knew when they were.</span> <span id="s930">We observed Christian holidays.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q.</span> <span id="s932">So you wouldn’t have done anything to observe the Sabbath?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A. No</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q. And you weren’t keeping Kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A. No, certainly not.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q. And was that a conscious decision, or was it just practical?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A. No, well there was no opportunity.</span> <span id="s938">That was not in their schedule.</span> <span id="s939">(Laughing) The kids went to school, went to church on Sundays, and there was no opportunity for that at all.</span> <span id="s940">Don’t forget, Jews didn’t live openly in Brussels at that time, most of them were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q. Sure.</span> <span id="s942">But you were not hidden, you were in this orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A. Well, we were hidden in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q.</span> <span id="s945">In which way?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A.</span> <span id="s947">In the way that they didn’t advertise that we were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q. I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A.</span> <span id="s950">They didn’t openly advertise that we were there.</span> <span id="s951">They didn’t go to the authorities and say we had” x” number of Jewish kids here.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q.</span> <span id="s953">But the other children who were non-Jewish knew that you were Jews and so it wasn’t a secret, and you weren’t hidden in a basement or attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A. No, nothing like that.</span> <span id="s955">However, from what I understand ,although I don’t have concrete proof that, the authorities, there were some inquiries, actually, the Germans came to the home a couple of time but they didn’t somehow bother us.</span> <span id="s956">And they were also stationed a couple of blocks for where we were and they would go back and forth all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A. Stationed.</span> <span id="s958">Was it a garrison or a police station?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q. No, it was built as was a home for the aged, and they took it over and turned it into a military hospital.</span> <span id="s960">So they were going back and forth all the time.</span> <span id="s961">From what I understand, although as I have said, I don’t have concrete proof the authorities did have some problems and they did protect us.</span> <span id="s962">How I don’t know, but the fact is that we survived and we were never bothered.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q. Were you in any way required to go to church, to any Christian services?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A. No.</span> <span id="s965">If you wanted to you could go, we were never forced.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q. Do you remember being aware of Nazi forces occupying Belgium?</span> <span id="s967">Do you recall starting to see Nazi officers on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A. Oh sure, they were everywhere.</span> <span id="s969">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q.</span> <span id="s971">What was going through your mind when you saw them?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A.</span> <span id="s973">We really did not know what was going on.</span> <span id="s974">We weren’t aware of the camps until much later, At first they didn’t round up the Jews, that didn’t come until 1942-1943, and then we were aware, especially the older children, they did not go out unnecessarily, they did not go out on the streetcars, which is where they rounded up the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q.</span> <span id="s976">So what made you become aware, was it your minders, chaperones who gave you instructions or how did you become aware that it was dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s977">A. Yes, they told us.</span> <span id="s978">They didn’t keep it a secret.</span> <span id="s979">As a matter of fact there was one young girl, she was older than we were.</span> <span id="s980">She lived in Belgium.</span> <span id="s981">She wasn’t a native Belgian, she was from somewhere in Eastern Europe, and her parents placed her in the orphanage, under the guise of Christian, and they rented an apartment across the street from the orphanage, so that they could keep an eye on her.</span> <span id="s982">And so on her way to school, she could stop by to visit them, and a friend and myself happened to be by the window when the Germans came and threw their furniture out the window, and took them away.</span> <span id="s983">We didn’t know that she was Jewish.</span> <span id="s984">We suspected she was Jewish but we didn’t really know, because she went to school and she acted as a Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q.</span> <span id="s986">What made you suspect that she was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A.</span> <span id="s988">She looked it.</span> <span id="s989">She had very Semitic features.</span> <span id="s990">And we were suspicious from the beginning because it didn’t look normal somehow.</span> <span id="s991">She wasn’t like the rest of us, and she was an extremely bright young girl, she was a genius.</span> <span id="s992">She was going to one of the top schools there.</span> <span id="s993">And so of course at that point, we knew.</span> <span id="s994">And they were taken to the place where they took the Jews, before they were taken to Germany, a town called Malines.</span> <span id="s995">And this happened shortly before liberation.</span> <span id="s996">They took them on the train, her mother hanged herself, and the father survived.</span> <span id="s997">So then she left the orphanage, and went back to the family.</span> <span id="s998">That was the only incident that a Jewish child was actually hidden.</span> <span id="s999">People were not supposed to know that she was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q.</span> <span id="s1001">So her parents were taken away in plain sight of the people at the orphanage.</span> <span id="s1002">Did she start acting differently?</span> <span id="s1003">How did she react?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A. Not really, she continued going to school, I guess she didn’t really, she was I guess she was hoping that no one would know.</span> <span id="s1005">It must have been late 1943 or early 1944, because shortly after that we were liberated in September 1944, so shortly after that, so she wasn’t actually in the home for that long.</span> <span id="s1006">No, she just continued.</span> <span id="s1007">And then after the liberation, when her father came back, she went back to him.</span> <span id="s1008">After that, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1009">She never became friends with us, she really kept to herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q. And so I am supposing this was an all-girl environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A.</span> <span id="s1012">The home?</span> <span id="s1013">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">Q.</span> <span id="s1015">There were boys too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q.</span> <span id="s1018">So how were the boys and girls separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A. Just different dormitories, not in the dining room or playing.</span> <span id="s1020">We were mixed together.</span> <span id="s1021">The sleeping arrangements were different.</span> <span id="s1022">They had boy dormitories and girl dormitories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q.</span> <span id="s1024">So were there any romances at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A. No, because when the kids turned 18, they went to another facility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q.</span> <span id="s1027">But I am supposing the boys and girls might have fancied each other before the age of 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A. No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q. Okay.</span> <span id="s1030">So we were talking about how things changed in 1942.</span> <span id="s1031">Do you recall if there were different phases as you get into 1943-1944, or once you were out of school it was basically the same daily routine until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A. Yes, it was fairly the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q.</span> <span id="s1034">So nothing deteriorated at the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q.</span> <span id="s1037">There was no hiding at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A. Well, there was no hiding in the sense that we lived in an attic or a basement but certainly our movement was restricted.</span> <span id="s1039">You couldn’t go wherever you felt like going.</span> <span id="s1040">I had more flexibility because I was blonde and blue eyed, and I was small and because I was under 15 so I didn’t have to carry an identity card.</span> <span id="s1041">But the older girls, the older people, and children they were more restricted, could not go out, they could not go out on the street car, and we had to wear the Jewish star for a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q. Yourself included?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A. Yes, all the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s1044">Until they realized what it was for, and then they took it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q.</span> <span id="s1046">How did they realize what it was for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A. Because that is how they herded up all the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q.</span> <span id="s1049">How long did it take before you were required to put it on and when they realized what it was for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A.</span> <span id="s1051">It didn’t take very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">Q. Do you recall having it on your clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">A. I remember sewing it on myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q.</span> <span id="s1055">How did you feel about sewing it on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A.</span> <span id="s1057">At that time we didn’t think so much about it but once we realized what it meant, we didn’t feel so comfortable with it.</span> <span id="s1058">I am sorry to this day that I threw it out, I am sorry that I didn’t keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q. Do you remember being out on the street with it on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A. Yes, because we used to go on long walks every weekend.</span> <span id="s1061">Because it was sewn on our outer garment.</span> <span id="s1062">I also remember sort of hiding it as much as I could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q.</span> <span id="s1064">So that means that you were aware that it was not a good thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q. Were you getting into trouble?</span> <span id="s1067">Were you being harassed verbally or given any looks out on the street, any violence?</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">A. No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q. Nothing at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A. Not personally .</span> <span id="s1071">Nobody knew that I was Jewish, aside from the star, as I said we didn’t wear it for very long.</span> <span id="s1072">I don’t have Semitic features.</span> <span id="s1073">When I was a young child, I was blonde, I had long braids, I have blue eyes.</span> <span id="s1074">I looked like everybody else.</span> <span id="s1075">So why couldn’t I be like everybody else?</span> <span id="s1076">I never had any problems, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q.</span> <span id="s1078">So the phase when you had to wear the star was very short, was it a few months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A. No, it was a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s1080">It was very short, because once they realized what was going on, they told us to take it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q.</span> <span id="s1082">Who was “they”, the people who were in charge of the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A. Because they were very protective of us, they really and truly were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q. Do you remember anybody’s name who worked there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A.</span> <span id="s1086">The head of my home, we used to call them “Tante”, aunt.</span> <span id="s1087">The head of my home was Tante Denise, Vandenbroucke was her last name.</span> <span id="s1088">And she was totally devoted to the children and totally devoted to us particularly, it was strange, but that was the fact.</span> <span id="s1089">And when I went back to Belgium, on several occasions when she was alive, and I used to correspond with her regularly.</span> <span id="s1090">One was named Lucianne and, Gabriella, something, I forget, there were three, no four.</span> <span id="s1091">The children were divided according to age, there were three age groups and each one took care of a group and one was in charge of the boys, and each one had different responsibilities, and Tante Denise was the head of the staff, and she was a wonderful, wonderful woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q. And I think I might have asked you this you, regarding orphanage on the shore, this orphanage in Brussels these women were civil servants , their salaries were paid by donations, how did the survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A. Whoever supported this institution, that is who paid their salaries.</span> <span id="s1094">This was a very big enterprise; they had a board of directors.</span> <span id="s1095">The Foyer des Orphelins was a very well-known institution, they might have had some state funding, but they also received voluntary contributions because they had functions to raise funds.</span> <span id="s1096">But where they got all their money from, I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q. And the institution was called what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A. Foyer des Orphelins.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q. 1944, do you remember of anything of consequence before liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A. Well no, life was pretty much the same until September 4, 1944 when the Brits came in and we went down and we watched them.</span> <span id="s1101">And that was a change of life that very day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q.</span> <span id="s1103">Did you hear anything about D-Day during the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A. Oh yes, the head mistress had a radio, and we weren’t allowed to listen to the BBC, but somehow she managed to get that frequency, and we used to listen to it.</span> <span id="s1105">And the big scare came during The Battle of The Bulge, we were sure the Germans were coming back.</span> <span id="s1106">So we were totally aware of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q. And this radio was in English or French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A. No, in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q. And who would listen to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A.</span> <span id="s1111">We used to sit around and listen to it.</span> <span id="s1112">A group of us, and she would invite some of us to listen in her room, Tante Denise.</span> <span id="s1113">We used to sit around and listen to it in her room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q.</span> <span id="s1115">Did you know that you were not supposed to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A. Yes, she told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q.</span> <span id="s1118">She told you not to talk about it.</span> <span id="s1119">But it is interesting that she trusted you not to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A.</span> <span id="s1121">She was a very remarkable person; she was really an exceptional human being.</span> <span id="s1122">We knew we were all in this together.</span> <span id="s1123">We were totally aware of what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q.</span> <span id="s1125">The other children who were listening to this were Jewish or was it a mix?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A.</span> <span id="s1127">It was a mix; it was the older children, not the little ones.</span> <span id="s1128">She chose who could listen to it or who couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1129">Not the whole clan was there.</span> <span id="s1130">She had her favorites, there was no question about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q.</span> <span id="s1132">So did you hear about D-Day as it was happening or right after it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A. I don’t know how many days after we heard.</span> <span id="s1134">We just heard that the Allies had landed on the French coast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q. Was there a sensation that something was going to be different?</span> <span id="s1136">Was there hopes were there fears?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A.</span> <span id="s1138">There was always hope that the war would end and the allies would win, but it was never sure until it actually happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q.</span> <span id="s1140">How openly did the older children and staff talks about it with the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A.</span> <span id="s1142">It was a frequent topic of conversation that is what was happening during those years, that was the news, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1143">I mean you didn’t have a 24 hour news cycle that we have now, but we certainly knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">Q.</span> <span id="s1145">So you said that you were listening intently during the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1146">What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A.</span> <span id="s1148">The allies drove the Germans back.</span> <span id="s1149">My husband was in the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s1150">I think it was December 1943.</span> <span id="s1151">(Asks Burt –husband “When was the Battle of the Bulge?”)</span> <span id="s1152">Oh yeah it was December 1944, Christmas Day, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q.</span> <span id="s1154">So how does the war end for you?</span> <span id="s1155">What is the series of events?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A.</span> <span id="s1157">We were already liberated.</span> <span id="s1158">We were liberated in September.</span> <span id="s1159">We were scared that the Germans were coming back, but the Allies drove them back.</span> <span id="s1160">The war ended in May 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q.</span> <span id="s1162">How did you know that you were liberated by the British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A.</span> <span id="s1164">We saw them, we went out on the street, we saw them coming in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q. Were you let out on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A. Yes, we went to the main avenue where they came in, everybody was lining up.</span> <span id="s1167">The people took us there.</span> <span id="s1168">It was very exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q.</span> <span id="s1170">How do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A.</span> <span id="s1172">It was jubilant.</span> <span id="s1173">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1174">Then things progressed from there, we went back to school and life normalized.</span> <span id="s1175">And the war ended.</span> <span id="s1176">Then a very close friend of mine, her father had immigrated to the United States in 1940, and he was the only one, they could only get one visa.</span> <span id="s1177">She heads a mentally handicapped brother, and her and her brother went to Belgium and her mother went to Auschwitz and survived.</span> <span id="s1178">I happened to be outside one day and into the orphanage, through the gates walks this woman.</span> <span id="s1179">My friend’s name was Hilda Strauss.</span> <span id="s1180">And she asked me in German where she could find her daughter Hilda Strauss.</span> <span id="s1181">Somehow I understood it, and she was not in the same building that I was in.</span> <span id="s1182">I took her over there, and it was the most incredible reunion between mother and daughter.</span> <span id="s1183">And her wrist had obviously been broken, because the bone stuck out and the hand was downward.</span> <span id="s1184">She told us she was hit on the wrist with the butt of a rifle: obviously the wrist was never set.</span> <span id="s1185">She survived.</span> <span id="s1186">Then she joined her husband and they lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and then Hilda joined them.</span> <span id="s1187">But that was really the first remarkable thing after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q.</span> <span id="s1189">When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A.</span> <span id="s1191">The war ended in May, so it was shortly after, maybe June or July.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q.</span> <span id="s1193">Did Hilda’s mother talk about what had happened to her, aside from the rifle butt, did she talk about how it happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A. No, because that was the only contact that I had with her.</span> <span id="s1195">She left for the states right after that Hilda didn’t go to the states in February 1946, I left in April, 1946, Hilda left in February 1946, but her mother went before.</span> <span id="s1196">So that was the only contact that I had with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q.</span> <span id="s1198">So during this time, were the orphanage authorities trying to find out whether your parents were still alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">A. Well, the Jewish kids all went back.</span> <span id="s1200">Another friend of mine her mother had immigrated to England, to London.</span> <span id="s1201">Her brother had been in the boy’s home, and had been sent to the Nice and put on a train to a concentration camp, and jumped off that train and tried to join the Maquis, which was the underground in France.</span> <span id="s1202">When they found out he was 15 years old, they threw him out , so he joined the Foreign Legion, and he spent the war years in what is now Vietnam, in Indo-China.</span> <span id="s1203">And after the war he came back, he went to join his mother in England, and so did his sister, they were twins, and there were a couple of boys, they were also twins, their mother was in Scotland, and they went to join their mother in Scotland.</span> <span id="s1204">Hilda went to join her parents in Bridgeport, Conn. and I went to my uncle in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q.</span> <span id="s1206">When did you get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">A. April, 1946.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q.</span> <span id="s1209">When did you arrive in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A. April 29, 1946</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q.</span> <span id="s1212">So you were about 16?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A. No, 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q.</span> <span id="s1215">What were your first impressions of New York City?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A. I was really looking forward to it, we had seen all the pictures and the skyscrapers, and I was one of the first ones to go.</span> <span id="s1217">And I came over on the freighter.</span> <span id="s1218">The voyage took two weeks, it was horrible.</span> <span id="s1219">And the ship docked in Brooklyn-a real slummy place.</span> <span id="s1220">And my first question in my broken German was, “Where are the skyscrapers?</span> <span id="s1221">This is not what I expected.”</span> <span id="s1222">However I was very impressed when we came into the harbor and I saw the Statue of Liberty, I was sick for two weeks, it was a very rough voyage and I had a very difficult time because my aunt and myself, we did not get along, and so it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s1223">And my older cousin had just been discharged from the army the day before I arrived, so there was such turmoil in that family, and I felt that I did not fit in.</span> <span id="s1224">And my younger cousin, the older cousin’s brother, who was a senior in high school, he was a rebellious kid, and he had problems in school, and so there were problems with that.</span> <span id="s1225">And it was a two bedroom apartment.</span> <span id="s1226">So I had to sleep in the living room on the couch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q. Where was this in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A.</span> <span id="s1229">It was in Washington Heights.</span> <span id="s1230">The population at that time was almost 100% Jewish-German.</span> <span id="s1231">It was very uncomfortable, and I didn’t like it, and I was very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1232">I went to school right away.</span> <span id="s1233">They put me in junior high school in grade eight.</span> <span id="s1234">Of course, I didn’t speak English, and in those days they didn’t have E.S.L classes, like they do today.</span> <span id="s1235">And so they just stuck you there, and you either learned or you didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q.</span> <span id="s1237">Now were there other German-Jewish kids in that class?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A. No, not recent immigrants.</span> <span id="s1239">Of course there were.</span> <span id="s1240">Because it was in Washington Heights, most of the population was from a Jewish-German background.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q. Were they bilingual?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A. Of course they were, but I couldn’t speak German, I just spoke French.</span> <span id="s1243">I could understand German but I could not converse in German.</span> <span id="s1244">And that was the first year.</span> <span id="s1245">During the summer, somehow my aunt managed to get me a babysitting job.</span> <span id="s1246">I was 16.</span> <span id="s1247">So, I was taking care of an infant.</span> <span id="s1248">To this day I am wondering how this woman trusted this baby to me, what did I know about babies?</span> <span id="s1249">So I wasn’t very happy with that.</span> <span id="s1250">Then in the Fall I went back to school, I went to high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q.</span> <span id="s1252">How long did it take you to learn to speak English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A. I learned English very quickly, because it is so isolating, you can’t talk to anybody.</span> <span id="s1254">I would say I learned to speak English in three months.</span> <span id="s1255">Then I went to high school for a year.</span> <span id="s1256">Then when I was 17 my uncle said to me “You have to go to work,” so I went to work, and I finished high school at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q.</span> <span id="s1258">What kind of job did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A. My first job was babysitting, and then I worked in Mount Sinai hospital dealing with medical records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q.</span> <span id="s1261">So that was an administrative position?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1263">Well you know, way down on the labor scale.</span> <span id="s1264">I was a clerk.</span> <span id="s1265">I wasn’t trained for anything.</span> <span id="s1266">After I finished high school, I went to secretarial school, and I became a medical secretary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q.</span> <span id="s1268">So that was your choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A. Yes.</span> <span id="s1270">I worked in the hospital-that is what I was familiar with I and liked it ,and so that is what I did until I got married, even after I got married, and I worked in a doctor’s office until I had a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q.</span> <span id="s1272">Now in these immediate post-war years, what kind of efforts did your family make to track down your parents and the rest of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A. Not really, nobody made any effort.</span> <span id="s1274">I really didn’t know anything until I met Kordula.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q.</span> <span id="s1276">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A.</span> <span id="s1278">In 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q. Was there an immediate assumption they had not survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A. Yes, we knew that, that much we knew.</span> <span id="s1281">I don’t know how we knew, but we knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q.</span> <span id="s1283">When did you first start hearing about what happened in Jewish communities in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A.</span> <span id="s1285">What happened in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q. Or in the rest of Europe, that the destruction was systematic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A.</span> <span id="s1288">We heard that when we were in Belgium towards the end, once they started really rounding up the Jews in 1942-1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q. Was there any knowledge of camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A.</span> <span id="s1291">What they said is that is that they were taken to labor camps, it was never said that they were extermination camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">Q.</span> <span id="s1293">When did you first learn that they were extermination camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">A.</span> <span id="s1295">We first learned that after the war, when Hilda’s mother came.</span> <span id="s1296">By then for sure we knew what had happened.</span> <span id="s1297">Before we may have suspected what was going on, because people came back and started telling us about what had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q.</span> <span id="s1299">So already by 1945-1946, you had heard what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A. For sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q. So, let’s jump back to New York.</span> <span id="s1302">Did you have any social relationships with any other refugees?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A. Yes I did.</span> <span id="s1304">I didn’t meet anybody when I was in school during the day.</span> <span id="s1305">But when I went to evening school, I did, because everybody was in the same situation.</span> <span id="s1306">When you were 17 or 18 you had to work to survive.</span> <span id="s1307">I didn’t have to, because I lived with my uncle, but the other young women and men had to work to help support the family.</span> <span id="s1308">When you are a refugee you have to work to survive, you didn’t come with anything except the clothes on your back.</span> <span id="s1309">At that point we were all working and going to school at night, I developed a good network of friends.</span> <span id="s1310">Then we joined the Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q. Were they Zionist organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A. Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q. Which one did you join?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A. “Habima?”</span> <span id="s1315">I don’t even remember.</span> <span id="s1316">I wasn’t very keen on it, I was never good at that kind of stuff, and I wasn’t good at organizations.</span> <span id="s1317">I’m still not good at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q.</span> <span id="s1319">But you weren’t very keen on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A. I went for the social aspect, but I never really liked organization because of the politics, and I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s1321">To this day I don’t like it, and I am not involved in any organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">Q.</span> <span id="s1323">So the idea of Palestine or later Israel never appealed to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A. No.</span> <span id="s1325">I am certainly pro- Israel, and I have a lot of family there, but I never called myself a Zionist because I did not want to live in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q.</span> <span id="s1327">Did you want to live in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">A. Yes, definitely, that was where I wanted to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q. And how did you meet your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">A. I was working in the Bronx Hospital as a medical secretary and he came for an interview as an intern there, and that is how we met, in the library.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">Q.</span> <span id="s1332">What year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A. 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q.</span> <span id="s1335">When did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A. 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">Q.</span> <span id="s1338">Did you ever decide to go back and keep any Jewish holidays or religious aspects or was that was just a thing of the past?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A.</span> <span id="s1340">That was a thing of past.</span> <span id="s1341">I kept the Jewish holidays, nominally, but was never really seriously into it.</span> <span id="s1342">My husband didn’t come from a religious family.</span> <span id="s1343">His grandfather was religious, but his parents weren’t.</span> <span id="s1344">And my family wasn’t religious, my family in New York.</span> <span id="s1345">I knew I never would go back to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">Q.</span> <span id="s1347">When did you first visit Europe again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A. 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q.</span> <span id="s1350">So you hadn’t gone back even to Belgium before 1987?</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A. I am just trying to think when I went back for the first time to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q.</span> <span id="s1353">It must have been before 1987.</span> <span id="s1354">It must have been the late 1970s.</span> <span id="s1355">I went to Israel in 1975, the first time I took my son, and I think I went to Europe, to Belgium a couple of years later.</span> <span id="s1356">I think it was the late 1970s.</span> <span id="s1357">I have pictures downstairs, I can refer to them.</span> <span id="s1358">That was the first time I went back to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1359">I didn’t go back to Germany until 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q. Had you been in contact with anyone from the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A.</span> <span id="s1362">Now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q. From the ‘40s until the ‘70s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">A. I was in touch with everybody.</span> <span id="s1365">I was in touch with Tante Denise, I was in touch with my friend Mariette, and I was in touch with the Jewish kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q. And all the correspondence was in French,</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A.</span> <span id="s1368">The correspondence was in French.</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">Q.</span> <span id="s1370">So you never lost your French?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">A. For sure, I am not fluent anymore, but at that time I was fluent, for the first few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q.</span> <span id="s1373">Did you get to see them in to Belgium during the late 1970s?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A. Yes, we used to have reunions, then in the late 1970s.</span> <span id="s1375">And then my friend Mariette, she came here.</span> <span id="s1376">And she came here to Canada to visit me, and I went back quite a few times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q.</span> <span id="s1378">What did it feel like to go to Germany, to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A. Well.</span> <span id="s1380">Very interesting.</span> <span id="s1381">Everybody.</span> <span id="s1382">I shouldn’t say everybody….</span> <span id="s1383">Most people chided me for going back.</span> <span id="s1384">My husband said, “How can you go back?”</span> <span id="s1385">He would never set foot in Germany.</span> <span id="s1386">And my friends and everybody.</span> <span id="s1387">So I didn’t have any support.</span> <span id="s1388">But, I felt I had to go back.</span> <span id="s1389">I had to show them that they didn’t kill everybody, that I survived.</span> <span id="s1390">And that I was there to represent the people who didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s1391">So I felt very good about it,</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q.</span> <span id="s1393">So did you see anybody that you remembered in Germany from your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A. Yes, I did remember them.</span> <span id="s1395">I didn’t remember the names exactly, but I remembered some of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q.</span> <span id="s1397">Did you meet them again in ’87?</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A. Oh yes.</span> <span id="s1399">The gentiles.</span> <span id="s1400">The Jews were all gone.</span> <span id="s1401">Sure, I met classmates, kids I went to school with.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q.</span> <span id="s1403">What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A. Well it was very interesting in that...I took a lot of pictures and brought them back and my friends said, “They all look worse than you do.”</span> <span id="s1405">It was very nice to see them.</span> <span id="s1406">They were all very friendly and hospitable.</span> <span id="s1407">It was very nice to see them.</span> <span id="s1408">I really had no ill feelings.</span> <span id="s1409">When I gave the talk to the town, I said,” Under the circumstances, I don’t know what I would have done.</span> <span id="s1410">Would I have saved people, would I have harbored someone, would I have put my life in danger for somebody else?</span> <span id="s1411">I don’t know.”</span> <span id="s1412">I felt it was very therapeutic.</span> <span id="s1413">And it was just a positive experience for me.</span> <span id="s1414">So I didn’t put any blame.</span> <span id="s1415">So I went with open feelings, and I was willing to listen to people.</span> <span id="s1416">And it was therapeutic in a sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q.</span> <span id="s1418">What changed because of that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A. I felt that there was some closure; I was able to go back and to face the people and in a way confront them, and the fact that they were very responsive.</span> <span id="s1420">And it was a just a positive experience, it was not a negative experience for me, and people may not understand that, but that is the way I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q.</span> <span id="s1422">Now is there anything that we haven’t touched upon or talked about that you would still would like to mention?</span> <span id="s1423">That you think is important that we left out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A. Well the one thing that I would like to mention is that neither one of my children married Jewish partners, and that in one generation, it is all gone, and that is kind of upsetting, and it not that we objected to them marrying their mates or whatever...But it is sad that in just one generation it is all gone, and my son who went to Israel, who worked in my family’s kibbutz for 10 years every Summer, that is what he did and yet it didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1425">And that saddens me.</span> <span id="s1426">Otherwise, I have been very fortunate, both my husband and I are healthy, both my children and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren are well, both my children are doctors and doing well in their profession.</span> <span id="s1427">But there is no sense of Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1428">When they celebrate their mates’ holidays, when they celebrate Christmas and whatever else.</span> <span id="s1429">But my son is in touch with the family in Israel, and he has strong feelings for Israel.</span> <span id="s1430">But not for Jewish life or Jewish people in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q.</span> <span id="s1432">It is very touching and also very curious to me that this is how you feel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A.</span> <span id="s1434">In a sense we were responsible?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q. Can you elaborate on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A. Because we didn’t instill Jewish life in our children.</span> <span id="s1437">Because we didn’t practice it ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q. And that was a conscious decision on your part.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">A. And that was a conscious decision; I just didn’t know the outcome at that time.</span> <span id="s1440">I don’t think I would have done it anyhow.</span> <span id="s1441">It just wasn’t in me either and certainly not in my husband.</span> <span id="s1442">So, in a way, we are certainly responsible.</span> <span id="s1443">We never insisted that they date Jewish people, well they did join Jewish organizations, but that didn’t work out for them.</span> <span id="s1444">And that’s, you know, pretty much it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q. Leni, I’d like to thank you for this amazing opportunity to listen to your life story.</span> <span id="s1446">I am going to stop the recording right now,</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A.</span> <span id="s1448">You know this is my daughter’s doing, that she contacted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q.</span> <span id="s1450">The interview is your daughter’s doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">A.</span> <span id="s1452">That she insisted that I do this interview.</span> <span id="s1453">I wouldn’t have done it on my own.</span> <span id="s1454">Because I feel that my story is not really that compelling, certainly not as compelling as peoples’ who were in concentration camps, who were hidden in attics, or forests or horrible places.</span> <span id="s1455">That I did not suffer in that sense.</span> <span id="s1456">I always feel kind of, not guilty, but I don’t think that my story deserves that much attention.</span> <span id="s1457">Let’s put it that way.</span> <span id="s1458">But she insisted that I do it, and I agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q. Wonderful, thank you, we are glad that you agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A. Well thank you, it was really a great experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q. Thanks, I am going to stop recording now.</span></p></body></html>
