I was together with my family and with my neighbors and everybody else there.</span> <span id="s36">But then we were occupied by the Hungarians and a few years later we were occupied by the Germans.</span> <span id="s37">So when the Germans came in, this is when I started seeing and feeling different things.</span> <span id="s38">Now the difference was that we weren't allowed to go out at night anymore.</span> <span id="s39">We weren't allowed to go shopping, only at a certain time.</span> <span id="s40">But it didn't take long, maybe six weeks after the occupation by the Germans, that we were rounded up and we were taken to a..</span> <span id="s41">.</span> <span id="s42">uh....ghetto.</span> <span id="s43">And that is to Uzhgorod [Czech: U_horod].</span> <span id="s44">That was the capital of Carpathia.</span> <span id="s45">Now that was something that was horrible in my life and actually what happened was maybe four weeks after the Germans were there, they took my brothers and my father away and they told us that they're going to be in a work camp.</span> <span id="s46">You know, that they weren't going to be in the army, but they gonna be working.</span> <span id="s47">So my mother and, and us children--my grandparents were there--left.</span> <span id="s48">A few weeks later after they took my father and my two brothers away, this is when they rounded us up and...and took us to that ghetto actually.</span> <span id="s49">In the ghetto it was, you know, we were sleeping on the floors, on concrete, but we had blankets that we took from home when we left the house.</span> <span id="s50">They ...uh...told us that we can...we've got to leave everything except only what we can take with ourselves.</span> <span id="s51">So I remember my grandfather.</span> <span id="s52">He was...uh...a very old man.</span> <span id="s53">He was past 80.</span> <span id="s54">And he had a box...he had a Torah.</span> <span id="s55">I don't know how to explain it.</span> <span id="s56">The Ten Commandments or whatever...a Torah.</span> <span id="s57">And he did not want to leave it because he felt that wherever he is going to be, we will be needing it.</span> <span id="s58">How can we live without it?</span> <span id="s59">So, we had to deal with that.</span> <span id="s60">We...we wrapped that Torah up and we carried it with us.</span> <span id="s61">(Sigh) When we got to...uh...the ghetto, the older people were using it.</span> <span id="s62">You know, they were still very religious and they felt that this Torah perhaps is going to save us or the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: How did they carry the Torah?</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: We carried it in...by...in our hands.</span> <span id="s65">You know we wrapped it up in sheets and whatever we had and we just carried it with us.</span> <span id="s66">But when we got to the...when we got to the...you know, into the ghetto, every day it was somehow worse.</span> <span id="s67">Sometimes they wouldn't let us have water.</span> <span id="s68">Sometimes they wouldn't let us get out of the barracks and what we lived on is on soup.</span> <span id="s69">They gave us soup and...and bread.</span> <span id="s70">So that in itself was a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s71">But still you were with the family, especially me as a young adolescent.</span> <span id="s72">I wasn't paying much attention to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: I was between 13 and 14 in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s75">But then all of a sudden they, the Germans, you know, came on the loud speaker and they told that every older Jew that has a beard and he's got to report to a certain barrack.</span> <span id="s76">And, of course, we didn't know what will happen there with them.</span> <span id="s77">So my mother went along with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: With whom?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: With my grandfather.</span> <span id="s80">And what they did is they...and my grandfather also had a..</span> <span id="s81">.</span> <span id="s82">a prayer shawl, a tallis [NB: tallith] they call it.</span> <span id="s83">So they made these men put on these tallisen, these prayer shawls, and they told them to start praying.</span> <span id="s84">And while they were praying, they started beating on them and they started cutting their beards.</span> <span id="s85">So my poor grandfather... and my...my mother had to watch that while this was happening to her father and she couldn't come to his rescue because, you know, you...you just killed if you...if you go near there.</span> <span id="s86">So this poor old man had to endure the pain not only the physical pain, but the beating, but also the cutting of the beard.</span> <span id="s87">And my grandfather never saw himself without a beard.</span> <span id="s88">So he continued crying for a couple of days and my mother didn't know what to do with him.</span> <span id="s89">So she told...she gave him a scarf and he put it around his face and he tied...tied his scarf on top and then he put on his hat, you know.</span> <span id="s90">The older Jews, you know, wore these black hats.</span> <span id="s91">And that's how he walked around because he couldn't see...he couldn't accept himself without a beard.</span> <span id="s92">First of all, he was very religious and that was against his religion and beside that, it was strange to see himself.</span> <span id="s93">So we stood in the ghetto for a few weeks and then when they got enough people into the ghetto for a train, for a full train load... It took about another six weeks to get these people together from all these little towns into this ghetto.</span> <span id="s94">And they gave us...they lined us up, and they gave us a loaf of bread near the train and they told us they're relocating us.</span> <span id="s95">They're taking us someplace where we are being needed to work.</span> <span id="s96">And they gave us a bucket there for if we need to use it, but the way they packed us into these cattle cars, it was so packed that if one wanted to stretch his legs, he just couldn't because he had a person on...on him.</span> <span id="s97">So...then when we were packed into this cattle car they locked the door from the outside and we stayed in this cattle car until it...it was midnight and midnight the train started going.</span> <span id="s98">You know, there were many, many sick people, many small children.</span> <span id="s99">It was really, really chaotic there inside.</span> <span id="s100">We didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s101">So it...you know, it was so noisy and it was so tense.</span> <span id="s102">I..</span> <span id="s103">.</span> <span id="s104">I don't know how to describe it, but anyway there was a lot of older people that fainted and some of them died because they were old and ill.</span> <span id="s105">So they were laying there with us.</span> <span id="s106">When we got to Auschwitz, and we really didn't know about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s107">The thing is that they...these cattle cars, they had windows on top, small windows.</span> <span id="s108">So sometimes, you know, the younger children would stand on one each other's shoulders and would wanta look out where we go, what it is.</span> <span id="s109">So as we were driving through the country side I remember my sister kept me on her shoulder because I also wanted to see what's going...what's...what's going on there.</span> <span id="s110">And I saw the farmers showing to me like this (finger across throat).</span> <span id="s111">I..</span> <span id="s112">.</span> <span id="s113">I really didn't know what they were saying.</span> <span id="s114">And...and a young adult it just didn't sink into my head that they're telling me something.</span> <span id="s115">But it was strange to see these farmers.</span> <span id="s116">They were all showing like this (finger across the throat).</span> <span id="s117">I told my sister.</span> <span id="s118">I told my mother that that's what they were showing me.</span> <span id="s119">Well, anyway when we got to Auschwitz it sort of didn't sink in.</span> <span id="s120">I didn't expect that I was brought to a death camp.</span> <span id="s121">I just didn't.</span> <span id="s122">But when I got to Auschwitz and they opened the doors and the SS with the dogs were standing there and there was a big flame in the back of the camp, a very big flame.</span> <span id="s123">And it smelled.</span> <span id="s124">It smelled liked someone would be roasting something, something.</span> <span id="s125">And the SS were screaming, "Heraus!</span> <span id="s126">Heraus!</span> <span id="s127">Heraus!"</span> <span id="s128">"Get out!</span> <span id="s129">Get out!"</span> <span id="s130">Some of them were trying to go out and whoever couldn't go out, they were helping each other.</span> <span id="s131">Like my sister...I had two sisters coming with me.</span> <span id="s132">One was holding on to my grandmother because she was old and she couldn't walk very well, so she was trying to help her out.</span> <span id="s133">My mother was holding onto my brother and sort of trying to hold on to me to.</span> <span id="s134">But what they did is they pulled my brother away from her.</span> <span id="s135">They...they pushed my brother to the left and my mother and my other sister and me to the right.</span> <span id="s136">So my little brother noticed that my mother is going a different way so he started running after her and they started beating on him.</span> <span id="s137">And my mother heard his voice so she was...she looked back, so she was running back to my brother.</span> <span id="s138">And then they started beating on her.</span> <span id="s139">So she was pleading.</span> <span id="s140">She went on her knees pleading to that SS man to please let me go for this is my child and he won't be able to survive without me.</span> <span id="s141">He's so little.</span> <span id="s142">He was six years old.</span> <span id="s143">So after they beat her up, they pushed her to the left with my brother and there I remained with my sister.</span> <span id="s144">We were trying to run with my sister...my mother too but they wouldn't let us because when we got to Auschwitz they already needed a manpower.</span> <span id="s145">Of course, at that time we didn't know.</span> <span id="s146">So they wouldn't let us.</span> <span id="s147">And we looked pretty...you know, we looked pretty healthy yet.</span> <span id="s148">So they wouldn't let us run to my mother.</span> <span id="s149">So they started beating on us, on my sister and me.</span> <span id="s150">And my sister says to him, "You know, something smells terrible here."</span> <span id="s151">He says, "Well, we're just roasting pigs."</span> <span id="s152">And...uh...then you see these mothers coming down with little kids and they're...they're trying to pull these kids out of their mother's hands.</span> <span id="s153">And, you know, when you try to separate a family, it's very difficult.</span> <span id="s154">It's very difficult.</span> <span id="s155">People put up fights.</span> <span id="s156">It...it was so much screams.</span> <span id="s157">So there was a truck.</span> <span id="s158">I remember that truck.</span> <span id="s159">So the parents, the...the mothers that wouldn't give up these children and they were beaten up and the kids got hurt, so they grabbed these kids and they threw them on the truck and they really didn't look how they throwing them on the truck.</span> <span id="s160">So at that time we saw that something horrible is happening the way these people were behaving to little children, to little babies.</span> <span id="s161">And, of course, on that truck there were people, you know, very sick people going, you know, they were throwing sick people there and...and...and these children that gave them a tough time.</span> <span id="s162">They were just thrown on the trucks.</span> <span id="s163">And there were so many mothers that were running after the trucks, and of course they beat them and they pushed them back.</span> <span id="s164">So that was the opening of these...of these train doors.</span> <span id="s165">This is the first thing that I have seen there.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Go ahead.</span> <span id="s168">Keep talking.</span> <span id="s169">Tell.</span> <span id="s170">.</span> <span id="s171">tell me more about...tell me more about what happened at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s172">What happened with the--?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s174">Okay.</span> <span id="s175">So...uh...that...that big fire so maybe being that my sister and I was so young, it was like scary.</span> <span id="s176">It was...felt like you're going into the fire.</span> <span id="s177">And as we were walking, the people that worked there, they told us... they told us that they're gas...you know, they're...they're gassing more people than they can burn in the crematorium so they had to...they have to burn them in the pits.</span> <span id="s178">And we still...we thought that some person is just being cruel telling us that.</span> <span id="s179">So...and we walked, we walked, you know, they had a long line of young people walking and as we were approaching these barracks there, there was...we heard music.</span> <span id="s180">There was a man is telling us that they are burning people because they can't burn them in the ovens.</span> <span id="s181">They can gas more than they can burn.</span> <span id="s182">And here we hear music!</span> <span id="s183">It was very, very confusing to us.</span> <span id="s184">When we got closer, our room...a..</span> <span id="s185">.</span> <span id="s186">a..</span> <span id="s187">.</span> <span id="s188">a barrack or whatever you want to call it, opened up and they told us to undress.</span> <span id="s189">And, of course, you know, the SS were walking around there and there was so many girls that didn't want to underess completely and they started beating on them and they had to get undressed.</span> <span id="s190">And then they started shaving our heads and...uh...I remember staying there and these SS walking around us and if the girls would put down their heads, just trying to, just trying to hide, they would come up and they would take their whip and they would pull their heads up like this with the whip and they would look at us and then they would start whipping us.</span> <span id="s191">So we...we felt that there is something terrible going on but we didn't, still didn't think that maybe people are being put into a gas chamber either.</span> <span id="s192">So then we took a shower and they gave us a..</span> <span id="s193">.</span> <span id="s194">uh...a striped dress and they gave us wooden clogs and that striped dress had a number.</span> <span id="s195">And that took place during the night.</span> <span id="s196">We kept on asking where's...where's my little brother.</span> <span id="s197">Where's my mother?</span> <span id="s198">Where's the rest of them?</span> <span id="s199">Because we thought we'll meet someplace.</span> <span id="s200">They didn't...you know we...they separated us right and left, my mother and my brother and my grandmother and my grandfather, my family went to the left and my sister and I were the only one from my family that I found myself with so we kept on asking each other where...where is the rest of them.</span> <span id="s201">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s202">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s203">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s204">And then when they gave us the dress and they lined us up after a long, long time.</span> <span id="s205">You know, by the time they shaved a thousand girls' heads, it takes a long time.</span> <span id="s206">And...uh...it was...it was at night.</span> <span id="s207">I remember it was at night.</span> <span id="s208">And they let us into our barrack.</span> <span id="s209">They...you know, they took us to our barrack.</span> <span id="s210">When we got to that barrack, there were, you know, like on the bottom there was three...uh...three different parts to that...to where we had to go and sit down or lay down.</span> <span id="s211">So I was on...I remember, on top of that thing...on top of that bed or whatever you would call it.</span> <span id="s212">And I would just sit there and my sister and we...we had...we were six girls to a place...uh...maybe that...that wide, and we would have to just lay there and we were just wondering what's happening.</span> <span id="s213">We just...we couldn't figure it out.</span> <span id="s214">So these barracks were made...they were made out of wood and there were cracks between them.</span> <span id="s215">So early in the morning they took us out around 4 o'clock.</span> <span id="s216">It was dark yet and I wasn't looking around too much.</span> <span id="s217">So they let us stay there for an hour and they were counting us and...uh...after they count us they told us we can go back in there.</span> <span id="s218">That was the first night.</span> <span id="s219">That was the first morning.</span> <span id="s220">When we got back in it was already about, you know, daylight and I took a look through the cracks and I saw people hanging on these wire fences.</span> <span id="s221">It was such a terrible sight.</span> <span id="s222">I wasn't...I just wasn't prepared for all that.</span> <span id="s223">And I say to my sister, "Look what's happening.</span> <span id="s224">You know, look what's happening.</span> <span id="s225">People are...are hanging on these fences.</span> <span id="s226">They're dead."</span> <span id="s227">They were got electrocuted because many of them...some of them were aware of the electric fences and some of them thought maybe they want to escape or to go look for their parents or go look for their family.</span> <span id="s228">So they...they were hanging there.</span> <span id="s229">We were in all day.</span> <span id="s230">All day we were in.</span> <span id="s231">In the morning they gave us some soup and all day we were there and wondering what will happen.</span> <span id="s232">And, of course, we were locked in from the outside so there was no way to get out to see where we are, what's happening, what's going on because... because whatever happened, whatever they did with us, it was always during the night.</span> <span id="s233">So at night they...they brought in some bread and they gave us a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s234">And again during the night they were taking us to the bathrooms.</span> <span id="s235">It was also again a barrack.</span> <span id="s236">So we got to this bathroom everybody in... There was water.</span> <span id="s237">So everybody was trying to wash their faces or go to the bathroom, but it was...those... those Kapos...you know, these Kapos were people that were taking care of us, watching over us.</span> <span id="s238">They started beating us like if...you know, I remember I sit down to want to go to the bathroom like a human being.</span> <span id="s239">It was...and she started beating on me because she thought I was there too long.</span> <span id="s240">I was black and blue from her.</span> <span id="s241">My sister got me to.</span> <span id="s242">.</span> <span id="s243">to where the water was running and she was trying to wash me up.</span> <span id="s244">And that was the experience the first day, first... second day.</span> <span id="s245">And...uh ... finally, you know, after everybody sort of got their beating, knowing, you know, saw how we were treated, they lined us up again and they took us back to that barrack.</span> <span id="s246">And that was during the night.</span> <span id="s247">The next day, again, they got us out at 4 o'clock and they told us to stay for an hour.</span> <span id="s248">So the next day, the people that were a little bit weaker couldn't stay for an hour.</span> <span id="s249">It was cold.</span> <span id="s250">They couldn't stay for an hour so they sort of like collapsed.</span> <span id="s251">So what happened was they came and they pull these girls out, these people out and they...also a truck came and they threw them on the truck.</span> <span id="s252">And...uh...when we were in Auschwitz, we never...we never knew where these people are going once they were on the truck.</span> <span id="s253">Because I think if a lot of people they would have known once they get on the truck that they'll never see the light again, I think maybe they would have tried harder right at the beginning.</span> <span id="s254">But...uh... they didn't know so they...that's how it was going on for about...I was in Auschwitz for about five weeks with this routine.</span> <span id="s255">And...uh...every morning, they just pulled other...other people out because they just.</span> <span id="s256">.</span> <span id="s257">they just ...some of them were just giving up somewhat.</span> <span id="s258">You know, they ...the beating was...was so bad that I think they just didn't wanta live right of death.</span> <span id="s259">They just didn't wanta a go through everyday this...this beating.</span> <span id="s260">So...so we were weeded out, but thank God, one day a Kapo came in and said that we have to line up again.</span> <span id="s261">That was after already we were lined up.</span> <span id="s262">And they looked everybody over.</span> <span id="s263">Whoever looked strong enough to them, they again put them to the right and me and my sister was put to the right and then other girls were put to the left and they...the girls from the right were taken away, and the girls from the left stayed...stayed where they were.</span> <span id="s264">And they put us in another barrack with...by the time we got there, there were already other girls there.</span> <span id="s265">And during the night, they took us to the...to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s266">But we recognized the railroad station because when we got to Auschwitz, I remember the sign.</span> <span id="s267">The sign said...uh...uh... "Arbeit macht das Leben süß."</span> <span id="s268">I don't know if you understand.</span> <span id="s269">It said that "work makes...uh...uh...life happy [sweet]"...something like that.</span> <span id="s270">So when we got to the station, we were glad that...we felt we were going to get out of this place; because, as you know, I mean, getting out from Auschwitz by a gate and not by chimney, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s271">So we were...we were maybe a thousand girls there.</span> <span id="s272">And they...again they put us into...uh...to cattle cars.</span> <span id="s273">And we stayed in these cattle cars, you know, the rest of the night and during the day.</span> <span id="s274">The cattle cars didn't move, but we were locked in.</span> <span id="s275">Yal, they also gave us a bread.</span> <span id="s276">And during the night...during the night, we heard like bombs were exploding and that noise.</span> <span id="s277">We were...we were...we were kinda happy.</span> <span id="s278">We were...we were figuring maybe they're going to bomb the tracks and these people aren't going to be coming.</span> <span id="s279">Because I left some uncles and aunts in the ghetto and a lot of my family in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s280">So I..</span> <span id="s281">.</span> <span id="s282">you know, I was talking to my sister and the other girls and we were saying, "Oh, My God, they're gonna...they're bombing the tracks."</span> <span id="s283">We weren't moving.</span> <span id="s284">The bombing the tracks in...you know, the family we left behind isn't going to come here.</span> <span id="s285">But...uh... that...that was maybe for an hour, an hour and a half, that noise constantly...constantly.</span> <span id="s286">And all of a sudden it stopped.</span> <span id="s287">It stopped and we're sitting there in that railroad...in that car.</span> <span id="s288">In the middle of the night all of a sudden...and we thought that maybe that...that it was bombed and that's why they're not taking us anymore.</span> <span id="s289">But in the middle of the night, again, we started off.</span> <span id="s290">We went...they ...they...you know the train started moving.</span> <span id="s291">And so when we also didn't know, you know, where we're going or what happens.</span> <span id="s292">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s293">They didn't tell us what was happening to us, what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s294">So...uh...but we were stronger people.</span> <span id="s295">We were, you know, we were weeded out.</span> <span id="s296">We were healthier.</span> <span id="s297">We were healthier.</span> <span id="s298">So we were just trying to talk and figure out what this world is coming to, what's happening, and that...you know, you didn't see anybody saying anything except the beatings and...and the brutalities and...(sigh)... Finally, after a couple of days we wound up...it...it was in Germany.</span> <span id="s299">They took us to Germany and, again, we were walking from these trains and they took us in again to barracks like in Auschwitz but...but it was smaller.</span> <span id="s300">It was a smaller camp.</span> <span id="s301">It was a smaller camp.</span> <span id="s302">And they put us into these barracks again and they gave us some soup.</span> <span id="s303">And the next day, again, they putting us out and they told us to get out again.</span> <span id="s304">For a hour we had to stay in line and they were counting us.</span> <span id="s305">And after that they gave us a slice of bread and some soup and they told us to march.</span> <span id="s306">We should go.</span> <span id="s307">And we...we marched and marched maybe for an hour and we got to a munition factory.</span> <span id="s308">When we got to the muniton factory, they took these girls and placed them in different places.</span> <span id="s309">And they placed me near a..</span> <span id="s310">.</span> <span id="s311">uh... near a..</span> <span id="s312">.</span> <span id="s313">uh...like...it was like a pump, to pump the explosive into bombs.</span> <span id="s314">They were maybe [motioning] that tall.</span> <span id="s315">And I had to do it so fast that it was going with the machine and as the machine was working, I had to work with the machine.</span> <span id="s316">So, of course, in the beginning it was okay because I still wasn't that weakened.</span> <span id="s317">But after awhile, you know, the little bit of hair that we had became red from the poison, from that gunpowder.</span> <span id="s318">Our eyes were yellow.</span> <span id="s319">Our bodies were yellow.</span> <span id="s320">The reason why is because we worked night shifts and day shifts.</span> <span id="s321">So the night shift, and we worked the night shift, they closed the doors and the windows so we had no circulation.</span> <span id="s322">So this poison was going into our system.</span> <span id="s323">When we worked during the day, it wasn't too bad because the doors and the windows were open.</span> <span id="s324">So there weren't that many girls that were falling, but during the night is when a lot of girls just fainted and just... just died because the body was full of poison.</span> <span id="s325">Well, anyway, we were working there for a few months.</span> <span id="s326">We got weakened and my sister...she's two years older.</span> <span id="s327">And at that time I just felt mentally that I can't go on anymore.</span> <span id="s328">Besides physically...I was physically broken.</span> <span id="s329">So what she would do is she would give her slice of bread and she would...uh...she would say, "No, you're not gonna die.</span> <span id="s330">You're not gonna leave me here alone.</span> <span id="s331">Your not gonna die."</span> <span id="s332">She...uh ...she was like afraid of being alone.</span> <span id="s333">So...so I was trying to hold on to my life because I saw what she care...you know, the way she carried on.</span> <span id="s334">When we were walking back and forth to work...you know, it was an hour's walk, maybe more...and it was cold.</span> <span id="s335">So whenever we could pick up, like a rotten potato or something we would pick it up.</span> <span id="s336">Or if we would find paper...if we would find paper, we would put in into the...uh...into that dress that we had so that we should keep warm.</span> <span id="s337">And, of course, if we could find a rag on the road sometimes, we would secretly want to pick it up and tie it to our clogs because at that time it was already snowing there in eastern Europe and the clogs were falling off our feet and we ...if we wouldn't pick them up quick enough, then we would be walking barefooted.</span> <span id="s338">So...uh...I remember one time...uh...we were walking on one side of the street and Russian soldiers and French soldiers... The reason why you knew they were Russian and French soldiers is because they let them...they were prisoners and they let them wear the uniform.</span> <span id="s339">It's just that the buttons I remember were off.</span> <span id="s340">They had no buttons.</span> <span id="s341">And...uh... the men...they were...uh..., you know, big men with these big hats and we...we were trying to figure it out.</span> <span id="s342">We thought they were Russian.</span> <span id="s343">So...uh...believe me they looked like they suffered, but evidently what happened was they must have gotten more food than we did.</span> <span id="s344">So a French soldier threw some bread across the street into our group.</span> <span id="s345">So the girl that was lucky was there and she picked it up, but the SS saw that she grabbed that bread and he started beating on her and beat on her and beat on her until she no longer could, you know, so she fell to the floor.</span> <span id="s346">And we just walked away, and we never saw her.</span> <span id="s347">But that would even happen if some girl would pick up...I mean when we...when we wanted to pick up something from...that was laying on the road, that... that would have to be like, you know, that the SS shouldn't see.</span> <span id="s348">You would have to look around and see because if they found you picking this up, you know, you were beaten up and it depended how strong you were whether you can take that beating or you can't.</span> <span id="s349">So...uh...and the girls were starting to get weak.</span> <span id="s350">You know, after...after awhile, you just can't take that punishment, the physical and the mental it's just...it's just you can't go on.</span> <span id="s351">We were there for a long, long time...for a long time going on.</span> <span id="s352">It was may...it was maybe 500 girls left at that time in our bunk...in our...in our,...uh...you know, in our group.</span> <span id="s353">And as weaker as we were getting, we were trying to...we were trying to help each other sort of.</span> <span id="s354">So...the S..</span> <span id="s355">.</span> <span id="s356">so the SS had one kitchen that the girls worked in...in the kitchen, cooking for the SS people and us, we had another kitchen.</span> <span id="s357">It was, you know, cooked soup.</span> <span id="s358">So there was a girl in.</span> <span id="s359">.</span> <span id="s360">in my...happened to be in my bunk there.</span> <span id="s361">She had a sister.</span> <span id="s362">She was lucky.</span> <span id="s363">She worked in the SS kitchen so, you know, she...she was surviving all right.</span> <span id="s364">But her sister wasn't surviving too well.</span> <span id="s365">So she sneaked some bread and brought it to her sister and they sort of...the Kapo caught her taking that bread to her sister.</span> <span id="s366">Well, they were both...both beaten up right there.</span> <span id="s367">And then they ordered all of us to come out and they took both of these girls and they hung them there on the gallows.</span> <span id="s368">I remember.</span> <span id="s369">I..</span> <span id="s370">.</span> <span id="s371">I remember I still if I have nightmares, these faces come in front of me.</span> <span id="s372">If I think back on them I just, you know, I think they were trying so hard to survive and, therefore, they were punished.</span> <span id="s373">And they were so young.</span> <span id="s374">They were so young.</span> <span id="s375">And that was going on, but...uh....</span> <span id="s376">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s377">I don't want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Take your time.</span> <span id="s379">Take your time.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: I'll take a little bit of water.</span> <span id="s381">I feel we were still perhaps treated better than a lot of them because we worked...because we worked, but still, you know, after awhile you just can't take it.</span> <span id="s382">You know, you can't take it.</span> <span id="s383">So again, I..</span> <span id="s384">.</span> <span id="s385">I couldn't get up in the morning anymore.</span> <span id="s386">And my sister would come and just literally stand me up because she knew that if I'll remain in the barrack that I'll just disappear...that, you know, she'll never see me again.</span> <span id="s387">So she would stand me up and she would hold me up for the hour that we would have to stay outside in the cold.</span> <span id="s388">It was so cold.</span> <span id="s389">And then she would drag me to work.</span> <span id="s390">She would actually drag me to work.</span> <span id="s391">And she would do her work and she would try to do my work.</span> <span id="s392">And...uh...it was...I just felt that I am not going to make it there in the end.</span> <span id="s393">But then all of a sudden, it was a long time.</span> <span id="s394">It was maybe nine months, a year, and we were already...we didn't look like people.</span> <span id="s395">We looked, you know, with...with deep red hair.</span> <span id="s396">I..</span> <span id="s397">.</span> <span id="s398">It was like an orangey red hair.</span> <span id="s399">Our bodies were yellow.</span> <span id="s400">We were very skinny.</span> <span id="s401">I weighed maybe 70 pounds, 60 pounds.</span> <span id="s402">You know, I just didn't look human anymore and I was burned up with that gunpowder.</span> <span id="s403">It was hot.</span> <span id="s404">That gunpowder is hot.</span> <span id="s405">So I was...my body was burned with the gunpowder.</span> <span id="s406">And one day...one day they came...they let us stay inside.</span> <span id="s407">They didn't take us to work.</span> <span id="s408">So what happened was they bombed.</span> <span id="s409">Every night when we were there, we were praying, praying they should bomb this factory, this munition factory.</span> <span id="s410">Even though we were there, they never let us out when the bombing was going on.</span> <span id="s411">They never let us out.</span> <span id="s412">They just locked the doors.</span> <span id="s413">But we...we didn't care.</span> <span id="s414">We almost felt well, you know, we...we won't live through it anyway, might as well go.</span> <span id="s415">But...uh...one day, it just so happened when we weren't there, that factory was bombed.</span> <span id="s416">So that was the day when they gave us off.</span> <span id="s417">And next day they took us to...make... they told us that we're not going to work anymore in that.</span> <span id="s418">They didn't tell us it was bombed.</span> <span id="s419">But they told us we won't...we won't be able to go there, but we're going to work someplace else.</span> <span id="s420">So they took us to work on a road, to build a road.</span> <span id="s421">Which was better because on a road you were on the fresh air.</span> <span id="s422">And...uh ...you know, you tried doing as much as you can and even...you know, even if sometimes you got a..</span> <span id="s423">.</span> <span id="s424">a..</span> <span id="s425">.</span> <span id="s426">a whip, you could have, you know, you...you sort of overcome it faster than working constantly in this poisoned atmosphere.</span> <span id="s427">But still we worked on that road maybe...uh...you know, a..</span> <span id="s428">.</span> <span id="s429">a few months and again they locked us in.</span> <span id="s430">They locked us into this barrack.</span> <span id="s431">We were...we were very few left.</span> <span id="s432">We were maybe 200, maybe 200 left.</span> <span id="s433">And...uh...we were locked in from the outside and...and nobody came at 4 o'clock to open up this barrack.</span> <span id="s434">So...uh...we...we got scared.</span> <span id="s435">We figured what they'll do is just destroy us in this barrack.</span> <span id="s436">And...uh...nobody came and nothing is happening.</span> <span id="s437">The SS we don't...we looked through the cracks and we don't see a soul.</span> <span id="s438">And we were there a day and a night.</span> <span id="s439">Nobody bothered us.</span> <span id="s440">Then middle of the day we see some civilians came with a truck, with an open truck and they opened up our.</span> <span id="s441">.</span> <span id="s442">uh....</span> <span id="s443">you know, our...uh...barrack and they said that we weren't needed there anymore and they're taking us to another place.</span> <span id="s444">So they put us on that open truck and as I said, we got there, there was maybe about...maybe a thousand, twelve hundred girls.</span> <span id="s445">When we...when we left there, there was an open truck full, maybe 200 girls, maybe.</span> <span id="s446">And they didn't tell us where we were going, but they put us in that open truck and that was civilians.</span> <span id="s447">There...there were no SS men, and they took us to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s448">When we got to Bergen-Belsen...uh...you know most of the people would have to stay in.</span> <span id="s449">And we were thrown in in a barrack.</span> <span id="s450">My God!</span> <span id="s451">There were all kinds of dead people laying there and the smell of dead people...uh... People that lost their minds from all this going through already....uh...the way they looked.</span> <span id="s452">I mean we didn't look so good either because we...we were a different color.</span> <span id="s453">We were yellow and we had orange red hair.</span> <span id="s454">We...we... we looked like to them probably also like we're not from this planet.</span> <span id="s455">Well, anyway they were infected with typhus already.</span> <span id="s456">So we were laying there and...uh...also got you know, we also got soup in the morning, but we didn't get the bread anymore in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s457">And we were there for a few weeks, a month.</span> <span id="s458">Uh, my sister got sick.</span> <span id="s459">She was the strong one and I was the sick one and she got sick.</span> <span id="s460">Evidently what happened she was... she was infected with typhus.</span> <span id="s461">She got the typhus, got to her faster than to me.</span> <span id="s462">So she had high fever and...uh...and I saw that she was talking deliriously.</span> <span id="s463">She...she...she no longer spoke, you know, normally and she was laying near the floor and she says to me, "You know I..</span> <span id="s464">.</span> <span id="s465">I see tanks coming down."</span> <span id="s466">And I thought she was sick.</span> <span id="s467">I thought she was sick.</span> <span id="s468">She was dreaming...she's delirious.</span> <span id="s469">I did...wasn't moving.</span> <span id="s470">I wasn't moving because....then all of a sudden, the noise from the tanks, that scared me actually.</span> <span id="s471">So I moved over to see through these cracks and when we saw it was tanks and that was the English...the English with tanks and with cars and with trucks.</span> <span id="s472">And they opened up these barracks.</span> <span id="s473">And when they opened up these barracks, you know, they were just staring at us there.</span> <span id="s474">We stared at them.</span> <span id="s475">A lot of them...the...the girls that had the strength to get up did and were running over to these soldiers.</span> <span id="s476">Prob...you know, probably a lot of them got scared because we looked so horrible.</span> <span id="s477">And a lot of them were sick, you know, going... So they were looking at us.</span> <span id="s478">We were looking at them.</span> <span id="s479">We didn't know what to make out.</span> <span id="s480">We didn't know it was the liberation army.</span> <span id="s481">We just didn't know.</span> <span id="s482">But they weren't hitting us, so we...we thought at least, you know, they're not hurting us.</span> <span id="s483">And my sister...uh...was laying there.</span> <span id="s484">She.</span> <span id="s485">.</span> <span id="s486">she wasn't happy.</span> <span id="s487">She wasn't sad.</span> <span id="s488">And I was looking at my sister and I saw the end is coming to...you know here.</span> <span id="s489">And then I looked at these people and I felt My God, there're not hitting us.</span> <span id="s490">Maybe they can help us.</span> <span id="s491">But I saw that time is going out.</span> <span id="s492">So what happened was they took...you know, after a day or so, they...they made hospitals, you know, on the premises.</span> <span id="s493">They took barracks and they made like hospitals and they were trying to save the ones that are still breathing.</span> <span id="s494">So they came and they picked...they came with these red, you know, there were little cars with red...red crosses and they picked my sister up and there here I wanted to go with her but they wouldn't let me go with her because she was very sick.</span> <span id="s495">And...uh...they took her away.</span> <span id="s496">So, there I was by myself and I couldn't move too much, but the English were starting to give us already at least food.</span> <span id="s497">And I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s498">I couldn't eat much so I..</span> <span id="s499">.</span> <span id="s500">I maybe would eat a slice of bread, but I couldn't eat.</span> <span id="s501">But the people that could...you know, that they wanted to eat.</span> <span id="s502">They wanted to save themselves.</span> <span id="s503">They starting eating and then they got sick.</span> <span id="s504">They got sick and they got diahhrea and oh, what was going on there.</span> <span id="s505">So finally when I..</span> <span id="s506">.</span> <span id="s507">when I saw my sister isn't coming, I felt that I need to go and look for her.</span> <span id="s508">I..</span> <span id="s509">.</span> <span id="s510">I wanted to take a walk.</span> <span id="s511">And there were, you know, there were mountains of corpse just laying there.</span> <span id="s512">But what...what's happening when we got liberated, there were...uh...organizations like the Hias, they asked us our names and so I figured...and we gave them our names.</span> <span id="s513">So I figured I am going to find my sister's name somewheres because when they had these mass graves after the liberation, they had there a plaque with names, the ones they knew that they died after the liberation.</span> <span id="s514">So I..</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">so I went over to one big, you know, it was like a mountain with corpses and I started reading hopefully that I will find my sister's name.</span> <span id="s517">At least I will know where she is, you know, and...uh...I didn't find it.</span> <span id="s518">And that's what I remember.</span> <span id="s519">I just remember all these corpse.</span> <span id="s520">This mountain of corpse.</span> <span id="s521">And I evidently blacked out because that's all I remembered from there.</span> <span id="s522">What... Shall I continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: What they did after they got themselves a little organized is that they...they went around with these cars and they picked up everybody that was breathing, hopefully that they will save and they probably picked me up but I don't remember where it was and how it was.</span> <span id="s525">I don't remember.</span> <span id="s526">But I was in this makeshift hospital for weeks with a high fever.</span> <span id="s527">I also got typhus and...uh...after a few weeks, you know, they did.</span> <span id="s528">I sort of...uh...was surviving.</span> <span id="s529">I was surviving.</span> <span id="s530">And the first thing when my fever broke a little bit, my...my first question was, "Where is my sister?"</span> <span id="s531">So they started asking me...uh....</span> <span id="s532">what happened to her?</span> <span id="s533">So I told them that, you know, what happened.</span> <span id="s534">They came and they just, you know, she was very sick and they took her away.</span> <span id="s535">And after awhile, after, you know...uh...I remember it was a week or so, maybe more, somebody...and I was getting a little better, they came and told me that my sister did survive from all...from....</span> <span id="s536">So anyway, then they right away reunited us.</span> <span id="s537">So we were together.</span> <span id="s538">So we were in that place still for a long time because we were very, very sick and...and that was in Bergen-Belsen in this makeshift hospital.</span> <span id="s539">And then all of a sudden they came to tell us that...uh...if we wanta go back to Czechoslovakia, we could go back to Czechoslavakia.</span> <span id="s540">But we were very weak and we were very...uh...we just...we didn't know what we want.</span> <span id="s541">We didn't know what we want.</span> <span id="s542">And we knew we couldn't go there on our own because we were very weak, so we didn't go.</span> <span id="s543">So we remained in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s544">And then the Swedish Red Cross offered to take in some survivors, the sick ones, the real sick ones and...uh...they...they took us to Sweden.</span> <span id="s545">When they took us to Sweden...uh...we still looked like...like corpse.</span> <span id="s546">We still didn't have hair and I was full of sores.</span> <span id="s547">Uh...And people were coming over to...uh...to us...to...to...to comb...to...to touch us and we...we again would look at them like: "My God, aren't they afraid of us?</span> <span id="s548">Look how we look."</span> <span id="s549">They were very kind.</span> <span id="s550">They were... they were just very nice people.</span> <span id="s551">And we were in a hospital there.</span> <span id="s552">We were in a hospital.</span> <span id="s553">I remember they gave us root beer to drink and I didn't want to drink it and they said, "No.</span> <span id="s554">Drink it.</span> <span id="s555">Drink it.</span> <span id="s556">That'll make you feel better."</span> <span id="s557">And, you know, a person that wants to survive, I was drinking the beer.</span> <span id="s558">So it's in Sweden where I really came to myself at ...at... You know I felt again like I..</span> <span id="s559">.</span> <span id="s560">uh...I am sort of human.</span> <span id="s561">And I think...uh...and, of course, at that time I was already, you know, a little bit older and I started looking at this world and trying to figure it out, what had...what has happened.</span> <span id="s562">So picking up the pieces here and there, I recognized that we were there alone.</span> <span id="s563">We knew...at that time we already figured out what has happened to my family.</span> <span id="s564">But up until then, to tell you the truth, we didn't allow ourselves to think that they would take all these kids that came with me to the gas chamber...my mother, my grandfather, my grandmother and the family that came with me, that these were the ones who went to a gas chamber to be gassed for no sin committed.</span> <span id="s565">So that was difficult for me in Sweden to deal with.</span> <span id="s566">(Sigh) They put me into a place where they start, you know, we were... It was like a school.</span> <span id="s567">We worked a half a day and a half a day we...we studied.</span> <span id="s568">And life was very good, but it was very sad.</span> <span id="s569">So we had some people talking to us and we had so many questions.</span> <span id="s570">They...uh...they were doctors who were talking to us.</span> <span id="s571">They were very careful on how they are letting us in on it, but still the bottom line was that we lost.</span> <span id="s572">We lost everybody.</span> <span id="s573">So my sister and I was left and then, again, they were trying...what they were trying to do after the war is get families together and I remember...I remember a..</span> <span id="s574">.</span> <span id="s575">when I was little that I had a sister that went to America.</span> <span id="s576">So they asked me do I know about a family.</span> <span id="s577">I says, "Yes, I had a sister, that she went to America and she lives in Brooklyn."</span> <span id="s578">And I gave them their names.</span> <span id="s579">And...uh...they put our names in a paper in here...in the United States so...probably in the Brooklyn paper or whatever, and a friend called up my sister that she...because my sister would talk about her family.</span> <span id="s580">She wonders whether she'll see them or anybody will be left or what's happening to us.</span> <span id="s581">And...uh...that friend calls her up and says, "You know, I saw two names--Liebowtiz names--in the papers.</span> <span id="s582">Maybe you should call up the Red Cross and they might be able to give you some information where they come from."</span> <span id="s583">And my sister did that and they were in touch with us.</span> <span id="s584">And...uh...after a short while they got us reunited.</span> <span id="s585">They brought us here to the United States.</span> <span id="s586">And this is how we...I got here.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Where did you come to?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: We came to Brooklyn and with my sister, and we lived with my sister for awhile and then, of course, I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Was your sister married?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: My sister was here was married.</span> <span id="s591">Yes.</span> <span id="s592">Uh...what I have is a lot, you know, being that I speak...I couldn't talk about it for a long time.</span> <span id="s593">I did not talk about it for a long time.</span> <span id="s594">And...and I..</span> <span id="s595">.</span> <span id="s596">I think...I..</span> <span id="s597">.</span> <span id="s598">I made a decision when I had my first child that I will not talk about it.</span> <span id="s599">The reason why I didn't want to talk about it is because I was afraid I will talk about it so much.</span> <span id="s600">What I..</span> <span id="s601">.</span> <span id="s602">I..</span> <span id="s603">.</span> <span id="s604">I am telling you is just highlights of certain days, not day by day.</span> <span id="s605">And...and to me it was if.</span> <span id="s606">.</span> <span id="s607">if my kids will hear what I have gone through that Hitler will get to them too and I wanted sort of like save them from, from that and, therefore, I didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s608">I didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s609">They...uh...they guessed.</span> <span id="s610">They... they knew that something isn't right because during the day I could control my emotion and I was busy.</span> <span id="s611">I was very busy.</span> <span id="s612">I worked.</span> <span id="s613">I was trying to raise a family and so I could control what's there behind my head, the past.</span> <span id="s614">But sometimes I would just go in and cried for weeks.</span> <span id="s615">That there was nothing to...I could do stop and they always felt well did they do something.</span> <span id="s616">DId they annoy me?</span> <span id="s617">And I kept on reassuring that they didn't do.</span> <span id="s618">It's just that I just don't feel good when they were little.</span> <span id="s619">So they knew that it...it wasn't...that I wasn't sort of completely a normal....</span> <span id="s620">It wasn't a normal situation because they couldn't figure out why I would be like that.</span> <span id="s621">And then sometimes which you cannot control is the nightmares, you see.</span> <span id="s622">The nightmares you can't control.</span> <span id="s623">So...uh...in the beginning we lived in a small apartment and...uh...you know the kids could hear me scream and my husband would wake me up.</span> <span id="s624">But at...but by the time my husband got me up...really got me up so I don't really that I should be up.</span> <span id="s625">It took a little while.</span> <span id="s626">In the meantime the kids heard my screams.</span> <span id="s627">And so.</span> <span id="s628">But they knew that they cannot talk to me about it.</span> <span id="s629">So this is how they knew what was happening, but I didn't talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: When you came to Brooklyn, did you talk about it with your sister who lived here?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: To my sister, it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s632">What happened was when we came here and we saw children on the street and they were free.</span> <span id="s633">They were running around and they played in the playgrounds.</span> <span id="s634">And we say the people and they...you know, I keep on asking are they Jewish.</span> <span id="s635">Are they Jewish?</span> <span id="s636">Because I thought all the Jews...that happened to all the Jews.</span> <span id="s637">And they says, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s638">So, you know, we had to deal with that.</span> <span id="s639">You know that there are Jewish kids that survived.</span> <span id="s640">And...uh ...it...you know, it also...I..</span> <span id="s641">.</span> <span id="s642">you know, I had to have help because of the nightmares.</span> <span id="s643">The nightmares were terrible.</span> <span id="s644">The nightmares were very exhausting.</span> <span id="s645">And you can't control them.</span> <span id="s646">You cannot control a nightmare.</span> <span id="s647">And, again, I stayed with my sister and she had two children.</span> <span id="s648">So it was like a..</span> <span id="s649">.</span> <span id="s650">like a continuation.</span> <span id="s651">It was like a continuation of it.</span> <span id="s652">(long, long pause) So that's...that's the way I lived until, you know, I got married.</span> <span id="s653">I met my husband and started having my own family.</span> <span id="s654">And...uh... I said I have to be strong and...uh...you know, I..</span> <span id="s655">.</span> <span id="s656">I made a comm... I feel I brought my children into this life that I owe them something that I need to bring them up.</span> <span id="s657">And to tell you the truth, I was so many times past my...you know what what was passing my mind is I'll bring up my children that will be different than the people with dealt with me because the people that dealt with me reacted like not people.</span> <span id="s658">Not human!</span> <span id="s659">And I worry...I mean...I..</span> <span id="s660">.</span> <span id="s661">I really thought about it all the time how my kids will be brought up.</span> <span id="s662">Will they be different people?</span> <span id="s663">Will they be different?</span> <span id="s664">And I so much wanted them to be different than what I saw.</span> <span id="s665">So I think I concentrated on that a lot.</span> <span id="s666">I really did.</span> <span id="s667">I, because it was with me constantly.</span> <span id="s668">And I..</span> <span id="s669">.</span> <span id="s670">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s671">I..</span> <span id="s672">.</span> <span id="s673">I..</span> <span id="s674">.</span> <span id="s675">I do have...uh...I brought up three children.</span> <span id="s676">I don't know if I should talk about them or I shouldn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: You want to stop for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s680">I think I would like to say now something of why I talk now.</span> <span id="s681">How much time do I have?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: We have a little bit....We have a little bit longer.</span> <span id="s683">You have talked for a little over an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Already over an hour.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s686">You've done beautifully.</span> <span id="s687">You've really done beautifully.</span> <span id="s688">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: Is there something you want to ask me that I may be...uh... I was just telling you highlights.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s692">Is there anything I missed?</span> <span id="s693">Is there anything you'd like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Well, what I would like to...uh...say is the reason why I..</span> <span id="s695">.</span> <span id="s696">uh...decided talking about it because I really think it's important.</span> <span id="s697">I know I cannot bring back my family, my little brother, the million and a half children that were destroyed, that were gassed, but perhaps maybe I could reach some people that make them understand that this did happen and it can happen again if we are not going to be if we are not going to be aware of our surroundings.</span> <span id="s698">I..</span> <span id="s699">.</span> <span id="s700">I think that every person...every person on earth should examine this, what has happened in the Holocaust because a thing like that can happen again and we need to watch that it shouldn't never happen again to no minority, to no minority.</span> <span id="s701">And therefore I feel I need to get this across to the world, maybe to...even to our future generation and tell them that this cruelty has been done to people from other people and to watch out.</span> <span id="s702">I..</span> <span id="s703">.</span> <span id="s704">uh...I have nine grandchildren and there're all great, but one of them is a little bit gifted and when I look at him and I say to myself, "I have so much hope in him that he might do something good with being that he's got so much ability, something good for society."</span> <span id="s705">And then when I look at him and then I think of my brother, little brother and all these other kids, I say to myself, "My God.</span> <span id="s706">Who knows what these kids would have been...what they would have accomplished if they would...if they would be given a chance just to live...just to live."</span> <span id="s707">So therefore I think every child on earth should be given this chance just to live and prove itself and not so brutally being destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: Thank you very very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: I also would like to add to this.</span> <span id="s710">I speak in the Children's Center and I come up with many children and they have many questions and I like children.</span> <span id="s711">Children are curious.</span> <span id="s712">And they also come in with mothers or with some chaperons and I talk to them.</span> <span id="s713">So after I get finished talking to the children, the parents or the chaperons come over to me and they ask me questions.</span> <span id="s714">And the reason why I want to tell this little story is because I feel I reached a person.</span> <span id="s715">A lady came over to me and she says to me, "You know my father was a SS person and he said it wasn't that bad.</span> <span id="s716">So I looked at the lady and I felt that I need to get something across to her and she should make her own mind on how bad and how good it was so I stopped for a second and looked at her beautiful children.</span> <span id="s717">And I said to her, "You know the SS people were volunteers.</span> <span id="s718">They were volunteers.</span> <span id="s719">The SS were the people in Auschwitz that lived on the premises with their families.</span> <span id="s720">They had better housing and nobody threatened their lives.</span> <span id="s721">But they were...their job was to take innocent kids and older people ...sick people, all kinds of people, escorting them to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s722">And then after the job was done, they went home to play with their children.</span> <span id="s723">So what can I tell you.</span> <span id="s724">You'll have to figure it out how bad it was."</span> <span id="s725">And I could see...I really have a lot of respect for that lady that she was trying to find the truth I feel.</span> <span id="s726">She was searching.</span> <span id="s727">She was trying to hear everybody.</span> <span id="s728">And I am hoping that she found the truth and that she...uh...will be able to make decisions accordingly and for the people around her you know that she...and with her children.</span> <span id="s729">I..</span> <span id="s730">.</span> <span id="s731">I feel that it can be done when you raise children to bring them up and show them right from wrong because my kids they would tell me always, "Well, Mom when I grow up, you'll be so proud of me."</span> <span id="s732">I says, "Honey, I am already proud of you, you know.</span> <span id="s733">You...you're the best and the finest."</span> <span id="s734">And...uh...we never told them what they should do in their lives.</span> <span id="s735">We never did because we felt they are individuals and they need to do what they need to do.</span> <span id="s736">So the oldest...the oldest one is doing research and even today, when she...you know, she does something good...something comes across, she loves to share it with me.</span> <span id="s737">She says, "You know, Ma, I told you I will try, you know.</span> <span id="s738">We'll do something to better humanity."</span> <span id="s739">And...uh...my younger daughter, she...uh...teaches children that have...uh...have a problem and she too tries so hard...I think she too tries so hard to...uh...to make me feel that she is doing something good or right or whatever you would call it.</span> <span id="s740">And...uh...my son.</span> <span id="s741">.</span> <span id="s742">our son...he...uh...he is a gastroenterologist; and so I feel like God took away a lot from me, but God gave me a lot back.</span> <span id="s743">And in...and what I wanted to achieve in life after the Holocaust I hope and I think I maybe achieved it by looking at my kids, what they do.</span> <span id="s744">And...and you know, having my grandchildren and they...they too are nice and hopefully, they'll...they'll do something good for humanity and not for destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: That's wonderful.</span> <span id="s746">Thank you very, very much for doing this today.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: That was beautiful.</span> <span id="s749">It's really
