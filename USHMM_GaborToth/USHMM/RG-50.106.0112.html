I want to thank you for doing the interview with us today.</span> <span id="s18">Can you tell me what is your name, and what was your name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Answer: Presently my name is Jacob Gerd, g-e-r-d Wiener, w-i-e-n-e-r.</span> <span id="s20">And formerly my name was Kopel(ph) Gerd Zwienizki, z-w-i-e-n-i-z-k-i.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: When did you change your name and why?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Changed my name as part of the naturalization in 1951, I believe, and the reason was that time I was married, my wife didn’t like this name, the all different kinds of pronunciations, and my brother already had changed his name to Wiener, w-i-e-n-e-r, and I told the judge at that time that the reason I’m changing my name to Wiener is because Zwienizki is very hard to pronounce, very hard to write.</span> <span id="s23">And just like a herring, where you cut off the top and the bottom, the tail and the [indecipherable] so I cut off the z and the icki and it remains wien.</span> <span id="s24">But I wanted a two syllable name so I made it Wiener.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: We’re going to ask about your immediate post-war experience.</span> <span id="s26">I would like you to tell me how you learned that the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: I learned it from newspapers and I also learned it from talking to people who had been in the Holocaust, who knew about the Holocaust [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: What exactly did you learn from talking to those people who were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: During the war, I was on – i-in the beginning of the war I was still in contact with relatives of mine in Germany, I wrote them letters and the letters came back.</span> <span id="s30">And from the contents of the letters I knew that it was going worse – from worse to worse – from bad to worse, because they wrote this person is not here any more, he went on vacation.</span> <span id="s31">What they meant by this of course was went to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s32">After awhile I don’t hear from the people at all, letters came back censored, or no letters came back.</span> <span id="s33">This went on every year.</span> <span id="s34">Every year I wrote a little article for myself about hoping that the war would end.</span> <span id="s35">We went out to the different organizations and – to find out if the war could be ended, but there wasn’t much response in that respect, and so it went on til the end of the war.</span> <span id="s36">In 1945 the war ended, and many demonstrations were held and people talked about this and they [indecipherable] and they heard about this from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: You were in the United States.</span> <span id="s38">How did the American media present the news of the war and what had happened to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: It’s unfortunate that the media here in the United States didn’t write too much about it, a-and if they did, like the “New York Times” they wrote it on a – not on a main page, but wrote it on pages afterwards.</span> <span id="s40">It’s – the only time when they wrote the things on the first page was during Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s41">And afterwards they didn’t write it on front of the pages.</span> <span id="s42">I read the paper, of course, and while I read the paper, I also learned English more, and – and I can only say this, you see, that when the war started I was registered in class 4-D, which was clergy going to school, because I went to the Yeshiva and they were exempt from actually joining the war, even though I tried to join the war and – but the only thing was at that time, either buy war bonds, or I even tried to join the war by being an air raid warden, but after awhile they told me, you cannot be an air raid warden, I was considered an enemy alien, despite the fact that I was Jewish in the United States, and I always had to get permission even to travel, let’s say from Baltimore to Yonkers, where I had a little shop, in Yonkers.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: What was reaction of the Jewish community around you to the news that was coming out of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: The Jewish community.</span> <span id="s45">A-After the war?</span> <span id="s46">After the war, about 1945, 1940 si – 1946, I left the Yeshiva in Baltimore, the [indecipherable] Yeshiva Rabbinical college, I left them.</span> <span id="s47">I got semicha there and I talked about this, they tried to help Jews in Europe, they send out packages to them, they send out packages and then I tried to find people from my birthplace to whom I could talk and who maybe knew more about what happened at my particular place where I was born.</span> <span id="s48">And I found people, I found people in New York.</span> <span id="s49">There was some people in New York by the name of Greenburg(ph).</span> <span id="s50">I talked to them what had happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s51">I also talked about other people, I went to organizations, like – had a big demonstration in Madison Square Garden.</span> <span id="s52">They had the em – demonstrations all over, and bringing people e – over, and many people came over afterwards, but they had not actually been in the Nazi concentration camps per se, they had, during the war they had gone from Germany, Russia, Poland and so forth to Shanghai or into other places.</span> <span id="s53">And they came over.</span> <span id="s54">And then [indecipherable] and other people came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: I have a couple questions about what you just said.</span> <span id="s56">You said you left the Yeshiva, you got semicha there.</span> <span id="s57">Can you explain what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Semicha means like ordination to be a rabbi.</span> <span id="s59">At that time, the rabbi at the Yeshiva was Rabbi Ruderman, who had come from Lithuania just before the war.</span> <span id="s60">In fact, his wife was born in Königsberg, was east Prussia, part of Germany.</span> <span id="s61">And it – and it was not – there were not too many people – during the war, of course, the number of students at the yeshiva increased and after the war it went down.</span> <span id="s62">At the end of the war, especially, I tried to become a United States citizen.</span> <span id="s63">Already during the war I tried to become a United States citizen.</span> <span id="s64">In 1943 was the first time I made an appeal to become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s65">Now at that time, the immigration policy was that you had to have first papers, and after first papers you have to wait five years and you can make an application to become a citizen.</span> <span id="s66">So, when I made my first application 1943, I was asked to come before a board in Baltimore, five different organizations, the navy, the – the war , the defense and so forth.</span> <span id="s67">And it was – it was rejected because at that time the war was – looked very bad because the Nazis had been stopped at Stalingrad and it was very bad, so they didn’t want anyone to become a citizen unless they actually went to war.</span> <span id="s68">And later on I made the application, think around 1950, though it might be earlier, with the FBI to go for translations.</span> <span id="s69">So they said, if you want to make translation, we have to send you to Germany, I didn't want to go to Germany, so I stayed here.</span> <span id="s70">But they helped me also in – to get my second papers, and I got them in, as I said before, in 1951.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: And that’s when you became a citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: Then I became a United States citizen, and as I mentioned before, I changed my name at that time.</span> <span id="s73">And I was already married then, because we married in 19 – got married in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Is your wife also a survivor of the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yes, my wife was born in Nuremberg and she moved to Firth(ph).</span> <span id="s76">And they were living there and the – her father was a merchant, he had – they had a business, and – and of course like all people at that time, tried to leave Germany after the Kristallnacht, which I consider the beginning of the end.</span> <span id="s77">Everyone knew that it would not change any more and they had to leave.</span> <span id="s78">Before that time, we also had tried to come out of Germany, but I don’t want to talk before that time, but only say that they finally, in 1939, that’s before the war, she came out with the Kindertransport, children’s transport to England.</span> <span id="s79">And their parents also came out, because they had some relatives in England.</span> <span id="s80">I had also tried to come out with the transport, but just on the date when I received the permission to come to England, they stopped it.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: I wanted to go back to something you said a few moments ago, about being at magison – Madison Square Garden –</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: – with [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s84">Can you tell me about that event?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: It was a big crowd in Madison Square Garden.</span> <span id="s86">They made many [indecipherable] meetings.</span> <span id="s87">But, as I understand it now, you see, and as I read in the newspaper and so forth, there were always requests of people to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s88">They – at – at that time, in order to come to the United States, [indecipherable] you needed a – what’s called a certificate – zertifickat.</span> <span id="s89">And there were only a certain number of zertifikats available per year for people from Germany, because a number of zertifikats had been set in nine [indecipherable] that time, and at that time the – the – the – the – I mean, the type of population in America was different than it was in 1940 and 1950.</span> <span id="s90">So, many people got certificates but they were only dated for two or three years later.</span> <span id="s91">And who wanted to wait two or three years?</span> <span id="s92">We didn’t want to wait two or three years.</span> <span id="s93">We didn’t have an American certificate, even though I know from my records, and my mother, that she had – my father had applied to go to the United States already in the 20’s, but my mother didn’t want to go because she had all her family in – in Germany.</span> <span id="s94">So that’s why we stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q: I’d like you as an eyewitness, to tell me what was going on in that protest at madis – Madison Square Garden.</span> <span id="s96">If you could describe the scene and what was said, and – and the feelings that the people had.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: I don’t know any more exactly what went on there.</span> <span id="s98">I can only tell you it was a very big meeting.</span> <span id="s99">You see, the Madison Square Garden has a very big place and it was filled up to capacity.</span> <span id="s100">And there were many people who spoke about it, what happened in – in – in – in Germany, and what could be done and they wanted to – they wanted to influence the American government to do something about it.</span> <span id="s101">In that respect, I mean a little bit to the side, when I was in the yeshiva, there was a young man, he was young at that time, who came every week, every Thursday to the yeshiva and from there he went on to Washington to discuss with cabinet ministers to let Jews out.</span> <span id="s102">And his name was Michael Trist(ph), and the person he talked to that was discussing, Moshe Sherer, which recently passed away, became the president of the Agudath(ph) [indecipherable] organization.</span> <span id="s103">But every week they came out.</span> <span id="s104">And some of the yeshivas and some of other organizations made it, but it was a very tough time because the United States was interested – and it is not against the United States, the United States was interested to win the war.</span> <span id="s105">If we win the war, then everything will change.</span> <span id="s106">So we cannot bomb the trains to the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s107">And they heard the person, Jacob Rosenheim, I have his book here, and I heard him speak many times, who le – sent letters, and I have the copies of the letters which he sent to Roosevelt and other people to do this.</span> <span id="s108">Only one person was successful to a certain extent, a limited extent and it was Ruth Gruber, I don’t know if you heard of her, who arranged with Secretary Ickes and Morgenstern(ph) and so forth, they arranged that thousand – that they permit a thousand Jews to go to Oswego, one of my family, and we also went to Oswego.</span> <span id="s109">In – that’s in the – Oswego is near Lake Erie, I think, it’s in the state of New York.</span> <span id="s110">So they did very many things, so the people came over and they were protesting and they were writing and they were talking to in-influential people.</span> <span id="s111">But it was not the mood at that time.</span> <span id="s112">It was just – in fact, they never felt that anything bad happened to the Jews, and it could be changed, until Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s113">I think by Kristallnacht it changed, because that was the first time that Roosevelt called his ambassador from Berlin away and talked to him about what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: When the war was over, and you said you had read articles, not on the front page, about what had happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s115">I would like to get a sense from you of what the Jewish community in the – in the United States, religious or secular, whatever you can share with me, what was the reaction of the Jewish community and – and was there much said by the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Many think that, and it was not always positive, unfortunately, because when I came and the whole family came in, already before the war, in 1939 to the United States, to Montreal we came, before we went to Montreal [indecipherable] United States, there were in – in the community there were mone – mostly older people and they could not believe it that it was as bad as it really was, even if we told it to them, you see, they could not believe it.</span> <span id="s117">And we were considered even when we came to the United States, refugees, an-and it – an-and considered refugees.</span> <span id="s118">We were called greenhorns.</span> <span id="s119">It’s completely different now, when the Russian Jews came over, and they were accepted as [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s120">We were – we be – came there with only four dollars from – from Germany, which we could take out, four dollars.</span> <span id="s121">This was 10 marks at that time, 10 marks was four dollars.</span> <span id="s122">And even when I was in yeshiva I had to canvas that – that we put clothing, other things like this, doctors, or medical servicing and so forth.</span> <span id="s123">We were not considered actually as it was, as bad as it really was.</span> <span id="s124">They did not think it was as bad as it really was.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: How long did it take for – for you or the people around you to grasp the full extent of the genocide, just how many people were killed?</span> <span id="s126">How long did it take for that information to come across?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: You must know that everything which was done by the Nazis was done secretly.</span> <span id="s128">And that’s why people still denied if afterwards.</span> <span id="s129">And that’s also why many people didn’t know about it until very much – because, as I mentioned before, in the beginning we did – we did receive some correspondence, but afterwards we didn’t receive correspondence.</span> <span id="s130">Everything went – I don’t know how it came over here [indecipherable] channels, small radios, because they had no television here.</span> <span id="s131">It came out slowly after the war, it came out, even so set – so far that last year when I was in Germany, I heard certain things which I didn't even know happened during the war.</span> <span id="s132">You see, even now, 50 years later, 60 years later you see, there are certain things which had never been publicized and which only come out now.</span> <span id="s133">It’s unfortunate, you see, when so much in secrecy that people couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s134">It was unbelievable, it’s beyond belief what happened there, that a – such a thing in a – a highly civilized, scientific country should happen like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: How closely did you follow the Nuremberg trials?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: At that time there was already television, I think, 1946 and we tried to see – look at the – look at the television, find out what ha – what was going to happen and we saw other people there.</span> <span id="s137">But in my impression, I mean the impression of most people was [indecipherable] that these people were so brainwashed, or crazy, or whatever you call this, you see, saying that I had nothing to do with it because I followed orders.</span> <span id="s138">Same thing was when they killed my mother also, they said, we followed orders.</span> <span id="s139">But they did not have their own mind, they just said they followed orders.</span> <span id="s140">Of course, the world knew by that time that they could have done something because they had power and they had all the authority to do what they wanted to do and they didn’t do it.</span> <span id="s141">And not only this, the worst thing of it, that they in-intimidated the whole population to do this – to go in the same way.</span> <span id="s142">That no one actually acted freely on his own free will.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did you follow the U.N. vote on the partition of Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes, we followed it very closely.</span> <span id="s145">It was in November and we followed the vote and it took some time to find that the majority vote came out about Palestine.</span> <span id="s146">That was going on for a long time, because it actually started long before the war.</span> <span id="s147">In 1936 with the British, you see, were not too happy and were not too much in favor of – of it at all.</span> <span id="s148">And they even – many people died because they tried to go there by force to Israel, to Palestine at that time.</span> <span id="s149">They couldn’t land, they got sent to the concentration camps in Crete and other places.</span> <span id="s150">But before the – this, we saw them, that finally came through.</span> <span id="s151">We were very much ap – surprised, especially that Russia voted for it.</span> <span id="s152">But of course no Arabs, they voted for it and they never acknowledged it.</span> <span id="s153">And to this date, no one blames them for anything, but they really do because they never voted for it.</span> <span id="s154">For them it doesn’t exist.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Let’s take a break and see if we can get – stop that background noise.</span> <span id="s156">All right, we’re back now and I had been asking you about the partition of Palestine and I wanted to get a sense of you – from you, of what was going on here in the Jewish community with respect to the partition and the birth of the state of Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: The entire Jewish community here, as far as I know and I saw, was very much interested in what was going to happen, because many Jews had already gone to Palestine at that time, and they did not feel safe in Palestine, and they did not know what would happen, the 21 Arab states would be poised to – to break Palestine and not to have peace with them, you see, even though the Jewish community in Palestine, and I know that, offered any person, whatever nationality, whatever sex, whatever religion, to stay there and they would live in peace.</span> <span id="s158">But there was so much hatred and unfortunately we still have hatred in the world, that they said no, don’t stay there, go out, because they will kill you.</span> <span id="s159">They did not have in mind to kill you, just now [indecipherable] in mind to kill anyone.</span> <span id="s160">Not as, number one, not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s161">And they went out and they made the concen – they made these refugee camps, in which they are existing today, and the U.N. supported it.</span> <span id="s162">I went to the U.N. when the U.N. was, at that time meeting.</span> <span id="s163">They were meeting already before 1945, the U.N. went in, and what would happen there, they saw people standing – people standing outside and there was – this is – was – o-other people in there, beca – all the people wanted peace.</span> <span id="s164">All the – they want to live in peace with other people too, but they just couldn’t.</span> <span id="s165">As I mentioned many times, in Germany I mentioned it too, the most pious person cannot live in peace if the wicked neighbor doesn’t want it.</span> <span id="s166">That’s one German citation, that the Germans made themselves.</span> <span id="s167">Schiller(ph) made it.</span> <span id="s168">His poem.</span> <span id="s169">So we were very much afraid that we would not have peace, but we all very much wanted peace.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Did you every consider making aliyah and going to Israel, sp – [indecipherable] at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: I know many of my family went to Palestine, but I can tell you that already ye-years before that, in 1933, when Hitler came to power, already in that ti – at that time they had what they called Hasharah.</span> <span id="s172">It means preparation for.</span> <span id="s173">And I participated in one of such groups.</span> <span id="s174">However, like all the Jews, my mother especially thought that things were changed and the neighbors, our neighbors, our non-Jewish neighbor [indecipherable] things were changed.</span> <span id="s175">And who knows what it is starting in a new life and so forth.</span> <span id="s176">I wanted to go there, we learned already Hebrew at that time.</span> <span id="s177">But at that moment when – when this happened, the partition happened in 1948, at that time I was in the United States and my – my father was in Canada and he did not have too much – he did not make too much of an effort at that time to go to Palestine, even though we had family in Palestine at that time, and I received [indecipherable] from Palestine, but at that time it was not settled yet [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: After the birth of the state, there was the – the war, and there have been subsequent wars.</span> <span id="s179">I-I wanted add – to ask you to share in the insights or any thoughts you had during these conflicts, particularly with your life experience, knowing what war can be, and knowing fear as a Jew, I was wondering if you had any insights that you could share about Israel’s wars.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: First I want to say that the Jewish people were always against war.</span> <span id="s181">We want to try to settle everything by peace as much as possible, even if it’s [indecipherable] unfortunately.</span> <span id="s182">But I remember one instance, I think it was the – the war – the Six Day War in 1967, I think.</span> <span id="s183">And at that time I was – I had a job in New York and I went to a convention in Montreal.</span> <span id="s184">We had – and my father’s family was living in Montreal, and at that convention we had a meeting and at that meeting there was a great British journalist, I think Lady jo – James, I don’t remember her name.</span> <span id="s185">Anyhow, there was a vote.</span> <span id="s186">Who votes for Israel and – that they should win or that they should be – should be peace and who votes against it.</span> <span id="s187">Every person voted with Israel that isra – that Israel should have peace.</span> <span id="s188">Only one person voted no.</span> <span id="s189">And they asked this one person why no, they said, there should never be a complete, 100 percent vote.</span> <span id="s190">There should always be one – besides, then they asked the question, what can we do in order to make peace here?</span> <span id="s191">Well, there were all different answers and one person, this Lady James gave a very interesting answer, she said, we should build a wall, like they have the China wall – Chinese wall between China and the other things.</span> <span id="s192">They had another wall [indecipherable] Berlin wall.</span> <span id="s193">So we make a – at that time they were all interested in making peace by building walls.</span> <span id="s194">So they had the intention, this lady says, you make a wall between the Israelis and the Arabs.</span> <span id="s195">Of course it never happened, but that was the psychology and the – the ideas of the people at that time, you see that they might think – that they think by making walls, you can make peace.</span> <span id="s196">Just like during the war, you see, when the French made the Maginot line, they thought with a wall they can [indecipherable] the peace and the Nazis just walk around.</span> <span id="s197">And that was an interesting idea she had.</span> <span id="s198">Then of course there were the other wars [indecipherable] but when the – the Six Day War, you know, when they suddenly saw that the Jews were winning and there was a euphoria and they went in the streets with big bed sheets and you collected money, everything was okay, but unfortunately, this a mistake for the Jewish people, they did not see what they could have done at that time, if they had done it at that time, we wouldn’t have trouble now.</span> <span id="s199">For instance, at that time the whole west thing, everything was okay.</span> <span id="s200">At that time they started to call it the West Bank.</span> <span id="s201">Before they didn’t call it even the West Bank.</span> <span id="s202">It was Transjordania, it [indecipherable] Jordania was – was separated between the east, the west and th-the whole thing about West Bank and East Bank and who knows what?</span> <span id="s203">These terms wouldn’t came up there – the other words which were going on between Israel, there was always a trouble – they were always afraid the Jews would win.</span> <span id="s204">And they did win in some [indecipherable] at that time when the [indecipherable] and they captured all of the Sinai peninsula and they even had Arafat surrounded.</span> <span id="s205">They did not do anything with him, they let them all go [indecipherable] I don’t know if the others would have done this if they had cir-circled – encircled the Jewish people and so forth, they would not let one person le – go out alive.</span> <span id="s206">But that’s what the Jewish mentality is.</span> <span id="s207">[indecipherable] they don’t understand this here.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: The comment that you just made with respect to the Sinai and the encirclement of the – that’s the ’56 war?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: It was the Suez canal.</span> <span id="s210">And I want to say only one thing, it could have been peace, and this was – and I remember this, you know, Golda Meier, who was the prime minister at that time, she made peace with Sadat.</span> <span id="s211">Cause even Sadat had fought the Jews, but they made peace on the basis, and that’s why she [indecipherable] she said we both have grandchildren and we don’t want our grandchildren to live through war.</span> <span id="s212">You see, so – so therefore there is some point where you can bring people together.</span> <span id="s213">But you can only bring them together – they mentioned Germany too, if you learn from the past.</span> <span id="s214">We have [indecipherable] grandchildren who – in the future, so have to learn from that.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: How closely did you follow the Eichmann trial?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: At that time again, we followed it by radio and by television and we were very much surprised that they found him, because he did not identify himself.</span> <span id="s217">Only afterwards they found out about it.</span> <span id="s218">And then it was ORT and television and a-all, and we heard all the reports which were done.</span> <span id="s219">It’s unfortunate again that one person [indecipherable] he should not have been executed, but – well, I don’t know, you see, because he executed thousands and hundred thousands of people, he is one person.</span> <span id="s220">He was guilty, that’s all [indecipherable] but again, to the last minute, he denied that he was responsible.</span> <span id="s221">He denied his responsibility.</span> <span id="s222">People don’t want to be responsible.</span> <span id="s223">I did by – by orders.</span> <span id="s224">But that was his order, because he was one of the three or four people at the Wannsee conference who made the decision of the final solution.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Did you feel justice was done?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: I think there was done justice, you see.</span> <span id="s227">Even though we say – even though the Jewish religion they say God is the final judge, you know, God is the final judge, but – and justice will come eventually and it did come eventually because the war ended and Hitler did not achieve what he wanted to achieve, so he was the final judge, but at that moment it was in the hands of the human court, with the majority of mankind at that time, because everyone was involved.</span> <span id="s228">So therefore, I think there was justice done, to that extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: We’re going to pause, and I’m going to flip the tape.</span> <span id="s230">One moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener.</span> <span id="s233">This is tape number one, side B. And I wanted to now continue in the 60’s, you had just told me about the Eichmann trial.</span> <span id="s234">The 1960’s were very turbulent in the United States and I would like some insight from you on how you reacted to some of what was going on around you.</span> <span id="s235">Specifically, let’s start with the Civil Rights movement.</span> <span id="s236">Do you have any thoughts on that?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: I never felt any animosity, so to say, to anyone who was not Jewish or any other kind of color, because even in school in Germany, I had a black person, at that time they were called Negroes, in my class, and he came from a former German colony in east Africa.</span> <span id="s238">So I – I always tried to reconcile people and to try to – to understand other people’s views.</span> <span id="s239">Now when this happened with the Civil Rights movement, of course when I was working in the department of Social Services in New York, we had also many people who were different colors, Orientals and other people of different colors and I was always very good with them, and never had any problems.</span> <span id="s240">So, besides this, I remember when they had this march to Selma there was one Jewish person who was killed, Schwerner(ph).</span> <span id="s241">And Schwerner(ph), we knew his father, who had a wig fam – a – a business of making wigs, sheitel, in German.</span> <span id="s242">And so we knew about this, you see.</span> <span id="s243">Again you see, here you see that there were Jewish people who, as some could say, with what happens to other people and not just saying it like you know, many times people say yeah, we have sympathy, but they deserve it.</span> <span id="s244">No, not that way.</span> <span id="s245">A-And try to have and try to see what it was.</span> <span id="s246">So we had the sympathy with them also, and th – because – because a number of Jews, especially Jews, are very sympathetic to all kinds of people.</span> <span id="s247">They have this kind, what you call this [indecipherable] hearts.</span> <span id="s248">Emotion with other people.</span> <span id="s249">It doesn’t necessarily mean we – we – we have to leave our religion or our whatever we believe in, but we also acknowledge what others believe in, we don’t fight them because of they’re – they are different in certain respects.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You mentioned that in Germany you had a classmate who was from Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like to have him in the class and what the reaction of the other students was to this individual?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: In the beginning there was really no difference.</span> <span id="s254">Under the Weimar republic, I mean before Hitler came to power, they made no difference between them and them, even though Weimar republic said every person has a right to live his way.</span> <span id="s255">This person was okay.</span> <span id="s256">I don’t know what happened to him afterwards, but I’m quite sure that when Hitler came to power, he had gone back by that time and I don’t know what happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s257">But I only know that during this time, it was a – because it was an organization in Germany during the Weimar republic which was called verhein(ph), means a-an assembly, a group, for Germans in the foreign countries, especially in the Austria, Czechoslovakia, where the Germans were the bordering countries, here was such kind of an organization and they wanted everyone already in the Weimar republic, they wanted everyone to join this organization and to work for them.</span> <span id="s258">In other words, they already wanted at that time to include them into Germany.</span> <span id="s259">They were not hiding like Hitler did, to conquer them and make them part of Germany, but they were just like supporting them, because they were living at the outskirts of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: This country had gone to war with Korea and then again with Vietnam.</span> <span id="s261">I was wondering if you had any insights that you could share about what was – what it was like for you to watch this country now go to war.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: The unfortunate thing is that after the World War II, which is now of course, in Germany [indecipherable], it means war of distraction, because that was the whole purpose, more so than winning the war.</span> <span id="s263">At – more – many more wars happened.</span> <span id="s264">Like you say, the war in Korea, the war in Vietnam and now even other wars in Bosnia and all over the world [indecipherable] situation in Africa, all these different things which happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s265">But that was the – and age – I mean, the 60’s were some kind of – it was a rebellion, it was rebellion of the youth.</span> <span id="s266">And I saw it myself because there was it – in my department, when the commissioner gave a talk, a group of people came, stopped him from talking and sat in front of him – sat in front of him, you see, so that he couldn't talk any more, and talked against him.</span> <span id="s267">No respect.</span> <span id="s268">I mean, that was – that is actually the beginning of making peace.</span> <span id="s269">The first – the first thing about peace, when you have to re – respect for each other.</span> <span id="s270">And honor what other people say, that’s a real democracy.</span> <span id="s271">This was what Freud calls civil disobedience.</span> <span id="s272">That means they – they wanted to show their own force, their own selfishness, their own pride by saying I know more than you do.</span> <span id="s273">That happens with – I mean, it happened in schools too, that children – and my wife knows about this, that the children many times will see – accuse teacher of something which they want to be the boss [indecipherable] be in charge.</span> <span id="s274">You see, if people don’t work together with each other, you see, that’s what I always try to do, as I mentioned before, with the black people.</span> <span id="s275">With other people, if they don’t accept this and the respect to other people – respect other people and – and listen to other people, at least listen to them, you see, then we cannot have any peace.</span> <span id="s276">So I was always – I didn’t really understand the anti-war movement at that time.</span> <span id="s277">Of course, we shouldn’t have a war which there is no purpose to it.</span> <span id="s278">But the government itself, you see, didn’t have a key purpose of what they really wanted to do, and therefore it’s – it’s no wonder that the people themselves didn’t know what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: I’d like to ask you about – you mentioned children and – your wife and children.</span> <span id="s280">What kinds of things did you tell children about your experiences before you came to this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: I told the children then and I’m telling the children now – and I wrote about this, I’m telling the children to grow up in a country where you don’t know what’s going to happen to you, they make laws against th-the Jews, they make law against other things, the first thing is you have to know what you want to do, you have to know yourself.</span> <span id="s282">You start with knowing yourself and then you will either – you cannot be everything, everybody [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s283">So therefore I say if you want to be a Jew, you have to know what it means to be a Jew.</span> <span id="s284">If you want to be someone else, you have to know what – what it means to be someone else.</span> <span id="s285">But you have to know what you want to be.</span> <span id="s286">Because you cannot talk to other people if you don’t have a point of view of your own.</span> <span id="s287">So it – when I wrote the children and I was many asked to talk about what it means to grow up in Germany, and I was many times asked, what do you think about things which are going on in this world, I say, we cannot have all the answers, and I studied psychology, we cannot meet on the – always have all the answers, but we have to know one thing, that we have to have one point of view and sometimes we don’t know the an – we don’t always know the answer, you see.</span> <span id="s288">But then we have to have a belief, a faith [indecipherable] I have the faith in God, and finally he will make the final decision.</span> <span id="s289">I don’t know, we make – made decisions and it would not happen that way.</span> <span id="s290">We had – we – we always thought, you see, that if we make this kind of treaty, we’ll have peace.</span> <span id="s291">No peace came though.</span> <span id="s292">No, we – we don’t always know the decision, but finally the decision were made [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s293">Just like I know that when Chamberlain before the war, by the mun – Munich conference came back with an umbrella and said, we have thousand years of peace, that what he thought, you see.</span> <span id="s294">But I don’t know if he ever believed it.</span> <span id="s295">If you say something and you don’t believe it [indecipherable] tell the truth, then nothing will come out of it, that’s what I say.</span> <span id="s296">That’s why I told the children, you have to learn something about yourself and you have to go to school, you have to – education is the most important, now we all know it in America too, education is the more important.</span> <span id="s297">It’s – it’s more important than learning about war [indecipherable] education, because if you haven’t educated you don’t know how to – what kind of decision to make and where to go.</span> <span id="s298">And it also finalize – it also sensitizes a person to what it means, how to live with other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: I wanted to ask you about some of your writings.</span> <span id="s300">And specifically if you had some favorite themes that you revisit in your writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Favorite themes?</span> <span id="s302">When I write certain stories and so on, I make people beli – I bring out – I like to, I intend to, I don’t know if I’m always successful, I intend to find out in – in – and – and impress upon them that, as I said before, we have to know what we want.</span> <span id="s303">And – and I know there are two types of people who came out of the concentration camps, two types of people.</span> <span id="s304">Don’t want to be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s305">You see, the one type of people who came out and said, if God lets this happen, where is God?</span> <span id="s306">And another type of people came out and they said, I cannot believe anyone and I only believe in God.</span> <span id="s307">So just two opposites.</span> <span id="s308">And we see this here in the United States nowadays, we see that many what we call bali-chuva(ph), that means people who returned to Jewish [indecipherable] many thing.</span> <span id="s309">And we see on the other hand that people say, I don’t want to believe that.</span> <span id="s310">And I wrote about this.</span> <span id="s311">And – and – and I say, if – if a person doesn’t at least have one goal or one motive by which to go, he gets lost.</span> <span id="s312">And many people committed suicide during the war, afterwards, because they – they didn’t know what was going to happen and they couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s313">From the Jewish point of view, it is an [indecipherable] sin to commit suicide, because we have – we are not the masters of our ow life, and that’s why suicide is forbidden because our life was given by God and therefore we cannot take it away.</span> <span id="s314">He – unless He takes it away, you see.</span> <span id="s315">But – but that’s the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Do you have some favorite works or perhaps a favorite poem that you would like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Yeah, I have here two things which I like to tell you.</span> <span id="s318">When we first came to America in 1939, and I must say that every step in my life was a miracle, and that’s what I want to write about, and every person has miracles in his life, everything was a miracle.</span> <span id="s319">It was a miracle that we came out, that we came out this way.</span> <span id="s320">Even the killing of Ernst vom Raim(ph) on Kristallnacht was also a miracle because up to that time, the number of Jews emigrating had declined, and this – many Jews emigrated after this happened, who otherwise would have died in the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s321">So I don’t know – you see, everything is a miracle.</span> <span id="s322">But when I came out of Germany, I wrote of it.</span> <span id="s323">This is a poem, and I only want to read the last two lines because how happy we were to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s324">It goes like this, “Land of future, our future, everything we bring to you.</span> <span id="s325">Seeking refuge we are coming.</span> <span id="s326">That is all we have in view.</span> <span id="s327">To be treated in your country, duties, rights, like you, the same.</span> <span id="s328">Not despised, distained, detested, that’s our honest aim.</span> <span id="s329">Continent of mankind’s future, world of sun and hope.</span> <span id="s330">Far off war and scenes of [indecipherable] on the western semi-globe(ph).</span> <span id="s331">God bless you.</span> <span id="s332">From a land of terror we were forced to flee.</span> <span id="s333">God bless you America, you, the land of the free.”</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Is there another piece of work that you wanted to – to share today?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: [indecipherable] briefly and this is in answer to the people who said, why did this happen to me?</span> <span id="s336">And what do the victims say?</span> <span id="s337">The victims say, I may be alive and many are not alive any more.</span> <span id="s338">“What was our guilt?</span> <span id="s339">We were born a Jew.</span> <span id="s340">We are weak and helpless and only a few.</span> <span id="s341">We pray to you, God, to [indecipherable] the Shema for you, we accept our death.</span> <span id="s342">The killers rejoice with a stone filled heart to see us defenseless people depart.</span> <span id="s343">You will judge them, we know, for their horrible crime to kill us all.</span> <span id="s344">You will pay them in time.</span> <span id="s345">The Jewish people will not disappear as long as we to you are near.”</span> <span id="s346">Now, that was what the victims said.</span> <span id="s347">Now what do the survivors say?</span> <span id="s348">The survivors say, “How can we forget the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s349">Yes, some survived, although millions were lost.</span> <span id="s350">We survivors will never forget their pain.</span> <span id="s351">We’ll cry out to the world, never again.</span> <span id="s352">To you God, we belong for infinity, because you have never forsaken me.</span> <span id="s353">You knew what would be our destiny.</span> <span id="s354">Only we cannot fathom your heavenly scope, but we’ll never lose love and fear and hope in you, who has the power and might, you who work in justice and right.</span> <span id="s355">You left us alive.</span> <span id="s356">We were saved to narrate our brothers and sisters indescrit – indescribable fate.</span> <span id="s357">For the world must know what the Nazis contrived, and that it was God by whose love we survived.”</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: You seem to have an ability to explain to people about your experience, either in poetry or in some of the other written work that you’ve done, and some of your written work is in the file available at the museum.</span> <span id="s359">Do you have any advice or any guidance for survivors who would like to – to speak to their children or their grandchildren and find it difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah, I sometimes get people who talk to me and who’ve said they cannot talk to their par – to their children because their children are different.</span> <span id="s361">Some children do not want to hear about what happened there.</span> <span id="s362">But I can tell you one thing, which I know from my work as – on psychology and in the department of Social Services, that I have found that it’s very difficult, often, not always, to talk to the children, and it’s easier to talk to grandchildren.</span> <span id="s363">And I found this out in three respects.</span> <span id="s364">Number one I found it out when I was working with child abuse, what was [indecipherable], that the children of – who were abused didn’t like to talk to their child – to their parents because they didn’t want to make them feel ashamed or responsible.</span> <span id="s365">But the grandchildren want to know, they’re a little bit further removed.</span> <span id="s366">Number two, I found out we had some relatives in Russia and my – my brother once went to Russia and he spoke to them.</span> <span id="s367">And then some grandchildren of ours, from my – my – my uncle’s grandchildren came and they wanted to know about Communism and things like this.</span> <span id="s368">The children didn’t talk about Communism to their parents, the – on why and what, but the grandchildren did.</span> <span id="s369">Then I also have this here – this – I worked with AAA, alcoholic anonymous, so the children don’t want to talk about it to their parents, because they don’t want to picture their parents as alcoholics.</span> <span id="s370">But the grandchildren want to get into [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s371">And the same is also true with the Holocaust experience, that most of the time you see, the children don’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s372">They hear so much about it, it’s too much.</span> <span id="s373">But the grandchildren are free, more free and they want to hear about it and they – many times, an-and that’s why, for instance my – my wife didn’t want to write any book or anything like this for her children.</span> <span id="s374">Yeah, now she writes it for her children [indecipherable] the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s375">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s376">I think eventually they will hear it, you see, but it takes a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: I’d like to ask you some questions about your volunteer work at the museum.</span> <span id="s378">And I’d like to know specifically what do you do at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: All right.</span> <span id="s380">We moved to Silver Spring in 1988.</span> <span id="s381">When I came here I had a job already right away with the Montgomery county to give a course on the search for identity by the famous Victor Frankl.</span> <span id="s382">It’s an omo – i-it’s called – Victor Frankl.</span> <span id="s383">And then I also tried – I – at that time the museum was just forming, it had an office on L or M street in Washington, D.C. and I was going there and talking to Miss Morgenstern and additional people of the museum, I was talking to them about this.</span> <span id="s384">But they were not organized yet, so I just let it go.</span> <span id="s385">Then I – I didn’t want to take a job there, I just wanted to see if anything could be done.</span> <span id="s386">I was talking to them to – to the one in charge of the library.</span> <span id="s387">And then I started to become a regular volunteer when it opened up in 1993.</span> <span id="s388">Even before that I was already a volunteer.</span> <span id="s389">And in the first year I was also on the volunteer advisory board.</span> <span id="s390">One time I – I was a little bit – for a little while I was chairman, but then [indecipherable] two years, then you have to go out and I didn’t want to – because you can only stay at wa – at – on the advisory board for two years, then you have to interrupt one or two years, but I didn’t want to do it any more, no time.</span> <span id="s391">So what happened is now I’m doing three things at the museum.</span> <span id="s392">Number one a visitor representative, which means on the floor doing all the different things which should be done, which are necessary on the floor, about information and passes, elevators, all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s393">Number two, I’m with the Fannie Mae organization [indecipherable] about taking groups, leading groups around, young childrens in their teens, junior and high school children.</span> <span id="s394">And then after talking to them for two hours or so leading them [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s395">Then number te – three, I’m in the speakers’ bureau.</span> <span id="s396">And speakers’ bureau, they have different person now, John Minnick.</span> <span id="s397">I went and I talked to the – different things.</span> <span id="s398">I also talk – I was asked by other organizations, by the Catholic University and by Fort Meade talked i-in York, Pennsylvania, in White Port, Virginia.</span> <span id="s399">[indecipherable] remember what the difference is, and talked [indecipherable] you see, I just talked there.</span> <span id="s400">But I only talked for a few minutes, let’s say for 20 minutes, 30 minutes the most, 20 minutes and then they ask questions.</span> <span id="s401">But as we see, I showed them the list and when I talked at this school, the high school, I was surprised that after the school was finished, after school was finished, people came and they stayed and they asked more questions.</span> <span id="s402">That’s what I’m doing now and I also – I also brought to their attention that it was 60 years now after the Holocaust and to do something about it, they didn’t want to do anything in the beginning, but now it seems to be [indecipherable] doing something about it, you see.</span> <span id="s403">So I just got to all the different people [indecipherable] will also give a luncheon and I think it’s a luncheon [indecipherable] the museum in January next year, about certain experiences in [indecipherable] Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s404">There are many things in Kristallnacht which I didn’t know and I have the documents there and I have some books which I found in the library only last week.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: What special insights and talents do you bring to your work at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: I don’t know if there’s any talent, I don’t know is there any insight.</span> <span id="s407">I think it’s just the willingness to – people should know certain things and – which to – which is very hard to get to it – i – a different way, you see.</span> <span id="s408">You have to have your contact, you have to know what other people want.</span> <span id="s409">The only thing is like – like you say in social work [indecipherable] you see, the most important thing of a person is be able to listen, listen, you see.</span> <span id="s410">And so I try to listen to the other people, I don’t always talk [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s411">But I mean, in general it’s – it’s the attention, it-it-it’s mainly to listen to other people, to understand what they mean by that, and if not you ask them.</span> <span id="s412">And it’s – it’s the most important, I think, and people should ask questions.</span> <span id="s413">You cannot always have the answers because there are more questions than answers.</span> <span id="s414">[indecipherable] it’s more question than answer.</span> <span id="s415">But it also says [indecipherable] the Bible says, and too in the Talmud that you don’t ask questions, you – you cannot learn.</span> <span id="s416">So you see, you have to ask the questions and when you see something, you ask the question, why is this happening, why is this not happening.</span> <span id="s417">And not to be so bland and disregard what’s going on around you, that don’t have anything to do with you.</span> <span id="s418">You cannot live in this world, I tell them many times, as one person.</span> <span id="s419">You can only live with – you must have other people to live.</span> <span id="s420">What would you do if you would be only one person?</span> <span id="s421">Who is going to bake?</span> <span id="s422">Who is going to [indecipherable] Who is going to – to bring you from one place to another, transportation and so forth.</span> <span id="s423">So we need all our other people too.</span> <span id="s424">Everyone has a job in this world, and we must all work together.</span> <span id="s425">And we must all believe that we are not the final [indecipherable] and we’ll be judged eventually.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">Q: Can you tell me some of your special experiences or special moments that you’ve had at the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s427">A: I – I – I once – I was working in the – in – on the – in – in the information section [indecipherable] two times I had people coming over and tell me – tell me something about this, so I told them – and they came from Germany.</span> <span id="s428">I – because they needed someone to speak German to them, so they called me over, so I spoke to them.</span> <span id="s429">So inter – and was very interesting.</span> <span id="s430">This one person, she was a student in history, and the other one was in – working in the German embassy in Tunis.</span> <span id="s431">It just so happened that they wrote me, they knew that I would be in Germany, they telephoned me from Tunis to Bremen and they excused themselves as they could not come.</span> <span id="s432">See, I don’t like to start conver – correspondence with others, you see, but they wrote me.</span> <span id="s433">So that was one instance and they wanted to see me and they wrote me, by the name – the name of Schroeder, that I think they are related to the president – president of wer – Germany.</span> <span id="s434">So [indecipherable] works in the embassy.</span> <span id="s435">So then I had, another time I had the woman coming over and she said she was very depressed and she said, we were living in the zargabeit(ph), the Zweibrücken and it’s between border, French border.</span> <span id="s436">And at that time in 1936 – ’36?</span> <span id="s437">Yeah.</span> <span id="s438">They had the plevisute(ph) whether they want to come to Germany or not.</span> <span id="s439">So they decided to come to Germany because Hitler made so much propaganda there.</span> <span id="s440">But she said, we were always good friends with Jews.</span> <span id="s441">My fath – my – my father used to deal with Jews and my – and we always had good relationship.</span> <span id="s442">And then afterwards, when we joined Germany, then they called over my husband – her husband and they asked him what did he do with the Jews, you see?</span> <span id="s443">Why do you still keep contact with the Jews.</span> <span id="s444">I didn’t understand exactly what she said, if he committed suicide or what he did.</span> <span id="s445">But anyhow, after she came back from the – going through the museum, she came back to me and she said to me, I don’t want to see all this.</span> <span id="s446">In other words, she said, I don’t want to remember all this because it gives bad memories back to me.</span> <span id="s447">So people come over sometimes and they tell you certain things.</span> <span id="s448">There are many other things, but you hear any other things.</span> <span id="s449">You sometimes see people who you haven’t seen for years.</span> <span id="s450">Sometimes people come – I met people from South America who – who met – who knew someone of ma – my cousin who lives in South America.</span> <span id="s451">You see, i-it – all kinds of experiences.</span> <span id="s452">It’s very interesting there if you are on – on the – with the public, you know?</span> <span id="s453">That’s why I went with the public, and I could have done translations upstairs if I wanted to, but this is more interesting for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Have their been any special moments where your experiences as a refugee and survivor have – have had an impact on the students who come in through the museum?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Yes, I mean, when I talk to them and they want to hear more about it and – and some people call me back and there is some impact, but I – I don’t know actually how much impact it is, I only in – I only can say that when we finish the rounds, you know, I sometimes ask people to write out the comment – the comment cards, you see, and – and they write out the comment cards.</span> <span id="s456">They write out certain things that gave them more insight and they would like to hear more about it.</span> <span id="s457">It has some insight, but directly I cannot point to any particular theme, you see.</span> <span id="s458">There are – it certainly makes an impact on them, and the people come – to most of them.</span> <span id="s459">To most of them, I cannot say to all of them.</span> <span id="s460">Especially children who, I would say who are more than 15 years old, because if they are less than 15 years old, even though the museum says 11 years can come, you have different types of people.</span> <span id="s461">Some have – are very intelligent [indecipherable] some only become intelligent at 15, it’s all different grades.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: There has been a resurgence of interest in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s463">You have been in this country since before the war was over.</span> <span id="s464">In your experience, what do you think has accounted for this resurgence in interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: It – it took a long time to – people here in the United States and all over really found interest in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s466">In the beginning no one wanted to talk about it.</span> <span id="s467">And I know the people who come from Germany [indecipherable] don’t want to – to buy German goods, and things of this sort.</span> <span id="s468">After the years go by, people can look a little bit more in unbiased [indecipherable] peace and rest about what happened with us, and people want to know more about their past in hitl – in Hitler’s time.</span> <span id="s469">You see, everyone had one had to rate – write a – what is called a family tree.</span> <span id="s470">And in the United States I think it came about when Haley wrote his book on roots and people want to know who’s really my forefather, who are really my people before me.</span> <span id="s471">And I think this had some influence here that people want to know more about it and the children want to know more about their family.</span> <span id="s472">It could be an – and they learn a little bit about it in school, more than before.</span> <span id="s473">It’s unfortunate that in Maryland it’s not compulsory to teach the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s474">But I know they have five or six states, like New York is one of them.</span> <span id="s475">And maybe [indecipherable] to the education [indecipherable] where it is compulsory to talk about the Holocaust, not only in five or six lines like they have in the social studies book, much more about this an-and learn about things, see.</span> <span id="s476">How people should live with each other.</span> <span id="s477">Human history.</span> <span id="s478">And that’s why very important, you see that people like [indecipherable] we talk about the Holocaust, you see, we try to learn about it, we like to make people aware about what happened and what can happen if the Holocaust and especially the second ge-generation, they should know about that [indecipherable] they doing a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">[break]</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Jacob Wiener.</span> <span id="s481">This is tape number two, side A. And I had been asking you about the resurgence of interest in the Holocaust, and I wonder if you think that the – the Holocaust Museum itself has had some role in the resurgence of interest.</span> <span id="s482">If the Holocaust Museum itself had some role in the resurgence [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Okay, you also asked me about how I feel about certain things.</span> <span id="s484">I already told the Holocaust Museum there are certain things which I don’t feel are correct.</span> <span id="s485">For instance, certain people, you see, certain people who had the experience and so forth, should be used to do some research in certain areas and – and I found that – that the Holocaust Museum is more interested in certain facts, not – they would hear more about the emotions from other people, you see [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s486">Of course, when you have emotions, you may not always be neutral, but there is no person in this world who is a neutral, you cannot be neutral in th – in – in th – in your mind [indecipherable] where it says you can be neutral in facts, you see.</span> <span id="s487">So for instance, I [indecipherable] to them that they are – they’re preparing people who have studied from books and every book has a certain bias.</span> <span id="s488">Because you can have 10 books and you have 10 certain points of view in 10 certain books.</span> <span id="s489">You cannot be full of bias.</span> <span id="s490">Of course, the survivor, or someone [indecipherable] also has certain biases, because what he went through.</span> <span id="s491">But his personal bias is – is actually what he learned during the Holocaust, I mean what the experience in the Holocaust, what I experienced or others experienced during the Holocaust, so [indecipherable] so therefore I say, if you’d send someone out to visit concentration camps for instant, you know, many survivors don’t like to do this, because they want – don’t want to have a second experience.</span> <span id="s492">But the people who go there with a professional degree and book knowledge, they may not know which questions to ask, proper questions.</span> <span id="s493">And that’s why I said to them many times that – that I feel you should at least send one person also from the – from those Holocaust people, you see, the sur – survivors and they should bring out their – their emotions, wha – how they feel about it.</span> <span id="s494">I feel about certain things, you see, feeling is not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s495">And that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s496">And then – then, like I, you see, I don’t feel too comfortable in maybe saying everything which is there, but you cannot always – you don’t know who the other person is, how the other person would take it, if I tell them from my own inner heart, you see, how I feel about it.</span> <span id="s497">So I don’t honestly know that, you see, but I don’t want to insult the person on – and things like this.</span> <span id="s498">But – but let’s say when I lead the groups around, you see, I tell them how I feel about it.</span> <span id="s499">And I tell the other people who I – how I feel about it.</span> <span id="s500">And I don’t always know if this is the right way to say or not.</span> <span id="s501">You should always say your – your feelings.</span> <span id="s502">If you have very strong feelings about it, like I had about – as I mentioned to you before, about people can come out and they say they don’t believe in God any more, you see, now I have the strong feelings about this.</span> <span id="s503">But – and na – once happened when I – when someone has invited me in New York, psychologist, a friend of mine, he asked me to talk about what happened during Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s504">I couldn’t say it, because it – I was – it was too much for me, I couldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s505">I do cry.</span> <span id="s506">I couldn’t say it.</span> <span id="s507">So there are certain times, in certain instances which made the greater impression on you.</span> <span id="s508">Makes a great impression.</span> <span id="s509">I didn't vi – didn’t want to talk about the Holocaust, what happened to me, but after awhile I said to myself, the world must know, you see, like the book says.</span> <span id="s510">And, so therefore I said I would [indecipherable] about it, and so not everyone may like it, but that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s511">I hope only that we gonna have this hatred any more and this kind of terrorism, and this kind of anti-Semitism, because I experienced anti-Semitism very early in class, in – in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Did you experience anti-Semitism in this country after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, not really.</span> <span id="s514">You see, there is always some subtle anti-Semitism which, if a Jewish person advances or so, there’s always some anti-semi – Semitism in the – and why does he do this, and – and why does he deserve this, and why doesn’t he – there is always some anti-Semitism, but I cannot at this point have to think about it, find out special incidents.</span> <span id="s515">There are always certain incidences when you see it.</span> <span id="s516">I mean, I don’t know if this is anti-Semitism, because that the Jews were considered enemy aliens during the war, I don’t know if that’s anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s517">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s518">But, that we were considered like refugees and looked down, that was hard to get a job, you see, at that time it was hard to get a job if you are not pure in your language and you have an accent.</span> <span id="s519">In America it’s not – no longer that way, used to be.</span> <span id="s520">So, I mean, you couldn’t get a job in the very beginning, you know [indecipherable] some anti-Semitism, I think, but – or it’s just [indecipherable] against foreigners, you see.</span> <span id="s521">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s522">But whenever someone leaves a country, comes to a different country, he’s not immediately accepted.</span> <span id="s523">Takes a long time.</span> <span id="s524">Now we accept people much quicker, when the Jews come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Do you see the interest in Nazism from the skinheads and the other neo-Nazi groups as a – as a parallel to what was happening in Germany before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: They could develop into such a thing, I think, because they are very adamant about hating people and – and – and wherever there’s hate, there is the possibility that it develops into the same a-as before.</span> <span id="s527">I know this because the thought already is, before Hitler, feeling at the time, I saw the – that – that youngsters, you see, called you names [indecipherable] that’s always possibility.</span> <span id="s528">And – and in Germany, at least now, they tried to outlaw anti-Semitism, you see, here too, but you cannot completely outlaw it because you never know what really is in the person’s heart.</span> <span id="s529">There are some people who [indecipherable] anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s530">[indecipherable] you see in schools too, sometimes they see the teacher [indecipherable] people, especially when you go to non-Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s531">And they [indecipherable] have the books really, what kind of books they read and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s532">But it’s not on the old – in the old [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s533">I like to – if I see something like this, I’d like to address it head on, you see, like I do many times, you see, even when the Nazis invaded our town, I asked them right away, don’t – don’t want to hide from them, I just want to ask them, why do you have this?</span> <span id="s534">Some like – someone asked me, do you have any – do – don’t you – do you – y-you don’t like me because I’m not formal, I’m not religious, or so, like this, they ask me this questions.</span> <span id="s535">I say no, I would like you to see and be religious, but I – I – it’s up to you, you see.</span> <span id="s536">You have the choice, you see, and therefore I – I’m not refusing, you know, everything, that is nothing but my point of view is, you see.</span> <span id="s537">That’s what the most important, like said before, you have to have a point of view.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: What are the accomplishments that you feel the most proud of?</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Most important is that when I came here, you see, I – I found something in – in the education field.</span> <span id="s540">And I like the education field because you can influence the children and people and other people and – and I work in that field with – when I was – I had different job, I – I founded a – a Jewish school in th – the mountains, the mountain there, the Catskill mountains.</span> <span id="s541">I – I worked with the girls’ schools, and I helped bring girls over from – from Hungary and Sweden to the United States on a student visa and I helped banking institution in 1956, the children’s home for the ke – the re-retarded and emotionally disturbed children, which is still exists in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s542">And I – I learned with other people.</span> <span id="s543">So I think that’s a – another thing, and I wrote a few things, you see, which [indecipherable] and learn from if they want to, and – and I think eh – but could have done more.</span> <span id="s544">But we cannot do all everything.</span> <span id="s545">We can only do a few things, a few things and everyone does his own and we live together in peace and harmony.</span> <span id="s546">And to be well and healthy, that’s the most important.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: What would you yet like to accomplish?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: I’m writing this book, I hope to finish it, because they always ask me, when will you finish it, how – how far are you?</span> <span id="s549">I – I’m lazy.</span> <span id="s550">I just cannot get to it all the time because I have many other things, I have here [indecipherable] chaplain, I go there – there – I give classes here and there and there, so I have to cut down on this, to do one thing.</span> <span id="s551">Too many things are not good to do, even if I move it up and – I – I want to finish this book, I hope, and write a little bit more about the experience, and talk to people, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Tell me about the book that you’re working on.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: The book is actually an autobiography, but it’s not only an autobiography, also it’s something about history in it, because – I mentioned this in the museum, I said you only want historians to travel overseas, yeah, I said – I said, I’m also a historian because I – I studied history and languages, you know, to see, that’s why I n – know a little bit about every language, but not the whole language.</span> <span id="s554">Now, towards the end is this, I – I want it to be maybe part of a textbook, so that’s why I wrote also a little bit of history in there, you see how it came about, and how the Nazis invaded Poland.</span> <span id="s555">What you hear mostly nowadays when peoples talk is their experience in concentration camps, and – which unfortunately is – is a very important part of their life – lives, but I think it – I – what people don’t know so much, and that’s what I am talking to them about in the – for the speakers’ bureau I mentioned it, about how was it possible that Nazism developed in Germany and what brought it about, you see.</span> <span id="s556">The antecedents, what happened before, you see, and ho – what it means to grow up in Germany, that’s my topic, more or less, you see.</span> <span id="s557">Not so much – and it wasn’t in the conversation unfortunately you see, but I understand it was a terrible experience, but here’s what I want to – to write about in this book, and I don’t have a name for it.</span> <span id="s558">But I also want to tell them, you see, that I, among the [indecipherable] I wrote about it, every person has to see in this life, miracles happen.</span> <span id="s559">[indecipherable] a whole list of miracles that happened to me.</span> <span id="s560">I wouldn’t be here, the miracles.</span> <span id="s561">So I feel it’s important that a person understands themselves and understands that he is not the guide of the [indecipherable] you know, no some – next day something happens, you get sick.</span> <span id="s562">But you have to pray and you have to hope, see.</span> <span id="s563">That actually i-is what I believe and I would like others to believe it too, but I can’t make them believe.</span> <span id="s564">But I said to them, you see, you can learn a little bit from me.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: You mentioned some miracles that happened to you in Europe, getting out of Europe.</span> <span id="s566">What miracles happened to you in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: In this country, first of all, when we came to – I have to start here, coming to Canada.</span> <span id="s568">It happened many miracles in Canada, I – it would be too long to talk about everything, I’d rather [indecipherable] a miracle happened that we wanted to stay in Montreal and we were told by the government you come – go to Saskatchewan.</span> <span id="s569">And my father had a cousin.</span> <span id="s570">A miracle happened that we – we met some people at the travelers’ aid and they found out for us and we stayed in Montreal.</span> <span id="s571">We didn’t think we would.</span> <span id="s572">A miracle happened that I want to come to the United States and there was no way for me, I didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s573">But one day we found a newspaper where some people who have gone to school with me in Germany, they on there and I wrote to Baltimore and I got an affidavit.</span> <span id="s574">And the next miracle was, when I got American affidavit I needed permission to come to America, I didn’t think I would get it.</span> <span id="s575">Had special meeting with the consul [indecipherable] and I had no money and I got money from the [indecipherable] Jewish American Aid Society, I came to America and I came to Baltimore.</span> <span id="s576">Never thought I would come to Baltimore to an institution.</span> <span id="s577">And I never thought I would – I would stay there five years or six years.</span> <span id="s578">Stayed there five, six years, til I got [indecipherable] in the organization.</span> <span id="s579">Then I didn’t think I would get a job afterwards, I got a job [indecipherable] and so forth, so all kinds of – and didn’t think I would ever become a citizen [indecipherable] and about getting married and children and all the other things coming afterwards.</span> <span id="s580">All miracles.</span> <span id="s581">The whole story of miracles, and I wrote si – I wrote that the miracle of Hanukkah, the miracle of proof of my own stories.</span> <span id="s582">Hanukkah miracles [indecipherable] miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Is there anything that you would like to add that we haven’t covered today, or was not covered in your other interviews?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: We will never be able to cover everything, but I just want to say that, as I mentioned before, if you have hatred in your heart, you – you won’t get very far and you might only hurt yourself and other people.</span> <span id="s585">And since I was a social worker at one time, I still am, that’s number one.</span> <span id="s586">Number two is, you have to have your own opinion what you want to live with and – and if you feel comfortable, then you should do it.</span> <span id="s587">And especially if you’re Jewish you should – you should know what it means to be a Jew and – and you should teach your children, you see, and sometimes your children don’t ask many things, you see.</span> <span id="s588">You should play to their – an age when they ask, and when they ask you should answer them as much as you can.</span> <span id="s589">And I hope that the Holocaust Museum will make it possible – makes it possible for people to learn about that and – an-and gives everyone a chance to experience what other people experienced, but they should also give some opportunity for people who experience it to – to do more in this area if they want to.</span> <span id="s590">I want to thank you, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: I thank you very much for speaking with us today.</span> <span id="s592">And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum – excuse me, Memorial
