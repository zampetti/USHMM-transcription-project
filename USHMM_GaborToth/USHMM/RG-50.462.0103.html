one:</span></p> <p><span id="s2">PS: This is Philip Solomon, interviewing Mr. Philip DiGiorgio for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s3">Mr. DiGiorgio is a veteran, U.S. Army Veteran, of World War II, and was involved in liberation of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s4">Today’s date is December 6, 1994.</span> <span id="s5">Mr. DiGiorgio, can you tell me where in Europe and in what unit you were serving?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">PG: I was with the 42nd Rainbow Division of the Seventh Army and...</span></p> <p><span id="s7">PS: That was an infantry division?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">PG: Right.</span> <span id="s9">And I was in E Company of the 232nd Regiment of the 42nd Division.</span> <span id="s10">I am a proud holder of the Combat Infantrymen’s Badge, and I’m sitting here today to tell you that it was my honor to liberate Dachau concentration camp, having been in the first wave.</span> <span id="s11">And the sites, of course, were unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">PS: Going back a little bit before you discovered the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s13">In your advance through France, do you know where in France you landed, on the continent of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s14">PG: We came in on, in Marseilles, the port of Marseilles.</span> <span id="s15">And we took the Forty and Eight trains to Strasbourg.</span> <span id="s16">And then it was from Strasbourg that we went into action.</span> <span id="s17">We hit, well many, many towns, many of which are familiar, like Nuremberg, Würzburg, Schweinfurt, Fürth, and also the Vosges mountains.</span> <span id="s18">We started out at Gemsheim [phonetic] in Jan-...</span></p> <p><span id="s19">PS: Now what was all in...combat, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">PG: Yes.</span> <span id="s21">They were all, we, our division took all those towns.</span> <span id="s22">Then on occasion, like in Munich, I believe your outfit helped out.</span> <span id="s23">We had the 45th Division and the 101st to help us out.</span> <span id="s24">It was a real, real tough battle.</span> <span id="s25">But--and then, after that we hit Dachau.</span> <span id="s26">And I guess it was about two weeks later the war ended, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">PS: Again, now in your advance, like when you went through France, did you see any...evidence of Nazi atrocities?</span> <span id="s28">Like did you see any displaced person camps or prisoner of war camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s29">PG: No.</span> <span id="s30">No, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s31">PS: Did you have...</span></p> <p><span id="s32">PG: We had a job to do, we were going, it was about the time, Phil, of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">PS: December...</span></p> <p><span id="s34">PG: That was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">PS: December, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">PG: That was the beginning of it.</span> <span id="s37">And it was during the time, yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s38">PS: So in France you had no contact with French citizens or you saw no...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">PG: I..</span> <span id="s40">.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">PS: You were not in a position to see any evidence...</span></p> <p><span id="s42">PG: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">PS: That the Ge-, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">PG: We when we ended up, when we landed in Strasbourg, the Alsace-Lorraine people were very friendly, very helpful.</span> <span id="s45">That was I think the last time I slept in a bed.</span> <span id="s46">And then we went off and I was like a dog.</span> <span id="s47">I didn’t...</span></p> <p><span id="s48">PS: Now was Strasbourg still in...</span></p> <p><span id="s49">PG: I shouldn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">PS: Alsace...</span></p> <p><span id="s51">PG: Alsace-Lorraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">PG: And we, from there we pushed off and we had, we lived in January, February, March, April, outdoors and, like an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">PG: But thanking God that I made it.</span> <span id="s56">And I say--but Dachau, the concentration camp, was unbelievable, to see man’s inhumanity to man...</span></p> <p><span id="s57">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">PG: Was staggering.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">PS: Just one question, Phil, before we get to Dachau.</span> <span id="s60">You were, you entered Germany in March was that?</span> <span id="s61">February or March, 1945, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PG: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">PS: The Bulge was December, 1944.</span> <span id="s64">Then...</span></p> <p><span id="s65">PG: The Bulge, well it was like the end of, I think it was the end of December.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">PG: In December it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">PG: That's when we hit Strasbourg.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s71">Well what I wanted to ask you, Phil, after you entered Germany and you advanced in combat, say for the next couple weeks, were you in any way aware of what was going on within Germany?</span> <span id="s72">Were you aware then of the gassing of all the Jews, of political prisoners, the Romanians, the Poles?</span> <span id="s73">Were you aware at all of what later became known as the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">PG: Yes.</span> <span id="s75">I, we used to get our hands on The Stars and Stripes, the paper.</span> <span id="s76">That's how I knew about the atrocities.</span> <span id="s77">And like I said, going through all the towns we went, we fought in, and ending up in Dachau, was, well, it was a staggering thing to see.</span> <span id="s78">Like--I’ve given you some of my pictures of the atrocities.</span> <span id="s79">It was breathtaking and unbelievable.</span> <span id="s80">Like I'll say it again, man's inhumanity to man was unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">PS: Now, before you reached the site of the concentration camp, you were in combat against the German Army--the Wehrmacht–and the S.S. for a couple months I guess, when, until you arrived...</span></p> <p><span id="s82">PG: January, February, March and [unclear] ended up...</span></p> <p><span id="s83">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">PG: In May the 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">PS: Now during that period, again, did you see any, did you liberate any displaced persons camps, any prisoner of war camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">PG: Just Dachau.</span> <span id="s87">That’s the only...</span></p> <p><span id="s88">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">PG: But that’s the only one we hit.</span> <span id="s90">But we were, you know, we were following orders and we went where we were told to go.</span> <span id="s91">We hit, like I say, the major towns that I mentioned.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">PS: When you were approaching the concentration camp of Dachau, did you know, were you, do you know if your command knew that they were, was there any part of your mission to liberate Dachau?</span> <span id="s93">Do you think that any of your men, including your command element, knew that they were on their way to liberate a concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">PG: Yes, yes, we were not told that.</span> <span id="s95">They knew it.</span> <span id="s96">They, in other words, we just, you know, go where they point us.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">PG: But...</span></p> <p><span id="s99">PS: Do you think that they were aware to get to Dachau...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">PG: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">PS: For the purpose of...</span></p> <p><span id="s102">PG: Oh yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s103">The high command designated our company to hit that concentration camp.</span> <span id="s104">And I think the greatest sight I ever saw in Dachau were the bodies of about eight S.S. soldiers with their heads blown off.</span> <span id="s105">I found that a very enjoyable sight.</span> <span id="s106">I know it sounds cruel.</span> <span id="s107">And the other sight is, was having the pleasure of seeing the prisoners grab a guard who mixed in.</span> <span id="s108">When they were running around, when they were released from their cells, and the gates were opened, some of the guards tried to escape mingling with the prisoners.</span> <span id="s109">The prisoners, it was another great sight where, I know I was pretty bitter at the time after seeing all this, the unbelievable sights, that they would grab the guards and rip them apart.</span> <span id="s110">I mean, pull them apart handily, without any instruments, just their pain and their horror was such that they had to, they relieved a lot of their tension by doing that.</span> <span id="s111">But it was a sight to behold.</span> <span id="s112">And I do remember taking some of the building, opening up, well we had to clear a lot of the buildings in the camp to make sure there weren’t any pockets or anybody hiding, and we would see people sitting up on a chair that were white as a ghost.</span> <span id="s113">They were dead, but they were still alive, and they could hardly move.</span> <span id="s114">It was the most frightening sight.</span> <span id="s115">And then when I visited one of the Kommandant’s offices I did see the first time a lampshade made out of human skin.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">PS: Phil, not to interrupt, when you, now we’re speaking about Dachau.</span> <span id="s117">And we’re talking of the date of about April 29th, 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">PG: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">PS: When you first entered, was there any armed resistance from...</span></p> <p><span id="s120">PG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">PS: The guards?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">PG: There, the Germans had fled.</span> <span id="s123">Those people that were in the camp fled.</span> <span id="s124">And like I said they did, we did catch, my platoon didn't do it, but another platoon, the First Platoon, caught these S.S.ers that I saw lying on the ground.</span> <span id="s125">But they were the only soldiers that were left.</span> <span id="s126">And of course there were guards around.</span> <span id="s127">I don't know whether they were civilians or what, but they had mingled in with the prisoners that, they got there just to, I guess, as I explained.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">PG: But, well, we pressed on.</span> <span id="s130">I guess we were there a better part of a day then we pressed on, because we were still chasing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">PS: Can you give any estimate at all of the number of dead that were around the camp or also the number of living?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">PG: I cannot give you the amount of people that we liberated, but there was a hell of a lot of them.</span> <span id="s133">But there were about, from what I’ve read, about 60,000 people that were cremated in Dachau, according to, from what I’ve read.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">PS: Yeah, according to the records.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">PG: Yeah, 60,000 human beings.</span> <span id="s136">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s137">PS: Now among the survivors, first were there any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">PG: I did not see any children.</span> <span id="s139">But I know there were lots of children in photographs that I’ve seen and pictures I’ve seen and having been so close to it, seeing other camps, that there were a lot of children.</span> <span id="s140">I might have, I do have the privilege of going there in the coming April, to visit Dachau and to also look at the Rainbow Division Memorial Plaque at the main gate.</span> <span id="s141">We have our Rainbow Division plaque there, which I’d be very proud to see, although I doubt we are going.</span> <span id="s142">It’s next year, our 50th Anniversary.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">PS: Can you kind of give a description of the condition most of the survivors that you saw?</span> <span id="s144">Were there many women?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">PG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s146">There were men and women.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">PS: Women, but no children.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">PG: There were men and women.</span> <span id="s149">I did not see any children.</span> <span id="s150">Men and women.</span> <span id="s151">They were naturally underfed.</span> <span id="s152">They were, they looked very ragged, naturally.</span> <span id="s153">But it was a great joy and exhilaration for them to see us.</span> <span id="s154">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">PS: Did you see any freight cars, cattle cars, the forty and eights?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">PG: Yes.</span> <span id="s157">As we approached the gates, on the outside, let alone the bodies we saw inside, there were about I’d say fifteen to twenty of these little freight trains.</span> <span id="s158">They called them forty and eights: forty people or eight horses.</span> <span id="s159">And they had them stacked with bodies, ready to be cremated.</span> <span id="s160">They were still outside the gate.</span> <span id="s161">They had so many in there that they had these freight trains parked, freight cars parked outside.</span> <span id="s162">And that was the first thing that I saw that was absolutely staggering.</span> <span id="s163">Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">PS: They were like railroad cattle cars, were forty and eights.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">PG: And they were piled there just like piles of wood or trash, just unbelievable, Phil.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">PS: Was there, do you think that, from what you, oh, was there any, did you have any contact at all with the prisoners?</span> <span id="s167">Were any of them able to speak English or were any of them--were you or any of your buddies that were...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">PG: I had two fellows, one fellow from Rydal, Vic Shafer, and another one from Long Island, Lenny Russin, that were able to speak Jewish.</span> <span id="s169">And they did communicate with some of them.</span> <span id="s170">But we had a job to do.</span> <span id="s171">And though we spoke with, they spoke with them a short while, we were in a machine gun squad and we kept moving.</span> <span id="s172">We had a thing to do.</span> <span id="s173">We, you know, there was no time for--but I do remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">PS: You did have time to observe a number of the survivors, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">PG: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">PS: Did you have any indication [unclear] nationality?</span> <span id="s177">In other words, do you think it was predominantly Poles or Romanians or Gypsies or Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">PG: It's very difficult to say.</span> <span id="s179">I imagine, well, I don’t imagine, but most of them were of Jewish extraction, whereas a lot of Poles and German Jews, Polish Jews, and, they were most of them that I surmised.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PS: Phil, when you entered the camp, you say there were no guards still remaining there?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">PG: They were, no, they were, the soldiers left.</span> <span id="s182">There were some of the guards now.</span> <span id="s183">I am pretty sure they were civilian guards because at that time toward the end of the war the German Army was hurting and they were surrendering all over the place.</span> <span id="s184">There were as many as 200,000 surrendered at one time.</span> <span id="s185">And men were kicking them in the rear end as they surrendered.</span> <span id="s186">And that’s what I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s188">Do you have any--was your medical unit with you?</span> <span id="s189">Were they prepared to treat those who were in need of medical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">PG: Yes, there were some, I remember that.</span> <span id="s191">But the ones that I saw, you know, they were running around in jubilation.</span> <span id="s192">I mean, having been sprung, you know, they, there was just, a lot of chaos, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">PS: Did your unit, were they prepared to feed the...</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PG: I don’t, I can’t tell you that.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">PG: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s197">All I know is we were moving.</span> <span id="s198">At that time, Phil, you know, when you’re on the line, there are no clean sheets and hot food.</span> <span id="s199">You got K-rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">PG: Well you know what a K-ration is.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">PS: I’ll say.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">PG: Like a Cracker Jack box and you got a breakfast, lunch and dinner.</span> <span id="s204">And that was it.</span> <span id="s205">So, as far as, we weren’t prepared.</span> <span id="s206">There were, probably the rear echelon probably came up and helped them, I imagine.</span> <span id="s207">We had to move on.</span> <span id="s208">After we cleared the camp then we had to move on.</span> <span id="s209">We had a job to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">PS: It was quite possible that many of those you saw who were in pretty bad condition possibly many of them died also there.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">PG: Oh, I have, like I said, this one building we were clearing, I remember there was these two people sitting.</span> <span id="s212">They were as white as a ghost and they were dead, but they were still alive.</span> <span id="s213">I could see their eyeballs moving.</span> <span id="s214">But they were absolutely, they were in solitary confinement, whatever their problem, whatever they did.</span> <span id="s215">And it was something you never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s217">Is there any--we have more--some other things to travel, Phil, but within, while, during the time you did spend within the concentration camp, is there anything additional you would like to mention in addition to what we’ve already gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s218">PG: No, just that prior to hitting Dachau, and having been in the field for I’d say about four months or five months, whatever it was, I became toward the end very bitter, losing a lot of friends, having seen all that I had seen.</span> <span id="s219">I was very, very tired and disgusted.</span> <span id="s220">But when I hit Dachau, I knew why the hell I was there in Europe.</span> <span id="s221">And I was glad that I could be part of it because the people in that camp could have been my friends and my relatives, my family.</span> <span id="s222">And that’s how I look at things.</span> <span id="s223">And I was just happy that I had that honor of doing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">PS: When you mention losing some of your friends, you’re referring to buddies in your outfit...</span></p> <p><span id="s225">PG: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">PS: Who were, who didn’t make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">PG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s228">The first time we went in, in Gemsheim, oh, we lost a bundle.</span> <span id="s229">And we were told that we were gonna go in and clean out Gemsheim with nobody there and they were waiting for us with the Tiger Tanks.</span> <span id="s230">They really hammered us.</span> <span id="s231">That was our first taste.</span> <span id="s232">And, [chuckles] it was the beginning, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">PS: I would like to add at this point that the 42nd Infantry Division, the Rainbow Division, was a very much honored unit during World War II.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">PG: And World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">PS: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">PG: In World War I there was the Fighting 69 that everybody knows about.</span> <span id="s237">We were the same division, trying to maintain the division’s valor.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">PS: You--I was going to ask you about seeing all the horrible, almost unbelievable situations of the German atrocity against mankind, you did express that you were disgusted with the war and, but then you did mention that when you saw the unbelievable sights of man’s inhumanity to man in Dachau that you then saw that this was something that had to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">PG: When I hit Dachau and saw what I saw, I, it just renewed my strength and my desire to fight, because like I said, at that time, "You know, you're loosing this buddy and that buddy.</span> <span id="s240">And this guy gets hit and that guy gets hit.</span> <span id="s241">And you're gonna wonder whether the next one's got your name on it."</span> <span id="s242">And you live like that for four, five months.</span> <span id="s243">But like I said, when I hit Dachau, when I saw that camp, that really, all I can say is, wow, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">PS: Phil, I think you had mentioned sometime back on this tape that you saw eight S.S. Germ-, in S.S. uniform, with their heads blown off?</span></p> <p><span id="s245">PG: Mmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">PS: Do you know what had happened to them, how it came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">PG: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s248">I saw them lying there.</span> <span id="s249">What had happened was, our first platoon went in first and they probably apprehended them before we got there.</span> <span id="s250">But when we got in, we opened up the gates.</span> <span id="s251">But the first platoon was pursuing.</span> <span id="s252">And after we regrouped we got out.</span> <span id="s253">But we had, like I said, we had to clear the camp before we went ahead.</span> <span id="s254">And there were a lot of tricky tunnels and a lot of--it was pretty scary, you know?</span> <span id="s255">You, like you're, you go through, you figure this is all clear, O.K., there’s nobody here.</span> <span id="s256">And then you, you'’re getting shot from behind.</span> <span id="s257">But there were a lot of tricky tunnels and stuff like that along the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">PS: While you were right there in the, either in, within the camp or in the vicinity of Dachau, did you see any German civilians who were observing what had happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">PG: I saw a lot of displaced people.</span> <span id="s260">I’ve seen them like, you go into a town, like we went into Gemsheim, you see all the old people coming out and kids and the, with their animals and pets.</span> <span id="s261">It was just scary, you know, it was just heart, heart-, what am I trying to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">PS: Yeah...</span></p> <p><span id="s263">PG: Rendering.</span> <span id="s264">And I remember that sight.</span> <span id="s265">And the, well, that’s the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">PS: Now, you expressed very well your own feelings.</span> <span id="s267">Do you think that your feelings represented pretty much the reactions of other men in your unit?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">PG: Oh definitely, yeah, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">PS: Now how long did you remain within Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">PG: I’d say the major part of a day, then we had to move on.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s272">When you moved on, at that point, what was your direction?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">PG: We were in the Seventh Army and we were--what we were doing, we were cleaning out pockets of Germans.</span> <span id="s274">And at that point there was, I would say during the past, that last week there wasn’t that much resistance.</span> <span id="s275">They were only giving up.</span> <span id="s276">We had scores of them giving up.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">PS: Now Phil, at this point, were you aware that this was Dachau, that this was a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s278">Did you think, even in your wildest imagination, that this was just one of many concentration camps, that those, all the bodies you saw there, were only a part of twelve million that were killed?</span> <span id="s279">In other words, did you at that point realize that this all added up to twelve million killed in concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">PG: Well, I was aware, as I said, I read The Stars and Stripes about these concentration camps.</span> <span id="s281">And we had no idea where we were going when we were forging ahead.</span> <span id="s282">We were following orders from the high command of the Seventh Army.</span> <span id="s283">And this is when we came into Dachau.</span> <span id="s284">And I saw, like I saw with my own eyes.</span> <span id="s285">But we were pretty busy most of the time.</span> <span id="s286">And we, dodging bullets, you know.</span> <span id="s287">It was an experience I don’t know, are you, are we almost terminated now?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">PS: Well, there are a few more things to...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">PG: Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">PS: Now, in your own mind, Philip, can you explain the German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">PG: I knew, from what I had read, that the Nazis were the ones behind all the problems.</span> <span id="s292">After the war was over I was stationed in Austria for a year and I found the Austrian people very, very friendly, very nice.</span> <span id="s293">But where I was stationed, the I went to church, I became very, very religious, Philip.</span> <span id="s294">I became very, very religious after the, you know, having survived what I did.</span> <span id="s295">And I went to church.</span> <span id="s296">I prayed, and the people in the town, this little town of Bad Hofgastein would see me going to church.</span> <span id="s297">And they’d, they were, you know, more friendly to me.</span> <span id="s298">And that’s where I learned to speak German there.</span> <span id="s299">And I found the people very nice.</span> <span id="s300">I found from my experiences, there were an awful lot of hard core Nazis which, you can’t wish them anything but bad luck.</span> <span id="s301">I mean, but I was fortunate to run into a lot of fine, fine people in Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">PS: I was going to ask you if your experiences had any effect at all in your faith and your religion.</span> <span id="s303">But I think you’ve already expressed that very, very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">PG: Indubitably.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">PS: That it did really have an effect.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">PG: And to this day I you know, when you’re in combat like that, you make all kind of promises to God.</span> <span id="s307">I’ll be honest with you, Phil, I was so close to God I was on the other side of Him.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">PG: You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s310">Trust me.</span> <span id="s311">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s312">PS: That’s certainly very commendable.</span> <span id="s313">Is there a regimental history of your unit in combat?</span> <span id="s314">And the experience of the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">PG: I don’t get the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">PS: You have a regimental history that shows...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">PG: Well, we, yeah, we have I have articles, you know, from the certain towns that we took, like the Nuremberg and the Würzburg and the Munich, Gemsheim...</span></p> <p><span id="s318">PS: Now, when you left Dachau, you proceeded what, south?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">PG: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">PS: To Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">PG: I think it was, yeah, right before the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s323">We’re up to, let’s see this April 30th.</span> <span id="s324">And the official German surrender was May the 8th.</span> <span id="s325">So we’re within...</span></p> <p><span id="s326">PG: May the 9th, wasn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">PS: The 8th, 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">PG: O.K., I won't argue.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">PS: Yeah, so we’re within the last, final days of World War II.</span> <span id="s330">Now, as you advanced south of Munich toward Austria...?</span></p> <p><span id="s331">PG: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">PS: Did you then see any other survivors of the concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">PG: There were a lot of displaced people, yeah.</span> <span id="s334">We saw them all the time.</span> <span id="s335">In fact, when we held up, after the war, we had a lot of them working for us.</span> <span id="s336">And they were in the towns doing, you know, menial jobs for the Germans, to keep occupied.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">PG: But they were all displaced people, lots of them, of different nationalities.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">PS: Do you think they were accep-, when they came in to, I know a lot of the displaced people simply wandered out of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s340">You know, the survivors.</span> <span id="s341">And do you think they were accepted if they went into a small town, or, say Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">PG: I don’t know about Munich, because that was behind us.</span> <span id="s343">But in Austria, I do remember seeing a lot of them, and they were gainfully employed, doing, of course, menial jobs.</span> <span id="s344">But, like I say, I found the people in Austria to be very nice.</span> <span id="s345">I was led to believe, I'm not a historian, I was led to believe that in northern Germany, was the hotbed of most of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s346">But I do know where I was stationed, thank God, that the people were very nice.</span> <span id="s347">And I didn’t run across any, and it was a good thing I didn’t run across any.</span> <span id="s348">[both chuckle]</span></p> <p><span id="s349">PS: Where were you at the time of the German surrender, which was either May 8th or 9th.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">PG: I think it was Tittmoning in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">PS: You hadn't yet reached Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">PG: Oh no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">PS: You were in...</span></p> <p><span id="s354">PG: Oh wait a minute.</span> <span id="s355">I’m not sure now.</span> <span id="s356">You know it’s only...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">PS: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">PG: It’s only fifty years ago, Phil!</span> <span id="s359">It’s only fifty years ago.</span> <span id="s360">I think we ended up there in Austria, in Salzburg, around in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">PS: Now, how long did you remain in Europe after the termination of the war?</span> <span id="s362">I believe you said about a year?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">PG: About a year, because we spent most of the summer chasing Fräuleins, and then I learned to ski.</span> <span id="s364">I was in the ski resort.</span> <span id="s365">Oh, it was the most delightful winter.</span> <span id="s366">And I got myself a good racket.</span> <span id="s367">I was the company clerk and I had some people who was doing my job.</span> <span id="s368">And I skied every day, Phil.</span> <span id="s369">It was the, it was a pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">PS: Your unit then, was it still part of the 42nd...</span></p> <p><span id="s371">PG: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">PS: Division?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">PG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s374">What happened was I was the clerk typist.</span> <span id="s375">And I tried to tell them that when I got drafted.</span> <span id="s376">And when I was in the machine gun squad I was very unhappy.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s378">PS: This is Phil Solomon on tape one, side two, interviewing Mr. Philip DiGiorgio for the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College.</span> <span id="s379">Phil, you were just, we were speaking about your post-war experiences in Austria as part, you were part, your outfit the 42nd was officially part of the army of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">PG: Yes.</span> <span id="s381">Yeah, we were designated.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s383">And you were staying in, again, what town in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">PG: Bad Hofgastein.</span> <span id="s385">I was in the regimental headquarters.</span> <span id="s386">And that’s where we were stationed.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">PS: Yeah, the location, Phil, was it west of Vienna?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">PG: It was near, it was, oh--it was directly east, it was near Salzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">PG: Which was east of, Vienna was on the other side of Austria.</span> <span id="s391">And I..</span> <span id="s392">.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s394">You were west of...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">PG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s396">And I’ll tell you something.</span> <span id="s397">I had a chance to go visit Vienna.</span> <span id="s398">And I refused to go.</span> <span id="s399">Some of the fellows that came back from my company who were there said that the Russians were walking around with machine guns, full of vodka.</span> <span id="s400">And all I needed was one of those guys to bump into me, and I wouldn’t have come home.</span> <span id="s401">Because I was in no mood to well anyhow, that’s something else.</span> <span id="s402">But I never saw Vienna for that reason.</span> <span id="s403">But I did spend a lot of time in Salzburg too.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s405">Were you anywhere near Mauthausen, the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">PG: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">PS: That was I think about eighty miles west of Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">PG: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">PS: One of the real bad ones.</span> <span id="s410">You know, one of the bad concentration camps.</span> <span id="s411">Now a few more questions, Phil.</span> <span id="s412">During this period, were you a witness to, what--I'd like to get if possible, a little picture of the handling of all these displaced persons, the concentration camp survivors, who were free and returning to their prior environment.</span> <span id="s413">Did you see any of the handling of these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">PG: No, no.</span> <span id="s415">Because we had to push on, Phil.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">PS: No, I mean...</span></p> <p><span id="s417">PG: I’m sure that regimental headquarters and the rear echelon and, you know, for every person like myself in the infantry up on the line, there’s about forty guys behind the line.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">PS: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">PG: And I was one of the lucky ones to be able to experience this.</span> <span id="s420">Ha, ha, ha!</span> <span id="s421">But, I’m sure they were handled, and I’m sure that the divisional and the Seventh Army had made preparations and all, because a lot of them went on their own too, you know.</span> <span id="s422">They couldn’t force them to do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">PS: And were you aware of any, the assistance set up for handling these freed survivors, in getting them back to their homes or...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">PG: I had, no.</span> <span id="s425">I had no idea, like I said, we had to push on.</span> <span id="s426">I would love to have hung around and not push on!</span></p> <p><span id="s427">PS: But you were...</span></p> <p><span id="s428">PG: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s429">I do not know how it was handled or what the procedure was for those people.</span> <span id="s430">But I was assured that they were taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s432">Now you remained in Europe then until about May of 1946?</span> <span id="s433">Or...</span></p> <p><span id="s434">PG: Yeah.</span> <span id="s435">I got out in ‘46.</span> <span id="s436">I guess it was around May.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">PS: Just reminiscing, thinking back, did you, do you think that you would have the same feelings about the war had you not seen the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">PG: Oh that was, like I had mentioned earlier, I--what am I--you know, everybody's waiting--my number's gonna come up, you know.</span> <span id="s439">I figured, well.</span> <span id="s440">But when I hit Dachau and I felt I accomplished something, I did something, and it was a very warm feeling knowing what these poor people went through in concentration camps, poor innocent people.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">PS: Yes.</span> <span id="s442">So you believe, as most of us, that our war effort was justified through all the atrocities that...</span></p> <p><span id="s443">PG: Well, that animal wanted to come over here.</span> <span id="s444">You know, he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s445">PS: Yeah, sure, would have.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">PG: He oh, definitely.</span> <span id="s447">He was on his way.</span> <span id="s448">And he had, he was a very ambitious paper hanger.</span> <span id="s449">And I'm just delighted, like I said, that he met his demise.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s451">Phil, I have covered just about the field that, you know, the questions about what we would like to, you gave us exactly the testimony that an eye witness to the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s452">Is there anything that you would want to add?</span> <span id="s453">Anything that we didn’t cover that you would like to add at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">PG: No, just that I’m delighted that you called on me to help.</span> <span id="s455">This Holocaust museum is very important, because there are a lot of people that don’t realize and are very callous towards this.</span> <span id="s456">And it just, it aggravates me, and I'm glad I could put my name to this, because like I say, there are a lot of people that don’t even believe it, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s457">And I’m just glad I can attest to my experience.</span> <span id="s458">I will say this, the United States Post Office is trying to come out with a stamp depicting the atom bomb.</span> <span id="s459">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s460">PS: [unclear]...</span></p> <p><span id="s461">PG: There’s a lot of...</span></p> <p><span id="s462">PS: The Japanese are objecting very strenuously.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">PG: Yes.</span> <span id="s464">Now let me say something about this.</span> <span id="s465">Now this is important.</span> <span id="s466">I found out about a month after the war that we were getting ready to go to Japan.</span> <span id="s467">Well, you can imagine how I felt.</span> <span id="s468">I was, thank God, I came through one.</span> <span id="s469">I gotta go over there and let them, you know, take a shot at me?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">PG: Well God bless him, the President of the United States...</span></p> <p><span id="s472">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">PG: Harry Truman, dropped the bomb and ended the war.</span> <span id="s474">Now, of course, a lot of people were killed.</span> <span id="s475">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s476">But, he saved a lot of their lives too.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">PS: Yeah, that’s exactly...</span></p> <p><span id="s478">PG: He saved a lot of their lives, but he saved my life.</span> <span id="s479">And I--never--the greatest man that ever lived...</span></p> <p><span id="s480">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">PG: He saved my life.</span> <span id="s482">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s483">PS: I..</span> <span id="s484">.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">PG: When I hear this, that we want to defend them, they started the war, Philip!</span> <span id="s486">They, and like I say, I’m not a hero.</span> <span id="s487">I didn’t volunteer.</span> <span id="s488">Although I got my combat infantry badge and I got my Bronze Star.</span> <span id="s489">So those are my trophies.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s491">Well deserved.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">PG: Well, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">PS: Phil, on behalf of the Holocaust Oral History Archive of Gratz College, I want to thank you very, very much for your very meaningful testimony.</span> <span id="s494">And again, on behalf of all of us here at the Holocaust Archive, we thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">PG: O.K.</span></p></body></html>
