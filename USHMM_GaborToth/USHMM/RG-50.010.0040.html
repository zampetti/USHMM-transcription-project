E., Atlanta, Ga. 30324.</span> <span id="s3">I've been there for thirty years.</span> <span id="s4">I was born December 31, 1916.</span> <span id="s5">I witnessed the concentration camp liberation about 3 to 4 hours after the Germans had fled away.</span> <span id="s6">I was with the American Army Engineers.</span> <span id="s7">My prospective profession at the beginning of the war was a businessman.</span> <span id="s8">My present occupation is a businessman.</span> <span id="s9">I was with the 333rd Engineers at the time we liberated, we helped to liberate, the Buchenwald Concentration Camp.</span> <span id="s10">I was a warrant officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: How did you first hear about these camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I had first heard about the camps through reading about them in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s13">I never did really believe that such a thing existed.</span> <span id="s14">I thought it was propaganda put out like the propaganda about Germans cutting off women's breasts in Belgium in World War I and killing children by stabbing them with bayonets in World War I, which later turned out to be propaganda, so I felt that this also must be propaganda because it was too gruesome to contemplate human beings doing officially as an action of a state.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: Did you have any idea of what you would see when you got to a place like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: I had no idea in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What was the mood of your group when you were approaching this camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: I was in a jeep with one other American soldier so we were not actually liberating the camp, but we were coming on it to see it after the Germans had fled away.</span> <span id="s19">At that time, they were in serious route conditions and they were fleeing from us and trying to turn themselves over to us as fast as they could to keep the Russians from getting them.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Do you remember the date?</span> <span id="s21">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Q: And did you have any personal feelings about this?</span> <span id="s23">About these camps other than what you've told me?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: I'll tell you my feelings shortly about them.</span> <span id="s25">I have a statement now I can read about them if you like.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: Let's go on and then we'll get that.</span> <span id="s27">Now, give your description of the camp as you remember it.</span> <span id="s28">When you first got there, what was your first impression?</span> <span id="s29">What did you see?</span> <span id="s30">The sights and sounds, etc.</span> <span id="s31">?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: My first impression of it was the odor.</span> <span id="s33">The stench of it was all over the place, and there were a bunch of very bewildered, lost individuals who came to meet us pathetically at the door in their unkempt uniforms to see what we were doing and what was going to be done about them.</span> <span id="s34">They were staying at the camp even though their guards and staff had fled because they didn't know where to go or what to do.</span> <span id="s35">They had heard news that the Americans had taken over that area, and they were waiting for somebody to turn their lives back straight again.</span> <span id="s36">They were just lost souls at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: What did they do when they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: They came up and they tried to embrace me, and they talked to me eagerly about what had happened to them and how it had happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Did they have any orders about what they were supposed to do or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">I mean, they didn't know what was going on, did they?</span> <span id="s41">They were just kind of lost, wandering around.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: They were just wandering there in the confines of this awful place.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Were they processed in any way?</span> <span id="s44">Was there any ordered structure to what was being done or was just everyone standing around gawking and looking?</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Everybody was standing around when we got there.</span> <span id="s46">In fact, we were helping to feed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: What did your fellow soldiers and officers say and do at this time when you were there?</span> <span id="s48">How did they treat these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: They treated them very, very well.</span> <span id="s50">Q: What did they say to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: They had the same deep feelings, as well as I could tell, that I had about the horrible atrocities that were committed by man against man.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: What was your feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: My feeling was that this was the most shattering experience of my life, and it has been the most shattering experience of my life since.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Did the condition of these people make you consider them as less than human beings or how did you feel about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: I felt the captors were less than h uman beings.</span> <span id="s56">I thought that these people were helpless victims of a system that had been impossible for them to cope with.</span> <span id="s57">They were in the position of someone who was forcibly kidnapped by a machine gun armed band on the street and taken somewhere and tortured and executed.</span> <span id="s58">They had no chance to defend themselves.</span> <span id="s59">The system was so clever, and I felt the country was being run by a madman, who had a lot of willing accomplices and he was carrying out this program of his.</span> <span id="s60">A madman dealing with sane people who were helping him carry out his mad program.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: Were any of the guards around or any Germans around when you got there?</span> <span id="s62">A: All the guards had fled.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: Were there any killed?</span> <span id="s64">Could you see any dead ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: No, nobody was killed.</span> <span id="s66">There were some inma tes of the camp who were almost dead and the ovens were still burning.</span> <span id="s67">There was still human flesh and bones burning in the ovens when I came on them.</span> <span id="s68">They had about six or eight ovens in a row -- all of them smoldering and burning and crackling.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: But you saw no Germans at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: No, except there were probably some Germans who were inmates in the camp, but the people in it for the most part were people from Poland, Romania, and Hungary, who had been shipped there for extermination.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Did you see any violence by the inmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: None at all.</span> <span id="s73">They were very peaceful and pleasant.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: How would you answer the question: What kind of people would do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: I felt that Hitler himself was a madman.</span> <span id="s76">The other people involved either had to be mentally unbalanced in serious ways or else they had to be very psychologically disoriented to undertake a program of this sort and live with it from day to day.</span> <span id="s77">I can’t really imagine that type of person who engaged in systematic, mass murder over a period of time, day after day, and lived with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: How long were you there?</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: I was there for maybe four hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Did you see any German citizens around?</span> <span id="s81">Any people from the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: There was nobody from the area, but, interestingly enough, the inmates told me that trucks went out into the surrounding villages each eight-hour shift and picked up people from the villages who came there and worked in the camp during that shift.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: So they knew what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: And the trucks then took them back and picked up the new shift and put these people back, so everybody in the surrounding villages knew what sort of a place they had there.</span> <span id="s85">But I felt that they, too, were victims of the system and, if they dared to raise their voice, they, too, would be put in this camp; so people were afraid under those circumstances to interject.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Did you hear any talk among the soldiers about making reprisals against the Germans because of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: We all felt very deep hostility toward the Germans before we saw this concentration camp layout and this just added fuel to our flames.</span> <span id="s88">Shortly after we got into Germany...[Mr. Glustrom says to someone else “The tape recorder’s on.”]</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: What about the military?</span> <span id="s90">Did they help you in any way cope with this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: No, they didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: They didn't help you to relieve the tension?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: But, I was going to say -- I remember now -- that the attitude of the American commanders as soon as we got into Germany and had been there for about a week changed.</span> <span id="s94">[At first] they wanted us to destroy everything and they didn't care if we killed Germans or what.</span> <span id="s95">But, about a week after we got in, the attitude changed and they wanted to preserve everything and just do the necessary damage to get the Germans to surrender.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Did you have an opportunity to visit with a Rabbi or Chaplain or anyone?</span> <span id="s97">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: No psychiatrist?</span> <span id="s99">No one helped you?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: No, nobody helped me at any time or for any experience when I had to face death.</span> <span id="s101">I faced it alone and when I had to bury large numbers of dead people or witness large numbers of dead people, I had to do it on my own resources.</span> <span id="s102">And very few people got any help or were in a position to get help when they needed it in a crisis.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Did you tell anyone about the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s105">I talked about it continuously after that.</span> <span id="s106">Q: Who did you talk with?</span> <span id="s107">Members in your group?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s109">The people I came in contact with and most of our group wanted to see it for themselves if they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Have you talked about it much since you came back home?</span> <span id="s111">A: Well, from time to time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Did you feel it was important for your wife to know about it?</span> <span id="s113">A: I felt that she certainly would be interested in knowing about it.</span> <span id="s114">Q: What about your children?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I have also told them because I felt they should know, too.</span> <span id="s116">Q: Did you all see the Holocaust TV show?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: I really think everybody should know about it and, yes, we saw the TV show.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Did you think that that was worthwhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: I thought it was worthwhile, but I thought it was quite a bit cleaned up from what the actual conditions were.</span> <span id="s120">In the first place, they would have to have "smellavision" to be able to tell what it was really like, and they could not possibly show the filth people had to live in who were in this camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: What do you think people can learn from this?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: I think they can learn that they can become the victims of evil just as readily today as they could any time through history.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Should this be taught in schools or in religion classes?</span> <span id="s124">What is your feeling about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: I think it should be taught, certainly, that nobody or no country is immune to depredations of the individuals within it who decide to take over in that manner.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Q: Have you ever had any unpleasant experiences from this, like nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s127">A: I used to have that sort of thing, but that lasted two or three years and then I became able to digest it.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: What was the most striking thing about this experience to you?</span> <span id="s129">What struck you the most other than the feeling you have already said about man's inhumanity to man?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: The helplessness of the individual in face of an organized system that has been very carefully calculated and designed in every physical and psychological way to control him and his destiny.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Did you consider yourself a religious person at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: I have always considered myself a religious person in a sense of the word, but not in the sense that I have ever favored any organized religion of one type or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Did you have any conscious thought about God or religion at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: I had one impression that if there was a personal God He must be participating in this type of activity in some form or fashion to let it happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Would you say that your feeling about God was different after this experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: No, I think it was about the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Did religion have any way that you viewed these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Or the civilians or the Germans?</span> <span id="s140">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: It didn't enter into it?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No.</span> <span id="s143">I didn't look at it as a religious matter.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: If you had been a prisoner, do you think your religion or your religious feeling would have helped you hold together or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: No.</span> <span id="s146">It wouldn’t.</span> <span id="s147">It didn't help me when I was facing death myself and so I had to have resources within myself.</span> <span id="s148">I don't know what you would call them -- whether psychological, religious or what -- but I had to have my resources to withstand the shock of death, possible death, and the shock of seeing mass death practiced against others.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you feel that your religious thoughts, or your feeling about mankind, had any bearing on your feeling about the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Have your had any change in your political views?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s153">I came back home determined to try to correct some of the injustices that I had lived with since my childhood here in the South.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: Do you think you have had any success in this?</span> <span id="s155">Do you see that people's attitudes are changing toward one another or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: I witnessed improvements in people's attitudes for some time, but after the 1954 Supreme Court decision on schools, I witnessed a sort of hardening of people's positions and even a reversal of attitudes.</span> <span id="s157">I witnessed for many years the Church not willing to participate in programs designed to bring equalized opportunities into the lives of various people in this country.</span> <span id="s158">Then the Church began to take an interest in this question and participate in it.</span> <span id="s159">So the churches went counter to the general population in that respect.</span> <span id="s160">They did participate, except for here and there a brave, far-seeing individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: How do you feel about the Civil Rights Movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: I feel very strongly about it.</span> <span id="s163">I participated in it quite heavily.</span> <span id="s164">I paid a big price for participating in the Civil Rights Movement.</span> <span id="s165">I was an officer of the Georgia Council on Human Relations for over twenty years.</span> <span id="s166">I was close to being one of the founders of it.</span> <span id="s167">I was vice president and an officer of The Atlanta Urban League for thirteen years.</span> <span id="s168">My wife and I were one of the founders of the Georgia Civil Liberties Union [CLU]Chapter, and I was the only continuous officer in the CLU for about fifteen years.</span> <span id="s169">I've been an officer in the Poverty Day Nursery Association for about twelve, fifteen years so one might say that I have participated actively in the Civil Rights Movement.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: What about the Viet Nam War?</span> <span id="s171">How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: At first, I felt like everybody else, and then as I got educated mainly by my sons I began to oppose it very strongly as our biggest mistake as a nation.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: What about the situation in the Middle East now?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: In the Middle East now, I am hoping there will be peace and that Israel will survive as a viable state.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: What about things like the executions in Cambodia?</span> <span id="s176">Do you see the same thing happening again?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: There too, one doesn't know whether to believe the stories or not to believe them because all you get is a newspaper version which hasn't had a great batting average.</span> <span id="s178">But, if they are taking place, they are sickening.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Suppose that one of your children or grandchildren were to come to you and say they might want to be a Nazi.</span> <span id="s180">How would you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: I would feel like renouncing that child and not ever seeing them again or having anything to do with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Do you see the Nazi movement as primarily a Jewish persecution?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: It is also anti-Negro.</span> <span id="s184">It would become anti-any minority group.</span> <span id="s185">It starts out with the Jews and ends up wanting to control everything.</span> <span id="s186">I don't know if you ever read that statement by Pastor Niemoller who was in Germany during the time of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s187">It is a very effective statement in which he says...I could read it for you if you want.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: I've got two or three more questions and then we'll read it.</span> <span id="s189">Do you feel like your attitude toward the leaders of the Jews has changed or your feeling toward the Jews themselves?</span> <span id="s190">Do you think they were too docile?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No.</span> <span id="s192">I think they did the best they could under the circumstances.</span> <span id="s193">They themselves didn't believe that anybody could do this and by the time they did find out what was happening, it was too late for them to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s194">When they actually as a group, the ones who were still more or less free, realized what was happening, then they started trying to revolt and fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">Q: Do you feel the need to do something today to make sure that something like this never happens again other than what you have already talked about?</span> <span id="s196">I know you have participated in different movements and things.</span> <span id="s197">I know you feel a need for it.</span> <span id="s198">Do you feel like it’s going to be actually beneficial?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: I don't know what people can do other than to teach man to somehow work within himself and his own feelings towards his fellow man.</span> <span id="s200">I think in order to help make others better, a person has to first make himself better.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Otherwise, his work with others becomes nullified in his own selfishness and greed and intolerance.</span> <span id="s202">So, I believe that each individual needs to become a better person himself in order to help society, and then I think a person should devote a portion of his time towards working with and in society.</span> <span id="s203">But I guess that's not happening so much because people are participating less and less in the processes of the society they live in.</span> <span id="s204">You can look at the voting record in this country and see that.</span> <span id="s205">This is fairly well known.</span> <span id="s206">It's by Pastor Martin Niemoller.</span> <span id="s207">He was a practicing minister in Germany of excellent reputation and then he had to experience the Nazis and this is what he said about them: "In Germany, they first came for the Communists and I didn't speak up, because I wasn't a Communist; then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew; then they came for the trade unionists and I didn’t speak up because I wasn't a unionist; then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant; then they came for me and, by that time, no one was left to speak up."</span> <span id="s208">And so with that statement, I can tell you a little bit personally -- I'll just read it here -- that helped shape my life and create the type of climate for the kind of work I did towards racial justice and harmony in Atlanta.</span> <span id="s209">[Reading] “I was with an engineering regiment attached to General Patton's 3rd Army.</span> <span id="s210">Our mission was to destroy a single rail line behind the collapsing German Army so our heavy tanks would have a supply of gasoline, ammunition, and food.</span> <span id="s211">I was 24 years old and I was helping to spread the havoc that was being done in that war.</span> <span id="s212">The most shocking event of the war and of all my 61 years of life since then was a sudden visit to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp a few hours after its liberation.</span> <span id="s213">Its long rows of ovens were crackling and smoldering over the bones and flesh of human fodder.</span> <span id="s214">The camp guards had just fled in trucks back into their prosperous homes in the nearby villages.</span> <span id="s215">Many inmates met us at the open gates in shabby uniforms -- frightened, bewildered, and dreading the possible return of their captors.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Free, but surely, not so free.</span> <span id="s217">Many of these adult prisoners were thin -- their size indicating the term of their imprisonment -- on their less than subsistence rations.</span> <span id="s218">Their life had consisted of hard labor and steady starvation.</span> <span id="s219">A nauseating stench dominated the area like a thunderous discord and especially in the dormitories and sick rooms.</span> <span id="s220">The dormitory rooms were about 12 x 15 feet with 9 foot ceilings approximately.</span> <span id="s221">Wooden bunks without pads were every two feet, floor to ceiling around all the walls.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Approximately 15 inches was allowed for ingress.</span> <span id="s223">There were approximately 54 persons wedged into these bunks in each room and then numerous others were crowded in on every foot of the floor.</span> <span id="s224">Unable to move, the occupant was forced to file his own mess and sleep in the common stench dominating everyone.</span> <span id="s225">Many rooms were used in three shifts.</span> <span id="s226">Diarrhea and dysentery were commonplace.</span> <span id="s227">It was like a giant cesspool.</span> <span id="s228">The sturdiest structure in the camp was the weirdly efficient crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Outside of the crematorium, I saw a long flatbed trailer loaded with four layers of naked, starved bodies.</span> <span id="s230">At least 200 tiny adult corpses, weighing 40 to 60 pounds each, I guess, were stacked and tied like cord wood awaiting the ovens.</span> <span id="s231">This gruesome shipment had been transported along the German highways almost covered with canvas, but open enough to see under.</span> <span id="s232">Live prisoners were hauled into the camp by rail and by truck.</span> <span id="s233">Some were selected for work in the factories while their life lasted; the others were marked for final disposal taken into a room with simulated shower heads.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">They stripped for the showers and were bolted into the room.</span> <span id="s235">The victims realized too late that gas, not water, came out of the nozzles.</span> <span id="s236">All the bodies were completely stripped of jewelry, gold teeth, and any other items of value before being thrown down a chute into the oven room.</span> <span id="s237">There was an administration building in front of the entrance gate with labs for medical experimentation on humans.</span> <span id="s238">Many lamps of tattooed skins were shown to me by the inmates in grisly display.</span> <span id="s239">They also told me of a factory building where they worked making soap and other items.</span> <span id="s240">The staff and guards lived in the nearby towns and were hauled back and forth from nearby villages for their shift in the round-the-clock operation.</span> <span id="s241">The way Buchenwald and other concentration camps operated in Germany had to be common knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Apparently decent Germans felt helpless to fight against the very heavy ruthless system in control of their country.</span> <span id="s243">Like most Americans, I had never believed the atrocity stories about such a highly educated nation as Germany.</span> <span id="s244">Seeing Buchenwald is an intensive mental and emotional beating, uprooting and changing all the forces directing my life.</span> <span id="s245">Injustice became clearer to me and far less tolerable.</span> <span id="s246">And so I became ripe for the Civil Rights activity, which I engaged in on returning from five years of military experience.”</span> <span id="s247">So that describes essentially my feeling about the whole burden that was created for man to bear in his soul and his conscience for the rest of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: John, I surely do appreciate your time and your interesting story.</span> <span id="s249">You'll hear from us.</span></p></body></html>
