id="s12">Q:Leah, will you begin by telling me your name, both, I think, your name now and your name in 1939, and where you were born, and your date of birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A:My name is Leah Silverstein and I was born in 1924 in Praga which is a suburb of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s14">And I was born Leah Hammerstein.</span> <span id="s15">And my mother's name was Sarah Bjorn Goldstein and my father's name was Leib Hammerstein.</span> <span id="s16">I had three, two brothers.</span> <span id="s17">My elder brother, was, his name was Wolf Hammerstein, we called him Wowe, and my younger brother was two years younger than myself and his name was Hershele Hammerstein.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q:Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A:Well, my mother died in 1929 when I was five years old, and it meant a terrible change in the life of our family.</span> <span id="s20">From a well to do family, which operated a haberdashery business within one year we became poor, dirt poor.</span> <span id="s21">My father intended to emigrate to Paris, France, where he had a daughter...not a daughter, a sister, and, but the plan didn't realize and through manipulations by his family and friends, he lost the money that he acquired after selling everything we had.</span> <span id="s22">And it coincided with the time of the world crisis in 1929, with the depression era.</span> <span id="s23">So, to make a long story short, I knew hunger and cold and humiliation of being poor, walking around in tattered clothes even before the war.</span> <span id="s24">I was a very good student at school.</span> <span id="s25">I had excellent grades and I liked to go to school.</span> <span id="s26">And, well, my father remarried after four years of being a widower and that was another traumatic experience for our family, because my step mother turned out to be a terrible person.</span> <span id="s27">She didn't know how to take care of us children.</span> <span id="s28">I mean, well, she was a wicked step mother to put it simply.</span> <span id="s29">And at one point she tore up all my school books and school copy books which I treasured very much because I liked to study.</span> <span id="s30">I liked going to school.</span> <span id="s31">And, it well, we ended up in fighting each other physically.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">01:04:49 Well, she was kicking and beating me around and after that incident I left my father's home and I went to live with my maternal grandmother.</span> <span id="s33">Well, before the war I started to, I, after finishing my elementary school, I enrolled in a high school, which we called Gymnasium at that time.</span> <span id="s34">And it was a very lucky moment for me because high school in pre-war Poland was not free.</span> <span id="s35">You had to pay for it.</span> <span id="s36">I didn't have the money to pay for the tuition so I enrolled in a contest where over a hundred young girls competed for two places and one of the Gymnasium.</span> <span id="s37">Well, I was one of those two that got a place and for two years I attended this high school until the war broke out, as you know, on September 1, 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q:Now, was this high school in Warsaw or in Praga?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A:Yes, it was in Warsaw on Platz Krasinskich.</span> <span id="s40">The name of the school was Gymnasium Zaksowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q:What about your religious background?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A:Well, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, was a very observant Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s43">A typical east European Jewish woman was all the manifestations of being Jewish.</span> <span id="s44">You know, attended regularly all the holidays in the synagogue and preparing shabbas as it should be, and you know, just being a typical, not quite orthodox but very traditional.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">01:07:10 My father was already not so very traditional.</span> <span id="s46">He still you know was going to the synagogue but only on the big holidays and he was more oriented towards the movements typical in the Jewish community after the events of 1905.</span> <span id="s47">You know the revolutionary movements and then the, the 1917 upheaval in Russia, was the, which brought on the communist regime and he was a very young person at that time, but involved in all these movements.</span> <span id="s48">Well, as for myself, I'm not a religious person.</span> <span id="s49">I cannot say that I am an atheist.</span> <span id="s50">I would rather say I am an agnostic.</span> <span id="s51">I didn't have any manifestations of the existence of God and the Holocaust even intensified this belief in me.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q:But, as, as a child you lived in an observant home?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A:Well, my a, when I went to live with my maternal grandmother, I lived in a Jewish home.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q:Were your friends Jewish, or mixed?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s56">My friends were all Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s57">I didn't have any Polish friends because the elementary school, even though the curriculum was Polish exactly like the other elementary schools, Polish schools had, the lectures and the lessons were all in the Polish language.</span> <span id="s58">But the children were all Jewish children and the same applied to the Gymnasium, to the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q:And that was very intentional?</span> <span id="s60">There was a real separation?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A:Well, that's how it was in Poland.</span> <span id="s62">I can't exactly answer this.</span> <span id="s63">I haven't studied these things.</span> <span id="s64">But the Jewish children went to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s65">That doesn't mean that all the Jewish children went to Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s66">There were Jewish children who went to Polish schools.</span> <span id="s67">It depended where you lived.</span> <span id="s68">It depended on the local circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q:Were there a lot of Jews in Praga?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A:Yeah, there were.</span> <span id="s71">There were Jews in Praga.</span> <span id="s72">I can't give you exact numbers, but there was a considerable community in Praga.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q:Now, both in your time in Praga and then in Warsaw afterwards, did you experience any anti-Semitism before the war?</span> <span id="s74">Did you know about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s76">Well, I remember the one incident when I was walking home back from school and Polish boys were behind me and making anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s77">They were singing a sing-song.</span> <span id="s78">I don't know if you understand Polish, but well, well I can say it in Polish for those who understand the language, "zydowiea chaja, spraedawata jaja, po ezemu, po ztotemu."</span> <span id="s79">??</span> <span id="s80">That was one incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">01:11:04 The other incident that I experienced was we had, like I said before a haberdashery business and the neighbors next to our store, was a Polish store and you could feel the isolation, you know.</span> <span id="s82">The, there wasn't a good feeling of good neighborhood you know.</span> <span id="s83">They existed...they tolerated us, but there was no real friendship.</span> <span id="s84">Besides, I was, at that time too young to think about these things.</span> <span id="s85">I was a child at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q:Now were you in, did you join or were you involved with any youth groups or cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A:Yes, I was.</span> <span id="s88">Even before the war I joined a Jewish Zionist scout organization called Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s89">Luckily for me, because this organization really gave me a good start in my life.</span> <span id="s90">I mean, they gave me something to believe in.</span> <span id="s91">Because like I told you before, my childhood was not a very happy one and in the youth organization I found room, you know, for growth.</span> <span id="s92">We were intellectually active.</span> <span id="s93">We were, I have good friends.</span> <span id="s94">We went to outings, so that was very beneficial for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Q:Tell me a little bit about the organization?</span> <span id="s96">What did it believe in?</span> <span id="s97">What was, what was it about?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A:Well, this was one of many Zionist youth organizations that existed in Poland before the war.</span> <span id="s99">There was a whole row of them.</span> <span id="s100">This one was a Jewish scout organization, and we were connected even with the Polish scout organization.</span> <span id="s101">We had good friends in that Polish organization, Irena Adamowicz, and others, Henryk Grabowski, and others.</span> <span id="s102">And the aim of this organization was to eventually immigrate to Palestine.</span> <span id="s103">At that time we didn't talk about Israel because Israel didn't exist yet.</span> <span id="s104">And the task of this youth organization was to prepare the young people for work on the land in our homeland to build kibbutzim, you know communes, and to go to live over there.</span> <span id="s105">That was the main purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">01:14:01</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q:So, even then, before the war, everyone believed in a, in a desire and a need to get out of Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A:Not everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q:The people in your organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A:The people in my organization, definitely, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q:That's interesting.</span> <span id="s112">Now, prior to 1939, how much did you know about Hitler and the Nazi party and what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A:I knew almost nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q:Nothing in the newspapers, no refugees coming into Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A:Well, they used to come when they started to expel Jews from Germany, they used to come to Poland.</span> <span id="s116">But being a teenager at that time, I didn't pay too much attention to that.</span> <span id="s117">It's only later on, you know, that I understood much more but not before '39.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q:OK, so, how did things change, what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A:You mean when the war broke out?</span> <span id="s120">Well, our whole life was broken right away.</span> <span id="s121">You know I was walking with my younger brother Hershel in Praga on the streets.</span> <span id="s122">It was a beautiful autumn day and planes appeared on the sky and we thought that these were Polish planes making maneuvers but in fact they were the first bombs coming down from that, from these planes were intended, you know, for the Polish population.</span> <span id="s123">And I remember we started to run away because in addition to the bombs comings down from the skies, the planes came down very low and they started you know to shoot at the population from their machine guns.</span> <span id="s124">And, all of a sudden you know around the walls there were you know marks from the shells, so naturally we panicked and ran home.</span> <span id="s125">And father didn't know what's happening.</span> <span id="s126">We didn't have a radio so we went to the neighbors to listen to the radio.</span> <span id="s127">And indeed there was an announcement telling that Poland is in war with Germany.</span> <span id="s128">That the Germans crossed the Polish border and we are at war with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q:Was this totally unexpected?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A:To me it was totally unexpected.</span> <span id="s131">Maybe to grownups it wasn't, but to me it was totally unexpected.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">01:17:01</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q:So, what happened next?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A:Well, next, my father...well Praga was bombarded very heavily.</span> <span id="s135">He, my father had a brother living on the left side of the River Vistula.</span> <span id="s136">You know Warsaw is divided by the River Wisla, in English Vistula.</span> <span id="s137">We lived on the right bank.</span> <span id="s138">His brother lived on the left bank.</span> <span id="s139">So, he collected us children and we ran from Praga to Warsaw hoping that Warsaw is not bombarded so heavily as Praga is.</span> <span id="s140">The truth turned out to be the reverse.</span> <span id="s141">Warsaw was even worse bombarded than Praga.</span> <span id="s142">And the flight from Praga to Warsaw, you know, we had to cross the bridge and the bridge was one of the main targets of these planes.</span> <span id="s143">You know, I don't have exactly the right words to describe the panic that existed among these running people.</span> <span id="s144">The screams and you know the cries of the children.</span> <span id="s145">The women, the terrible panic that seized the population.</span> <span id="s146">And the planes coming down on you.</span> <span id="s147">It was a miracle that we made it through that bridge, but we did.</span> <span id="s148">We came to Warsaw to my uncle.</span> <span id="s149">They were surprised to see us, what happened you know.</span> <span id="s150">And for the first time in my life I felt the smell of burning domiciles.</span> <span id="s151">This was the invitation to the terrible five years that came later on, you know, when not only the smell of burning domiciles, but the smell of burning human beings came to your nostrils.</span> <span id="s152">Well, we stayed there a few days, a day or two.</span> <span id="s153">I don't remember exactly.</span> <span id="s154">We didn't have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s155">We were scared.</span> <span id="s156">We decided to run back to Praga, and again the same terrible situation you know.</span> <span id="s157">Running all the time through deserted streets you know, hiding in houses which were shaking you know.</span> <span id="s158">Well, we came back to Praga and I went to my grandmother's place.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q:Now, I'm sorry, your grandmother lived in Praga also?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s161">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q:For some reason I thought she was in Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A:No, she lived also in Praga.</span> <span id="s164">And one of the first days of war when I stayed with my grandmother, the house in which we stayed was bombarded.</span> <span id="s165">A bomb hit the house.</span> <span id="s166">It cut off the edge of the house, and so we didn't perish, but we were buried under a pile of rubbish.</span> <span id="s167">And finally we succeeded to crawl out from under this.</span> <span id="s168">I remember being a child I couldn't stop laughing seeing my grandmother being, you know, all covered with pinkish dust.</span> <span id="s169">She looked so funny and she had a wig on her, like Jewish orthodox women did, and the wig went awry on her head, you know.</span> <span id="s170">Well, being a child, I still found it very funny.</span> <span id="s171">But we came out alive from that experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">01:20:55 When we came out into the streets, it was havoc all around, you know.</span> <span id="s173">Dead horses, dead people, the war was coming to us step by step.</span> <span id="s174">My grandmother was buried under the pile of rubbish twice, because she went to visit a friend of hers and the other house was, was hit too, yeah, and she crawled out a second time from under the pile of rubbish.</span> <span id="s175">Well, what would you like to know more?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q:Well, how long did this go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A:What do you mean "this"...the bombing?</span> <span id="s178">Well about a month.</span> <span id="s179">Warsaw held out longer than any other Polish city.</span> <span id="s180">For a month it was hell on earth, to put it simply, you know.</span> <span id="s181">You were hungry.</span> <span id="s182">You couldn't wash.</span> <span id="s183">Your life was in jeopardy every moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q:So you just went from place to place trying to find safety?</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A:Yeah, where could you run?</span> <span id="s186">You run to people you know, right, or to your relatives.</span> <span id="s187">So, we ran to one of my uncles who also lived in Praga, close to where my grandmother lived, but he decided to leave Warsaw.</span> <span id="s188">Because, you know, after the first week of the war, Colonel Umiastowski gave an order for armed, for men, armed able, of men who are able to carry arms to leave Warsaw and to go to the east because the east was still some...we couldn't go west, you know.</span> <span id="s189">West was the Germans.</span> <span id="s190">The East was still giving some hope to people.</span> <span id="s191">Maybe for reorganizing the Polish army, whatever.</span> <span id="s192">So, people were leaving in the thousands, the city.</span> <span id="s193">And my uncle also left with his wife and two of my cousins.</span> <span id="s194">He went as far as a community called Katuszyn and that's where a bomb hit him and both his legs were torn off.</span> <span id="s195">He didn't come back, of course.</span> <span id="s196">He died after a few hours.</span> <span id="s197">His wife and the two children came back later on to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s198">And when the ghetto was established in fall of 1940, they went to live in the ghetto and we too.</span> <span id="s199">Every Jew had to be concentrated in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">01:23:55</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q:So, the bombing campaign went on about a month?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q:Then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A:Then the bombing stopped and the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s205">I remember, you know, we all went out to see.</span> <span id="s206">It's sort of morbid curiosity, you know, what's going on.</span> <span id="s207">And well, there they were.</span> <span id="s208">First, you know, on motorcycles, on trucks full of Germans, and my grandmother she tried to console us children.</span> <span id="s209">She said, you know she remembered the Germans from the first world war, so she said, in Yiddish of course.</span> <span id="s210">She talked Yiddish, don't be scared, you will see soon the Germans will distribute frozen fish.</span> <span id="s211">She remembered that incident from World War I and she was convinced that the same will happen now.</span> <span id="s212">Well, they distribute later on, but not fish.</span> <span id="s213">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q:So, what kind of changes took place once the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s215">Were they nice to you?</span> <span id="s216">Were they scary, what, what was it like, seeing all these Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A:Well, it was scary, but you see when you are very young you are protected by the absence of the notion of mortality.</span> <span id="s218">So, you are rather curious more than, than apprehensive.</span> <span id="s219">Apprehensiveness comes later on when you are more mature and you understand things better.</span> <span id="s220">Well, for a while before we went to the ghetto, you see the Germans came in, in September '39.</span> <span id="s221">The ghetto was established a year later.</span> <span id="s222">That doesn't mean that all the ghettos in Poland were established a year later.</span> <span id="s223">Some were established on the very months that they came.</span> <span id="s224">Like in Katnaf Tribonovsky, and, in September there was a ghetto already.</span> <span id="s225">But in Warsaw, it took a year.</span> <span id="s226">And well, we were all, they gave us like two weeks to exchange, you know, the Poles from, yeah, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q:But in this year, your life changed?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q:What were the restrictions?</span> <span id="s230">Were there decrees?</span> <span id="s231">Could you do certain things and not other things?</span> <span id="s232">What was life like?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">01:26:32</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A:Well, for one thing schools were closed.</span> <span id="s235">There were no schools for Poles, certainly not for Jews.</span> <span id="s236">Food was rationed.</span> <span id="s237">Poles got better rations than the Jews, right away.</span> <span id="s238">The intelligencia was gathered, the Polish Intelligencia and done away with either to most of them they were you know killed off right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q:And you were aware of this at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A:I, well, I was aware that I couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s241">I was aware that hunger was still a matter to deal with, and, but I was not quite aware of the political atmosphere at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q:Were there beatings or anything like that on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A:Definitely.</span> <span id="s244">Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q:That you saw?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A:Yeah.</span> <span id="s247">People, you know, the Jews were not allowed to walk on sidewalks.</span> <span id="s248">There were, they had, whenever Germans came along the street, the Jews had to step down to go in the middle of the road and to take off their hats.</span> <span id="s249">And we didn't, whenever they didn't do it, they were beaten.</span> <span id="s250">And I remember one such incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q:What about religion, was that outlawed or did people continue going to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A:No, you couldn't go to synagogues anymore.</span> <span id="s253">Well, I was not a synagogue goer anyway, but I don't think they were allowed.</span> <span id="s254">Any clandestine activity was not allowed and to go to a synagogue would be a clandestine activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q:So, how did you spend your time in this year.</span> <span id="s256">You couldn't go to school.</span> <span id="s257">You couldn't I assume there were not too many cultural opportunities?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A:Right.</span> <span id="s259">Well, like I said, I was a member of Hashomer Hatzair and we tried to contact each other, the friends from that organization.</span> <span id="s260">You know, in that organization, the youth were divided into age groups.</span> <span id="s261">So, I contacted the friends from my age group and we started to, to do something, gathering meeting.</span> <span id="s262">And people tried to return to the normalcy that existed before the war.</span> <span id="s263">They tried.</span> <span id="s264">And soon some of our leaders in the organization came back from the east because many of them when was that wave of escapees to the east, they went to the east too.</span> <span id="s265">And some of them came back, and when they did come back, they reorganized our youth organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">01:29:54 We had some activities.</span> <span id="s267">We were meeting, of course clandestinely, and each time in a home of another person.</span> <span id="s268">Among my instructors was Szmuel Breslaw, and he used to come from Warsaw to Praga and organized it.</span> <span id="s269">Well, when we came to live in the ghetto, a kibbutz was established, a commune, for our organization, and other youth organizations did the same thing like the Dror organization, and I went to live in that kibbutz.</span> <span id="s270">The kibbutz that I belonged to was on Nalewki 23 in Warsaw, and I lived in that kibbutz till I escaped from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s271">With a group of, of other Hashomer Hatzair members.</span> <span id="s272">At that time, one of our leaders, Josef Kaplan, succeeded in arranging for us to live on a farm near the city of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s273">And so, the members of the group to which I belonged were all trying to get out from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s274">At that time it was not terribly difficult to get out.</span> <span id="s275">It was difficult.</span> <span id="s276">There was always a death penalty for leaving the ghetto.</span> <span id="s277">Personally, I escaped by jumping into a street cart, which at that time was crossing the ghetto from one Aryan side to the other Aryan side.</span> <span id="s278">And that's how I got out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s279">The group to which I belonged, pair by pair escaped from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s280">Some, by having permits to leave the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">01:32:09</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q:Work permits you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A:Whether work permits or other kinds of permits, you could achieve a permit to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q:Actually, I want to stop you, because as far as I can tell there's a period when you were living on this kibbutz in the ghetto, how many, and I want to hear more about that and just the ghetto life itself.</span> <span id="s285">The ghetto was formed, when?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A:It was formed in October 1940, and it was closed on November 15, if I remember correctly 1940.</span> <span id="s287">Closed by, mean, by closed, I mean you couldn't get in or out without special permissions.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q:Now, did you initially move in with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A:Yes, initially was my family.</span> <span id="s290">My father went to live in a place on Ogrodowa Street , but I separated.</span> <span id="s291">I mean, as I told you before, I didn't live with my father anymore.</span> <span id="s292">Even before the war, I lived with my grandmother.</span> <span id="s293">So, I went to the place where my grandmother was living.</span> <span id="s294">Well, and from there I went to live in the kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q:Fairly soon after the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A:Very soon after I came to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q:Tell me, tell me a little bit about the ghetto itself, not just the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s298">But what the life was like there?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A:To capsulize it, I would say it was hell on earth, because on an area which included several streets, I mean the wall which was running around the ghetto was like eleven miles long.</span> <span id="s300">So, within that area people were concentrated you know in Warsaw before the war, there were about, over 300,000 Jews, maybe more.</span> <span id="s301">And when the ghetto was created, the Germans herded into the ghetto Jews from the surrounding areas, from the smaller areas.</span> <span id="s302">And, finally there was like on this limited place, like almost half a million Jews living in terrible conditions, living on a, on a nutrition base which was below the subsistence level, attacked by dirt and hunger and soon the other killing factor was typhus which was rampant in the, German, in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s303">Till this very day, you know, sometimes I get the terrible smell of carbole.</span> <span id="s304">I don't know what the English word for carbole is.</span> <span id="s305">That was a disinfectant that they were spraying in houses where cases of typhus broke out.</span> <span id="s306">And people were driven from those houses to public baths to, to, for so called de-lousing.</span> <span id="s307">Which was actually a place where you could get typhus because typhus is a disease by lice born...it's a lice born disease.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">01:35:54 And, well, look, we came to live in the ghetto in, in October 1940.</span> <span id="s309">By, by March my father was dead, starved to death, literally.</span> <span id="s310">Because once he was cut off from the ghetto, he was cut off from his clientele and from his, from his subsistence, you know.</span> <span id="s311">A terrible hunger was in my father's house because sometimes I was running from the kibbutz to see how my father is doing.</span> <span id="s312">And it was a sight which I will never forget.</span> <span id="s313">And I run to see my grandmother, whom I loved, because she was the substitute of my mother, you know, and Randy, what can I tell you.</span> <span id="s314">These sights of my father and of my grandmother dying from starvation and terrible hygienic conditions, is a picture which haunts me till this very day, you know.</span> <span id="s315">And this is over half a century ago, and it torments me in terrible nightmares to this very day.</span> <span id="s316">My grandmother was lying on a, on a dirty bed because she was unable already to move from that bed, without food, and with her came to live some, a Jewish family, a young Jewish family with three little children.</span> <span id="s317">The mother was soon caught smuggling some food and she was put into the jail.</span> <span id="s318">And the father was going out with the eldest son which was like six years maybe old to find some work to earn some money.</span> <span id="s319">He usually came home empty handed because he was a barber and very few people needed his services in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s320">So, when I came to visit my grandmother, I saw these little children, you know turning into little monsters because when a person is subjected to starvation there are visible changes in their body you know.</span> <span id="s321">First people get swollen, and later on they become distorted.</span> <span id="s322">And these little children were like two little monsters, that I, and they were next to my grandmother who was also in a, in a state of decay.</span> <span id="s323">And sure, I remember she said to me in Yiddish, "Look in what state I am."</span> <span id="s324">And I stood there, a young girl, you know, tears were running down my cheeks.</span> <span id="s325">I couldn't help them.</span> <span id="s326">The only...you know, living in the kibbutz we were much better off than other people because at least we had three meals a day.</span> <span id="s327">Very, very skimpy meals, but still like a piece of bread and a, and a bowl of soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">01:39:36 Sometimes I saved one of the pieces of bread that I got and I was bringing it to my father or a potato.</span> <span id="s329">It was nothing that could really change the situation, but it, that was the most I could do.</span> <span id="s330">And thinking of it now in hindsight, I think that was, that was a very terrible, I mean, it was a very hard thing for me to do because I was hungry all the time too, you know.</span> <span id="s331">It's not a big deal to share with others when you have plenty, but it's very difficult to share with others when you are yourself hungry.</span> <span id="s332">Not only hungry, I came, my physical health deteriorated in the ghetto to a point where I fainted and I was taken to a clinic.</span> <span id="s333">And of course the doctor said she needs better nutrition.</span> <span id="s334">She needs not to work so hard.</span> <span id="s335">Speaking of work, what was I working in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s336">The members of the kibbutz, the boys, I mean the young men, we were not boys, but the young men usually worked on, on the Polish air field on Okzeie.</span> <span id="s337">Or in the geographical cartographic institute in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s338">But the girls were usually domestic helpers, you know.</span> <span id="s339">So, I was also a domestic help working for other Jews who were still wealthy in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s340">Because, you know, the differentiation was enormous in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s341">Not everybody was right away poor.</span> <span id="s342">There were many people who were well to do in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s343">So, well?</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q:People who were well to do in the ghetto, weren't, were they able to help those of you who didn't have as much?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A:Well, there was ZTOS, ZTOS is an acronym for Zydowskie Towarzystwo Opieki Spolecznej, and this was an institution who was supposed to take care of needy people.</span> <span id="s346">But there were, the need was so enormous as to the possibilities of supplying, that they couldn't meet all the, all the demand that people had.</span> <span id="s347">So, there was a big differentiation between people who had the means and could buy food which was smuggled into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s348">And between the people who right away became pauperized because they were cut off from their professions.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">01:42:39 And especially the people from the smaller communities.</span> <span id="s350">They were usually very poor to begin with.</span> <span id="s351">They were right away, you know, candidates of starvation from, death from starvation.</span> <span id="s352">Which makes me think that usually there is this myth that Jews are rich people.</span> <span id="s353">This is a myth.</span> <span id="s354">In, in Poland before the war there was an enormous amount of Jewish people who were poor especially in the shetlach and in the smaller communities, people were not very rich.</span> <span id="s355">Usually the ratio between the rich and poor was such that there were a few rich people and the majority was poor.</span> <span id="s356">Well, you asked me if they helped.</span> <span id="s357">Maybe they did, but I don't think they could help a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q:You, you mentioned that your father died very soon.</span> <span id="s359">Were you able to see him before he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A:Yes I was.</span> <span id="s361">Yeah, I was running from time to time to see him, bringing him something to eat if I could, you know.</span> <span id="s362">It was a slow and painful death.</span> <span id="s363">I don't know if people can understand it, because in the United States I don't think that people starved to death.</span> <span id="s364">You can have poor people, probably people who do not have enough, but not starvation.</span> <span id="s365">In ghetto it was literally starvation.</span> <span id="s366">You died day after day.</span> <span id="s367">It took, it takes a couple of months to starve from, to die from starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q:So, you were able to get back and forth and you, and that's how you knew that he died?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s370">One day a girl came to tell me that my father is dead.</span> <span id="s371">So, I ran over there, and there he was in that basement apartment...apartment, you can't call it apartment.</span> <span id="s372">He was on the floor in a pool, in a pool of his excrement.</span> <span id="s373">And that and the step mother was standing next to him, you know.</span> <span id="s374">Well, I didn't have much sympathy for her, but that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">01:45:20 And I didn't have the money to pay for a decent burial.</span> <span id="s376">At that time you still could have a burial if you paid to the, to the Judenrat, to the Jewish council, about 15 zlotys they would bring a hearse and carry away the dead person.</span> <span id="s377">But we didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s378">So, what people, poor people, used to do is to put the cadaver out in front of the house.</span> <span id="s379">And then there were special wagons who came and picked up all of those dead people and brought them to the cemetery on Gesia Street.</span> <span id="s380">So, the next day I ran to that cemetery hoping to find my father there.</span> <span id="s381">And what I saw is, it was you know, a terrible nightmare.</span> <span id="s382">For the first time in my life I saw a pile of dead bodies, you know, like two stories high.</span> <span id="s383">Because the amount of dead people was so enormous and growing from day to day that the, the grave diggers couldn't keep up with the pace of the dead, you know, of the amount of people who were pouring into that cemetery.</span> <span id="s384">So they collected them, you know, piles, one upon the other, you know.</span> <span id="s385">And all these corpses, you know, the limbs intertwisted between, you know, with open mouths and I was a young girl, and the stench from that pile of human corpses was so terrible.</span> <span id="s386">It's a sweetish smell, you know.</span> <span id="s387">I don't have the words to describe it, but, it was, you know, hell was, even the word hell is not a word to describe it, you know.</span> <span id="s388">Though I couldn't find him on that pile, you know.</span> <span id="s389">I just couldn't make it, and I went back to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s390">Well, I, there was no point in even telling about it because the majority of people in the kibbutz had parents in a similar situation.</span> <span id="s391">Not all of them, but some were in the same situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q:Let me ask you, how does a 16 year old girl deal with this?</span> <span id="s393">How do you handle this?</span> <span id="s394">I mean this is...</span></p> <p><span id="s395">01:48:05</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A:You handle as much as you can, you know.</span> <span id="s397">Like I said, I was lucky that I belonged to that group of young people.</span> <span id="s398">And we were, you know, it gave you a frame in which you could exist, you know.</span> <span id="s399">It gave you a sense of belonging.</span> <span id="s400">That's very important.</span> <span id="s401">You knew where you, who you belonged to.</span> <span id="s402">You knew where you stand and your life was organized.</span> <span id="s403">That's one way how you could cope with it.</span> <span id="s404">It was later on that I was completely abandoned and left all alone.</span> <span id="s405">That was a terrible time for me, but that came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q:Now, (technical conversation) where were your brothers at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A:Good question.</span> <span id="s408">My elder brother, who was ten years older than I was, escaped somehow from the ghetto and would, and went to the province hoping to find some work.</span> <span id="s409">He was already a married man and he had a boy five or six years old and he was hoping to find some work so that he could come back to the ghetto and somehow feed the family, but that was it.</span> <span id="s410">He went and he never came back.</span> <span id="s411">And I don't know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s412">Now, my younger brother was still in the ghetto too.</span> <span id="s413">And for a while he was working in a bakery, but then he joined a group or was sent to a group, I don't know exactly, but he was sent to a camp in Belzec.</span> <span id="s414">And we know what happened, later on I learned what happened in Belzec, but at that time I didn't know.</span> <span id="s415">I had some news from my cousins.</span> <span id="s416">Though, remember I told you that my uncle was killed in Katuszyn, and the children came back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s417">Later on I got a letter from one of the cousins saying that my brother, my younger brother, escaped from the, from the camp, from the labor camp and was working as a farm hand in a Polish farm, but that was it.</span> <span id="s418">I didn't hear from him, never again.</span> <span id="s419">You know after the war, we were going to the Jewish community in Praga and the survivors used to write down their names in hoping to find other survivors.</span> <span id="s420">And I was looking for my brothers.</span> <span id="s421">They were not on the list of the survivors.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">01:51:12</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q:What was life like in this kibbutz in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A:Well, it was, it was good, comparable to what was going on in other families.</span> <span id="s425">We kept ourselves clean, even though the premises were very limited, and we, we went to work like I said before.</span> <span id="s426">In the evenings and on shabbat, we used to gather and had discussions and had, you know, presentations by all kinds of literary men who used to come to the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s427">So, we were politically and intellectually active, in spite of the terrible conditions that existed in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q:How did you...you said you had, not a lot of food, but you were able to have three meals a day.</span> <span id="s429">Was there a system, how did you...how did you get stuff?</span> <span id="s430">How were you more comfortable than other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A:Well, you know every Jew had a right to certain food allotments, but we didn't go to the store individually.</span> <span id="s432">The, the coupons were collected by one person and through certain channels we were supplied with food.</span> <span id="s433">There was a party key, I think, a system according to which each youth organization was getting a certain amount of food.</span> <span id="s434">The amount was not enough to feed all the people in the kibbutz, especially that many other members of the organization used to come to the kibbutz who were not living in the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s435">They were living with their respective families, but they came to the kibbutz and many of them were already starving to death, too.</span> <span id="s436">So, we were sharing with, with the other members of Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s437">So, usually it was in the morning it was two slices of bread with some substitute marmalade and a bowl of soup.</span> <span id="s438">In the middle of the day there was another bowl of soup, usually the same kind of soup, and in the evening again, a piece of bread and soup.</span> <span id="s439">The soup was usually made out of groats, Kasha.</span> <span id="s440">And occasionally it was with some potatoes, very seldom a piece of fat to, you know, to make the soup richer.</span> <span id="s441">Very seldom a piece of butter or other kind of fat.</span> <span id="s442">And I remember the groats were of a special kind.</span> <span id="s443">They were coarsely grounded so the husks were swimming in the soup and in order to see, to eat the soup you had to separate the husks from the grains so you had a wreath around the plate, you know of the husks.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">01:54:37</span></p> <p><span id="s445">Q:Did you have a garden, did you have vegetables or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">A:Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s447">Maybe occasionally we got some vegetables, but it was not a daily menu.</span> <span id="s448">The daily menu was bread and soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q:Living...how many people were living on this kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A:I think it was about, around twenty people.</span> <span id="s451">I have in my memoirs the names of the people who lived in the kibbutz.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q:Was it different...you described that the work was different for the boys and the girls, but was it different living there as a girl in other ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A:No, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q:Did you all have jobs in that home to do certain things to help maintain it?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A:Sure, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s456">There were, the girls were assigned to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s457">Each week another girl would be the, the chief cook.</span> <span id="s458">For me it was a nightmare because I didn't have any experience in cooking and the stove was not in, in good working condition.</span> <span id="s459">It was usually very difficult to make it, you know, work.</span> <span id="s460">We didn't have the proper fuel.</span> <span id="s461">You know, in Poland, stoves are, you know, heated by coal and wood.</span> <span id="s462">Coal and wood was expensive, so it was a very hard task.</span> <span id="s463">And here I was in that kitchen, you know, with the big pot for so many people and the fire doesn't start, and the boys were going out in the middle of the night like at 3:00 a.m. So, I started to work around 12:00 at night, but even with all my efforts I sometimes didn't have the soup ready and it was an anguish for me.</span> <span id="s464">You know, I would come out and say, "zupa jeszcze nie gotowa", the soup isn't ready.</span> <span id="s465">It was a heartbreaking experience, because I was responsible for the people and they had to go to work without the soup.</span> <span id="s466">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q:So the women cooked, the girls cooked and the boys...what were, what were their jobs in the kibbutz?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A:Well, I don't think they had special jobs.</span> <span id="s469">You know, it's a commune.</span> <span id="s470">You live in a commune.</span> <span id="s471">You have, each person tries to, to accommodate you know the way of living.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q:I mean, did certain people have to go outside of the ghetto to try to bring in more food?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A:You couldn't get out of the ghetto without the permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">01:57:12</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q:Nobody could sneak out?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A:Well, you could sneak out, but you always ran the risk of being caught and shot.</span> <span id="s477">Because you know it was, the law said that you cannot...the German law...that you cannot leave the ghetto under the penalty of death.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q:You said you had intellectual discussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q:Did you have any fun?</span> <span id="s481">Was there music, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A:Yeah, we used to sing a lot.</span> <span id="s483">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q:So, in, in the midst of all this horrible situation, you were able to enjoy each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A:Definitely.</span> <span id="s486">And well, in my opinion it was like an oasis in that terrible ghetto, you know, which was nothing but...I would name it a cesspool of, of human, of humanity.</span> <span id="s487">The, the demise of people happened in such terrible conditions you know that for normally thinking people, I think it's still this very day a concept that they cannot even understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">01:58:58</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s490">02:01:05</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Q:Talking a little bit about your organization, your kibbutz within the ghetto, who were your leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">A:It was Mordechaj Anielewicz.</span> <span id="s493">It was Josef Kaplan.</span> <span id="s494">Szmuel Breslaw, these were the leaders.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q:What kind of guys were they?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A:Fantastic guys, fantastic.</span> <span id="s497">The best among the Jewish youth.</span> <span id="s498">Intellectual, it was a mission in their lives, you know.</span> <span id="s499">It was a commitment to a good life and, and above everything, to free the people from the status of being pariahs among other nations, and to lead the people to their homeland, to be people equal to other people.</span> <span id="s500">That was the main point.</span> <span id="s501">They were wonderful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q:Were there any women, girls who were also sort of leaders?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A:Oh sure, there were girls.</span> <span id="s504">Tosia Altman, Miriam Heinsdorf.</span> <span id="s505">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q:You said girls weren't really treated differently.</span> <span id="s507">I mean, we know that in all societies women are usually treated a little differently, but was there an equality, a sense of equality amongst you?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A:I don't get the question.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q:Well, in many societies, ours included, women generally, historically have had a different position than men.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A:No, I don't think that they were treated less...with less importance than the men.</span> <span id="s511">We were treated equally.</span> <span id="s512">A girl was equally privileged or underprivileged in certain situations just like the men.</span> <span id="s513">There was no, no notion of seeing the girls as less worthwhile or anything.</span> <span id="s514">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q:In these leaders that you mentioned were they a little bit older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A:Yeah, they were older.</span> <span id="s517">I was among the youngest.</span> <span id="s518">You see the group that came from Praga, I belonged to, to the youngest group.</span> <span id="s519">So, the leader, if I was at that time, what, 14, 15, 14 years old, and they were in their early twenties.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">Q:They were old guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A:They were old guys.</span> <span id="s522">Some of them, if somebody were 30 it was definitely old.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q:Were there other things that they told you that you can remember or guidance that they gave you.</span> <span id="s524">Were their plans, were their goals, other than to one day go to Palestine?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A:Look, when we came into the ghetto, we tried to maintain the same life style that we had before the ghetto, because we didn't know what the next day will bring.</span> <span id="s526">So, the only way to sustain ourselves was to cling on to the lifestyle that we had before, until the first news about mass killings came to the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s527">That was a break in the attitude.</span> <span id="s528">That was a change, that we didn't think about Palestine anymore.</span> <span id="s529">We had to think about self defense.</span> <span id="s530">When the realization that they, that they are about to annihilate us that, and the people in the youth organization, not only in ours, in the other youth organizations as well, realized they were the first to learn about it.</span> <span id="s531">You see, the first mass killings began, was the invasion of the Germans of the Soviet Union in June 1941.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">02:05:22 Along with the German army came the Einsatzgruppen, killing squads.</span> <span id="s533">Their only purpose was to kill Jews and communists, and that's when the first massacre occurred in Ponary, in a place near Vilna.</span> <span id="s534">It was in the same months when, when the occupation started, I mean when the German ____________ came into the east.</span> <span id="s535">Thousands of Jews were driven to these previously dug out graves and they were machine gunned.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q:How did you find out about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A:Well, good question.</span> <span id="s538">Like I said, we were a scout organization and we had good connections with the Polish scout organization.</span> <span id="s539">And Irena Adamowicz was a good friend of Hashomer Hatzair, and she suggested that one of her acquaintances in this Polish scout organization would go to Vilna and find out what...we didn't know what happened in, in Vilna yet, until this delegate, his name was Henryk Grabewski, he went on a bike from Warsaw to Vilna and when he came, the idea was to get in touch with the, with our members of Hashomer Hatzair in Vilna.</span> <span id="s540">But when he came and got in touch with the people, he learned what happened to the Jews of Vilna.</span> <span id="s541">And when he came back, and told us about this, we were the first to realize that the Germans mean business, business of killing the whole Jewish nation.</span> <span id="s542">You see, the Germans didn't come out straight and said we are going to kill you all.</span> <span id="s543">It was a step by step process.</span> <span id="s544">The annihilation, if you summarize this you can see it in, in four major steps like the writer Raul Hilberg so eloquently put it.</span> <span id="s545">He pointed out there were four major steps in the annihilation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s546">There was identification, expropriation, ghettoization, and finally annihilation.</span> <span id="s547">First you mark the Jews.</span> <span id="s548">You put a "J" for Jew, Jude, into your passport.</span> <span id="s549">You put on an armband, or a yellow star on your garb and you are right away separated from the non-Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">02:08:45 Then your property is taking away from you.</span> <span id="s551">Your bank accounts, your, your factories, your, your real estate.</span> <span id="s552">Everything.</span> <span id="s553">Then you are herded into a ghetto, you are concentrated.</span> <span id="s554">And finally from this concentrated places you are being driven to the death camps.</span> <span id="s555">But this was a process which took years, it took months.</span> <span id="s556">You had, they had to organize transports and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s557">It was a big business.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q:When you got this information that Jews were being massacred, do you remember the dialog amongst your group and with your leaders at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A:Well, I was too young to be included in these discussions, but I remember that one day we were explained that we have to defend ourselves, that the Germans are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s560">And this was a concept for me as a young girl which it couldn't get through my skull because why?</span> <span id="s561">You know, I remember a discussion that I had with my uncle, my other uncle, I had two uncles in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s562">And when I came to talk to him I said, "Uncle, they are going to kill us off."</span> <span id="s563">And he said, "Girl, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s564">They don't kill people for nothing.</span> <span id="s565">They kill only trespassers of the law.</span> <span id="s566">As long as you remain in the framework of law, nothing can happen to you."</span> <span id="s567">That was the concept, you know, that existed among Jews before they finally realized that, that they are going to be, you know, exterminated.</span> <span id="s568">I'm hesitant to use the word exterminated.</span> <span id="s569">Elie Wiesel in one of his articles made a good point in my opinion.</span> <span id="s570">He said, "Only vermin are exterminated.</span> <span id="s571">People are being murdered."</span></p> <p><span id="s572">02:11:21 Well, the point is that the Germans considered the Jews as vermin.</span> <span id="s573">You see, in order to kill people the killers have to be motivated to do it and in order to be able to kill so many people, you know, we talk about killing so many people.</span> <span id="s574">People cannot understand that it was an enormous task to do.</span> <span id="s575">You can not get away with killing millions of people right away.</span> <span id="s576">And, the killers had to be properly prepared to that task.</span> <span id="s577">And one of the points that enabled them to do it was the process of dehumanizing the Jews to instill in the killers the idea that the Jews are not people.</span> <span id="s578">They are vermin.</span> <span id="s579">They are dangerous, just like rats and lice and roaches are dangerous.</span> <span id="s580">That's how, that's why we have to get rid of them, because they step on the moral fiber of the German nation.</span> <span id="s581">And in order to preserve the integrity of the German nation, we have to get rid of this vermins.</span> <span id="s582">That's how they could do the job.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q:Let's get back to you, your story.</span> <span id="s584">So, after you got, I understand that after you got this information it was a real turning point in psychology and, and operations in a way?</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q:Did they start training you for self defense at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A:Well, training, it's a big word because you see the idea of self defense in the Warsaw ghetto was born much earlier than the, the uprising, you know.</span> <span id="s588">The uprising took place in '43, but the idea was born from the moment when we learned about Ponary, about Babi Yar, which took place in September '41, and we learned also from that courier, from that Polish courier that there is a group of young Jewish people who organized themselves in a partisan organization to fight the Germans, to defend themselves.</span> <span id="s589">The FBO, an organization.</span> <span id="s590">So, this idea swept to the Warsaw ghetto and we...we, by we I mean the youth organization...started to, to the nucleus of a self defense operation.</span> <span id="s591">There was the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">02:14:48 You know, at the time, when the first mass deportations from the Warsaw ghetto began in July 22, 1942, there was already the, the nucleus of the defense organization among Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q:OK, but I want to know while you were there, were you, were people starting to try to get weapons.</span> <span id="s594">Did they teach you certain things about how to protect yourself?</span> <span id="s595">Did you talk about going to the forest versus staying in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">A:Look, I left the Warsaw ghetto in late summer or early fall '41.</span> <span id="s597">So, I was not in the Warsaw ghetto anymore when the Jewish fighting organization was organized.</span> <span id="s598">I was at that time on that farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q:Right, but when, what I'm asking is, when you got information about Vilna, about Ponary, you were still in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q:Oh, you were not even in the, you were out already?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q:OK, so, what you're talking about is the spirit and the mentality of what was going on in the ghetto, but you at this point were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q:OK, I just wanted to clarify that.</span> <span id="s606">Before you tell me about the farm, I'd like to learn a little bit more about the rest of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s607">That there was an organizational structure, I believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A:You mean the Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A:Well, you know the ghetto was ruled by the Judenrat, by the Jewish council, which was appointed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s611">And it was an instrument in the German hands to, you know, to enforce all the laws that the Germans wanted to implement into the Jewish community.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">02:17:03 And at the beginning, the attitude to the Judenrat was people didn't know what to figure out, you know, what to make out of it.</span> <span id="s613">After all this was the only official presentation of the Jewish community, and they were the distributor of food.</span> <span id="s614">They were, you know, providing all these services needed in any community like health services, burial services and work.</span> <span id="s615">And, the big change, the attitude towards the Judenrat change was the first expulsion from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s616">After that, you know, when it became obvious that the Jews driven out from the ghetto are being killed, so this was the turning point in the whole existence of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q:When are you talking about, what period?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A:Well, it was like I said the first mass deportation from the Warsaw ghetto was in '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q:While you were in there did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A:I wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q:No, I know that, but while you were in the ghetto did you, were you aware of the Judenrat, did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A:Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q:Did you know any of those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A:Not personally.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q:What was your impression?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A:It was, it was the institution in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q:Were they fair?</span> <span id="s628">Did they try to help people in need?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A:Yeah, they tried to help people, within their framework, you know.</span> <span id="s630">Everything was within the rules prescribed by the Germans.</span> <span id="s631">You see, the, the Judenrat, the policy was to appease the Germans.</span> <span id="s632">The policy was, that the ideas by the leaders of the Judenrat was like my uncles, as long as you stay in the framework of law, you, you have a chance of surviving, which turned out to be false later on.</span> <span id="s633">But at the beginning neither the members of the Judenrat or the, or the regular population didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s634">You see, the Germans were, were lying all the time to the Jews.</span> <span id="s635">They were purposely deceiving them.</span> <span id="s636">You know, the Germans are known as an orderly people.</span> <span id="s637">Everything has to be done orderly according to their rules.</span> <span id="s638">And one of the rules was to keep the Jews in the dark, because if you don't, there will be panic.</span> <span id="s639">And it's much more difficult to, to handle a panicky situation than you can handle an orderly situation.</span> <span id="s640">Let me add one word.</span> <span id="s641">In order to, to maintain this principle, the Judenrat had at their disposal the Jewish police, you know, the Ordentlich.</span> <span id="s642">And that was a terrible thing because by terrible thing I mean that the Germans succeeded to make the Jews participating in the process of killing Jews.</span> <span id="s643">You see, I don't know if I expressed myself well.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">02:20:53 The idea, the German idea was to involve the Jews in the process of extermination and they succeeded, and the Jewish police were participating because they were the one who were rounding up the people to send them to the death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q:Now, I still want to stick with the time that you were in the ghetto, so that's about a nine month period or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q:OK, and just within that time and what you knew then, in some of the reading I've done, I understand that there was a lot clandestine activity in terms of social services, cultural activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A:Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q:Did you...what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A:Well, like you say, there was a lot of activities, you know.</span> <span id="s651">People, first of all, all the youth organizations were very active.</span> <span id="s652">In addition to this you know, people were trying, like I said before, they were trying to hang on to the, to the way of life they had before they came to the ghetto and to a certain extent they succeeded in it.</span> <span id="s653">There were organizations, there were cultural organizations.</span> <span id="s654">Of course, schooling even was going on in a clandestine form because you were not allowed to have open schools.</span> <span id="s655">But schools were existing, and, you know, even high schools and elementary schools, even universities.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q:Did you go to any concerts or theater, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A:Personally I didn't, but other people did.</span> <span id="s658">I mean, you see my existence in the ghetto was limited by the living in the kibbutz and going occasionally to my father and my grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q:Were people, in trying to lead a normal life, were boys meeting girls were...?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s661">Life has its rules you know, under all conditions people have basic needs and by basic needs I don't mean only the physical needs, right, emotional and cultural needs too.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q:Did you have a boyfriend at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A:Yeah, I had, I had a boyfriend, but well, it was puppy love.</span> <span id="s664">I must tell you we lived in a commune.</span> <span id="s665">Boys and girls, but there was no sexual activity.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q:Was that a rule or just...?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A:Yes, it was a rule.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">02:23:42</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q:Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A:Why?</span> <span id="s671">Because that was the way our moral principles told us.</span> <span id="s672">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q:Did you feel safe in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A:I can't answer that question.</span> <span id="s675">It was later on when I tried to make it on the Aryan side that sometimes the existence in the ghetto gave you more security than to be on the outside.</span> <span id="s676">But when I was in the Warsaw ghetto it was still the ghetto.</span> <span id="s677">You see, there was...the Warsaw ghetto had a different picture before the first expulsion and after the first expulsion.</span> <span id="s678">It changed dramatically.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q:OK, but what, so while you were there, were there any roundups or killings or any, any sense of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A:Of course.</span> <span id="s681">I mean the Germans used to come and round up people who were politically suspect and to my astonishment and to my disappointment I have to say that there were Jews who were, you know, in the services of the German Gestapo and they were denouncing Jews.</span> <span id="s682">That's how, you know, our leaders were rounded up.</span> <span id="s683">Josef Kaplan and Szmuel Breslaw, were killed in the ghetto because they were denounced and the Germans came and killed them.</span> <span id="s684">And there were killings...for any transgression you, you were killed because that was the only penalty the Jews deserved.</span> <span id="s685">There was only one penalty, killing you.</span> <span id="s686">For any transgression, even for without transgressions.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q:Did you see people being hurt or being beaten?</span> <span id="s688">Did you see any of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A:In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A:No, but I saw people you know, starving.</span> <span id="s692">The street was strong with starving people, dead corpses.</span> <span id="s693">That's what I saw.</span> <span id="s694">I came out, you know, going to work in the morning I had my sandwich with me and it was torn out from my hand by, by another starving person.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">02:26:40</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q:Was there any relationship between your organization and either other organizations or the adult community?</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s698">Sure, the youth organizations were cooperating with each other, of course.</span> <span id="s699">And the youth organizations had also political parties.</span> <span id="s700">We didn't, but others did.</span> <span id="s701">So there was a cooperation.</span> <span id="s702">The people brought into the ghetto the relationships from before the war.</span> <span id="s703">Their affiliations to political parties or to some cultural organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q:Is there anything else you can think of to tell me about the ghetto, and if not then I'll ask you about your next...</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A:Well, the Warsaw ghetto was described in so many ways that it seems, to me, futile to repeat it.</span> <span id="s706">Only, what I can tell you the most outstanding features in the Warsaw ghetto, when I was there, were hunger and typhus.</span> <span id="s707">People were dying at, at an incredible rate every single day.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q:So, it was decided that several of you would leave for this farm, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A:More than seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q:No, I said several.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A:Several, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q:And this was...when did you decided to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A:This was late '41, like September '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q:OK.</span> <span id="s715">You started to tell me before that you were going to get on a train which left the ghetto.</span> <span id="s716">Why don't you tell me how you got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A:Well, I told you already, I jumped into a street cart, and the guy who was with me Amnon Klukowski, he jumped first, extended his hand to me and I grabbed his hand and I jumped into the running street car.</span> <span id="s718">I was young then.</span> <span id="s719">I wasn't looking then like I look today.</span> <span id="s720">I, I hurt my knees by doing it, but we came through the ghetto.</span> <span id="s721">We removed our arm bands and we get off the car as soon as we could.</span> <span id="s722">As soon as we found ourselves on the Aryan side because we, we, you didn't know who the people in the street cart were.</span> <span id="s723">They could denounce you or they could keep their mouths shut but you never know so it was safer to get off and to walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">02:29:39 I must say that some of the Polish street car drivers were nice and cooperative and understanding because sometimes they would slow down the pace of the running cart so that people could jump into.</span> <span id="s725">It was at that time mostly for smuggling purposes, you see, you got out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s726">You buy, bought some food over there and you tried to smuggle in back, into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s727">But we were not smuggling, we were just smuggling ourselves out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q:So, after you got off of the street car, what did the two of you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A:Well, we start walking, and a group of Polish youngsters came after us and you know, "Hey Jews from the ghetto, hey Jews from the ghetto."</span> <span id="s730">But Amnon, my companion, succeeded in chasing them off and nothing, no harm came to us at that point.</span> <span id="s731">The real dangerous point was at the railway station, when you came to the railway station, which was, you know, crawling with, with people waiting for Jews.</span> <span id="s732">We called them shmaltzovniks.</span> <span id="s733">There were people you know the scum of the Polish society who made it a profession to hunt down Jews and you know, live on, on this ransom money, whatever they could take from them, money, jewelry whatever.</span> <span id="s734">And sometimes it ended up in only taking their possessions away, but sometimes they took their possessions away and denounced them to the Germans.</span> <span id="s735">So, when we came to that railway station, it was swarming with shmaltovniks, and one came up to us and said hey, don't be in such a hurry, where are you going you Jew Boy.</span> <span id="s736">But Amnon had the right attitude and he started, you know, to answer him in a foul Polish language because that's how you could get rid of them.</span> <span id="s737">And we finally succeeded to get on the train in the last moment.</span> <span id="s738">Again jumping on the already moving out from the, from the station.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q:Let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s740">I guess you were about 16 at the time.</span> <span id="s741">Do you remember whether this was kind of exciting, an adventure?</span> <span id="s742">Were you afraid, you know, what your mood was... when you were leaving the ghetto to go the next place?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">02:32:32</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A:Well, first of all when I found myself outside the ghetto it was a tremendous feeling of, of relief, you know to be again on normal streets, you know.</span> <span id="s745">To walk like, again like a normal person.</span> <span id="s746">Not to walk among dead people or people confined to be dead.</span> <span id="s747">The sun was shining, you know.</span> <span id="s748">It was an exhilarating experience, you know.</span> <span id="s749">Boy, you know, when you are young you want to live and it, I enjoyed very much the sense of being free again, even for a short while, but that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q:So you jumped on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A:Yeah, and we came to Zloty Potok.</span> <span id="s752">Zloty Potok is a station that you had, had to get off and you had to walk some twenty some kilometers to the farm.</span> <span id="s753">It's in the area of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s754">So we came there and we were like twenty some people on that farm.</span> <span id="s755">Each pair had another story to tell when they came, you know, how they succeeded in getting out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s756">But soon it was already full and soon there was not much work to do on the farm so, and people need to eat.</span> <span id="s757">We couldn't sustain all the people from the work on the farm, so the majority of the group went to Czestochowa, and they established a kibbutz there on Berka Joselewieza One, in the ghetto of Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s758">There was a group of five people who remained on the farm to keep the farm hoping that next summer we'll be able to resume our activities, and I was among the group who stayed on the farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q:Who owned this farm?</span> <span id="s760">How did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A:The farm before the war belonged to, it was on a territory owned by a Jew called Praszker.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">02:35:03 There was a big factory.</span> <span id="s763">I think they were producing, what is it...bricks, and Josef Kaplan one of our leaders succeeded in, in arranging, in arranging for us that we could come to that place and actually create the farm.</span> <span id="s764">We created it, you know.</span> <span id="s765">Why a farm and not any other kind of employment, because you see, as a, as a youth organization, as a Zionist organization, even before the war we prepared ourselves to refarm workers to live on a kibbutz in, in later Israel, so that's what we wanted to do.</span> <span id="s766">We had kibbutzim even before the war on farms, and this was one of the farms that we created in that small community.</span> <span id="s767">We had a cow.</span> <span id="s768">We had a horse.</span> <span id="s769">We had some goats and some sheep and we had the fields.</span> <span id="s770">We were, we were growing potatoes.</span> <span id="s771">We had some, we had an orchard with plums.</span> <span id="s772">We had, we planted some vegetables and we were hoping, you know, first of all to nourish ourselves and maybe to sell some of that.</span> <span id="s773">But like I said, it was late in the summer and we couldn't sustain all the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q:Now in a way, certainly compared to where you came from, it sounds somewhat idyllic, it sounds very nice, a pastoral existence.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A:Oh boy, it was such a relief, you know.</span> <span id="s776">It was such a difference, you know.</span> <span id="s777">You came out from hell, again into a normal life, you know, because you see in very small communities like Zarki there was no ghetto.</span> <span id="s778">So until the Jews were driven into extermination camps they lived normal lives.</span> <span id="s779">And when we came to that community it was appalling to us how people were living in their own homes, doing their businesses like usual, eating normal meals and we came from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s780">You know, glodomory is the Polish word for, for starving people.</span> <span id="s781">And the first thinking was to eat.</span> <span id="s782">We were unsatiable, you know.</span> <span id="s783">So, the, the local Jews, especially members of the local Hashomer Hatzair organization, they were coming to the farm and helping us out.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q:Did you have any contact with the local Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A:Where, in the farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q:In this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A:Well, our neighbors were Poles and we had good relations with them.</span> <span id="s788">Our next door neighbor, his name was Wesoly and they were okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">02:38:22</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q:And you felt safe there?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q:How did you...now, there were five of you who stayed on?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q:How did you all spend your time?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A:Well, one of them soon joined the kibbutz in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s796">Actually we were left four people.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q:Who were...can you name them?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A:Sure, those four that remained, it was Amnon Klukowski, Chagit Elster, Abraham Silberstein, who later became my husband, and myself.</span> <span id="s799">And Abraham, you see we had to, to sustain ourselves so how are we going to make it through the winter.</span> <span id="s800">We got some allotments from the Judenrat in Zarki.</span> <span id="s801">It was a very primitive Judenrat because the community was small.</span> <span id="s802">We got some bread from them and that was already good.</span> <span id="s803">We still had some vegetables from the crop that we collected at the fall, so for, for the first months of winter we had something to eat.</span> <span id="s804">And Abraham Silberstein engaged himself as a helper to a smuggler.</span> <span id="s805">You see that farm was close to the border, was the Reich, was the Polish territory annex to the German Reich.</span> <span id="s806">It was easy to cross the border and to smuggle some food.</span> <span id="s807">So, he was doing it.</span> <span id="s808">First of all, to, to get, earn some money.</span> <span id="s809">First of all, we also had to take care of the animals.</span> <span id="s810">They had to eat too.</span> <span id="s811">So, that was one way to survive that winter.</span> <span id="s812">It was a very severe winter, I remember from.</span> <span id="s813">Was from '41 to '42, and I fell sick with typhus and that water.</span> <span id="s814">You see, we had some Jews living on, next to the farm and we came to visit them and they were in a very poor and very dirty -- and evidently some of the lice traveled from them to me and I got sick and I was very close to death because typhus is a terrible disease.</span> <span id="s815">You either make it through or you don't.</span> <span id="s816">I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">02:41:02</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q:Was there a doctor nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A:Yeah, there was doctor nearby which he couldn't do much, you know it's...</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q:Did you all have...I know I asked you this before but I'm just curious, did you have certain responsibilities that were yours that you took care of on this farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A:The responsibilities were very limited.</span> <span id="s822">They were limited to, to, to survive.</span> <span id="s823">You know a person needs to eat.</span> <span id="s824">Normal people eat three times a day.</span> <span id="s825">Where are you going to take the food from.</span> <span id="s826">That was the first concern.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q:So, there was no division of responsibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A:No, no.</span> <span id="s829">We just tried...and during that winter we had visitors from our leaders in Warsaw and that's when the idea of self defense was instilled in us.</span> <span id="s830">They were already acquainted with what happened in, in the territories occupied by the Soviets.</span> <span id="s831">And they told us the terrible truth that's awaiting us and that we have to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s832">So, how are we going to defend ourselves?</span> <span id="s833">To defend means to have weapons.</span> <span id="s834">Where do you take the weapons from, you know.</span> <span id="s835">We didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s836">Even if we could find some dealers and clandestine weapons.</span> <span id="s837">We didn't have the money to buy the weapons so what we did is we equipped ourselves with knives, whatever we had.</span> <span id="s838">It, it was a determination among our groups, they are not going to take us alive.</span> <span id="s839">We will fight, whatever we can.</span> <span id="s840">With some vitriole, with some knives, whatever we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q:I think, you, did you have some contact with Arieh Wilner?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q:Was that at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s845">Arieh Wilner came to the farm in the spring of 1942.</span> <span id="s846">He was on his way to Bendzin, which was a Polish city incorporated into the Reich.</span> <span id="s847">His aim was to spread the idea of self defense in those communities too.</span> <span id="s848">And it was Arieh who brought the idea of self defense to our group.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">Q:What kind of a man was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A:A fantastic man.</span> <span id="s851">He was so handsome and so...you know, I couldn't help being infatuated with him, you know.</span> <span id="s852">I fell in love with him and we had precious moments, you know, together...no sex...but still very, very nice moments and then he went to Bendzin.</span> <span id="s853">I saw him later in the Warsaw ghetto because I rejoined the Warsaw ghetto later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">02:44:41</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Q:How, so, how long did you stay on this farm?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A:Well, from more or less from September '41 till May '42.</span> <span id="s857">In May '42 we had to leave the farm because the situation was changed.</span> <span id="s858">The idea that the Germans are going to kill us was spread already among the young Jewish youth organizations.</span> <span id="s859">It became one of the factors in our lives and there was no need already to be on the farm.</span> <span id="s860">Besides we couldn't exist.</span> <span id="s861">We couldn't sustain ourselves.</span> <span id="s862">So, the rest of us, the four of us joined the group in the Czestochowa ghetto and the kibbutz.</span> <span id="s863">We joined the kibbutz and we were there in the kibbutz till September '42.</span> <span id="s864">While I was in the kibbutz in Czestochowa, I was working on one of the farms, which before the war belonged to the youth organizations.</span> <span id="s865">And at that time, the first Akcja, the first deportation from the Warsaw ghetto took place and we had the first escapees from the Warsaw ghetto coming to our place in the ghetto Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s866">At that time, I was supplied with a false birth certificate and it was decided that I should leave the ghetto and go to the Aryan side and be a courier, or be, you know, a link to someone on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s867">And I went with Tosia Altman and a group of young girls who were even younger than I was.</span> <span id="s868">But they escaped from the ghetto and Tosia picked them up and brought them to Czestochowa because where could you run.</span> <span id="s869">You could run from one ghetto to another ghetto.</span> <span id="s870">I went out from the Czestochowa ghetto.</span> <span id="s871">I came back to the farm, which was deserted by that time, with a young girl there.</span> <span id="s872">I met Tosia Altman with the young girls from the ghetto, and we all went to the ghetto in Krakow.</span> <span id="s873">You see, the idea was that you ran from one ghetto to another and especially to another ghetto which had already a deportation Akcja or operation, whatever the English word would be for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">02:47:57 Because after a while...you see, if a ghetto was big and the number of Jews was large they couldn't take them all at one time, you know.</span> <span id="s875">Even if you could put on a train 500 or 600 Jews you have to do it piecemeal.</span> <span id="s876">So, usually after the first deportation there was relatively, a time of relative peace before you knew that they will come again.</span> <span id="s877">So, we were running to those ghettos that had already these Akcja.</span> <span id="s878">And we came to the ghetto of Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q:What was your, when you say that they thought that you may be able to serve as a courier, what was your job?</span> <span id="s880">What kind of information were you passing?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A:It was not information at that time.</span> <span id="s882">My first task was to take care of these young girls and bring them to a safer place.</span> <span id="s883">Safer was a relative notion, but at that moment, Krakow was safer than Warsaw, you know.</span> <span id="s884">Warsaw was in the throes of the expulsion.</span> <span id="s885">The operation in Warsaw lasted two months, you know.</span> <span id="s886">From July to September or October, the beginning of October.</span> <span id="s887">That was my first task, to take these girls and in case we were interrogated, I would have this paper, this birth certificate that I am Polish.</span> <span id="s888">That was my first task.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q:When you were sent out from Czestochowa, did, did you have any either ambivalence about leaving the other people who now you were very close with, I assume, or any fear of going out somewhat on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A:Sure.</span> <span id="s891">I was already very close to Abraham Silberstein who later on became my husband.</span> <span id="s892">It was very hard for me to part with him.</span> <span id="s893">And it was hard to part with the other girls.</span> <span id="s894">We liked each other very much.</span> <span id="s895">It was a very good spirit reigning among us, you know, real friendship.</span> <span id="s896">I haven't experienced this warmth of good relationship ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">02:50:39 It was hard for me to separate myself from them, but on the other hand, I was, I was exhilarated, it was a chance for me to get out from the ghetto.</span> <span id="s898">Instinctively, you felt that you had much more chances outside the ghetto than inside, you know.</span> <span id="s899">A lot depended on your instincts at that time.</span> <span id="s900">Sure, but, you said whether I fear to go, you asked me if I..</span> <span id="s901">.</span> <span id="s902">of course, I feared.</span> <span id="s903">Fear was the constant feeling that accompanied me since the war began until the war ended.</span> <span id="s904">You live in constant fear.</span> <span id="s905">Day by day, week after week, month after month, year after year.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q:I don't know much about Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s907">Was that when...you lived there for a few months, I guess?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q:What was that like as compared to when you were living in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A:Well, it was like the same thing only on a smaller scale, you know.</span> <span id="s911">The pattern was the same, you know.</span> <span id="s912">You lived in a commune.</span> <span id="s913">You went to work.</span> <span id="s914">You tried to conduct some cultural activities but, you know, the danger of being deported was hanging over us like the Demoelitus sword.</span> <span id="s915">After what happened in Warsaw we knew it was going to happen in other places and we were informed, as a matter of fact the youth organizations were much, more, much better informed than regular Jews.</span> <span id="s916">So, that was, you know, it changed the whole attitude to what was going on, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q:Was this a closed ghetto like the Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s918">02:53:03</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A:Sure, it was closed but it wasn't so heavily guarded as the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s920">The Warsaw ghetto was surrounded by a big brick wall ten feet high topped with crushed glass and there were fourteen gates leading into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s921">At each gate you had three policemen, a German, a Polish and a Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s922">So, you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s923">But in Czestochowa it wasn't so terrible, there was no wall against the ghetto.</span> <span id="s924">There were streets assigned to be the ghetto.</span> <span id="s925">If you had the courage to go to, to the non-Jewish part you could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: And did you do the same kind of work there as before like helping out in someone's home.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A:No, I was working on the farm.</span> <span id="s928">I was assigned to a brigade who was, the task of the brigade was to collect, what would be the English word...caterpillars.</span> <span id="s929">We were assigned to a field where they were growing cabbage and the cabbage was infested by, by worms and there were caterpillars all over the, the cabbage beds.</span> <span id="s930">Our task was to collect these things.</span> <span id="s931">They smelled terribly and you had to collect them and many of them were squashed under your hands, you know.</span> <span id="s932">I described it in more detail in my memoirs.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q:When it was decided that you were going to get Polish papers, did anybody talk to you about how you might have to act differently or did they teach you certain things, how to cross yourself, anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A:No.</span> <span id="s935">The idea was only...the idea that was transmitted to us is that from now on you have to defend yourself.</span> <span id="s936">The Germans are going to kill us.</span> <span id="s937">Defend yourself in any way you can.</span> <span id="s938">Don't be direct to the, to the umschlagplatz, which was, you know, the assembly place in Warsaw or in any other ghetto.</span> <span id="s939">Don't go to these trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q:But that was basically all the direction you were given?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A:Yes, and I was given a false birth certificate which was, you know, it was like a ticket to life.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q:Do you know how they got it?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A:Yes, they were in contact with some people who were manufacturing these birth certificates.</span> <span id="s944">The problem only was that on that certificate I was three years older than I really was.</span> <span id="s945">So, I had sometimes trouble with look my age.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q:So, your first mission was to take these girls to Krakow?</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q:How long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A:For a few weeks, not too long.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">02:56:32</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q:What was the life like there by comparison?</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A:It was the same thing like in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s953">Hunger, typhus, desolation, on top of everything our group became illegal.</span> <span id="s954">By illegal I mean we were not local Jews.</span> <span id="s955">We were coming from another city, and it was the task of the Jewish police in Krakow to round up all these illegal Jews.</span> <span id="s956">Evidently they had to report to the German authorities how many Jews they have in the ghetto and they had to, to give exact numbers.</span> <span id="s957">So, we were illegals and they were hunting us so we were hiding.</span> <span id="s958">In the ghetto we were hiding.</span> <span id="s959">I was put in some attic, you know, and kept there for days in a row without being even able to go to the, to the rest room, or, you know, being delivered food like to, to a pet or animal, you know.</span> <span id="s960">And in a very short time, we became infected by lice.</span> <span id="s961">We were dirty.</span> <span id="s962">We were smelly, hungry, desolate.</span> <span id="s963">And the, I decided that we have to run again because we couldn't live there.</span> <span id="s964">You know, a paradoxical situation arose, even in the Jewish ghetto, we were illegal.</span> <span id="s965">We couldn't even stay in the Krakov ghetto unless we were ready to die there on that attic.</span> <span id="s966">So, we decided to run and we ran to a ghetto in Tarnow, which just had an Aktion.</span> <span id="s967">And we came over there.</span> <span id="s968">I will never forget the sight over there.</span> <span id="s969">It was, you know, like after a real pogrom, you know.</span> <span id="s970">Households, the doors open, broken glass, pillow cases ripped up and, you know, the feathers in the air.</span> <span id="s971">Domestic utensils spread all over the place.</span> <span id="s972">People in hiding, those who succeeded not to be rounded up.</span> <span id="s973">And they were not even hostile towards us.</span> <span id="s974">They were indifferent.</span> <span id="s975">You know, it was, an inhumane situation already existed there.</span> <span id="s976">The relations between people were not already normal.</span> <span id="s977">They were not human relations any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">02:59:37</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Tape #3</span></p> <p><span id="s980">03:01:00</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q:When we stopped, you were talking about what it was like arriving in Tarnow after an Aktion.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A:Well it was a terrible sight you know.</span> <span id="s983">It was, desolation everywhere, you know.</span> <span id="s984">The people that we met were scared and suspicious and not willing to talk to us.</span> <span id="s985">Even like, it didn't matter to them anything because they were at the brink of an abyss and that changes the psychology of a person.</span> <span id="s986">You stopped caring about others.</span> <span id="s987">You stopped caring about anything.</span> <span id="s988">I saw the people, young people having sex almost publicly.</span> <span id="s989">And I asked one of them later on, why would you do that and he said, "Well, I don't know if I'll live tomorrow.</span> <span id="s990">I want to taste life what it is like before I go to, to die."</span> <span id="s991">To make a long story short, the, the atmosphere was macabre.</span> <span id="s992">To me I couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s993">I couldn't stay there another day.</span> <span id="s994">There was no where for me to go.</span> <span id="s995">I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s996">The girls got attached to some groups and they didn't want to go with me anymore, only one girl went with me, Julcia Fiks, Ester.</span> <span id="s997">Julcia was her clandestine name.</span> <span id="s998">Her real name was Ester Fiks.</span> <span id="s999">She came with me and we ran back to the Krakow ghetto.</span> <span id="s1000">The situation didn't improve in the Krakow ghetto, and that's when I decided that I will run away from the ghetto into the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1001">I had no contact with my Hashomer Hatzair people anymore.</span> <span id="s1002">I had no money, maybe a few zlotys, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">I had no food.</span> <span id="s1004">I had no place to live.</span> <span id="s1005">On top of everything, I heard stories like other Jewish girls escaped from the ghetto into the Aryan side and they were scooped up and killed.</span> <span id="s1006">In spite of all this, in spite of these rumors, I decided to do it because it became obvious to me that I will sooner or later be scooped up by the Jewish police and handed over to the Germans and sent away, and I didn't want that to happen because I knew what happened to scooped up Jews.</span> <span id="s1007">So, I one day joined the working brigade going from the ghetto to work on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1008">At a suitable moment, I detached myself from that group, take off my, took off my armband and I had this false birth certificate in my pocket and, viola, I was a Polish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">03:04:26 There was no where to go, no place, no money, no contacts, no where.</span> <span id="s1010">So, for hours I was walking the streets aimlessly just walking, until I could make some decision.</span> <span id="s1011">I remember I came, I came to a church and went into the church and it was very soothing.</span> <span id="s1012">The inside was cool and so quiet.</span> <span id="s1013">It was a temporary relief, you know from all the horrible sights that I saw.</span> <span id="s1014">But I had to make a decision what to do with myself because there was a curfew time, you know, after seven or eight in the evening, I don't recollect exactly, nobody was to be found on the streets and I had to make a decision before that time.</span> <span id="s1015">So, in spite of the rumors that I heard about Jewish girls being killed, I went to a German hospital and I offered my services.</span> <span id="s1016">I was asking if they need some help.</span> <span id="s1017">They told me that they are not the hiring office, that if I want to apply I should go to a certain place on a certain street.</span> <span id="s1018">They gave me the number, and I went there from the hospital to that office and I had that conversation with the hiring woman.</span> <span id="s1019">And she hired me.</span> <span id="s1020">Well, I should add that I made myself as presentable as I could, you know, after that existence in the ghetto, you know.</span> <span id="s1021">I was still in a very poor physical shape.</span> <span id="s1022">And, you know, I was dirty and I didn't even have a place where to wash up.</span> <span id="s1023">But somehow I succeeded to make a good impression on that interviewing woman.</span> <span id="s1024">She gave me the job and I said when can I report to work.</span> <span id="s1025">She said if you want you can come tomorrow.</span> <span id="s1026">So, I went and I became a member of the, of the staff of that German hospital.</span> <span id="s1027">It was on Marka, Swistego Marka Street in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">03:06:58 And I was assigned to the kitchen as a kitchen helper, kitchen help, and I was working there, cleaning the vegetables and it was a very hard time for me because all of a sudden I had to become a Polish girl with all the Polish mannerism, which I didn't have.</span> <span id="s1029">One thing stood in my favor was the Polish language.</span> <span id="s1030">I was in very good command of the language.</span> <span id="s1031">So, at least they couldn't suspect me right away.</span> <span id="s1032">You, see that was an impediment for many, many Jews.</span> <span id="s1033">That even if they spoke Polish, they didn't spoke a pure Polish.</span> <span id="s1034">There was always a Jewish accent in it and the Poles could detect you right away.</span> <span id="s1035">The Germans couldn't, but the Poles could.</span> <span id="s1036">So, I was working there for some time and it was very hard for me because the women in that group of kitchen helpers, they were churlish and their language was foul.</span> <span id="s1037">Each time I heard them talk, I was red in the face, you know.</span> <span id="s1038">I was a young girl with no sexual experience, and here I was among women who were prostitutes, who were mostly maids who worked previously before the war in Jewish households.</span> <span id="s1039">The very lowest levels of Polish society, but somehow I managed to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">03:09:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q:I have a question.</span> <span id="s1042">When you said you had to become a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1043">Other than the language, what did that involve?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A:It involved everything would detract you from being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1045">You had to assume a role of a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1046">It was a very hard task.</span> <span id="s1047">I felt all these years from the moment when I went on, this, the Aryan side, I felt like an actor on a stage, playing a role which I hated, but I had to do it in order not to be detected.</span> <span id="s1048">You had to acquire the, the way of talking, the way of behaving.</span> <span id="s1049">You had to learn the Polish prayers, which I managed and which I remember to this very day.</span> <span id="s1050">You, you had to hide your, your grief and your sadness.</span> <span id="s1051">You had to be frivolous, you had to be like other Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1052">I just had to simulate the behavior of the Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1053">And I had good examples in front of me.</span> <span id="s1054">And still I was detected by one of the girls and she denounced me to the, to the German.</span> <span id="s1055">When we came for our weekly pay, she said to the officer, this is a Jew.</span> <span id="s1056">And the German asked me, "Are you Jude?</span> <span id="s1057">," are you Jewish.</span> <span id="s1058">I said, no, I said, she is.</span> <span id="s1059">So, you know, he understood that it was a joke and besides he was a simple clerk.</span> <span id="s1060">It wasn't his task to, to handle Jews.</span> <span id="s1061">He took it like, you know, a bad joke or a good joke.</span> <span id="s1062">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1063">He didn't make anything out of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q:When you were working amongst these people, did you hear anti-Semitic remarks.</span> <span id="s1065">Did they talk about the situation and the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A:Sure, they were talking about it.</span> <span id="s1067">At another time I was sitting in front of a big basket with vegetables cleaning it and the sun rays came on my head and one of the girls said, "Look, her hair is reddish like a Jewess."</span> <span id="s1068">And everybody laughed and I laughed most hilariously, you know, but inside, you know, the fear was gnawing on my inside, you know.</span> <span id="s1069">And another time the kitchen chef grabbed me and put my head on the table.</span> <span id="s1070">He was preparing the, the sausage for the evening supper.</span> <span id="s1071">And he put this long knife to my neck and said, "You see, if you were Jewish, I would cut off your head."</span> <span id="s1072">Big laughter in the room and I laughed most hilariously of course.</span> <span id="s1073">But you know what it does to a psyche of a young girl in her formative years?</span> <span id="s1074">Can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">03:12:34 With nobody to console you, with nobody to tell you it's okay, it will be better, hold on.</span> <span id="s1076">Total isolation, total loneliness.</span> <span id="s1077">It's a terrible feeling.</span> <span id="s1078">You know, you are among people and you are like on an island all alone.</span> <span id="s1079">There is nobody you can go to ask for help.</span> <span id="s1080">You can nobody ask for advice.</span> <span id="s1081">You had to make life threatening decisions all by yourself in a very short time, and you never knew whether your decision will be beneficial to you or detrimental to your existence.</span> <span id="s1082">It was like playing Russian Roulette with your life.</span> <span id="s1083">And it was not only one incident.</span> <span id="s1084">It was this way from the moment I came on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1085">Day after day.</span> <span id="s1086">I remember one day I got...well it's a long story.</span> <span id="s1087">I don't know if we have time to tell about these stories, all of them.</span> <span id="s1088">Anyway, I got a place to live.</span> <span id="s1089">It was a Polish woman whose husband never returned from the war and she was taking in tenants to her apartment and my roommate was a prostitute.</span> <span id="s1090">And the...it was a very difficult time for me, you know.</span> <span id="s1091">I was -- my head was full of lice and the, and the landlady discovered it and she said, "Girl what's the matter with you?</span> <span id="s1092">Where are you coming from?"</span> <span id="s1093">I had to invent some excuse extemporaneously, you know.</span> <span id="s1094">You had, this was a skill I had developed on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1095">You had to lie impromptu, right away.</span> <span id="s1096">You had to have ready answers for every unpredictable situation.</span> <span id="s1097">So, I said something, you know, I don't remember exactly what I told, but she bought it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">03:15:11 And it was a real plague.</span> <span id="s1099">I don't know, I hope you never experience being plagued by lice, you know.</span> <span id="s1100">It's a plague which is mentioned in the Hagadah, you know, one of the ten plague sent on pharaoh.</span> <span id="s1101">It's a terrible plague.</span> <span id="s1102">You cannot live normally when you are eaten by lice, you know.</span> <span id="s1103">And even if you wash your hair you take out, you comb out the lice, there are nits on your head and they, they develop next day into lice.</span> <span id="s1104">And I understood I have to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s1105">I didn't know how.</span> <span id="s1106">And one day by chance I went to a hairdresser.</span> <span id="s1107">It was fashionable at that time that young girls were, were curling up their hairs with permanent.</span> <span id="s1108">With a permanent.</span> <span id="s1109">It was a fashionable thing.</span> <span id="s1110">And the Polish girls liked it because Polish girls had usually very straight hair.</span> <span id="s1111">My hair was by nature wavy, not curly but wavy.</span> <span id="s1112">So, I went to that hairdresser and I had my, and I agreed to have a permanent.</span> <span id="s1113">And he also asked me where are you coming from, a prison.</span> <span id="s1114">I said, you got it.</span> <span id="s1115">And a good thing was that smart people during the occupation didn't ask too many questions.</span> <span id="s1116">If you came across a decent person and he suspected you of being Jewish, he had a choice whether to denounce you or to say nothing.</span> <span id="s1117">The barber didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1118">After that visit I noticed a big relief.</span> <span id="s1119">Evidently the heat from that machine coming on my head was killing the nits and after a while I got rid of that plague and it was such a relief.</span> <span id="s1120">Well, I got lice infected later on, but that's another story again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q:Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s1122">I'm sure there were a few other places that you could have worked.</span> <span id="s1123">What, what prompted you to go work in a German military hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A:Good question.</span> <span id="s1125">Because I overheard that in that German hospital girls are coming for work.</span> <span id="s1126">Some were killed but I took the chance maybe they won't recognize me.</span> <span id="s1127">I didn't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1128">You are in a strange city.</span> <span id="s1129">You don't know where to go.</span> <span id="s1130">You don't have money.</span> <span id="s1131">You have to disappear from the street before seven o'clock in the evening.</span> <span id="s1132">Where are you going?</span> <span id="s1133">Like I said, it was Russian Roulette.</span> <span id="s1134">I just knew that I heard that this place was, was hiring people so I went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">03:18:23</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q:This was just conversation on the street or you just heard about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A:I heard about it in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q:So how long did you work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A:I worked there from about November of '42 to March '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q:What else happened there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A:While I was working there.</span> <span id="s1142">Well one thing is that...on Christmas Eve, '42, '43, the kitchen chef arranged a big party, a Christmas party and of course I participated in that party and I was terribly afraid to get drunk, because I didn't know what I might say when I will be drunk.</span> <span id="s1143">On the other hand I didn't want to show that I am not drinking because that would be an indication, you know, only Jewish girls didn't drink.</span> <span id="s1144">Polish girls drank, especially that group of girls had no objections of imbuing themselves with vodka.</span> <span id="s1145">So, I was drinking, and I became drunk for the first time in my life, but even in the straight, state of drunkenness I didn't lose my, my ability not to talk of what need not to be said.</span> <span id="s1146">I didn't lose my hold on myself completely.</span> <span id="s1147">But that turned out to be very beneficial for me because after that party I was one of the group.</span> <span id="s1148">It was like battle christening for me.</span> <span id="s1149">I made it.</span> <span id="s1150">I was Leoska.</span> <span id="s1151">I wasn't Leah anymore, I was Leoska and it was okay.</span> <span id="s1152">The girls they took advantage of me.</span> <span id="s1153">They sent me to steal food for them.</span> <span id="s1154">I did it because I wanted to be accepted and I was, and that's how, how I could exist among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">03:21:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q:Did you make any friends there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A:I, later on I made friends with one Jewish girl who also came to work there.</span> <span id="s1158">Her name was Ursula and from the moment she came to work I suspected her of being Jewish because you know, you had a sense of distinguish right away your own people.</span> <span id="s1159">And to prove that she's Jewish one day when we went down to the cellar to pick up the potatoes or vegetables I started to hum the Jewish national anthem, the Hatikva, and I figured if she's not Jewish she won't react to it, but if she is she might and she did.</span> <span id="s1160">And we became friends.</span> <span id="s1161">It was very beneficial for me because she was, her sister who was a married woman already was hiding with her husband on the Polish side in Krakow and she used to take me to them.</span> <span id="s1162">So, that was the first honest human contact that I could have after I left the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1163">And it was a big relief.</span> <span id="s1164">The other important thing that happened to me at that time was that I stole a gun from one of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1165">It happened that way.</span> <span id="s1166">Tosia Altman, one of the leaders in my youth organization knew where I was.</span> <span id="s1167">She knew that I am in that, that I work in that hospital.</span> <span id="s1168">And evidently other members of the organization knew.</span> <span id="s1169">So, one day on my way from work to the place where I lived, I met one of our members.</span> <span id="s1170">His name was Tadek, Tuvia Szajngot was his real name.</span> <span id="s1171">And we knew each other from the ghetto in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1172">He was one of the escapees from the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1173">And he stayed in the Tarnow ghetto.</span> <span id="s1174">He came, he was purposely waiting for me.</span> <span id="s1175">He knew that I would leave work at a certain time and we met and during that conversation he instilled in me the idea that maybe I could steal a gun.</span> <span id="s1176">The hospital has Germans and each of them has a weapon.</span> <span id="s1177">And one day it happened.</span> <span id="s1178">I describe it in more detail in my memoirs, so I don't think it's important to go over it again and again.</span> <span id="s1179">I succeeded in taking out a parabellum and I hid it in my place where I was living until after a while Tadek came and picked it up.</span> <span id="s1180">And it did a good job later on in the, in the uprising and the, during the uprising in the Czestochowa ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">03:24:44</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q:Weren't you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A:I was scared to death -- you mean when I was stealing it?</span> <span id="s1184">It was one of the most romantic experiences in my life.</span> <span id="s1185">I became so frantic that for a moment I thought I'm going out of my mind because there was a moment when I grabbed the gun out of the scabbard, what is the name, the word...and I put it into my panties and went from the room where the Germans -- you know the room was empty when I took it.</span> <span id="s1186">There was nobody in it and it was a split second decision whether I'm going to do it or not, and I did it.</span> <span id="s1187">And here I am with that gun in my hand which I put into my panties.</span> <span id="s1188">I run out from room.</span> <span id="s1189">Luckily across that room was the rest room.</span> <span id="s1190">I ran into that rest room and didn't know what to do with it now.</span> <span id="s1191">What was I going to do with that thing.</span> <span id="s1192">So, I climbed on the toilet and there was a, a window.</span> <span id="s1193">The window was leading to a little roof which was nothing but the top of, of a garbage bin and I left it there, and I went back to the kitchen, you know.</span> <span id="s1194">But inside there was such a storm running in me that I had to use all my humanly possible power to, to control myself, you know.</span> <span id="s1195">I was red in my face.</span> <span id="s1196">My mouth was dry like a sole.</span> <span id="s1197">I was trembling.</span> <span id="s1198">I was afraid that my, that people would notice some physical changes in myself.</span> <span id="s1199">So, I tried as best as I could to control myself and I succeeded.</span> <span id="s1200">Nobody suspected me.</span> <span id="s1201">I was probably the last person they would suspect of stealing that gun.</span> <span id="s1202">Later on, you know, there was an alarm.</span> <span id="s1203">There was, you know, Gestapo came and the police came.</span> <span id="s1204">They arrested the German whose gun I stole, but I succeeded in getting out that, that gun from that hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">03:27:17 Well, around March I got a letter from Tosia Altman, that Arieh Wilner, one of our leading persons in the organization, was caught by the Gestapo and he's under investigation and that I should leave immediately, the hospital, because in all probability Arieh, which was, you know, Jurek was his pseudo name in occupation time that Jurek might have some picture of me and maybe even some letters from me to him.</span> <span id="s1206">So, I had to leave immediately, which I did.</span> <span id="s1207">On my way out from the hospital and I was running away, I had people coming to the Wache, to the check points, you know to the guards at the entrance, people asking for Leokadia Bukowska.</span> <span id="s1208">That was my Polish name.</span> <span id="s1209">And I ran out in a fit of, of anxiety from that building, running like crazy in front of me, just like a hunted animal, literally, you know.</span> <span id="s1210">And I jumped into a street cart, not knowing where it's going.</span> <span id="s1211">It didn't matter to me, just to be far away, as far away from that hospital as possible.</span> <span id="s1212">And in my wild imagination I thought that some people are after me, you know.</span> <span id="s1213">I was suspecting, maybe those who were asking me were told that I just left the place and they were running after me.</span> <span id="s1214">So I, you know, in the, in the street cart the seats were, were, you know, benches, one on one side of the street cart and the other on the other side.</span> <span id="s1215">People sit vis-à-vis each other.</span> <span id="s1216">And there were two guys who were looking at me all the time, and I didn't know why they are looking at me, but of course suspicion right away, you know.</span> <span id="s1217">They, they must be those guys who came to catch me.</span> <span id="s1218">Anyway, I don't know whether this was true or my wild imagination.</span> <span id="s1219">Maybe they were just looking at me, you know, as a young girl, or maybe they just saw that something wrong is with me.</span> <span id="s1220">Anyway, I jumped out from that street cart and ran straight into a house and hid myself in the attic, covered myself up with some, with some shmates, some rags and I laid there for several hours.</span> <span id="s1221">I heard some talks on the, on the, in the back yard but I didn't know whether it relates to me or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">03:30:20 Anyway, after several hours I succeeded somehow to calm down, to regain my posure, no my, to regain my balance again and I ventured, ventured to get out into the street and there was nobody waiting for me in the street.</span> <span id="s1223">And I got in touch with that girl, Ester Fiks.</span> <span id="s1224">She was working in another German institution called the Soldatenheim.</span> <span id="s1225">I got in touch with her.</span> <span id="s1226">I knew where she's working and we decided to run away.</span> <span id="s1227">And we ran away to Lwow, Lemberg.</span> <span id="s1228">We took a train and came there and we tried to, to establish ourselves over there, but a sense told us that this is not a good place to, for us.</span> <span id="s1229">It was full of Ukrainians and Ukrainians were collaborating with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1230">The atmosphere was not good for us and the very same day we took another train back, but not to Krakow anymore.</span> <span id="s1231">We went to the ghetto and took it to Czestochowa, and we got into the ghetto in Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q:Leah, when we stopped before, I think you had just arrived back in Czestochowa from, after you had been working in this military hospital.</span> <span id="s1233">Can you pick up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">A:I met with my friends from the kibbutz in Czestochowa from Berka Joselewicza and among them was Abraham Silberstein who was one in the group who stayed in the, at the farm after the rest when to Czestochowa and I learned at that time that they are organizing an uprising, that they are not going to be scooped up by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1235">That they will fight when the time comes.</span> <span id="s1236">I also learned that an uprising is being in preparation in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1237">And after a few days, we recuperated, you know, could wash ourselves and bring ourselves to, to, to look normally, me and the other young girl, Ester Fiks, decided to go to Warsaw to get into the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1238">If we are going to fight, we are going to fight in the Warsaw ghetto.</span> <span id="s1239">One of the reasons was Warsaw was where I grew up and belongs to me.</span> <span id="s1240">Another is that Arieh Wilner whom I loved was there and I wanted to be with him, whether we are going to fight, I want to be with him.</span> <span id="s1241">And the third reason was that Ester's little brother Bolus was in Warsaw and she wanted to be close to him to take, you know, supervise him somehow take care of him.</span> <span id="s1242">So, we decided to go to Warsaw, and we came to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1243">And we entered the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">03:33:56 You usually entered by way of a working battalion from the Aryan side going at the end of the day into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1245">So, we joined a battalion and went into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1246">And I came to the headquarters of the Jewish fighting organization on Zamenhofa.</span> <span id="s1247">Let me tell you, when I came to the ghetto it wasn't the same ghetto that I left in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q:Give me a time frame here, please.</span> <span id="s1249">What, approximately when was this that you returned?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A:It was the beginning of April '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q:So you were saying the ghetto looked very different to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A:Different.</span> <span id="s1253">It was a ghost town, because at that time the ghetto was already, the population of the ghetto was reduced from half a million to only sixty or fifty thousand people.</span> <span id="s1254">And they were concentrated in a small, much smaller area.</span> <span id="s1255">And you went through a zone which was an inhabited zone, you know, with all the aspects of a ghost town, you know.</span> <span id="s1256">A town after a terrible pogrom, you know.</span> <span id="s1257">And it was, it was like coming into a world out of this world.</span> <span id="s1258">A world that your senses cannot even comprehend all this, you know.</span> <span id="s1259">You see houses abandoned.</span> <span id="s1260">People domiciles, people's way of living destroyed and you had to go through that area very quickly.</span> <span id="s1261">You were not allowed to linger around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">03:36:11 Well, I came to that, to that center of the Jewish fighting organization and I met Arieh Wilner over there.</span> <span id="s1263">He was in a terrible state because it was after the, after he was interrogated by the Gestapo and he was tortured terribly.</span> <span id="s1264">He was, there is an exact description of his tortures by Henryk Grabowski, the Pole who was the scout and who succeeded to rescue him from one of the, of the working camps that he was put into.</span> <span id="s1265">Anyway, it wasn't the same Arieh that I knew in Spring.</span> <span id="s1266">He could barely talk to me.</span> <span id="s1267">He was in a state of depression and maybe he didn't want to talk to me.</span> <span id="s1268">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1269">After a few days, we wanted to join the working groups.</span> <span id="s1270">I remember the discussion they had between the leaders of ZOB, Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, Mordechaj Awelewicz, Icchak Cukierman, and Cywia Lubetkin, and they decided it would be better to send me out from the ghetto to be a courier.</span> <span id="s1271">I had the attributes than to stay in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1272">It was too late to train me.</span> <span id="s1273">They didn't have enough weapons even for the people who were organized already in groups.</span> <span id="s1274">So, I was smuggled out from the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q:May I ask you a few questions before you continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q:Did you have any sense of how well trained the Jewish fighters were, how organized they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A:No, I didn't have at that time any idea about it.</span> <span id="s1279">I knew that they are organized.</span> <span id="s1280">I knew that they are ready to fight but I didn't know the details and I was not told many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q:Now, there are a couple other things that I think are, we may have missed, but it's up to you whether you want to go back now or later.</span> <span id="s1282">I know you were doing some work in Plaszow, yes?</span> <span id="s1283">Weren't you going back and forth to Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A:That was when I was still in Krakow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q:Do you want to continue or go back to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A:It's up to you, what would you like to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q:Well, I would like to know about this.</span> <span id="s1288">I understand you had a meeting with...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">03:39:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A:Irena Adamowicz.</span> <span id="s1291">While I was working in the German hospital, it was called Krankensammelstelle.</span> <span id="s1292">One day she came and visited me, and I was glad to see her and, you know, hear news about our friends because she was that link, that courier who, between the ghetto and outside people.</span> <span id="s1293">She had some friends, close friends from Hashomer Hatzair in the labor camp in Plaszow.</span> <span id="s1294">By the way, that's the place that is mentioned in the film "Schindler's List", but at that time I had no idea that this was ever come up, the name, I mean, of the place.</span> <span id="s1295">And she said she had two friends in that camp, and she would like me to contact them because they might need some help.</span> <span id="s1296">And if I could supply that help, she asked me if I'm willing to do it and I agreed.</span> <span id="s1297">So, I went to that camp and through Polish contacts I got in touch with the people, with this couple.</span> <span id="s1298">It was a couple, and he was a dentist.</span> <span id="s1299">As such, the Germans exploited his, his, the skills and employed him...they gave him a small room on the Wache, which is the, the guard station, and that's where he was treating, you know, taking care of the teeth of the German team there.</span> <span id="s1300">The things he was asking me to do were not very important.</span> <span id="s1301">To bring him some medicines.</span> <span id="s1302">To find out if I could secure some place in case they would succeed in escaping, stuff like that, which I did.</span> <span id="s1303">And, we established a weekly contact.</span> <span id="s1304">On a weekend I would go to Plaszow and bring all stuffs.</span> <span id="s1305">After a while, the Germans on the Wache they knew me already.</span> <span id="s1306">And I used to bring some stuff that I could bring from the, from the hospital, like oranges or other stuff that were very rare and given only to Germans.</span> <span id="s1307">So, that was the contact.</span> <span id="s1308">Irena at that time also told me that in a nearby monastery, Jewish children can be, can be allocated, they could be hidden there for money.</span> <span id="s1309">And she took me to that convent.</span> <span id="s1310">I saw the children but I didn't make any point, you know, to distinguish which are Jewish and which are not.</span> <span id="s1311">That was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">03:42:23</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q:Was it easy to go in and out of Plaszow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A:It wasn't easy as far as I could go was the, the check point.</span> <span id="s1315">And, and the room that Chaim, was the name of that guy, was working, was close to that, to that check post.</span> <span id="s1316">I couldn't get into the, the premises of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q:But you were able to give him a package or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A:Yes, yes I was able to do that.</span> <span id="s1319">What is important is to remember that you have to establish a rapport with the people at the check point.</span> <span id="s1320">You have to win the confidence of the Pole who introduced me to the Germans and that's how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q:How did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A:Well, you had to have really an exceptional sense to feel out if that Pole can be trusted, you know.</span> <span id="s1323">That, that was a matter of intuition.</span> <span id="s1324">You could be wrong and you could, you know, jeopardize your life.</span> <span id="s1325">Like I said before, it was a gamble all the time.</span> <span id="s1326">You didn't know whether what you're doing will, will turn out to be good for you or bad.</span> <span id="s1327">You had to try.</span> <span id="s1328">I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1329">I had a good relationship with that Pole and he had a good relationship with the Germans and it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q:Did you ever have to bribe anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A:I had to bribe the Pole.</span> <span id="s1332">I mean by bribing I didn't give him money but I was, I was supplying them with stuff that they couldn't get in a normal way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q:I must say for a young girl, I mean, you had guts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A:You had to when your life is in jeopardy you discover in yourself qualities that you never suspected that you had them.</span> <span id="s1335">Until you are put to the test you never know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q:So, back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1337">It, it was decided by your group that you would be of more service by being on the Aryan side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">A:Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q:You want to tell me a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1341">I was really active from that time till the Polish uprising which happened a year later.</span> <span id="s1342">Very active.</span> <span id="s1343">At that time I was contacting Jews in forced labor camps in Skarzysko in Starachowice.</span> <span id="s1344">I was in contact with the Jewish partisans in the Wyszkow area.</span> <span id="s1345">I was a courier delivering documents to Jews in hiding.</span> <span id="s1346">I do whatever required to, to be done.</span> <span id="s1347">My contact was Kazik, Simcha Rotem, a very courageous young man.</span> <span id="s1348">He was the guy who later on rescued the remnants of the Jewish fighting organization from the Polish uprising and from, I'm mistaken, from the Jewish uprising, when they had the remnants from the, when the Jewish uprising, as subdued, he was the one who succeeded in rescuing them from the ghetto through the sewage canals.</span> <span id="s1349">Yeah, he was my contact.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">03:46:09</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q:And he would help you get the documents or money or weapons or whatever?</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A:No, he contacted me with other people.</span> <span id="s1353">One of the other people was Basia Berman and she was one of the members of ZKN, Zydowski Komitet Narodowy, which was functioning on the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s1354">She gave me assignments what to do.</span> <span id="s1355">Kazik gave me other assignments, and we were doing it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q:But you were operating mostly on your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A:Well, to, come to the partisans in the, in the woods, I was to be helped by Polish guides.</span> <span id="s1358">We, I mean the organization, had trusted people, Poles, and they were my guides through the, through the woods.</span> <span id="s1359">I wouldn't know where to find them myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q:Where were you during the Warsaw ghetto uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A:I was on the Polish side because when I left the ghetto I didn't leave Warsaw right away.</span> <span id="s1362">My friend, Ester, Julcia, she had to find arrangements with her brother.</span> <span id="s1363">She was looking for him and until all these things were arranged, we, we stayed a while in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1364">And that's when I was observing the uprising from the Polish side.</span> <span id="s1365">It was a terrible time, you know.</span> <span id="s1366">To see my people being, you know, killed out.</span> <span id="s1367">The ghetto was one big inferno.</span> <span id="s1368">Day and night, fire and, and smoke.</span> <span id="s1369">People jumping from, from the roofs and from the windows.</span> <span id="s1370">The comments that you heard from the Polish people.</span> <span id="s1371">"Zydki sie smaze", which means "the Jews are being baked or fried."</span> <span id="s1372">There were also expressions of compassion.</span> <span id="s1373">People are people in every society you have scum and you have people with moral principles.</span> <span id="s1374">But that's where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q:So you were able to observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1377">And you know there was one incident that is mentioned in many reminisces.</span> <span id="s1378">Next to the ghetto there was a carousel because at that time it was Passover, 1943, and at that time it was also the Christian Easter holiday.</span> <span id="s1379">So that people were coming.</span> <span id="s1380">It was a holiday.</span> <span id="s1381">And they were, you know, the carousel was playing and going around was the children flying in the air, while Jewish children were dying, you know, in the flames or being asphyxiated in the bunkers, in which they hid.</span> <span id="s1382">That's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">03:49:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q:So, as the ghetto was burning, life was going on as normal on the other side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A:Yes, business like usual.</span> <span id="s1386">Mothers strolling with their childrens and dogs, you know.</span> <span id="s1387">People, Polish people gathered on the roofs on their houses which were surrounding the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1388">It was that morbid curiosity looking inside what's going on there, you know.</span> <span id="s1389">There is this trait in people.</span> <span id="s1390">Whenever something terrible takes place, people have this curiosity to see what's going on.</span> <span id="s1391">That's how it was and you had all kinds of comments and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q:Did you have any sort of personal feeling that, about being on the outside instead of being on the inside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A:Not really.</span> <span id="s1394">I mean I was sent out, so I had the sense of, of duty to do things, and I knew that's important to do.</span> <span id="s1395">I was happy to do it, you know.</span> <span id="s1396">I was, it was a very good time for me.</span> <span id="s1397">I felt needed.</span> <span id="s1398">I felt that I am doing something important.</span> <span id="s1399">You know what it meant to come to a hiding place where people, Jewish people, were treated like they were reduced to a status of pets and to bring them food, money, medicine, sometimes a newspaper.</span> <span id="s1400">It was a feeling that you are really doing something good and it makes you feel good.</span> <span id="s1401">You don't think about endangering your life at that moment.</span> <span id="s1402">You know that you are doing...when I came to the Wyszkow partisans, Randy, you have no idea what a feeling it was, hearing "Lodzia is coming, Lodzia is here, Lodzia..." All of a sudden I was somebody.</span> <span id="s1403">All of a sudden I, I had, I was doing something important, something really that, something that really matters.</span> <span id="s1404">That was very good for my psyche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">03:52:08</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q:At the time of the uprising....</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A:Which uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q:The Warsaw ghetto uprising, did you, I guess after the flames started dying down, did you ever go into the ghetto and see?</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">A:No.</span> <span id="s1410">You couldn't get into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1411">You couldn't And after a week or ten days, we left Warsaw anyway.</span> <span id="s1412">We went back to Czestochowa, but not to the ghetto anymore.</span> <span id="s1413">And we found work what they call the Doldatenheim, a soldier's home.</span> <span id="s1414">It was like a restaurant and hotel for Germans.</span> <span id="s1415">Again we were assigned to the kitchen but I was promoted to do the laundry.</span> <span id="s1416">And, after a while I became very good at ironing, especially the starch collars of the German nurses.</span> <span id="s1417">And they were very pleased with my performance so that's how it was.</span> <span id="s1418">And one day they came, they had, you know, patrons, this restaurant, from the German population in Czestochowa, and one day the kitchen chef made an announcement if some of the Polish staff would like to swap jobs from the, from the Soldatenheim to be a maid in a German household.</span> <span id="s1419">And they promised to give us a separate room and more money that we got and some other fringe benefits and me and Julcia we decided we'll take it because we were hoping we could take with us that little boy that she brought from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1420">So, but when all the technical arrangements were taken care of I mean through the Arbeitsamt, through the employment... German employment office and when it came to, to start work, both her employers and my refused to take, to let, to take the boy in.</span> <span id="s1421">Well, they were lying again.</span> <span id="s1422">They always lied.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q:Didn't you have any qualms about going to work in the intimacy of a German home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A:Well, my main objective, like I told you, was to rescue that little boy because the boy stayed in a home, in a Polish home where he was working at the soldier's home and the landlady discovered him being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1425">She, she took off the cover to see if he is circumcised and the little boy pretended that he is asleep, he didn't, and he was at that time five or six years old and he realized that his life is in danger so he run away without telling his sister that he is doing it.</span> <span id="s1426">He just ran to the railway station and started crying and asked people to take him to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1427">Some people had compassion and took him to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1428">So, we stayed in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1429">We worked for these Germans until we escaped from there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">03:55:53</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q:Just tell me a little bit about what it was like working for this German family?</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A:Well, it was an experience sort of.</span> <span id="s1433">The work for me was very hard.</span> <span id="s1434">Demands were unsurmountable to my physical capabilities, you know.</span> <span id="s1435">I was still a very young girl.</span> <span id="s1436">I was emaciated from the ghetto existence and the job to do was so enormous that it was beyond my physical capabilities and the demands that -- her name was Else Schulte...her demands were such that, you know, everything had to be done perfectly and there was such an awful lot of things to do.</span> <span id="s1437">In a household there were ten rooms, it was a post-Jewish apartment consisting of ten rooms and all this I had to clean.</span> <span id="s1438">I had to, you know, lit or make fire in ten stoves in each room, because it was winter time when I was there.</span> <span id="s1439">I had to do the laundry.</span> <span id="s1440">Everything that in a, in a well run household needs to be done.</span> <span id="s1441">On top of everything, she gave birth to a little boy and I had to take care of that too, you know.</span> <span id="s1442">Laundry every day, ironing.</span> <span id="s1443">I was working from six in the morning till midnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q:Was she nice to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A:No, she was not.</span> <span id="s1446">She was not nice she, and, and she didn't know that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1447">She was treating me like a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s1448">Her, her demands were exorbitant, out... You know, she would, I would clean, let's say, the bathroom.</span> <span id="s1449">In comes Else, in German of course, "What kind of miserable job you are doing."</span> <span id="s1450">She would wrench out the, the brush from my hand, get on her knees herself, start rubbing, showing me how it should be done.</span> <span id="s1451">Okay, I tried to do it.</span> <span id="s1452">After I dusted the rooms and the furniture, she would go with white gloves and slide through the furniture to see if some dust is left on her white glove.</span> <span id="s1453">I start to remember a few details like that, but the worst part for me was the cleaning of the carpets, you know.</span> <span id="s1454">I had to roll them up, to take them down to the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1455">There was a scaffolding on the courtyard.</span> <span id="s1456">You had to hang them on that scaffolding and with a dust beater beat these rugs and I was simply, you know, crouching under it.</span> <span id="s1457">I couldn't...I couldn't, take them.</span> <span id="s1458">I couldn't put them on that.</span> <span id="s1459">And she was looking and observing me from the kitchen window and screaming at me, "Schmel, schmel."</span> <span id="s1460">All the time, you know, was an abusive language of course, "You Polish dumbbell" or something like that, what are you, " you don't know what cleanliness is.</span> <span id="s1461">You don't know what ordenem is."</span> <span id="s1462">"You don't know what order is", ordenem is the German word for order, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">03:59:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Tape #4</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">04:01:04</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q:These Germans you were working for, were they Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A:Yes, they were, they were prominent Nazis.</span> <span id="s1468">He was the Staatsanwalt of the city of Czestochowa which is the attorney general for the city.</span> <span id="s1469">Yes, he was very prominent.</span> <span id="s1470">This was her second husband.</span> <span id="s1471">The first was also a prominent Nazi.</span> <span id="s1472">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1473">But you asked me what, what were my feelings working for them.</span> <span id="s1474">It's paradoxical, but I felt safer in the German family than, within, with, than with, among the Poles.</span> <span id="s1475">You see, the Germans didn't have that capability of distinguishing Jews from Poles, but the Poles were experts.</span> <span id="s1476">They, they could smell a Jew just right away.</span> <span id="s1477">So, in a sense it was safer for me to be in the mouth of the lions, so to speak.</span> <span id="s1478">But there were moments which were very hard on me.</span> <span id="s1479">Except for the physical exertion, cases when she would take me to the ghetto in Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1480">These prominent Germans were allowed to exploit the craftsmen within the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1481">So, she had, there was a one famous tailor in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1482">He was, he had an opinion of the best tailors.</span> <span id="s1483">So, she went to him and he was making suits for her coats or whatever and she would drag me along to be an interpreter.</span> <span id="s1484">I'll come back to that in a moment.</span> <span id="s1485">And this was very painful for me because I was afraid that the Jews would see that I am Jewish and, and maybe some murmur or whatever, you know, or some approach from, from a Jew.</span> <span id="s1486">I was afraid to do it and besides it was very painful, you know, to see these people in that state of, of...of humiliation, and I couldn't help anything.</span> <span id="s1487">When I started to work for the Schulte family, I pretended that I don't understand a word German because it was very rare that Poles knew German.</span> <span id="s1488">Maybe only those who lived on the western part of Poland, which was bordering with German, Germany.</span> <span id="s1489">They knew, some of them.</span> <span id="s1490">Not in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1491">So, everybody that understood German was suspected of being Jewish because Yiddish and German...I mean Yiddish is derived from German.</span> <span id="s1492">So, I pretended I don't know a word of German.</span> <span id="s1493">And I understood every word, but I had to pretend that I don't know any German.</span> <span id="s1494">And after a while I let Else learn me a word or two and I developed a skill of talking in a broken German, you know, half Polish, half German, and she became very proud that she succeeded to learn that Polish dumbbell a few German words.</span> <span id="s1495">In the mean time I could understand everything that was going on between them, especially when they invited their guests, you know.</span> <span id="s1496">These were very hard days for me because I had to work doubly hard, you know, to prepare all these dishes and clean the mess after them.</span> <span id="s1497">And they were real pigs let me tell you that.</span> <span id="s1498">When they had parties they didn't behave in a civilized manner.</span> <span id="s1499">They were drinking and eating like pigs and farting and, and this was the high society.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">04:05:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q:Did they talk about the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A:Oh, yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1503">How they sept the moral fiber of the German society and finally we are getting rid of them.</span> <span id="s1504">Stuff like that, yes, it was a popular topic all over during these five years, among Poles, among Germans, and among the Jews.</span> <span id="s1505">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q:It must have been tough to listen to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A:Yes, very tough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q:You had mentioned that you saw some lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A:Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q:You mentioned that in the household you saw some lists?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A:Some what...oh yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1512">When I was cleaning in his study I looked at his papers that were on the, on the desk and there were names that I knew from, from the time that I lived in Zarki on that farm.</span> <span id="s1513">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1514">But it was ridiculous, you see.</span> <span id="s1515">He as, as a, as a..</span> <span id="s1516">.</span> <span id="s1517">an attorney had to do the paperwork.</span> <span id="s1518">The Jews were condemned to death anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q:How long did you work for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A:I worked for them from the fall of '43 till, till March '44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q:Did, in this time did you ever laugh, did you ever feel good?</span> <span id="s1522">Did you have any enjoyment, any rest, any diversion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A:Not really.</span> <span id="s1524">The diversion that I could be myself was when I talked to Julcia, you know she was working...we worked in the same building only she worked for one family and I was working for another family, and on Sunday we were allowed to go to church.</span> <span id="s1525">So, instead of going to church we were roaming the streets and, you know, talking and that was one way of relieving the tension.</span> <span id="s1526">Another was, is, you know, after my day's work was finished, I got a separate room.</span> <span id="s1527">So, I went to my room.</span> <span id="s1528">I closed the door and I could be myself again, you know, leaning on the window sill and looking out and being myself again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">04:08:14</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q:When you were leaning out the window, thinking, daydreaming or talking to your friend, what kinds of things would you think about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A:Well there were always things, you know, I had to make a decision at that time whether we are going to stay there or not, I mean with these families.</span> <span id="s1532">Because at a certain point, Else, the German employer became so enraged with my performance that she started to threaten me with a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1533">You will go out of my household straight into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1534">Also, my health deteriorated terribly because of that physical exertion.</span> <span id="s1535">It was too much for my physical capabilities.</span> <span id="s1536">I went to a doctor because I was starting to faint, and he said it's extreme exertion.</span> <span id="s1537">You have to, to eat better, rest more, what doctors will tell you.</span> <span id="s1538">And I understood that I cannot rest.</span> <span id="s1539">I cannot have better care.</span> <span id="s1540">I decided to run away, and we did one day.</span> <span id="s1541">We ran away, both of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q:Did, did you think in terms of you were going to make it through this and one day things would be okay again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A:I wasn't thinking that far.</span> <span id="s1544">It was an existence from day to day.</span> <span id="s1545">If I made it through one day it was good.</span> <span id="s1546">You never knew what the next day is holding in for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q:Did you have dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A:I'm sure I had dreams.</span> <span id="s1549">I don't remember, but everybody, you know, you see the instinct of survival is a very strong instinct, and when you are, and when your life is in danger, you want to preserve that life, especially when you are young, that instinct slightens with age, you know.</span> <span id="s1550">When you get older the instinct of survival is still strong but not as strong as when you are young.</span> <span id="s1551">You want to live, desperately.</span> <span id="s1552">You cannot, you cannot think of dying.</span> <span id="s1553">So you bury yourself in activity.</span> <span id="s1554">You do things.</span> <span id="s1555">You try to live one day after another.</span> <span id="s1556">And of course you always looking for possibilities to, to, to survive, which will be better, which will be worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">04:11:12 And you never knew which is going better for you or worse, you know.</span> <span id="s1558">Whatever decision you made, it was like a blind decision, you know.</span> <span id="s1559">But you had to make that decision.</span> <span id="s1560">And there was nobody to advise you or to, to hint to you.</span> <span id="s1561">You had, you had to use your faculties to make the decision and usually on a very short time.</span> <span id="s1562">I remember when I worked at the German hospital at the Krankensammelstelle.</span> <span id="s1563">One day I got a letter from the Gestapo to come to the offices.</span> <span id="s1564">And here I am, with that letter in my hand and I had to make a decision right on the spot.</span> <span id="s1565">Am I going to go there or am I going to run.</span> <span id="s1566">Run, where am I going to run to.</span> <span id="s1567">Nowhere to run to.</span> <span id="s1568">Then you come and think if they wanted me to, to...if they would suspect me of being Jewish they wouldn't write me a letter.</span> <span id="s1569">But you had to rationalize it.</span> <span id="s1570">You had to use your faculties.</span> <span id="s1571">You had to be smart and intelligent to make a decision.</span> <span id="s1572">And I figured if they suspect me of being Jewish they wouldn't write me a letter.</span> <span id="s1573">They would just come and grab me.</span> <span id="s1574">So, before the appointed day, I decided to make the visit by myself to see what kind of offices and what's going on there.</span> <span id="s1575">And when I came I saw that this is a clinic, a medical clinic, and again my goodness what do they want from me in a medical clinic, but I understood that its, that I am not be suspected of being Jewish especially when I saw that other girls on the staff get, got also these kinds of letters.</span> <span id="s1576">And, and then I decided to go there on the appointed day.</span> <span id="s1577">But you see that day when I had to make the decision I had to, to, what is the English word...I had to squash the impulse to run.</span> <span id="s1578">I had to subdue it and I had to force myself to think rationally when all your being is saying "Run, Leah, run."</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">04:14:00 But, when I came on that appointed day to that clinic, I was put into a room and all of a sudden I realized that I am in a room full of prostitutes.</span> <span id="s1580">And I, first of all, I, I could hear the language, the way they behaved and some of them were naked under their fur coats.</span> <span id="s1581">And, and over there I met my roommate from, from the early days in Krakow on the Aryan side, Marysia and she said, " What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1582">And I said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s1583">And she explained to me that from time to time the Germans gather the suspected, these prostitutes and they check them out for venereal diseases.</span> <span id="s1584">So, they were calling out by names one after another to an examining room and when my name was called out I came to the doctor and I started crying.</span> <span id="s1585">I said I'm not a prostitute.</span> <span id="s1586">I didn't have any sexual experience in my life.</span> <span id="s1587">And he of course discarded it, as, as I'm just joking, you know, and beckoned me on the examining table.</span> <span id="s1588">Well, it was a horrible experience for me, because I was really still a virgin and I, I was afraid, terribly afraid, what he can do to me, you know.</span> <span id="s1589">But this I'm telling you this as an example of how you had to make decisions in a very short time, decisions which could affect your life one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q:You and your friend Julcia, decided to leave the German families?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">Q:Where did you go?</span> <span id="s1593">What did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A:Well, we ran away.</span> <span id="s1595">First we, we came to the railway station and we bought tickets to the first train that is going away.</span> <span id="s1596">We said which train is leaving now, in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s1597">He said this and this train, gate so and so.</span> <span id="s1598">We ran to that train and we got back off.</span> <span id="s1599">I didn't even know where this train was going to, but we went along.</span> <span id="s1600">After an hour or so of riding on the train, we got off the train and we changed trains for a train going to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1601">And we were still zigzagging a few times because I was figuring we escaped six in the morning.</span> <span id="s1602">It will take them at least an hour to two to discover that we are missing.</span> <span id="s1603">Two hours could make us get away as far as we could from the place, and that's what happened, you know, zigzagging two's and...changing trains from one to another we arrived in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1604">They didn't catch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">04:17:27 Thinking rationally it was maybe a stupid decision to run away.</span> <span id="s1606">After all, this was a place which was relatively safe, but I just couldn't take it anymore and, you know, with young impetuosity you make a decision and you go on that decision.</span> <span id="s1607">But the terrible point was when I came and knocked on the door that Julcia was in, she was asleep.</span> <span id="s1608">You know, you couldn't blame her.</span> <span id="s1609">She was young and she just didn't got up in time, but I had to bang on the door until I got her out.</span> <span id="s1610">And when I was leaving, I left a key in the mailbox with a letter, and in that letter, I told them everything I think about the Germans.</span> <span id="s1611">I gave them a good sermon, who they are and what they are doing.</span> <span id="s1612">You see, I was reckoning.</span> <span id="s1613">If they catch me, they will, it will be my end anyway, but this is a chance to tell them who they are.</span> <span id="s1614">And I did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q:What did you do when you got to Warsaw?</span> <span id="s1616">Did you have friends there still?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1618">I got in, she got in touch with her brother who was at that time in Falenica, which is a suburban small community near Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1619">This was like a couple of months before the Polish uprising.</span> <span id="s1620">And I was again active in the underground until the Polish uprising broke out on August 1, 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q:When you say "active in the underground" what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A:What's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q:When you said, I was active in the underground..."</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A:In the Jewish underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q:So, that was still happening in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A:Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s1627">It was all the time.</span> <span id="s1628">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q:So, you knew people who were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q:Of course now they were living in the, on the Aryan side?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1633">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q:And you were taking things to different towns, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s1636">You know, the regular jobs of couriers.</span> <span id="s1637">Julcia was sent to Auschwitz because one of the members of, of Dror, Chavka Folman she was captured and sent to Auschwitz as a Polish girl, and her mission...Julcia's mission was to rescue her or to find out possibilities of rescue.</span> <span id="s1638">She did not succeed and it...in the meantime the Polish uprising broke out.</span> <span id="s1639">And I met Julcia after the uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">04:20:37</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q:When you went out to take things to the partisans in the forest, did you spend much time with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">Q:Did you understand what was going on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">A:Oh, sure, I understood what's going on there, but I stayed there a day, not more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">Q:Were they pretty organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A:The camp was on marshes.</span> <span id="s1647">You had to jump from one Hasag to another to get to the place.</span> <span id="s1648">It was like, sort of, of a prevention in case the Germans would discover them, and they did discover them on several occasion.</span> <span id="s1649">And they killed many of the partisans there.</span> <span id="s1650">This was a group of partisans of Jewish fighters in the Uprising, in the, from the Uprising, of the Jewish Uprising in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1651">And the partisans, they slept on the ground you know.</span> <span id="s1652">In the winter, they had some dugouts in the, in the ground, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">Q:Did they get any help from the Polish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">A:Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1655">Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1656">They wouldn't be able to exist without that help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q:Or from the Russians maybe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A:There were some Russian groups, partisans or escapees from the POWs, but, but that was not the main thing.</span> <span id="s1659">The real danger was from Polish partisans which cooperated with the Ukrainians and whenever they found Jewish partisans they would kill them off.</span> <span id="s1660">There was a group called NSZ which is an abbreviation Narodowe Sily Zbrojne, they would kill you off right away if they discovered that you were Jewish, and they did.</span> <span id="s1661">Some of my close friends from Zarki, that little town by the farm, they were killed by NSZ and by the A:K. which stands for the Home Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">Q:Now, you had contacts with the Polish underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">A:Only with one person who was a prominent communist.</span> <span id="s1664">You see the Polish underground was not a united front.</span> <span id="s1665">They had their political groups ranging from the extreme right to the extreme left and the leftist Polish underground, underground parties were more sympathetic to the Jewish cause than the rightists.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">04:23:36</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q:How much did you know about the Polish uprising before it took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A:Nothing.</span> <span id="s1669">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1670">It came as a surprise to me.</span> <span id="s1671">I had a meeting with Kazik (Simcha Rotem), and I came on that meeting.</span> <span id="s1672">At that time I was living in Constanta, which is a part of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1673">And when I met him, Kazik said run back home quickly.</span> <span id="s1674">On your way buy some food if you can, and stay there.</span> <span id="s1675">Before I made it home, the uprising was already in, in action.</span> <span id="s1676">They were already, you know, shooting and it began on my to the way home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">Q:Can you describe it a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A:The city of Warsaw which was a million inhabitants living in it was destroyed in, within a short time, you know.</span> <span id="s1679">The uprising broke out on August 1, '44 and it ended in October the third I believe.</span> <span id="s1680">And within that short time a quarter of a million Poles were killed.</span> <span id="s1681">The city, from a European metropolis, was turned into a heap of rubble.</span> <span id="s1682">Except for those sections of the city where the Germans had their strong holds and stayed in there, but the city was devastated.</span> <span id="s1683">And when the Polish uprising was through and vanquished, here we were a group of Jews what are we going to do, you know?</span> <span id="s1684">The Germans ordered the entire population to leave the city of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1685">Whoever would be found in the city of Warsaw after a certain date would be shot on the spot.</span> <span id="s1686">So, where are we going?</span> <span id="s1687">What are we going to do?</span> <span id="s1688">We were joking, you know, what are they going to kill us first, as being Jews, as being partisans, as being up, you know, insurgents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">04:26:09 And we had to hide.</span> <span id="s1690">We couldn't go to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1691">The majority of Poles of course, not the majority, every Pole was leaving Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1692">The Poles left the city.</span> <span id="s1693">The soldiers were promised a treatment under the Hague Convention to be treated like prisoners of war, but the Germans didn't keep their word.</span> <span id="s1694">They did what with the Poles whatever they wanted.</span> <span id="s1695">Some were killed.</span> <span id="s1696">Some were sent to concentration camps, some to work on the farms and factories in Germany.</span> <span id="s1697">The, the older population was put in a, in a transitory camp in a place not far from Warsaw called Pruszkow.</span> <span id="s1698">And from there the Poles were segregated, the young and the body abled were sent to Germany and the elderly and unable to be exploited were disbursed throughout Poland, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q:Now, this went on for two months.</span> <span id="s1700">That's a lot of bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">Q:What were they doing, hiding under ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">A:During...after the Uprising?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q:During, where were you.</span> <span id="s1705">That's two months of bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A:During, when the Uprising broke out, I volunteered and came to a, to a post where the uprisers were and I offered my services.</span> <span id="s1707">I said I am young I, I want to participate.</span> <span id="s1708">Didn't say I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s1709">They didn't take me.</span> <span id="s1710">They were already organized in groups.</span> <span id="s1711">They didn't take me.</span> <span id="s1712">I don't know for what reason.</span> <span id="s1713">So, during the bombardment, because the Germans were bombarding the city day after day, night after night, we, we lived in the, in the cellars and when for, in the intervals between shellings and bombing we went back to our apartments and tried to cook some food, you know.</span> <span id="s1714">The food that I succeeded in buying on my way home when Kazik told me to run, sustained me through all these terrible days.</span> <span id="s1715">I gave it to my landlady and she in return gave me one plate of soup a day.</span> <span id="s1716">Again, hunger, but under different conditions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q:Was there an effort to get out of the city towards the Russians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A:Yes, there was an attempt to do that because at that time, at the end of the Polish Uprising, the Russians were already in Praga, in my Praga, on the right bank of the Vistula.</span> <span id="s1719">And the hope was that in a few days they will come and liberate the whole Warsaw, but it didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1720">It didn't happen until January the 17, when the Russian offensive took on again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">04:29:25</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">Q:Did you try to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">A:Yes, I did.</span> <span id="s1724">I tried.</span> <span id="s1725">It was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s1726">You know, after, we knew that the Uprising collapsed.</span> <span id="s1727">It was vanquished.</span> <span id="s1728">We had to decide what to do, and we belonged to a fighting group of A:L., which stands for Army Ludowa which was the folk army not the Home Army.</span> <span id="s1729">And these were mostly leftists, communists.</span> <span id="s1730">And the, the commanders of the group that we belonged to told us that there will be an attempt to rescue the A:L. people through and, and take them out through the river to the right bank to the Soviets.</span> <span id="s1731">But it didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1732">It was a terrible experience.</span> <span id="s1733">And at, you know, at a certain point in the evening we were told to run towards the, the bank of the river, which we did, and along with the ex-fighters was the ex-insurgents, the civil population ran along, you know.</span> <span id="s1734">I mean, civil is maybe not the right word.</span> <span id="s1735">The regular population, women, children, just people were running along because they saw that the military is running maybe there is a chance for them too, to, to save their lives.</span> <span id="s1736">Many Poles didn't want to go to the Germans, you know, especially young people.</span> <span id="s1737">So, we were running, thousands of people.</span> <span id="s1738">It was night already, you know, and at the moment when the people were running towards the embarkment, Germans were situated on the river bank with their machine guns and started to, to shoot at the people because they felt that there is a, you know, that the Uprising is, is getting momentum again, that it's not completely vanquished.</span> <span id="s1739">So, the people who came very close to the German positions were killed right away and the people behind them started running back.</span> <span id="s1740">In the meantime, people were still running forwards because they didn't know what's happening on the, on the bank, so there was a whirlpool of people, you know.</span> <span id="s1741">Pandemonium.</span> <span id="s1742">Screams, crying, children abundant, their parents screaming, Mama, Mama, and the shooting and the fires, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">04:32:34 Well, we came back to the place.</span> <span id="s1744">Where we were waiting the whole day to be rescued and we decided to hide and we hid in a place on a, on a street which is, which is facing the river bank and the name of the street was Promyka.</span> <span id="s1745">The house in which we hid, the number was 43 and we stayed there for a long, for a long time.</span> <span id="s1746">Long weeks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">Q:One more question about the Uprising...Polish Uprising.</span> <span id="s1748">To your knowledge, were many Jews actively involved with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A:Do you mean whether they participated in the fighting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A:Yes, they did.</span> <span id="s1752">You see the group that I belonged to, we came and offered our willingness to participate in the uprising.</span> <span id="s1753">The A:K. didn't want us.</span> <span id="s1754">The A:L. accepted us and we were fighting as a Jewish unit.</span> <span id="s1755">That was the condition that Yitzhak Zuckerman put to the Polish underground.</span> <span id="s1756">He said we are willing to fight, fight but as a Jewish unit.</span> <span id="s1757">We are survivors of the Uprising of the Warsaw ghetto and we will fight as fighters, as Jewish fighters.</span> <span id="s1758">They accepted us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">Q:So, a number of your people did actually fight in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">A:Oh, sure, yes.</span> <span id="s1761">Many people were killed.</span> <span id="s1762">You know, the fate of the Jews in hiding was terrible with the moment when the Polish Uprising came about or happened.</span> <span id="s1763">Because all of a sudden they were exposed.</span> <span id="s1764">There was no hiding any more.</span> <span id="s1765">It was the Polish authorities who were now ruling in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1766">And it was a precarious situation for many people.</span> <span id="s1767">They estimated that about 20,000 Jews were hiding in Warsaw, and these people were all of sudden without any way of, of, of securing themselves some existence.</span> <span id="s1768">Many were killed.</span> <span id="s1769">Many were killed as Poles, you know, like together with the rest of the Polish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">04:35:51</span></p> <p><span id="s1771">Q:This place you chose to hide on Promyka Street , you were there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A:I can't hear you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q:This place you stayed on Promyka Street , you were there for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A:Oh, we were there from October the 3rd till November the 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q:How many people were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A:At the beginning there were 19 people.</span> <span id="s1777">We had two Poles among them and after a while a part left at hiding and went to another hiding.</span> <span id="s1778">And after a while we were discovered by Germans.</span> <span id="s1779">I mean not the whole group.</span> <span id="s1780">You see, we were hiding in a basement in the laundry room.</span> <span id="s1781">Now, we went to a place of one of the people who were gathered together when the Uprising collapsed and she said that we can go to her hiding place, which we did.</span> <span id="s1782">When we came there, there were four old women in the basement already, and they decided not to leave because one of the four was the mother of the owner of the apartment or of the house and she was paralyzed and she couldn't walk, and there were three Jewish old women who were there.</span> <span id="s1783">And the hiding place consisted of another cubicle, another room in that basement, which was normally the laundry room.</span> <span id="s1784">But instead they removed the door leading from the main basement room to the laundry and substituted the door by a shelf, by a, by a wooden structure with perpendicular shelves and they put all kinds of stuff on the shelves, books, cups, I don't know what there was, to mask the entrance to the laundry room, and that's where we spent terrible weeks, you know, without food, without water, without, with problems with a dog, with problems with excrements, you know, with problems with Germans coming down from every then and now into the basement because they were, you know, they were plundering in the, in the neighborhood, you know.</span> <span id="s1785">The houses were, you know, abandoned.</span> <span id="s1786">There in many household where they could collect very valuable things.</span> <span id="s1787">That's what they were doing in the neighborhood where we were hidden too.</span> <span id="s1788">And they were coming down to the basement every time, but luckily they did not discover the hidden fighters behind that shelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">04:39:04 But one day they found us, not the whole group.</span> <span id="s1790">They found me and one of the old women.</span> <span id="s1791">Her name was Sabinka.</span> <span id="s1792">We were those two, we were the two people who were going out day after day to find some food in the abandoned houses.</span> <span id="s1793">And one day they found us.</span> <span id="s1794">The Germans, there was a German patrol of SS police and they found us.</span> <span id="s1795">Well, I can't go into detail, it's a long story.</span> <span id="s1796">But, the point is that the next day they sent a wagon with a horse and a gendarme and they took me and the four old women and they took us out from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1797">It turned out to be beneficial because I was able to organize some help for the people hidden behind the shelf.</span> <span id="s1798">And among them were the very important people that like Ichak Cukierman, Zivia Lubetkin, Marek Edelman, who were at the top of the Jewish fighting organization.</span> <span id="s1799">Tovie Borzykowski and others, people that really counted.</span> <span id="s1800">And help was organized.</span> <span id="s1801">There was a rescue mission sent to that place and they succeeded to take them out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">Q:In reading...I don't need to ask you to go through all of the details of daily life there because you've described it very well in your manuscript, but there are certain aspects that were very interesting to me.</span> <span id="s1803">One is that you, in spite of these very, very difficult conditions every day, you had ways to kind of keep your self, keep your spirits alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A:Well, and you want to know how I did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q:Or how, as a group.</span> <span id="s1806">How you kept your morale up, how you kept yourself mentally active?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A:As a group, there were different phases of the existence.</span> <span id="s1808">Most of the time you know, depending on which time of the five years we are talking, there were times when I was completely on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q:No, I'm talking about in this house on Promyka Street .</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A:Oh, oh, that was a very interesting period because you know we were like 15 people after the five left and we were, you know spread on the floor and here we are.</span> <span id="s1811">We can't go out, so we used to stay all day long in that hiding and only in the evening we used to go out, you know, and, to relieve ourselves, to cook something if there is, if there was something to be cooked.</span> <span id="s1812">And, you know, to shave or to wash, wash, if you had some water, because we didn't.</span> <span id="s1813">And, like I said, we were often plagued by visits of Germans coming down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">04:42:41 But we found one way of relieving the tension, which was enormous, you know.</span> <span id="s1815">You live with that pent up anxiety, was a pent up fear that you can be discovered any moment.</span> <span id="s1816">And there were such moments because the Germans started to build a trench in front of our house.</span> <span id="s1817">It was supposed to be a barricade before the onslaught of the Russian army.</span> <span id="s1818">And the window from that basement, from that laundry room, was camouflaged by sacks of sand.</span> <span id="s1819">But as they were building this trench, the sacks were falling off and the sand was coming off from the windows and they could look into the windows and see us on the floor there.</span> <span id="s1820">So, the danger became very eminent.</span> <span id="s1821">You know, like I said at the beginning, I'm not a religious person, but, this was one of the miracles that happened, that people were not discovered.</span> <span id="s1822">I don't know how the history of the Jewish uprising in the ghetto would look today if these people were caught and, and annihilated because you know history is made by, by what people tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q:What, so, what did you do to relieve the tension?</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A:We established at one time a system by which every day a person would, would have a presentation, whether a lecture or talk about something.</span> <span id="s1825">We had one guy in the group who was like our living calendar.</span> <span id="s1826">A very nice guy.</span> <span id="s1827">His name was Zygmaunt Warman.</span> <span id="s1828">He was a lawyer by profession.</span> <span id="s1829">A tall, big guy.</span> <span id="s1830">Unfortunately he became sick in that hiding and he was coughing constantly and he was a mortal danger when the Germans were coming out and there were situations when the Germans were in the main room where the old women were.</span> <span id="s1831">The four old women were in a separate room.</span> <span id="s1832">We were in the laundry hiding.</span> <span id="s1833">Anyway, this Zygmaunt became our living calendar.</span> <span id="s1834">Each morning he would wake us up and said, "Hello everybody,"...let's say..."today is October 15, Wednesday, 1944."</span> <span id="s1835">So, at least we didn't lose the track of time.</span> <span id="s1836">We knew what day it was.</span> <span id="s1837">And like I said, everybody would, would tell a story, you know, something.</span> <span id="s1838">So, we kept ourselves this way.</span> <span id="s1839">Somehow to die from boredom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1840">04:45:42</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q:Now, this may or may not be an appropriate question.</span> <span id="s1842">But here you all are, 15 people in a very small space, day in, day out.</span> <span id="s1843">Obviously there wasn't much privacy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A:No, there was no privacy at all.</span> <span id="s1845">And in the beginning of course, we were, you know, in a very awkward position, you know, because we, some of us didn't know the other people.</span> <span id="s1846">But after a while when you live under this kind of conditions, you know, privacy flees out through the window...there was no window!</span> <span id="s1847">Anyway, there was no privacy.</span> <span id="s1848">You couldn't, you see, we had a sink in that room, being a laundry, we had a sink and it was a blessing, because you can go and urinate, but you couldn't do the other thing in the sink, so we had to wait till the night.</span> <span id="s1849">And we were also dressed, very, in very weird costumes, costumes.</span> <span id="s1850">I mean, we were dressed in what we could find in the adjoining abandoned buildings, you know, nightshirts or gowns or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1851">Some ball gowns, you know, we were looking weird, especially the girls, you know.</span> <span id="s1852">So, when somebody was going to the sink, there were all kinds of comments and... No privacy, you are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q:You've certainly maintained some humor, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A:What's that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q:You've maintained some humor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A:Yeah, sure, I mean, usually people try to be people as long as they can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q:Were there, I mean I know that prior to this you talked about the fact that there were strict moral codes.</span> <span id="s1858">But I can't believe that people living in this intimacy, so much need to relieve tension, that there weren't sexual relationships.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">A:You are quite right about that, and the truth is that there were couples among these people, you know.</span> <span id="s1860">Couples from before the war, and these people of course were together.</span> <span id="s1861">Besides, you were lying on a floor of a small room in a way that one body touched the other body.</span> <span id="s1862">There was no way you could escape it, you know, and there was some sexual activity among the people, in a surreptitious way, but there was.</span> <span id="s1863">But like I said, the majority were couples anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1864">Q:But even those of you who were not couples there, it had to be...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A:Even those who were not couples they became couples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">04:48:35</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">Q:For the time being?</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">Q:Did you have a boyfriend amongst them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q:So, after a month and a half or so, you left with the Germans, but the Germans weren't going to hurt you, they were just getting you out of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A:Yeah, well, they were about to shoot us, but there was a moment, again a miraculous moment which saved us from being shot.</span> <span id="s1873">When the Germans caught us they put us under the wall and the wall was facing the house in which the people were hidden.</span> <span id="s1874">And they separated me from Sabinka, which was one of the older women and one of the Germans evidently the commander of the group came up to me and asked for papers, you know, documents, identification.</span> <span id="s1875">Luckily I didn't throw away my, my id.</span> <span id="s1876">Many Poles threw away their identification because it's the end of the Germans, it's Poland again.</span> <span id="s1877">This euphoria of the first day of the Uprising was enormous, you know, such a burst out of Polish patriotism.</span> <span id="s1878">So, many people were throwing away their papers.</span> <span id="s1879">They don't want any German papers anymore.</span> <span id="s1880">I was lucky not to throw away mine.</span> <span id="s1881">And I showed them my papers, and another German was interrogating Sabinka a few yards away from me.</span> <span id="s1882">He asked... the German who was interrogating me asked me, "Who's she?"</span> <span id="s1883">I said, "She's my grandmother."</span> <span id="s1884">Because we agreed among ourselves that if we are caught I would say that she is my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1885">"She's my grandmother."</span> <span id="s1886">"What's her name?"</span> <span id="s1887">I didn't know what her name was except that, Sabinka, you know.</span> <span id="s1888">I knew only her name, I said "Sabinka."</span> <span id="s1889">He said, "Her full name?"</span> <span id="s1890">I couldn't say that I don't know the full name of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s1891">So I said any name that came to my head.</span> <span id="s1892">At that moment, he came over to the other German and checked the papers of her and he saw a completely different name.</span> <span id="s1893">He came back to me and started slapping me over the face.</span> <span id="s1894">You little slut, you Polish slut.</span> <span id="s1895">Slapping me on the face.</span> <span id="s1896">You are cheating, you are telling lies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">04:51:26 And here I have in front of me, you know, we were under the, you know, against the wall and in front of us was a group of maybe twenty German policemen.</span> <span id="s1898">All with their weapons ready to shoot.</span> <span id="s1899">At that moment, Sabinka who was, she was, she knew German perfectly.</span> <span id="s1900">She had an excellent command of the German language, she pulled that, my interrogator by the sleeve and said she wants to tell him something.</span> <span id="s1901">You know, the Germans were always impressed when somebody addressed them in the German language.</span> <span id="s1902">So, he was listening to her story and it was a fantastic story.</span> <span id="s1903">I don't know how she came up with that story.</span> <span id="s1904">She told them that she's a virgin and she was at that time, 75 or 76 years old, but in the family it was a secret.</span> <span id="s1905">They didn't want the children to know that she is a, a virgin, so they invented a name to say the children that she was married and the name that I gave is that invented name.</span> <span id="s1906">The German couldn't care less about the whole story.</span> <span id="s1907">What was funny to him that he has in front of him a 75 year old woman who says she is a virgin.</span> <span id="s1908">And he called the whole group and he said, "Look, here is a 75 year old virgin."</span> <span id="s1909">The point is that they started to laugh and the tense atmosphere , all of a sudden was, you know, the pent up tension dissipated.</span> <span id="s1910">And the commander sort of changed his mind.</span> <span id="s1911">He said okay you skunks or whatever he, epitaph he used, tomorrow you are out of here.</span> <span id="s1912">I'll send a wagon and you will be out of here, and that's how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q:Was your future husband Abraham in that hideout with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A:No.</span> <span id="s1915">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q:He wasn't with you at that point yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1917">A:No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">04:54:02</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q:(Technical conversation) So, at that point, when you got out, just an impression when you were able to leave your hideout and you could see a little bit more of the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A:It was a ghost city.</span> <span id="s1921">Can you imagine a metropolis of a million inhabitants to be all of a sudden empty of people.</span> <span id="s1922">It's a thing that is hard to, to visualize, even to tell about it.</span> <span id="s1923">You go through streets, which are torn apart by bombs, craters here and there, you know, caused by the bombs.</span> <span id="s1924">Houses demolished, either by crashing bombs or burned out.</span> <span id="s1925">Lots of people, dead people I mean, corpses, around the area.</span> <span id="s1926">It's more than the human language is able to, to describe, you know.</span> <span id="s1927">When I remember all these things, you know, it was, I think it was...sometimes people dream about terrible things.</span> <span id="s1928">They have nightmares.</span> <span id="s1929">This was a nightmare turned into reality.</span> <span id="s1930">The reality was more horrifying than any nightmare.</span> <span id="s1931">So we went through that, you know, they caught us on Zoliborz(Jalibusch) , which is, which is next to the Vistula, and in order to get to the, out of Warsaw, we had to go through the entire city.</span> <span id="s1932">So, it was hours of traveling and I had this chance of see that devastating city, you know.</span> <span id="s1933">It broke my heart to see so many killed children, you know, so many women, in most unbelievable positions how people ended their lives, you know.</span> <span id="s1934">With swarms of flies and rats running around them.</span> <span id="s1935">The terrible smell of burned domiciles of, of dead people.</span> <span id="s1936">You know, sometimes in westernized movies you see ghost towns, they look laughable in comparison, what, what Warsaw looked like.</span> <span id="s1937">Finally we came to a check point because some people had permissions to come into Warsaw to take out their belongings, but they were not allowed to take out jewels or money.</span> <span id="s1938">Who was caught with that stuff was killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s1939">When we arrived at that checking point, the whole area was strewn with corpses by people who were caught smuggling out jewels and money from Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">04:57:30 And I had money on myself, which Cyvia Lubetkin gave me in case I would be able to organize some help for them.</span> <span id="s1941">I put it into my garter and when we arrived at that checking point, the Germans ordered everybody out from the wagon, except for the paralyzed old woman who couldn't move.</span> <span id="s1942">We ordered to undress.</span> <span id="s1943">So even, it was November, it was cold.</span> <span id="s1944">In Poland November is pretty cold.</span> <span id="s1945">We had to undress almost completely.</span> <span id="s1946">I remember he was turning off the heels of my boots to see if I didn't hide there anything because many Poles hid their belongings, their money.</span> <span id="s1947">And he was, you know, they were, he had the long whip in his hand and he was, you know, going through my body with that whip and he ordered me to, to stand with my legs spread out.</span> <span id="s1948">He was checking me all over my body, but he didn't find the money in my girdle, my garter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">Q:He was checking you all over your body?</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q:With a whip?</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">A:With the whip.</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">04:59:06</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Tape #5</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">05:01:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q:The only thought I have between this period on Promyka Street and the time when you were liberated is, you had mentioned that you were able to help the people who were still in that cellar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q:Is that something that you maybe should talk about a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A:Yes, well, yes.</span> <span id="s1960">I found myself on the outskirts of Warsaw and there were different localities, you know, that were connected by EKD, which stands for Elektryozna Kolejka Dojazdowa, which was a train system which were connecting these places.</span> <span id="s1961">And we disbursed along this line, hiding in different places and I was in one of these places and I was looking desperately for people to organize this rescue mission but where am I going to, to whom, to where.</span> <span id="s1962">And again, a miracle, just by chance I met two Jewish women who were hiding on the Aryan side and one of them, her mother was in touch with a..</span> <span id="s1963">.</span> <span id="s1964">she was a physician, and she got in touch with a director of a hospital in one of these suburban localities and the director of that hospital organized a rescue squad.</span> <span id="s1965">There were six I believe people who were given orders to rescue people, not insurgents, but just people, from a certain point.</span> <span id="s1966">And they came, and they came like fifteen minutes...you see, like I mentioned before, the Germans were building a trench in front of the house.</span> <span id="s1967">And at mid day they went for a break, for a lunch break and the rescue squad came within these fifteen or twenty minutes of that break.</span> <span id="s1968">Isn't that something?</span> <span id="s1969">Miraculous.</span> <span id="s1970">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">05:03:41</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q:Where were you at the time you were liberated?</span> <span id="s1973">Tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A:Well, I was in a, a small locality called Brwinow, which is not far from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1975">Me and Julcia (Ester) Fiks who came at that time back from trying to rescue Chavka Folman from the Auschwitz concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1976">She was excellent, Julcia, in, in finding places.</span> <span id="s1977">In melina, she knew how to do it very successfully and we rented a small apartment in a house and we came to live there me, Julcia and one of the persons who were in that hiding on Promyka, Tovia Borzykowski.</span> <span id="s1978">And, like I said on the fifteen or seventeenth of January, the Germans came and liberated us.</span> <span id="s1979">The day before, I mean actually the night before, was a night of, of high anxiety because we didn't know what the Germans were going to do with the population.</span> <span id="s1980">In many cases, you know, they retaliated.</span> <span id="s1981">In many cases they would just expel the people to, to, for some reason and we didn't know what's going to happen to us.</span> <span id="s1982">And, again, we are Jews, you know, and Tovia didn't speak good Polish.</span> <span id="s1983">So, it was a night of great tension.</span> <span id="s1984">We couldn't sleep of course we were waiting what the next day will bring.</span> <span id="s1985">And the next day brought the Russians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q:Now, did you expect them that soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A:We didn't know when they will come, you see.</span> <span id="s1988">We expected them to come when the, when the Uprising collapsed.</span> <span id="s1989">We thought they will come in a few days, but that didn't happen.</span> <span id="s1990">This was October when it collapsed and, and they came in January, in the mid January.</span> <span id="s1991">It was such an enormous uplifting for me to see the Russian-German, the Russian soldiers coming into that little... They came on tanks.</span> <span id="s1992">During the night, the Germans were running away, you know, because the constant noise of running cars and horse driven buggies, whatever they had.</span> <span id="s1993">They were running like crazy.</span> <span id="s1994">And it was a good feeling, you know, to see the invincible German army to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">05:06:29 And then this running away stopped and there was a very ominous silence.</span> <span id="s1996">Quiet.</span> <span id="s1997">It was night and you didn't know what's going to happen in the few next hours because you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1998">I mean you didn't dare to go out and find out.</span> <span id="s1999">But in the morning, we, we saw this noise of the, the tanks are making when they are approaching the place where you are.</span> <span id="s2000">The thud of these heavy tanks.</span> <span id="s2001">They had enormous tanks, much greater than the German tanks.</span> <span id="s2002">And we looked out through the window and there they were the tshubarikis, the Russian soldiers, and we couldn't believe our eyes.</span> <span id="s2003">And you know, the constant suspicion that maybe they will go back, you know.</span> <span id="s2004">The fear that maybe it's not yet.</span> <span id="s2005">Don't, don't be happy yet.</span> <span id="s2006">Wait.</span> <span id="s2007">But as the day progressed more and more tanks and Russian soldiers were coming into that small locality, and around mid-day we ventured to go out, me and Julcia.</span> <span id="s2008">Tovia stayed behind still in the apartment, and we went to the, to the local market place.</span> <span id="s2009">That's where the Russians were congregating and some of them put up some make shift podium and they went on it and started to play their balalajkas and sing Russian songs.</span> <span id="s2010">Randy, what can I tell you.</span> <span id="s2011">It was a moment I will never forget.</span> <span id="s2012">There were three such moments in my life that were really when I felt utterly happy, you know.</span> <span id="s2013">The first was when I won that stipend to go to my high school to be able to study to learn.</span> <span id="s2014">This was the second time when I was liberated.</span> <span id="s2015">And the third when I gave birth to my second son, because I gave birth to my first son with a cesarean section and I was ready to have another operation with the second, but it turned out to be a normal birth and I was very happy when it happened.</span> <span id="s2016">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">05:09:05 Okay, coming back to the war we finally were liberated.</span> <span id="s2018">And we started to, you know, the Wisla, the Vistula was stuck, frozen, to an extent that tanks could go through the river.</span> <span id="s2019">So, we went there and we wanted to get to Praga because her brother, Bolus, was in one of the localities on the right bank, Faleniea.</span> <span id="s2020">We succeeded to get there.</span> <span id="s2021">And then the time, you know, of slowly, slowly people were coming together, you know.</span> <span id="s2022">From, I mean, Jews who survived the war.</span> <span id="s2023">We went to live in an apartment on Poznanska Street, number 38, and this became the gathering point of the survivors.</span> <span id="s2024">People who were coming out of the woods.</span> <span id="s2025">People were coming out from hiding.</span> <span id="s2026">Those who were coming from Russia because slowly there was an influx of people coming from the east, you know.</span> <span id="s2027">The Russians let the Polish population go.</span> <span id="s2028">There was a great number of Poles who spent the war times in, in the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2029">Among them, many, many Jews and they were coming back.</span> <span id="s2030">All, excuse me, and all these, all these people were coming.</span> <span id="s2031">You had to have a certain gathering point.</span> <span id="s2032">It's important for people who were coming out from their hidings or from their places of interment to, to have a point, to have an address where to come to, you know.</span> <span id="s2033">There was a committee established in Lublin, a Jewish community, and later on in Praga, so we went there and step by step we were coming back to life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q:What was it like, this return of all people from, all these people, from different areas and different experiences and horrors.</span> <span id="s2035">What was it like everybody coming back?</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A:Well, it was a very intensive time, you know, because like you said, different kinds of people were coming and each of them had a hair raising story to tell.</span> <span id="s2037">So, we were constantly hearing all kinds of stuff.</span> <span id="s2038">Things that now everybody knows because in hind sight you, you learned a lot of things.</span> <span id="s2039">But at that time, certain things we heard for the first time, like what was going on in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s2040">I was never in a concentration camp, but there were people coming from these camps and starting telling their stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">05:12:11 And slowly, you know, step by step, the terrible reality of the five years of German occupation began to unfold.</span> <span id="s2042">And people coming from Russia they had their stories too, you know.</span> <span id="s2043">Soon, we started to organize ourselves and I was assigned we were, we did...I mean...again our commanding people, I mean the people at the top of the group, like Yitzhak Zuckerman and others, I mention his name more often than others because almost all the leading people of Hashomer Hatzair died in the war except maybe for Chaika Grossman and well, we started to organize not only to, to have a gathering point for Jews to come to, but also to send out people to look for liberated Jews, you know.</span> <span id="s2044">Because when people were liberated by the Soviet Army, the first impulse of people was going back to their places.</span> <span id="s2045">That was the natural instinct, to see if somebody survived, if the house survived, if something can be rescued.</span> <span id="s2046">So, I was assigned to, to do that with another girl.</span> <span id="s2047">Her name was Krysia Biderman.</span> <span id="s2048">Actually her real name was Sarah Biderman, Krysia was her pseudo name during the war.</span> <span id="s2049">And we were traveling criss-cross Poland looking for surviving Jews, and we found them.</span> <span id="s2050">And sometimes these meetings were so packed with emotion I lack the words to describe it, you know.</span> <span id="s2051">Because the idea that we are really survivors couldn't sink in yet.</span> <span id="s2052">You were full of apprehensions that maybe it will change again, you know.</span> <span id="s2053">For, for years you were...lived like a hunted animal.</span> <span id="s2054">It, it gets into your psyche.</span> <span id="s2055">It's very difficult to get rid of that feeling that you are not in danger anymore.</span> <span id="s2056">All these self defense mechanisms are still with you, you know, and in many cases people were reluctant to admit that they are Jews.</span> <span id="s2057">In many places, places they didn't want to talk to us.</span> <span id="s2058">They didn't know who we are.</span> <span id="s2059">But there were also cases when we came and we got such a warm welcome.</span> <span id="s2060">I remember...I don't even remember which place, what was the name of the place, but we came to a small place and there was a Jewish family there and we got a very warm welcome.</span> <span id="s2061">We were tired, you know, traveling constantly and the ways and she gave us a good supper and she put us into bed and we could wash.</span> <span id="s2062">And it was real Jewish hospitality that was known before the war which was absent during the war and again, you know, it was like slowly coming back to life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">05:16:02 And a year later, after the liberation, there was a terrible pogrom in Kielce, a city called Kielce.</span> <span id="s2064">It's between Krakow and Warsaw, yeah.</span> <span id="s2065">And after that it was very hard to, to...to make people believe that they are out of danger.</span> <span id="s2066">The nightmare was coming back, and this time not from the Germans but from the Poles.</span> <span id="s2067">And many people didn't want to talk to us so we were leaving the address in case they would change their mind and in case they would decide to leave and if they come to Warsaw or to Lodz, or Wroclaw, we gave them addresses where they could come and get instructions and help and if they wanted to get out of Poland.</span> <span id="s2068">And within the first years after the liberations, thousands of Jews left Poland.</span> <span id="s2069">There was an organized exodus and there was a clandestine exodus called Bricha, but people were leaving Poland.</span> <span id="s2070">Of course there was always a number of Jews who stayed, you know, but not many.</span> <span id="s2071">Out of a population, of a Jewish population of over three millions, only 240,000 registered after the war.</span> <span id="s2072">That should give you an estimate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">Q:Did you come in contact with Polish people after the war and were they civil to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">05:18:06</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A:Sure I came in contact with Polish people because one of the contacts was that I wanted to resume my, my studies, you know.</span> <span id="s2076">For five years a book didn't come into my hands.</span> <span id="s2077">My studies stopped when the war broke out and this was during my formative years, you know, when normal people study and, you know, prepare themselves for life.</span> <span id="s2078">So, the first thing I wanted to do after the war was to resume my studies.</span> <span id="s2079">I always like to study.</span> <span id="s2080">Till this day, I regret that I couldn't study more than I did because I had to, to work to sustain myself and my family all the years after the war.</span> <span id="s2081">And the contact was with the Polish school, you know, all of a sudden I have Polish friends, Polish teachers and I was in touch.</span> <span id="s2082">But learning from the Kielce pogrom I didn't go back to my real name.</span> <span id="s2083">I kept my Polish name.</span> <span id="s2084">You know, to be on the safe side, so I was studying until I left Poland in '48 when the first -- by that time there was already a Jewish state established.</span> <span id="s2085">It was established in 1947.</span> <span id="s2086">And after the establishment, in '48 the first Arab Jewish war broke out.</span> <span id="s2087">At that point I decided to leave Poland and to join again the fighting Jews.</span> <span id="s2088">But by the time I came to Israel, the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q:Were you studying in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A:Yes I was...no, I was studying in Lodz.</span> <span id="s2091">First I did my matriculation and I did it in a school for, for adults and I could get into this school because, if you remember, my papers made me three years older than I really was.</span> <span id="s2092">And after that I even had a year and a half at the university in Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q:In what field?</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A:I studied history and English because I knew that I am going to, to Israel and Israel being, you know, a territory under the English rule I knew that English will be important.</span> <span id="s2095">I studied English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">Q:Did you work with the Bricha at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">A:Yes.</span> <span id="s2098">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q:Doing what, finding people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q:Was there any danger in working with the Bricha?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A:Sure there was danger, but it was not, you know the most extreme danger was out.</span> <span id="s2103">We knew that they will not kill us.</span> <span id="s2104">They could jail us by crossing illegally the, the frontier, but we knew they wouldn't kill.</span> <span id="s2105">So, it was dangerous but it wasn't so terribly dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">05:21:45</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">Q:Was it very organized?</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">A:Yes, it was organized, and again it was the Zionist organization, youth organizations who organized it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q:This was out of Lodz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A:Out of Lodz, out of Warsaw, out of Wroclaw (Breslaw), the main cities, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">Q:Some of the same leaders or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">A:Yeah, and new people came in, you know.</span> <span id="s2113">There were important people coming from the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s2114">Many important partisans came to the service, you know, sure.</span> <span id="s2115">There were at that time there were also people from Israel coming to Poland, from the Israeli Yishuv coming to find out what was left, who was left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q:Now, you were bringing people back to Lodz or something.</span> <span id="s2117">You weren't smuggling them onto boats?</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">A:No, all I did was give them the addresses where they can come, and many came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Q:You know, one thing sort of surprises me in all of this story and that is, you know, you were in between a number of towns, for five years.</span> <span id="s2120">How you could, how you were able to keep finding your friends and your colleagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A:What do you mean finding your friends and colleagues.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">Q:Well, I mean you hadn't seen someone in six months and you find her again, or, you know, you would go to Krakow and you would come back to Warsaw and you would know where everybody was, even though everybody was hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">A:Look, as a member of Hashomer Hatzair I was always in touch with other members of Hashomer Hatzair.</span> <span id="s2124">This was one contact, but there was a time when I was left alone without any contacts, but people, other members knew where I am, you know.</span> <span id="s2125">It was different, different times, at different periods.</span> <span id="s2126">It was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">Q:And after the war while you kept your Polish name, but people knew you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">A:The Jews knew who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q:But the Poles did not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A:The Poles finally they did know.</span> <span id="s2131">They did know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q:But they were nice enough...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A:Well, it was a different time now, you know, especially when you are young and among young people and the, the imminent danger the German danger is not around, people are people, you know.</span> <span id="s2134">I was an excellent student.</span> <span id="s2135">Other peoples like good students, and when you are attractive and young and a good students, people like you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">05:24:51</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q:When you went over to Israel in 1948...</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">A:It was '49 by the time I came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q:Do you remember your impressions on arrival?</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A:Sure, I was so happy to be there, you know finally the dream came true, because you know, we were dreaming about having a homeland of our own.</span> <span id="s2141">And finally I came, you know I remember walking in the streets of Tel Aviv and seeing inscriptions in the Hebrew language.</span> <span id="s2142">My goodness, it was like a, like a dream.</span> <span id="s2143">This, it was Hanukkah time by the time I came to Jerusalem and in the show windows of the stores there was Hanukia, the candelabras and all of a sudden the memories of my childhood, of my grandmother, everything came back to me because during the five years of the war there was no Jewish holidays for me.</span> <span id="s2144">So, all of a sudden it was coming back.</span> <span id="s2145">I had to change my, my image again.</span> <span id="s2146">First I had to change from being a Jewish girl to a Polish girl.</span> <span id="s2147">Now I had to, to crawl out from the Polish skin and crawl back into my Jewish skin.</span> <span id="s2148">These are psychological processes which are not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q:But, did it feel good?</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A:Well, it felt good to be in a Jewish state, but the reality of life in Israel was very harsh.</span> <span id="s2151">It's one thing to be euphoric about coming to your own country, and, but another thing is to meet the harsh reality, and the reality was very harsh.</span> <span id="s2152">I was right away taken into the army and I served in the ID forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">05:27:18 Another reality was, you know, economic shortcomings.</span> <span id="s2154">The country was just, you know, came into existence and there were food shortages and again hunger.</span> <span id="s2155">But not starvation hunger, it was a different way.</span> <span id="s2156">You could subside on that.</span> <span id="s2157">But the most hurtful thing, the more hurtful thing, was the attitude of the local Jews towards the immigrants.</span> <span id="s2158">The local, they called themselves sabra, those who were born there towards the olim hadashim, which means the new immigrants.</span> <span id="s2159">It was a condescending attitude and it hurt like hell.</span> <span id="s2160">They didn't even want to talk to us.</span> <span id="s2161">I remember I enrolled at the Hebrew University, I had people, young people, Jews, nobody wanted to talk about what happened to me in the war and they knew that I was a, a Holocaust survivor.</span> <span id="s2162">This was extremely hard because it's very hard to, to face intolerance and misunderstanding from another ethnic group, but it's doubly difficult or maybe triply difficult to receive it from your own ethnic group, you know.</span> <span id="s2163">And here that's how it was.</span> <span id="s2164">And there was a terrible economic hardship for me because, you know, I came without anything, you know.</span> <span id="s2165">I could go to a kibbutz, but I decided not to do it because the kibbutz would send me to higher education if they found it necessary.</span> <span id="s2166">If they found it would be beneficial for the kibbutz, and I had this urge to study to learn.</span> <span id="s2167">It was something that kept me going all my life.</span> <span id="s2168">Like I said before, I would like to study now too, but in all my mature life I had to work hard, till this very moment, I'm over 70 and I'm working a full time job and I didn't have time to study.</span> <span id="s2169">I mean I studied as much as I needed to, to keep my profession, to, to earn some money.</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">05:30:00</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q:When did you, or how long did it take for you to feel at home in Israel or for people to accept you, or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A:I don't think that people accepted me.</span> <span id="s2173">There was a chasm, a chasm between the local population and the newcomers.</span> <span id="s2174">Now, after so many years, it may be different, you know.</span> <span id="s2175">I left Israel in '68, so many changes took place there, but when I was living there...but one thing I must say.</span> <span id="s2176">The Jewish state straightened out my back as a Jewish person, you know.</span> <span id="s2177">I didn't have to hide my identity anymore.</span> <span id="s2178">I didn't have to be ashamed or afraid of being Jewish, and that made a big difference.</span> <span id="s2179">For a hunted person like myself, who had to hide their identity for so many years, to be able at least, you know, at last not to be afraid to say who I am.</span> <span id="s2180">It was a very, very beneficial thing for me.</span> <span id="s2181">To this very day, I think the best thing that could happen to the Jewish nation is the establishment of the Jewish state.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q:When did you meet up with your future husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2183">A:When?</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q:When did you meet up with your future husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">A:Oh, I met him in, in Israel.</span> <span id="s2186">Because he succeeded to wriggle himself out from Poland while the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s2187">He smuggled several frontiers from Poland to the Polish territory next to the Reich from there to Slovakia, from Slovakia to Hungary, from Hungary to Romania, and in Romania I think he came on some boat from Constanta , other port in Romania he came to...it was at that time still Palestine when he came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q:How'd you find each other in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2189">A:Well, we established contact even before, I was in Poland.</span> <span id="s2190">You saw, like I told you I came to Israel in '49.</span> <span id="s2191">And in the meantime there were delegates coming from Israel to Poland and I heard from these people, you know, about him, that Abraham is alive and he is in kibbutz Beit Zera.</span> <span id="s2192">So, we established contact and when I came we married in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">Q:It must have been something seeing him after all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A:Yeah, it was something.</span> <span id="s2195">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">Q:And you stayed in Israel for how long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">A:Twenty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">Q:And then decided to move over here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">A:Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">Q:Your whole family?</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">A:The whole family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">Q:Which included?</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A:My husband, my two sons and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">05:33:34</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q:Let me just ask you a couple general questions.</span> <span id="s2206">At what...if you had to think about this, what do you think got you through this five years of hiding often by yourself, what gave you the strength, the courage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A:I don't know.</span> <span id="s2208">You know, in terrible times like those, you live from day to day.</span> <span id="s2209">You cannot plan ahead unless you are in immanent danger and then you have to act on the spot.</span> <span id="s2210">You have to make a decision right there.</span> <span id="s2211">But I think that really what, what held me together, I mean in a sense that I didn't give in or break down was the deep moral principles that I acquired in the youth organization.</span> <span id="s2212">You know, I hear some, not sometimes, but, we have plenty of crime here in America among young people, and I was thinking, you know, why aren't they organized in, in youth organization which would give them an, an aim in life, an objective, a purposeful aim.</span> <span id="s2213">We had this aim, and we were instilled in good humanistic principles and in time of a crisis they come to your rescue.</span> <span id="s2214">The only thing I was terribly afraid of was that if I fall into the hands of the Germans that I would not betray my friends, you know.</span> <span id="s2215">That I wouldn't tell them who they are, where they are.</span> <span id="s2216">That was one of the terrible moments when the, the German police caught us in Warsaw after the fall of the uprising.</span> <span id="s2217">The incident with Sabinka.</span> <span id="s2218">The commander sent a few Germans down to check out the basement and in these moments I was so terribly afraid that they might discover these people there.</span> <span id="s2219">I would gladly at that moment exchange my life for their lives, but they wouldn't ask for it, you know.</span> <span id="s2220">And luckily, luckily they did not find them.</span> <span id="s2221">You see, sometimes a stupid shelf, which was nothing but a wooden frame with perpendicular shelves, could save the lives of prominent people.</span> <span id="s2222">That's something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2223">05:36:53</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q:Is there something unique about the spirit of resistance that drives you on, that's motivating?</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A:Look, the self preservation instinct in a person is terribly strong, especially when you are young.</span> <span id="s2226">As you get older, this instinct diminishes, it slacks down.</span> <span id="s2227">But when you are young, you want to live.</span> <span id="s2228">You don't want to die.</span> <span id="s2229">It's one of the most intensive drives in a human being, self preservation.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q:But a lot of people didn't fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2231">A:Yeah, they didn't.</span> <span id="s2232">Every person has a limit or a threshold, to say at which point they break, you know.</span> <span id="s2233">How much hunger can you take.</span> <span id="s2234">How much humiliation can you take.</span> <span id="s2235">How much physical pain can you take.</span> <span id="s2236">All these things are individual but I know that Arieh Wilner, for example, under terrible tortures, they were putting needles under his, his nails and they were burning his feet and they were beating him until he was unconscious, he never betrayed his colleagues.</span> <span id="s2237">That's where moral principles come in.</span> <span id="s2238">Some other person would say to heck with principles, I want to save my skull, and the Germans would always promise you, if you tell, we'll let you go.</span> <span id="s2239">We want to help you.</span> <span id="s2240">Of course they were lying.</span> <span id="s2241">They were always, they were perfect liars.</span> <span id="s2242">They always lied, but in order to get what they needed they would promise you.</span> <span id="s2243">So, if you asking what kept me, it was these humanistic principles.</span> <span id="s2244">You know, there is a paradox because our youth organization was instilling into the young people humanistic, good principles, but when this, this situation changed, we the loving peace people had to turn into fighters.</span> <span id="s2245">We had to forget about not lying, not stealing.</span> <span id="s2246">We had to do it ourselves.</span> <span id="s2247">We had to, to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">05:39:45</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">Q:And that came naturally?</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">A:And in the ghetto it was very hard to, to make people understand that it is necessary.</span> <span id="s2251">People till the last very moment did not want to believe that they are doomed, that it's doomsday.</span> <span id="s2252">They didn't want to believe it, you know like normal times.</span> <span id="s2253">If a person gets afflicted with a deadly disease like cancer or AIDS, or whatever brings death, the first reaction is no, it can't be true.</span> <span id="s2254">It's, it's impossible.</span> <span id="s2255">Why me?</span> <span id="s2256">Not me, maybe it happens to others but to me.</span> <span id="s2257">The first reaction is denial.</span> <span id="s2258">That's what happened in the ghetto, too.</span> <span id="s2259">When the Jewish fighting organization tried to convey the idea of the necessity of defending themselves, it met with disbelief.</span> <span id="s2260">People would come up with all kinds of, of rationalizing.</span> <span id="s2261">Ah, it happened in the eastern part, there in, near Vilna and Ponary because they were aiding the communists.</span> <span id="s2262">Ah, it happened in another place because they caught some smugglers.</span> <span id="s2263">People didn't want to admit the terrible truth that they were facing.</span> <span id="s2264">Some went to the gas chambers, to the last moment they did not believe that they are going to be annihilated, until it was too late, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q:You started to talk about becoming human again, sort of resurrecting yourself after all of this.</span> <span id="s2266">Was that, was that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">A:Not when you are very young.</span> <span id="s2268">You see, you bounce, sort of bounce back you know, the vitality of young people is enormous, you know.</span> <span id="s2269">You have a reserves.</span> <span id="s2270">You can bounce back.</span> <span id="s2271">It's much more difficult for elder person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q:Can you talk (technical conversation)...I'm sure that all of these experiences had a lot of impact on you for the, you know, afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">A:Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">05:42:33</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q:Are there certain sights, or are there certain smells or sounds that give you bad memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A:Definitely, definitely.</span> <span id="s2277">You know, you cannot go through hell and remain untouched or unshaken.</span> <span id="s2278">I went through hell.</span> <span id="s2279">Of course it affected me, and it affected any other person who, any other survivor, whether you were a survivor of a concentration camp or of a ghetto or a partisan or a soldier in an army.</span> <span id="s2280">There were many Jewish soldiers in different armies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q:So, are there certain sounds, certain sights, certain things that bring it all back for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A:Well sure, sure.</span> <span id="s2283">I'm sort of obsessed with the Holocaust, you know.</span> <span id="s2284">It's part of my life.</span> <span id="s2285">I can't detach myself from it anymore.</span> <span id="s2286">And it's a great hardship of my sons you know, because children usually get the messages from their parent through wordless osmosis I would say.</span> <span id="s2287">You don't even have to talk to them, but they get the message sooner or later.</span> <span id="s2288">When my children were small in Israel, they went in a kindergarten and they, they were, you know they had parties for Hanukkah and for other holidays, and the, the parents of these children were, would bring their parents, the grandparents of the children to these parties.</span> <span id="s2289">My kids would come to me and say, "Ima," Ima is the Hebrew word for mother, "why don't I have a grandfather or grandmother?</span> <span id="s2290">Where are they?"</span> <span id="s2291">Now, what can you tell to a five year old boy?</span> <span id="s2292">That they were murdered?</span> <span id="s2293">That's the reality you have to face.</span> <span id="s2294">And later on when my sons grew up, and it's very difficult for young people to be the so called second generation, to be children of Holocaust survivors because none of us is normal in the sense, you know, that like other people live in normal countries, you know.</span> <span id="s2295">It's a cataclysmic experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">05:45:10 It was a time there was no rule that could protect you.</span> <span id="s2297">On the contrary, the, the law was against you, you know.</span> <span id="s2298">The only law was the German law, and under the German law you were not even a human being.</span> <span id="s2299">To be Jewish at these times was a criminal offense punishable by death.</span> <span id="s2300">No matter what you did.</span> <span id="s2301">You could be productive for a time being until they could take out from you what they could.</span> <span id="s2302">But, in the end, you were doomed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q:I'm trying to understand how that affected you.</span> <span id="s2304">I know that you're obsessed with this.</span> <span id="s2305">Of course it's normal.</span> <span id="s2306">But when you say it's hard for my sons or because we're not normal.</span> <span id="s2307">I'm trying to understand how your interaction is different.</span> <span id="s2308">How those experiences impacted your values or the way you live that, that sets you apart?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A:You see, in a family, there are things you, you couldn't tell young people what the real reality was because you were afraid it might warp their emotional growth.</span> <span id="s2310">You couldn't tell them about Aktions and killings and killing centers.</span> <span id="s2311">So, you were keeping it from them.</span> <span id="s2312">But kids are usually very smart.</span> <span id="s2313">They would listen and they would pick up here and there an article, or here and there a book and they as they grew they realized and they had to face a terrible reality.</span> <span id="s2314">Because all of a sudden their parents were not normal parents.</span> <span id="s2315">Like, by normal, I mean like those in Israel who, you know, didn't make, didn't...those who were local Jews who didn't go through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2316">And we were different.</span> <span id="s2317">And childrens don't want to be different.</span> <span id="s2318">They want to be like anybody else.</span> <span id="s2319">So, they hold a grudge against us, you know sort of, you know. "</span> <span id="s2320">Why, why do you always have to talk about the Holocaust."</span> <span id="s2321">And how can I not talk about it when not only my immediate family perished in it, but the whole Jewish-Polish-Jewish community in Poland was destroyed.</span> <span id="s2322">How can you forget a thing like that and not talk about it.</span> <span id="s2323">But it takes courage to face it, and the truth also is that after the war, people didn't want to hear it.</span> <span id="s2324">They didn't want to know about it.</span> <span id="s2325">There was a time when it was taboo.</span> <span id="s2326">In Israel, in any other places, and it was only later years that sort of...I think that the film Shoah made a big change in the attitude and people started to think.</span> <span id="s2327">Besides, I think that people needed a certain distance from, in time, a perspective.</span> <span id="s2328">It was all too fresh after the war to come to certain conclusions or to certain, what would be the English word, to certain understandings.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">05:49:27</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q:So was this painful for you that people didn't want to talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A:Yes it was, it was, you see because in addition to being a Holocaust survivor, once you are being transplanted from one geographic entity to another one, once you become an immigrant it's very difficult to adjust to a new country.</span> <span id="s2332">Even though, theoretically, you know that this is your state it's a Jewish state and everybody's Jewish, but you are still an immigrant and an immigrant is automatically a half idiot.</span> <span id="s2333">You come to a country.</span> <span id="s2334">You don't know the language of that country.</span> <span id="s2335">You cannot express yourself.</span> <span id="s2336">You, you start, you acquire a few basic words and you come to a store and you're a laughing stock because instead of, of buying... I came to a store and I bought a pair of stockings.</span> <span id="s2337">I came home and realized that one is damaged.</span> <span id="s2338">I went back to the store and I say in Hebrew, you know, you don't understand Hebrew, ah well...anyway, instead of saying I want another stocking I said give me another "men" Of course she was laughing her head off.</span> <span id="s2339">What do you want?</span> <span id="s2340">Getteb and Gebber...you know, the consonants change.</span> <span id="s2341">Yeah, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s2342">And then I had to go through that process again when I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2343">I was again an immigrant, and again this transplanting process.</span> <span id="s2344">It's very difficult.</span> <span id="s2345">Again a new culture.</span> <span id="s2346">Again a new adjustment.</span> <span id="s2347">Again a new language, new habits, new environments, new requirements at work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q:I'm curious why you came to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A:I came, that's a very personal question, but to answer your question, it was not because of political reasons, it was because of personal reasons.</span> <span id="s2350">My husband couldn't find any work and we were on the thresh of poverty in Israel.</span> <span id="s2351">I was the only breadwinner in the family.</span> <span id="s2352">Well, let's not go into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">05:52:13</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">Q:Is there anything else that you want to add right now?</span> <span id="s2355">Because I think I've probably, I mean I could ask you more questions but you've given me a wealth of information and insight and I'm wondering if there's something else you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">A:Well, I would like to say that I'm glad that people slowly begin to understand what the Holocaust really was.</span> <span id="s2357">There is a whole range now of excellent researchers and people of, of science who study these things.</span> <span id="s2358">I lately read about this excellent book by David Goldhagen.</span> <span id="s2359">He has an excellent point, you know.</span> <span id="s2360">His point is that it was not only the Nazi regime, but it was...the title of his book is the willing, "Hitler's Willing Executioners" and the point he's making is that not only the regime but the whole German population was part of that terrible thing that, you know happened.</span> <span id="s2361">That they were part of the annihilation of Polish or East European Jewry.</span> <span id="s2362">He's not the first who came up with that principle.</span> <span id="s2363">Before him there was another excellent book by Christopher Browning," An Ordinary Man", and he gives an account of how these so-called ordinary Germans became mass killers and it's all based on German documents which makes these publications important.</span> <span id="s2364">Because the other documentation coming from Jewish sources, the non-Jews or anti-Semites would say the Jews have a tendency to exaggerate.</span> <span id="s2365">They are always see themselves as victims, but not with the German sources.</span> <span id="s2366">Here is black and white and they could not deny them.</span> <span id="s2367">Although there are those who denied that the Holocaust ever existed, you know, but... You know, that reminds me of a Polish saying, if I translate it into English, they would say, "If you spit on a prostitute, she would say it's raining."</span> <span id="s2368">That's what happening to all those who denied the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s2369">They would say that.</span> <span id="s2370">How can you deny obvious things.</span> <span id="s2371">You cannot.</span> <span id="s2372">But there have always been Jew haters and there are still Jew haters.</span> <span id="s2373">As long as there is hate in the world there will never be peace.</span> <span id="s2374">We see it not only on the Jewish case, look what's happening in ex-Yugoslavia, what's happening Biafra, what's happening in India.</span> <span id="s2375">What's happening in other places.</span> <span id="s2376">You would think that people would learn something from it, what happened, but in my opinion, people didn't learn a thing.</span> <span id="s2377">History, if you don't learn from your mistakes, you are bound to repeat it.</span> <span id="s2378">Some people would ask me do you think that the Holocaust is possible again.</span> <span id="s2379">My answer is yes, it's possible, because you see the German ideology killed not only people it killed moral principles.</span> <span id="s2380">Before you can kill people, you first have to kill the moral principles.</span> <span id="s2381">Then it's possible to do and you can see in the world today, where are moral principles.</span> <span id="s2382">People became sort of indifferent to calamities, and that's a dangerous thing.</span> <span id="s2383">That's what I would like to add.</span> <span id="s2384">If you ask me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">Q:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">A:Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">Photographs</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">A:This is the picture taken on the farm in Zarki.</span> <span id="s2389">Zarki was a small locality some twenty kilometers from a big city Czestochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">Q:From left to right will you tell me who's in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">A:The people in it are left to right, Motek Weinryb, he's still alive.</span> <span id="s2392">He lives in Germany now with his family.</span> <span id="s2393">Next to him is Srulek Warszawski, the one with the armband on his hand.</span> <span id="s2394">Behind him is a Polish guy, I don't know his name, a local Pole from Zarki.</span> <span id="s2395">Next to Srulek Warszawski, in the white blouse, is myself.</span> <span id="s2396">Next to me is Chagit Ester.</span> <span id="s2397">Next to her is -- there are Jews, two local Jews from Zarki.</span> <span id="s2398">I think the one next to Chagit his name was Burofsky (ph) but I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s2399">The other guy I don't know his name and driving the car is Abraham Silverstein.</span> <span id="s2400">And, standing there akimbo with his hands on his hips is Arieh Wilner--Jurek.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">This is a picture taken of myself and Ester Fiks, her pseudonym was Julcia.</span> <span id="s2402">It was taken right after the war in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">This picture was taken right after the war and we are here a group of people on the place where the bunker on Mila 18 was located.</span> <span id="s2404">We are here, of course, on the, on the, on the rubbish of that place.</span> <span id="s2405">From the left side there is Kazik, Simcha Rotem, is his real name, and I'm on the, on the white blouse standing next to that obelisk, or whatever that is, remnant of the war--of the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">Q:That’s O.K. It’s hard to see.</span> <span id="s2407">That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">06:00:06 It was the Russians, not the Germans, who liberated them.</span> <span id="s2409">Leah made an addendum to the interview release form, making it clear that the statement, "...the Germans came and liberated us," was a unintentional "slip of the tongue."</span> <span id="s2410">Leah does not permit this sentence to be reproduced.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Tshubarikis: Polish term for Russian solidiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Yishuv: (Hebrew), Yishuv literally means “settlement” but here it refers to the period in Israeli history when the land was being settled when the state of Israel had not yet been established.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">USHMM Archives RG-50.030*363 page \* arabic5</span></p></body></html>
