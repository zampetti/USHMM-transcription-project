Alexandria, Virginia, and today is the 12th of June, 1997.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Question: Like to go back and ask you several questions about your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">Q: If you could give -- give a little background about -- about your family, your -- your immediate family --</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: -- their names, and -- and occupations of your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s19">My family lived in a little town in southern Moravia, not far from Vienna, about 80 kilometers north of Vienna.</span> <span id="s20">I could trace my family back to the 17th and perhaps to the 16th century, and they probably lived there all the time.</span> <span id="s21">Perhaps they lived in Vienna, were expelled from there, and then they came back.</span> <span id="s22">And it is not impossible, but that’s just a guess, that my parents and the Jews in this area were there in the Roman times, because the Roman -- the limit of the Roman empire was in Vienna, called vie -- viento bona.</span> <span id="s23">My father was a glazier, but he had a hardware shop and he was affluent.</span> <span id="s24">My mother and her family came from the little town where I was raised, but they were very Viennese.</span> <span id="s25">And the whole population there was oriented towards Vienna.</span> <span id="s26">Vienna was the great city from which all the good things, and perhaps e-even bad things, emanated.</span> <span id="s27">In 1918, this part of Moravia was annexed by the Czechs.</span> <span id="s28">The Czech Republic was founded in 1918, but my family, as well as the neighbors and most of the po -- of the population experienced a very strong affinity to Vienna and to Austria.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I had one brother who is still alive, who lives in New York City.</span> <span id="s31">I had no sisters.</span> <span id="s32">My family was very large and most of the family was destroyed during the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s33">The Viennese part and the part living in this little town, and the -- only two cousins and my brother survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Is your brother older or younger than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: My brother is 85, I’m 80.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Was your mother a -- a homemaker, managed the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: Yes, my mother was a homemaker.</span> <span id="s38">She was a very, very good cook.</span> <span id="s39">She was a very -- lady always of good spirit.</span> <span id="s40">She was -- she did many good deeds out -- spontaneously.</span> <span id="s41">She had poor people, or people who were -- who were in need, and she was a very warm person and also her whole attitude was Viennese.</span> <span id="s42">For instance, she would sing all the time, and would sing Viennese songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Well, in my time, only my grandfather was religious.</span> <span id="s45">He went every day to the synagogue, but he said it’s nonsense what they are saying there.</span> <span id="s46">Yet he insisted to go there because he said one has to maintain the tradition.</span> <span id="s47">Not to go there would be a kind of betrayal of our ancestors.</span> <span id="s48">And the rest of my family was not religious.</span> <span id="s49">At the high holidays they perhaps would to the synagogue, but not otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What about your family’s politics, your father and mother’s politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Well, you know, my father had the great experience of the first World War.</span> <span id="s52">And he, like all the grownups who lived in my time were against the war, were for democracy, were against the Hapsburgs.</span> <span id="s53">So now, as I read history, it turns out that the Hapsburgs were really protectors of the Jews.</span> <span id="s54">They were not against the Jews.</span> <span id="s55">They used the Jews and protected them, that is to say, at least in the last two centuries, as least since Joseph the second, who contributed to the emancipation of the Jews who lived between 1780 and 1790.</span> <span id="s56">He was emperor of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: When Hitler came to power did your -- was your discussion in -- among your f-father and mother ab-about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well, it was not only when Hitler came to power.</span> <span id="s59">My parents and the whole population was politically very interested, very interested.</span> <span id="s60">And I remember that as a little boy, six years old, I saw the Nazis marching with the red flag, with the swastika in their flag.</span> <span id="s61">But these people were not considered to be our enemies, because the personal relations with them were very good.</span> <span id="s62">So they were in principle against the Jews, but not in practice.</span> <span id="s63">And the -- when Hitler won a great victory in the elections of 1830 -- of 1930, then the Nazi wer -- Nazi problem and the Hitler problem became very acute because we knew very well, we understood very well that might affect us.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: So let me say, we followed it very, very, very closely and although I was a young person, I didn’t have much experience, I know a lot about the initial time of the Hitler regime because it fascinated us and we knew, we realized we have a vital interest in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Were you close with your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s68">We -- we were very close, even though there was an age difference of five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: You played together, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s70">A: We played together.</span> <span id="s71">Of course, he was the -- the model, the role model whom I followed.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: Is he still?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: No, but it’s in a different stage of our life.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: I wanted to jump way ahead --</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: -- to your meeting with Elizabeth and your f-friendship with --</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: -- with her and the first time you met her.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s80">Well, we met in Paris in 1939.</span> <span id="s81">We were refugees, and we were really at the lowest level of society because we had no country to protect us.</span> <span id="s82">The French didn’t like u -- not -- didn’t like us, not personally, but they had too many refugees, there was unemployment in France, and at this time I met Elizabeth in Paris, in the summer of 1939.</span> <span id="s83">She went -- she participated in a club of young [indecipherable] and I once came there and participated in this club, too.</span> <span id="s84">A kind of club, it wasn't a real club.</span> <span id="s85">And that’s where we met.</span> <span id="s86">And that was before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s87">That was in May 1939 and the war broke out at the beginning of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: And did you become friends then?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Oh, we became friends from the very beginning, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: What was it that was the attraction between the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, that’s very difficult to say.</span> <span id="s92">You know, many great philosophers have th -- have thought about the reasons which attract men and women.</span> <span id="s93">I think it’s very difficult to say.</span> <span id="s94">But it was also a tragic time.</span> <span id="s95">We met in May 1939 for the first time, the war broke out at the beginning of September.</span> <span id="s96">I volunteered for the army, so we were separated.</span> <span id="s97">I came back on leave in December 1939 and then again in -- at Easter time, I think in -- in May -- March or April 1939.</span> <span id="s98">And then the war separated us completely, but we met after the war by chance, in a little village in southern France and were for a short while together, but a couple of months later, I was interned in a concentration camp in France.</span> <span id="s99">That was after the defeat of France and so we -- we -- we didn’t lose contact, because we were in correspondence, but in December 1941, Elizabeth and her family left France for America.</span> <span id="s100">So I didn’t see her from ninet -- from 1940 until 1947 where we met again in England and then we married.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You also were -- you knew her mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Oh yes, I knew her family very well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: What was your relationship with her father?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Very friendly relationship.</span> <span id="s105">Her father was a very, very highly educated and highly intelligent person, so it was very nice and interesting to talk to him and s -- her mother was a very nice lady and a very friendly lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">Q: And at one point in the video you said you couldn’t stay with them, you had -- you went off --</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: I couldn’t stay with them because when I was reunited with Elizabeth and with her parents, her parents -- her father was not yet demobilized and they had no money and nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s108">I remember the whole family, that is to say, Elizabeth’s father, Elizabeth’s mother, Elizabeth and for a couple of days even I ate the ration which her father got from the military.</span> <span id="s109">So one meal for four or five people.</span> <span id="s110">That made it impossible to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Well now I want to jump ahead further, past --</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: -- the war, to liberation.</span> <span id="s114">And I wanted to ask you what happened -- if you could recount what happened immediately following liberation, where you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Well, my libern -- liberation is a very long story.</span> <span id="s116">I de-decided in -- to evade and not to go along with the SS on their hung -- on their death marches.</span> <span id="s117">I was in hiding and then the Russian army came and I went back -- I tried to go back to Czechoslovakia, but there was still war, you couldn’t go back.</span> <span id="s118">So I very los -- sl-slowly drifted back to Czechoslovakia and from there to my former home where there was nobody left.</span> <span id="s119">And I stayed another year in Czechoslovakia and that was the beginning of communism, but it was not the communists in power, but you felt it.</span> <span id="s120">So in 1946 I got a visa to go to England where I stayed another year and then I left England for America and came into America in February 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: When -- when -- immediately after you were liberated, what did you have in your possession?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: Nothing at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I had nothing.</span> <span id="s125">As a matter of fact, four months -- no, no, that’s not correct, two months after my liberation, I got the first document which established my identity.</span> <span id="s126">Before -- and I still have it, I had proofs that I was deloused, see, because in Polish towns they tried to prevent the spread of lice, all of us had lice.</span> <span id="s127">So they gave you a paper that you have been in a place where they disinfected you.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: How was your health, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: My -- I recovered very fast.</span> <span id="s130">I had the very good physically constitution, in spite of the fact that I was fo -- over four years in concentration camps, and I was over four years or even longer hungry.</span> <span id="s131">And in spite of the fact that wa -- I collapsed twice due to hunger, I recovered very fast.</span> <span id="s132">Very, very fast.</span> <span id="s133">And I -- my liberation took place in January 1945, and in May, June, I looked absolutely normal and I felt very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Do you remember your first full meal after liberation, what that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yes, there I got a little bit sick.</span> <span id="s136">We crossed the Czech frontier in February 1945 coming from Poland and we were received by chance, by a Jewish family which had been hidden in the mountains and had come back.</span> <span id="s137">And they had -- they came back to their own house, there was plenty of food and great comfort and they were extremely friendly to us.</span> <span id="s138">And sure, the first meals made me sick, but that was temporary.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: You ate too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: I don’t know, but it made me sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Had you been thinking when you were in the concentration camp what it was you would want to do when you -- if and when you were freed, or you got your freedom?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: No, that was impossible, I mean, our main concern was not to be killed.</span> <span id="s143">And so what we would do afterwards was beyond us.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: So when you were li -- when you got your freedom, what were your plans, what were you thinking?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: I had no plans, and most of those who survived had no plans, because the impact of the concentration camp was overwhelming and it was very difficult to find your orientation under these new circumstances.</span> <span id="s146">We had no plans.</span> <span id="s147">And if I had a plan it was later on my wish to be reunited with Elizabeth and to go to America.</span> <span id="s148">So if there was any element of a plan, it was America.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you know the whereabouts of -- of your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: Oh yes, I know it very, very wer -- in great detail, for the following reason.</span> <span id="s151">When I came back to Brno, to Moravia, there was a man who had been with one foot in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s152">He had converted from Judaism and was Catholic, he had a non-Jewish wife.</span> <span id="s153">So he was always supposed to be deported but was not deported.</span> <span id="s154">He was a neighbor of ours and a nice man.</span> <span id="s155">And he called me and told me the following, that during the war a German soldier came to visit him and brought a message from my father which stated that my f -- my mother had been -- had been massacred together with 30,000 Jewish women -- women and my father and the husbands and the relatives had to look on.</span> <span id="s156">And this German soldier was behind where my father and his colleagues were.</span> <span id="s157">They were -- they formed a kind of outer chain, then there came my father and the men, then came the SS and then came my mother and all the women, who perhaps had to -- probably wi -- had to dig their own grave.</span> <span id="s158">So that was one -- and as proof of the veracity of this story, my father gave to this man, who was a very decent man, who happened to be in the army, a picture of mine, a photo of when I was about 11 years old.</span> <span id="s159">A couple of days later I met a young man in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s160">His name was Spitzer, I still remember it.</span> <span id="s161">And th -- after he heard my name, he told me that he had been with my father in a concentration camp in Lublin, and he knew my father very well and he confirmed the story, my father had told him the story which I heard from this former neighbor of ours.</span> <span id="s162">And I said goodbye to this young man by the name of Spitzer and two days later it occurred to me, I have to see him again and talk more with him.</span> <span id="s163">I couldn’t find him any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: And when you were liberated, you -- you knew that your father had -- had been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: When -- you know, I was liberated under very dramatic circumstances, the SS evacuated some 5,000 of those who were with -- had been with me in the camp, that was Auschwitz number three.</span> <span id="s166">And there were, however, other prisoners who had come into the camp, and many of them were massacred by the SS after the people who were originally with -- with -- with me in the camp, had been -- had left the camp and were on this -- on these death marches.</span> <span id="s167">And the camp was -- th- the SS set fire on the camp and it was very miraculous that I escaped and survived.</span> <span id="s168">And it wa -- it was from this camp, which happened to be between the German and the Russian front -- we were in between -- that I escaped into the Russian side and to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And had you heard news about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s171">I -- you know, I wasn’t shocked when I heard the story about my -- I was shocked about the way my mother died, but it was self understood for me that my whole family is dead.</span> <span id="s172">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: You had a feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Oh, a feeling, a-a-absolutely sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: And -- and when was it confirmed, when y --</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, it was confirmed when I talked to these men in -- it was perhaps in June, July 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: And he also told you about not only your mother but your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: About my mother, my father, that’s right, yes.</span> <span id="s179">Well, fo -- he didn't know about my father.</span> <span id="s180">He knew only abou-about my father had -- th-the message of my father and di -- the death of my father was confirmed by this young man, Spitzer.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And what about your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: My brother was in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: And did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s185">When I was deported from France, I managed to send him a postcard saying I am returning home, I don’t like it.</span> <span id="s186">He understood.</span> <span id="s187">I couldn’t say exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s188">And it is -- it was probably a French policeman who mailed -- who mailed this card, because I couldn’t mail it.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Was he in -- in Britain for the duration of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: He was in Britain for the duration of the war, he came shur -- to Britain shortly before the outbreak of the war and he came to the United States in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: You -- how long were you in the town of -- and I don’t know how to pronounce it, Chessikakowa?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Częstochowa, Częstochowa.</span> <span id="s193">Two days, three days.</span> <span id="s194">The Russians had confiscated -- the Russians had occupied this town and had confiscated a very big building of on -- an old building.</span> <span id="s195">I wonder what it served for before.</span> <span id="s196">And in this building to establish the repatriation office.</span> <span id="s197">And there were -- there were many with us, many French prison -- former prisoners of war, French prisoners of war, a few British prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s198">Probably also, but I am not sure, a very few American pilots who had been shot down.</span> <span id="s199">And then -- well, all kinds of people who -- who escaped the Germans.</span> <span id="s200">And the Russians tried to help us but they were very clumsy and very badly organized.</span> <span id="s201">So after two or three days I left Częstochowa.</span> <span id="s202">Częstochowa is a very famous town in Poland because one of the Catholic saints comes from Częstochowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">Q: When you left there, were you with anyone, or were you by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: When I left there I was with somebody and we walked, we decided to walk to another -- to hike -- I [indecipherable] to say walk -- to another Polish town Katowice.</span> <span id="s205">And we wanted to hike, but there were -- except for Russian military wagons, there was nobody on the ro -- on the road who would take you along, who could take you along.</span> <span id="s206">So we walked.</span> <span id="s207">It was very cold, snow was very high and we walked to Katowice.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: And why were you going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: Because I had the i -- I knew the eastern part of Czechoslovakia, he -- has -- has been liberated, so I had the foolish idea to go east, east, east, and cross the high mountains in -- in winter and go to this liberated part of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s210">Q: And how long did it take you to get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Well, I can tell you exactly.</span> <span id="s212">I left the camp on the 26th of January, 1945, and we crossed the Czech frontier on the 14th of February, it was rather fast, relatively fast.</span> <span id="s213">But generally we were walking -- perhaps no -- not always.</span> <span id="s214">Sometimes we got a -- a -- somebody took us along.</span> <span id="s215">But somebody was always the Russian soldiers because there was no other vehicle on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: What -- you had mentioned, I believe, in your video that in postwar Czechoslovakia there were -- arbitrary things were happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Well, the Czechs were very badly treated and very badly oppressed by the Germans, and by the Nazis.</span> <span id="s220">And when the war ended, they decided to expel all German inhabitants of Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s221">Now that was certainly arbitrary and cruel, because not all Germans were Nazis.</span> <span id="s222">And so the Germans suffered like the Jews.</span> <span id="s223">Not quite like the Jews, but similar to the Jews, because this deportation of the Germans were under much better condition than the deportation of the Jews.</span> <span id="s224">Created not only hardship, many people died.</span> <span id="s225">But the difference was that when the Jews were dep -- deported, they knew it’s -- it’s a death march, th -- it’s -- it’s the end of life, whereas the Germans didn’t have to fear that they would be bad -- that they would be killed when they got -- they were deported to Germany.</span> <span id="s226">And the Czechs were very chauvinistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Was there much anti-Semitism in postwar Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No.</span> <span id="s229">You know, the -- the czechos -- Czechoslovakia, the Czech -- Czechoslovak Republic was very democratic.</span> <span id="s230">Was founded in 1918 and [indecipherable] 1938 and there was no antisemit -- no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s231">One of the few countries where there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s232">It has a very humane and liberal government, there was no anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s233">And the Czech government also behaved very tolerantly towards the refugees who came from Germany.</span> <span id="s234">After the war, they come -- as long as it was there the communists were very powerful, it was still a democratic regime, but they started to prevail.</span> <span id="s235">And I s -- as long as I was there I didn’t -- I didn't notice.</span> <span id="s236">There was no anti-Semitism, but I do know that under the communist regime, shortly thereafter, when they came to power, there started to be anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s237">And certainly it became stronger and stronger and in 1951, Czech communists who were Jewish were punished, and one or two were hanged.</span> <span id="s238">And they were selected because they were Jewish.</span> <span id="s239">They were Czech communist Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: How long did you remain in Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I remained in Czechoslovakia one year.</span> <span id="s242">From ’45 to ’46 and then I got the visa for England.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: And y -- and during that time you were studying, you went to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s245">You asked me before what my plans were.</span> <span id="s246">I really didn’t know what I should do, but I went to school, I went to the university.</span> <span id="s247">Not -- not very enthusiastic, not very devoted to studying, but I went to the university.</span> <span id="s248">But I really don’t -- didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s249">You know, it was an entirely new situation and not only for me, for all those who came back and who were more or less in the same circumstances.</span> <span id="s250">Not only were our families destroyed, everything had changed.</span> <span id="s251">So you couldn't find your beer -- bearings very easily.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Yes, you said you were disoriented, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s254">And you know, if you read, you know, about the book, “All Quiet on the Western Front” by a German writer, Remarque, who describes the first World War in the west.</span> <span id="s255">He wrote a second book which is called “The Way Back.”</span> <span id="s256">And in this book he describes the disorientation of former soldiers, German soldiers, they don’t find their way in the German postwar society.</span> <span id="s257">And in a certain sense you find the same thing with the American Vietnam veterans.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: And still they don’t find their way.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: W-When did you begin finding your way?</span> <span id="s261">When did you begin becoming oriented?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Well, I think only in America and only after I had finished my studies.</span> <span id="s263">When I gr -- I would say when I got my first jo -- not my first job, no, no, I had many temporary jobs, but when I got my government job.</span> <span id="s264">That was settling back on that -- into normal circumstances.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: Did you ever think that you would live a normal life after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Oh yes, why not?</span> <span id="s267">But you know, you didn’t see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Can you talk about your reunion with Elizabeth?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Well, Elizabeth worked at a job in New York City in the New York Public Library and -- and not necessarily she, but her father scratched together enough money to take a trip to Europe, and they came incidentally with the Queen Elizabeth, which was a luxury boat, more or less.</span> <span id="s270">And we met in London after these many years, and she found that we love each other as we did before and we decided to marry, and so we married.</span> <span id="s271">And yesterday it was 50 years since we married.</span> <span id="s272">Of course we never expected that -- is that we would marry -- we met in Paris.</span> <span id="s273">We were bo-both born in Vienna.</span> <span id="s274">We never expected that we would marry in the Royal Borough of Kensington, in -- which is part of London.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Well, congratulations on your 50th anniversary.</span> <span id="s276">How did you first get word that Elizabeth was even alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: I mean, I think in July nine -- th-the war ended in May 1945 and I think by July communications were possible, and I had a cousin in America, in New York and knew -- he knew Elizabeth and he knew my address, and I had written to him and so I [indecipherable] Elizabeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: And how did you locate -- how did you locate her?</span> <span id="s279">Did you write her?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: So you were married i -- after -- a week after you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Right, right, something -- something like this, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: And that was a surprise to you, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: No, no, no, we intended to marry.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Oh yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: You knew that you were going to -- to see her and that you would probably ask her to marry you?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Then, how long before you came to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: I came to be married in June 1947, and I came to America in February 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And you had to remain in Britain for awhile?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: I had, because you see, at that time American immigration was based on quotas and the quotas depended on the pla -- on the country where you were born.</span> <span id="s293">So I was not born in Czechoslovakia, I’m Viennese born, so I was in the Austrian quota.</span> <span id="s294">And because of persecution, and the Austrian quota was always oversubscribed, it was very difficult to get a visa.</span> <span id="s295">And I got priority because after having married, I was the husband of an American citizen.</span> <span id="s296">Elizabeth was already an American.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: So what was that like, coming to America in 1948?</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Oh, to come to America was very impressive and it wasn’t very encouraging because you wondered how you can withstand all the institution tha -- I mean, not the institution but the way of life that you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s299">It took some time.</span> <span id="s300">Takes every immigrant some time before he gets somehow settled.</span> <span id="s301">And that affects all -- all phases, all aspects of life.</span> <span id="s302">For instance, when I came to America, on the first or second day, I asked when we have to go to the police to register.</span> <span id="s303">I didn’t realize and couldn’t understand that you don’t have to go to the police and register.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: -- and one of the most amazing -- amazing experiences was that I had to go -- I had to have a document notarized.</span> <span id="s306">And I was told -- and I asked where is the notary public, and I was told it’s the newspaper man at the corner.</span> <span id="s307">I couldn’t imagine that a newspaperman could be the notary public, because in Europe a notary public was a man of a certain standing, like a lawyer, with a big office.</span> <span id="s308">So I went around the newspaper stand, I was looking for a sign that this is the notary public, until I realized, or somebody made my mistake understood to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: So, you were still disoriented.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah -- so -- but a -- but yeah, cli -- they are little things and I think all Americans, or most Americans -- no, all Americans except the Indians hail from immigrants.</span> <span id="s311">But the present generation and those who have se -- have -- who have been -- who -- who -- who are natives of America don’t realize what it means to be an immigrant anywhere, not only in America.</span> <span id="s312">For instance -- after all I was a person of common sense, I didn’t know how to do certain things at the post office, because your -- the way the post office worked here is different from how it works in Europe.</span> <span id="s313">Now, that’s the other way around to, if you move to Europe, or to any other country.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: And how was your English when you first came to --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Well, I could speak, but it -- it was broken, it was broken English and I really have ne -- never fully acquired a mastery of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: So what were your impressions of -- other than the examples that you gave, about the notary --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Well, the impression were overwhelming, primal -- primarily because America is more advanced in many respects than Europe.</span> <span id="s318">And number two, I came from war-torn Europe, which had fallen back beyond the time when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s319">Even in England, conditions were pretty tough as compared to pre-war times, to peace.</span> <span id="s320">And the American civilization is quite different from the European civilization.</span> <span id="s321">So there are many aspects and many details which we have to learn about, to which we have to get accustomed.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Elizabeth said that -- that it was the freedom that was remarkable.</span> <span id="s323">Being able to just walk down the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yeah, that was remarkable, not only the freedom in comparison to what happens now, also the safety and security.</span> <span id="s325">For instance, I worked -- when I was in New York, when I studied, I worked in a typewriter shop.</span> <span id="s326">And sometimes we were told by our bosses to bring a typewriter somewhere to some part of the town, to the Lower East Side, to deliver it there.</span> <span id="s327">There was no fear whatsoever that somebody would take the typewriter away.</span> <span id="s328">There was no fear at all at that time, when I came to America, that somebody would attack you, that somebody will mug you.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: So what were your plans when you came to America, did you have any?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: I had no plans.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: And how did you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: I thought it’s -- it’s -- it’s reasonable to try to continue my studies.</span> <span id="s333">And that what I did during the first two years.</span> <span id="s334">But I wasn’t sure whether my studies would help me and whether I -- whether I would succeed in getting a reasonable position, or a reasonable job.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What was -- what was it that you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: I really didn’t know what I wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">Q: You were doing odd jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: Yeah, but the odd jobs I did only because I was studying.</span> <span id="s339">I wanted to finish my studies.</span> <span id="s340">I wasn’t very hopeful that would help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: And were you going -- you were going to school while you were living in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Oh yes, I went -- from the very beginning I went to school for about two years, then I made my Master’s -- I got my Master’s degree and then I was able, with the help of Elizabeth’s father to get a job as junior instructor at Johns Hopkins University.</span> <span id="s343">That was miserably paid.</span> <span id="s344">Elizabeth worked in -- we were in Baltimore, Elizabeth worked in the veteran’s hospital and that we were -- that what we were living from.</span> <span id="s345">And then I decided I cannot continue living on such a small salary, which practically was no salary.</span> <span id="s346">I have to look for another job, and Baltimore being near Washington, I went to Washington looking for a job and I got one and I got first -- I got a very good offer in the treasury, but I needed a job immediately so I got a summer job in the Department of Agriculture, a two month’s job and s -- out of these two months became 40 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You studied political science, or what did you study at Hopkins?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Economics.</span> <span id="s350">And when was it that you decided that that’s what you wanted to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Oh, the moment I came -- the moment I came, I think the second or third day after my arrival, I decided I have to continue my studies.</span> <span id="s352">I had studied in Europe, too.</span> <span id="s353">And the question what to study was clear, economics.</span> <span id="s354">It seemed to be clear.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Why was that clear to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: Because it seemed to be a practical occupation, not to remove from life, not necessarily a research [indecipherable] you can make research in economics, but it dealt with contemporary events.</span> <span id="s357">And that, of course, was of great interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: When did you become an American citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: In 1950, bec -- I didn’t have to wait five years because my visa was based on my -- on Elizabeth being an American citizen.</span> <span id="s360">So after two years I became a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Was that significant for you?</span> <span id="s362">Was it very meaningful?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: Oh, certainly it was very meaningful.</span> <span id="s364">It was more than meaningful, it was a major event, because you mustn’t forget, we always speak about the Holocaust and of -- and of persecution.</span> <span id="s365">But the fact that we were refugees before, meant that we were odd man out, we had no legal status.</span> <span id="s366">We had no country to which we could appeal for protection.</span> <span id="s367">Nobody cared for us.</span> <span id="s368">So to be again -- to have again a little status, and what was more, to be an American citizen was grandiose.</span> <span id="s369">So that was certainly a great event.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Was it in a -- in a room or a place where a lot of people were?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: No, no, it was my cousin -- my second cousin who is now dead, and I don’t know who else went with me.</span> <span id="s372">Elizabeth?</span> <span id="s373">I don’t think Elizabeth.</span> <span id="s374">Somebody.</span> <span id="s375">Wa -- no, it was just a judge and it was a ba -- the -- the -- I mean, the event alone was -- the fact of the event was impr -- impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: What -- what did it mean to you then to be an American?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, to be the citizen of a big country, which was a free country, and a humane country, but I -- I -- I mean, I wouldn’t say I’m -- I never believed I am a Yankee, or I could become a Yankee.</span> <span id="s378">I was a citins -- citizen of the United States.</span> <span id="s379">And don’t forget, I was born under an emperor and I was an Austrian citizen.</span> <span id="s380">And then the empire collapsed, then I became a Czechoslovakian citizen.</span> <span id="s381">Then I was nothing, because there was no Czechoslovakia any more and nobody else wanted to recognize our nationality.</span> <span id="s382">Then -- so when I became an American citizen, this had many aspects, many positive aspects, but from a very personal point of view, it meant that was again -- that I wa -- I was again irregularized.</span> <span id="s383">What is a man who has no country?</span> <span id="s384">He’s a nobody in the sense of the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Q: Was there -- I-I’m sure there were negative aspects of -- of your -- your arrival to America and your -- your transition.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: What -- what were some of them -- were the hardest things?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: I don’t think there were any negative aspects.</span> <span id="s389">I was not very encouraged that I would be able to succeed.</span> <span id="s390">I mean, I was interested in economics.</span> <span id="s391">I was interested in studying and then teaching, that was very nice, in Johns Hopkins, so it was a modest position.</span> <span id="s392">But teaching there was very nice and I liked it.</span> <span id="s393">But I couldn’t see how I could return to a normal, middle class life, because during s -- up to the time I had gotten a job in the government, I was not mi -- I was not middle class, I was very far down, no, that didn’t -- that was no hardship.</span> <span id="s394">That was one of the positive aspects of America, that in spite of the fact that I had very, very, very little money, I could have a breakfast which was richer than the breakfast of a European minister of that time.</span> <span id="s395">Unless he dealt on the black market, he couldn’t have a breakfast, at that time, which cons -- for less than one dollar I could buy toast with butter, a piece of bacon on it, orange juice -- imagine orange juice at that time in Europe -- compared to Europe, and -- and coffee.</span> <span id="s396">So I wasn’t suffering in any way.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Why did you have such doubts about your ability to ex -- succeed?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Because we didn’t know how -- I didn’t know how to succeed in America.</span> <span id="s399">You know it only afterwards.</span> <span id="s400">You cannot judge an experience which you don’t have.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: You -- did you -- you consider yourself an ambi -- ambitious person before the war?</span> <span id="s402">Did you have a-ambitions and --</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: No, I am not ambitious, but I am interested in many things, and I am particularly interested in history, not only for academic reasons, but I lived through it.</span> <span id="s404">You know, we -- we lived in Czechoslovakia and during my earlier life in a very, very upsetting time.</span> <span id="s405">I mean, the collapse, for instance, of Austria was a major, major event.</span> <span id="s406">And the collapse of Czechoslovakia, the abandonment of -- of the Czechs [indecipherable] England.</span> <span id="s407">All these were major events which affected us, of course.</span> <span id="s408">So, it was difficult to find, at the beginning, a satisfactory orientation.</span> <span id="s409">One didn’t know what’s going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Di-Did people wa -- in your first few years in America, did people ask you where you were from, what had happened to you?</span> <span id="s411">Were they curious, did you talk to them about what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, you know, when you asked for -- when you applied for a job in New York City, people were not allowed to ask you where you are coming from.</span> <span id="s413">It’s -- you know, in -- in order to -- to avoid any discrimination.</span> <span id="s414">But on the other hand, people had not the slightest idea of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s415">That’s a phenomenon that’s an -- a -- a subject which became interesting only in the 80’s.</span> <span id="s416">Once a la -- I told the lady -- I don’t know any more who it was, but I remember the event, that I was in a camp.</span> <span id="s417">And she said, what did you do to get into a camp?</span> <span id="s418">She had no idea.</span> <span id="s419">I -- in -- when I arrived in -- in the summer of 19 -- 1948, I had a -- an eczema.</span> <span id="s420">It wasn’t dangerous, but it was all over my body and I had to be hospitalized.</span> <span id="s421">And the people in Mount Sinai hospital didn’t -- also, they saw my number here, they didn’t want to accept me because I had -- I couldn’t promise that I would pay.</span> <span id="s422">So th -- there was a -- tha-that’s a very interesting phenomenon.</span> <span id="s423">Now there’s so much talk and fuss about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s424">But people here discovered this only -- well, I would say in the 80’s, not before.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: People ask about the number on your arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: No, they didn’t even know what it is.</span> <span id="s427">I mean, you know, that was, for instance, one of the great contrasts between America and Europe, because in America -- in Europe people knew about the Nazi regime, and it was not only a Jewish affair, thousands of non-Jews, 10 thousands, hundred thousands [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s428">When you heard what the Pope said when he was in Poland, he s -- he went to a place where 135 Polish intellectuals, officers, had been arrested and sent to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s429">It was German policy.</span> <span id="s430">And all of them died.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: So people weren’t asking you --</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: -- or inquiring.</span> <span id="s434">Were you telling anyone, were you talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: No, because nobody was no -- in the first place nobody was interested.</span> <span id="s436">In the second place, the few people who were interested were afraid to hear ster -- and still are, still afraid to hear stories about concentration camps.</span> <span id="s437">All this talk avoids talking about what happened in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s438">Because the listener identifies himself or herself with the person who tells the story and is afraid and shrinks away.</span> <span id="s439">I mean, people go as far as Anne Frank because she doesn’t speak of in -- of g -- of cruelties.</span> <span id="s440">It’s a sad story, but it’s not a story where all the bestiality of the SS comes to the fore.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Was that frustrating to you or would you rather have, at that point not have talked about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Well, I was always willing.</span> <span id="s443">I think one should talk about it, it’s a -- it’s a major event.</span> <span id="s444">But I was not frustrated, I mean, you consider people as being ignorant, because -- and not understanding the time in which they are living, if they show no interest.</span> <span id="s445">But I know why they show no interest, they do show interest, but they’re afraid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Was it still very much alive for you a -- at --</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Well, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Is it still?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Well, you know, the years have diminished the liveliness of the experience.</span> <span id="s450">On the other hand, due to the fact that Elizabeth worked in the Holocaust Museum, it is now nearer to me as it would have been had I not -- had Elizabeth not worked there.</span> <span id="s451">I -- what did I want to say now?</span> <span id="s452">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s453">I wanted to say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Wa -- about Elizabeth had gone over --</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s456">No, no.</span> <span id="s457">I mean, my interest in the Holocaust, I know what I wanted to say.</span> <span id="s458">In Europe, those of us who had survived ex -- talked all the time and all the time and all the time about our experiences.</span> <span id="s459">And of course you -- you learn from each other new things, which we personally hadn’t experienced.</span> <span id="s460">But on -- on -- on -- on -- on -- on -- because of this and because I was always interested in history, and I have read a lot ev -- of -- about the Holocaust before the museum started here, I’m interested in, certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: How much did Elizabeth know about what happened to you in your early years and when did -- when did you start telling her the details?</span></p> <p><span id="s462">A: Well, she knew in general what has happened.</span> <span id="s463">But, I mean, she hadn’t experienced it either, and she was in the same category as the non-survivors.</span> <span id="s464">Non-survivors in the sense of not having gone through this phase.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: She described finding something at -- at the -- at the museum about --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: -- about Auschwitz and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: -- and I suppose -- and she said she hadn’t known a-about it, so that you hadn’t gone into great detail about your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: No, you cannot, because it’s very complex story.</span> <span id="s471">For instance, I was in Auschwitz, but what was Auschwitz?</span> <span id="s472">Auschwitz was a series of camps, not one camp.</span> <span id="s473">And one of the camps was Birkenau, where people came to be killed immediately.</span> <span id="s474">In the other camps, where we worked, many people were killed, and people died.</span> <span id="s475">For instance, I was lucky not to die of hunger.</span> <span id="s476">I was once near the point where I thought I couldn’t continue any more.</span> <span id="s477">So it’s a very complex subject, very complex subject.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Do you remember the first time telling Elizabeth in detail?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Oh yes, I think that was probably still in -- in eng -- in England, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: But she had said there was a -- there was a gray period where you just didn’t discuss it, because she wasn’t sure --</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Oh.</span> <span id="s484">I never hesitated to discuss it with anybody.</span> <span id="s485">It was the f -- the fear of others, of your listeners, which we -- you noticed, which discouraged you to speak about the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: When -- when did you talk to your daughter Nicole about your experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Oh, I -- slowly.</span> <span id="s488">You cannot tell such a story to a child, still less when you’re in Germany with the -- when we came to Germany, I mean, I was attaché in Bonn, she was six years old.</span> <span id="s489">And she did -- she went five days into the amer -- an American school, but on the sixth day we sent her to a German -- on Saturday she had to go to a German school, you know, to learn German, and she hated to go to school and she hated to learn German, she learned it much later.</span> <span id="s490">And under such circumstances you couldn’t tell her where we are and what happened.</span> <span id="s491">But she learned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Maybe you can go back and you -- you started to talk about your 40 years with the -- working for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Oh yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: -- United States government.</span> <span id="s495">If you could go back to the chronology of -- of --</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yes, well, Johns Hopkins, they paid very, very badly and I also wasn’t -- I learned a lot there and I was very happy to teach there, but I also wasn’t happy about the ivory -- ivory situation of the school.</span> <span id="s497">It was far removed from the --</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Ivory tower?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: Ivory tower.</span> <span id="s500">It was far removed of real life.</span> <span id="s501">So I looked for a job and I found a job, a temporary job, which then lasted 40 years.</span> <span id="s502">And I was very happy in that job for many reasons.</span> <span id="s503">First of all, it was a rather solid position -- a comparatively solid position.</span> <span id="s504">Number two, the subject was very, very interesting.</span> <span id="s505">It was a world agriculture, world trade, trade policy, very, very interesting subject.</span> <span id="s506">And I and all those who worked in the Department of Agriculture on this particular subject were very lucky because we learned about foreign policy, we follo -- followed foreign policy developments in foreign countries.</span> <span id="s507">And from a purely intellectual point of view, we had a very interesting job.</span> <span id="s508">And I was in the Department of Agriculture.</span> <span id="s509">First I didn’t advance, then I advanced gradually.</span> <span id="s510">And -- and I -- I was very happy there, even is -- even when I didn’t advance, I wasn’t that -- I wasn’t happy not to advance, but I was happy there, I liked the work.</span> <span id="s511">And in 1959 I was appointed to be assistant agricultural attaché at the American embassy in Germany.</span> <span id="s512">I was there from ’59 to ’64 and then I was transferred to Brussels to the common market.</span> <span id="s513">And there I was agricultural attaché for 10 years.</span> <span id="s514">And I probably could have stayed there forever, but I got an offer to lead the American agricultural delegation in a big trade negotiation in Geneva.</span> <span id="s515">It was called the Tokyo round because the decision to enter such negotiations was made in Tokyo.</span> <span id="s516">So I was then s -- seven years -- no, over seven years, six years -- less than seven years, six years in Geneva, then I came back to Washington.</span> <span id="s517">I was here for two years and then I was appointed agricultural attaché -- no, counselor.</span> <span id="s518">Counselor for agricultural affairs at the American embassy in Paris.</span> <span id="s519">So we came back to France again, and that was very nice.</span> <span id="s520">So my whole career was very nice and very satisfactory and very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: And when did you finally retire?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: In 1990, seven years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: What was that like, going to Germany and living there?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: Well, you know, German is my mother tongue.</span> <span id="s525">I have, except for -- well, for the American studies and for the one year in Czechoslovakia after the war, where I went to the Czech university, I have only German schools.</span> <span id="s526">I have German grade school, German -- what is called the gymnasium, which is more than the high school here, but approximately in this category of schooling.</span> <span id="s527">And I went to the -- to graduate [indecipherable] at the German university in Prague before the war.</span> <span id="s528">After the war the German university didn’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s529">And I went for one year to the Czech university.</span> <span id="s530">And both the German and the Czech university had the names, Charles University.</span> <span id="s531">So I was very familiar with German -- and I had never lived in Germany, but still coming to Germany -- except in the concentration camp, I was familiar with their way of talking, with their way of thinking.</span> <span id="s532">I was very familiar with everything, which facilitated my work.</span> <span id="s533">At that time most, not all, but most of the people with whom I dealt, were former Nazis.</span> <span id="s534">Of course, they were hiding it, but they couldn’t hide it.</span> <span id="s535">I didn’t discuss anything with them, but you know the way they spoke, I mean, not specifical, there were -- there was no question about this, I mean, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: There was no question --</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: No, except one little incidence, but I mean they were all good democrats, they said, but they were not.</span> <span id="s538">Now when I speak of those people, I mean primarily government official, and relatively high government officials, with exception, with exception.</span> <span id="s539">But for me it was fun because I understood that -- and I mean, I could see through them.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">Q: It was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: It was fun.</span> <span id="s542">We had one incident which is remarkable.</span> <span id="s543">We ran a restaurant in a little town in Germany, Elizabeth and I, and we overheard a conversation at the next table, where one person said, no, Herr doctor, that goes too far.</span> <span id="s544">Expel yes, burning -- to burn them, no.</span> <span id="s545">And [indecipherable] said, all of them should have been burned, there are still some survivor.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: You overheard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Oh yeah, we overheard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: How did that make you feel?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: Well, it was laughable, I mean, you see, Nazism is a very complex per -- very, very complex problem.</span> <span id="s550">It requires a lot to understand why it happened, who did it.</span> <span id="s551">For instance, those who were the SS, those people who were in the concentration camps and killed people and tortured people, these were the lowest of the lowest.</span> <span id="s552">You know?</span> <span id="s553">These were at the margin of society.</span> <span id="s554">The others acquiesced in it.</span> <span id="s555">Take the German government.</span> <span id="s556">Hitler was a man who had no career before he became a politician.</span> <span id="s557">Goering was a -- a former officer who didn’t find his bearings after the war.</span> <span id="s558">They were all people at the margin of society.</span> <span id="s559">But these people didn’t kill, I mean, all -- at -- at the top.</span> <span id="s560">But those who were in the camps, the SS, the SA and those from the -- the police battalions who were in Poland and killed not only Jews, but thousands, 10 thousands of Poles.</span> <span id="s561">These people were really the -- the scum of the earth.</span> <span id="s562">Really, from every point of view the scum of the earth and they were also, I would say, the scum of the German people.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">Q: You were associating with -- with people who perhaps gave the orders --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: -- that were somehow involved --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: -- in a higher level --</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: -- and I would think that would -- that would make -- part of me would be -- would be very upset and angry at -- at having to associate with --</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Well, you -- you -- you couldn’t identify this or that person as being a murderer, you couldn’t do that.</span> <span id="s571">But you knew what the attitude was.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: But you -- you had said it was -- it was fun or amusing.</span> <span id="s573">Was there a part of you that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: Well, imagine during my stay in Germany, and even when I was in -- in Brussels, I used to go to the so-called Green Week, which was an agricultural exhibition in Germany -- in -- in Berlin.</span> <span id="s575">An exhibition which had a long tradition.</span> <span id="s576">Every year by the end of January, there was this big exhibition.</span> <span id="s577">And at two or three occasions, I was invited, together with other people to dinner by the president of Germany.</span> <span id="s578">So where I was sitting?</span> <span id="s579">Not next to him, but this was a long dinner table and I was invited to dinner by the president of Germany.</span> <span id="s580">Certainly that was amusing, it gave me a lot of satisfaction, because I-I realized, and I qui -- I thought of it, I was condemned to die.</span> <span id="s581">I was not only condemned to be in the camp, all of us were destined to die, by the highest authorities of the German Reich.</span> <span id="s582">And now here is another highest authority, highest authority at least formally, of the German Reich and I was his invitee.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: You had defied --you somehow defied them.</span> <span id="s584">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s586">So that was -- I mean -- well, you know, if a child is bad -- suppose you have a very bad child, you don’t hate the child, you try to understand.</span> <span id="s587">And I wouldn’t say that I didn’t hate the Nazis, I certainly hated them.</span> <span id="s588">And I say [indecipherable] the scum of the earth, but I try to understand.</span> <span id="s589">And my feeling is that apart from this lowest level of society, the guilt of the German people consisted in acquiescence, rather than in active persecution.</span> <span id="s590">On the other hand, there was resistance, and there were so many shades of attitudes, like these two people who -- but there were many more shaped like these two people whom we overheard in the restaurant.</span> <span id="s591">And one said expel, the other said kill, and so on and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s592">And then, how can you judge any nation?</span> <span id="s593">A nation consists of millions of people.</span> <span id="s594">How can you really judge and know what their feelings are and what their attitude are?</span> <span id="s595">And one important thing, no country in modern times has suffered such dictatorship as the German people.</span> <span id="s596">It was incredible, it was -- the dictatorship alone was German efficiency.</span> <span id="s597">And the Germans, who believed they are courageous, were afraid.</span> <span id="s598">And how could you -- how could you oppo -- if you opposed it you were -- you -- you -- you were killed yourself, or you were sent to a concentration camp, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Did you go back to Auschwitz after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: No, I didn’t go back, but not because of any fear of being overcome by emotions, but simply for the following reasons.</span> <span id="s601">When I was in Germany, or in -- no, in Brussels, I once made a trip to France and I visited the military camp where I had served in southern France.</span> <span id="s602">And there was nothing left.</span> <span id="s603">I didn’t recognize the place.</span> <span id="s604">I knew that was the place.</span> <span id="s605">The barracks had gone, there was no spirit in it.</span> <span id="s606">And I know when I go to Auschwitz, there is no shouting SS, no fear.</span> <span id="s607">What you see are remnants of a different time.</span> <span id="s608">They don’t tell me anything.</span> <span id="s609">I have my own memories, but the memories will not be revived.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You didn’t feel as though there was any use for you --</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: There is no --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Q: -- personally to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: -- no, there is no use.</span> <span id="s614">Yeah, I was with Elizabeth last year in Austria and another person who was with us wanted to see Mauthausen, and they went there.</span> <span id="s615">I didn’t go along, but not because I -- I am afraid I would be emotionally di-distressed.</span> <span id="s616">It is not the same.</span> <span id="s617">What you see are not living things.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Because Elizabeth was not at a -- a concentration camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: -- or -- or an extermination camp, do you not consider her a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: No, a survivor -- the question is what do you survive?</span> <span id="s624">If you were not in a concentration camp you’re not a survivor of a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s625">If you were not in a battle, you’re not survivor of this battle.</span> <span id="s626">No, I mean -- oh yes, she is a -- she was persecuted, she had her own experiences.</span> <span id="s627">But that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s628">One cannot speak of survivors who didn’t survive a certain -- a certain event or a certain process.</span> <span id="s629">On the other hand, there is no merit to be a survivor and nobody has to be proud of -- of having been a survivor.</span> <span id="s630">You can be -- no, one shouldn’t be proud at all.</span> <span id="s631">I think pariet -- parietes should not be applied.</span> <span id="s632">One can be satisfied, one can be happy to have survived or satisfied to have shown resistance and courage.</span> <span id="s633">But to be proud?</span> <span id="s634">The Bible says pride cometh before the fall.</span> <span id="s635">I mean, I just mention this, but there is no merit in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You hear a lot about survivor’s guilt.</span> <span id="s637">Have you ever experienced any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: No, that’s nonsense.</span> <span id="s639">What kind of guilt?</span> <span id="s640">Did they do anything wrong, that they survived?</span> <span id="s641">They should be happy that they survived.</span> <span id="s642">You know, there are many false stories, there’s a whole mythology about the survivor and the survivor’s children.</span> <span id="s643">The children are influenced by ha-having learned about what happened to the parents, naturally, but why should anybody be guilty that you survived?</span> <span id="s644">Why?</span> <span id="s645">It’s ridiculous.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: How do you think Nicole, your daughter was influenced by you being a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: She learned it gradually and it -- she understands, I think.</span> <span id="s648">You know, she also had th -- she went -- she was with us in Germany and she went to the German school, and she hated school and she hated this.</span> <span id="s649">But then she -- when she came to -- when we were in Brussels, we sent her to a school where you -- the children were taught in their mother tongue, in -- and in a foreign language.</span> <span id="s650">Now, there was however, only a limited number of languages which were considered mother tongue, and English was at that time not considered the mother tongue for a child.</span> <span id="s651">So she went to courses which were in German, which was considered her mother tongue, and in French.</span> <span id="s652">Geography was in French, history was in German and so on.</span> <span id="s653">And she learned German in Brussels at the school, not in Germany.</span> <span id="s654">No, she -- she has a very objective attitude, and you know, she has such a -- very good experiences about Germany.</span> <span id="s655">And I must say, I was going to -- I have gone to German grade school, I repeat this, to German high school, to German -- to German university.</span> <span id="s656">And in grade st-school, my teacher was a neo-Nazi, probably later on was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s657">In -- in -- in the -- in high school for eight years, the head of the teachers was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s658">And I had good experiences with him, but that doesn’t excuse they’re Nazis and that was their stupidity.</span> <span id="s659">But after all, I had very good German friends.</span> <span id="s660">Chauvinism is really a high degree of ignorance [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s661">Chauvinism is a high degree of stupidity.</span> <span id="s662">Why should one hit somebody because he speaks another language, or he is formally and really part of another nation of people.</span> <span id="s663">Only people who are very, very narrow minded have such views or attitudes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Q: Have you -- you talk in the video about the Polish officer, the former Polish officer --</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: -- who saved your life --</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Kubacic.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: -- a couple of times.</span> <span id="s669">Hav-Have you -- did you ever talk to him after the -- after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No, I -- you know, the story is as follows.</span> <span id="s671">When I was in Vernet, which was a horrible French concentration camp, but we were not beaten or tortured, we were hungry and we -- people starved to death, I was there by mistake, as they said, so to facilitate -- to ease my position, I was made assistant postmaster, which meant I could circulate in the camp and distribute -- distribute the mail.</span> <span id="s672">And one day Kubacic came to me, I hadn’t known him, and asked me wher -- and asked me whether I could give the letters and the rest to him -- to him personally, because the French officials who were in there took the stamps away and his letters had very beautiful stamps.</span> <span id="s673">And so I became acquainted with him without knowing him really.</span> <span id="s674">And when we were deported in the train, already in Poland and we moved through the city of Katowice, he was standing next to me -- you know, in the train, the train moved through the city of Katowice, he was standing next to me and he had this -- the -- the strong desire to talk to somebody.</span> <span id="s675">And since he knew me, he talked to me and he told me he’s not Jewish.</span> <span id="s676">And he cannot say what he really -- that he’s -- that he was a Polish Intelligence officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: And then he helped me -- that was at the time when I broke down out of hunger, and he was able to -- you know, he was our kapo and as kapo, he was supervising the food rations which we got.</span> <span id="s679">And he managed to let me have two of rations.</span> <span id="s680">And in this way I ris -- I recovered again.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Do you know what happened to him after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s683">Well, I don’t know, but the end of the story is -- I don’t know whether I told this in the first interview.</span> <span id="s684">I was on good terms with him, he had helped me.</span> <span id="s685">And one day he started to shout to -- shout at me and beat me.</span> <span id="s686">And I didn’t understand what has happened.</span> <span id="s687">Two -- two weeks later he had escaped.</span> <span id="s688">And he beat me and shouted at me so that nobody ca -- he was very decent -- that nobody believed that I known about his plan to escape.</span> <span id="s689">And about a year later we read in a French paper -- you know, papers were smuggled into the camp.</span> <span id="s690">There were [indecipherable] many Frenchmen and sometimes it was a piece of a paper, but there was a paper, a Parisian paper which stated that six -- six French resistance fighter had been arrested and executed.</span> <span id="s691">And they gave the names.</span> <span id="s692">And one of the names was Stanislaw Kubacic.</span> <span id="s693">Now whether it was the same, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Do you ever go to any reunions, or do you ever meet up or talk with any of the other survivors at your [indecipherable] camp --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: No, I have a friend who happened to be in the same camp as I was, but I don’t know -- I don’t know any survivors here.</span> <span id="s696">I would be interested to talk to people, but I don’t know any.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: What would you be interested in talking to them about?</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: Because, when you talk to people who have the sim -- a similar experience as you, you learn about new details which you didn’t experience, or which you didn’t know.</span> <span id="s699">Also, recollections came -- come back if you talk with somebody you -- there might be an event which you have entirely forgotten.</span> <span id="s700">And somebody mentions something in this context and the event comes back to you, and you start to remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Do you talk to your friend who lives in this area about --</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Oh yes, yes, we talk, yeah.</span> <span id="s703">Well, he doesn’t -- you know, he’s now in a situation where he talks all the -- all the time about the camp, but sometimes he doesn’t want to hear about it.</span> <span id="s704">It doesn’t matter to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: How -- is it always on your mind, do you think about it a lot, is it never far?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, you know, I had -- up to now, now my memory weakens very strongly.</span> <span id="s707">But I had an excellent memory.</span> <span id="s708">I don’t know why, I cannot explain.</span> <span id="s709">You might have noticed that I said on the 14th of February we went to Czechoslova -- [indecipherable] different year.</span> <span id="s710">I remember date, I remember many details from the past.</span> <span id="s711">And so shortly I -- but I live it, my whole past, it’s not only concentration camp.</span> <span id="s712">So, no doubt that was one of the greatest events in my life.</span> <span id="s713">If I say one, it was the greatest, but there was another one, which was of short duration.</span> <span id="s714">But I was in the Battle of France when France lost the war, and to be -- only for a short da -- time, under fire, under -- under -- under the fire of guns, it’s quite an experience.</span> <span id="s715">But that was the same in Auschwitz because we were bombed and I was in the middle, once.</span> <span id="s716">Not all the time.</span> <span id="s717">But once I w -- the bombs were falling right and left.</span> <span id="s718">So that -- it wasn't such a great experience, I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s719">It was intellectually, mentally it’s a bit -- it was very noisy.</span> <span id="s720">You know, noise is horrible.</span> <span id="s721">Noise affects you physiologically, physically.</span> <span id="s722">And that was the -- that was the day when -- when we were shelled by ar-artillery.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: I was going to ask you if there are any m -- smells or tastes or may -- and now --</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: -- noises that remind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: -- of that camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: I have the strange experience of having been led to the gallow, to a temporary gallow and th -- together with several other boys, and this gallow where they wanted to hang us was one of the cement with a kind of poster which -- you s -- you see it very often, you know, where you have a fence, it’s -- it’s a poster which is a bit -- a little bit curved, and the fence is fixed on this.</span> <span id="s729">When I see such a thing, I remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: It reminds you of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Oh, it reminds me, yes.</span> <span id="s732">But I tell you, I have -- I had very few dreams wer -- were a-about the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s733">I had some about bombing.</span> <span id="s734">Bombing was a terrible experience, but had very few nightmares about the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s735">And yet, I-I think of it, not with pleasure, but I think of it and what happened.</span> <span id="s736">And you see, if you talk with people who had the similar experience, they remind you of certain things which you might have forgotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: You had said in -- in the video that the hanging incident --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: -- or the near hanging incident had somehow receded in your memory for awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s741">Right.</span> <span id="s742">I say there, or I believe it has receded because there was an [indecipherable] to -- to suppress it, you know?</span> <span id="s743">To me -- because it was really -- I mean, even the bombs were falling, when they were beating us, when I -- when I was so weak that I gave up really.</span> <span id="s744">I was about to ga -- give up.</span> <span id="s745">I -- I couldn’t do any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s746">That didn’t give you the feeling of the imme -- the feeling of immediate death, but this event, when they wanted to hang us, that was really the next -- the next thing is nothing.</span> <span id="s747">The next thing you are not here any more.</span> <span id="s748">And that, perhaps, created in me the desire to push it aside.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: When did it resurface and did you actually forget that it happened, or you just sort of pushed it way back?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: You know, I have written my souvenirs -- my memoirs, and they are 420 pages, my whole life.</span> <span id="s751">It starts with my birth, until 1990.</span> <span id="s752">And of course a large part is devoted to the camp experience.</span> <span id="s753">And there, when I started to write this, then it came back, in all clarity.</span> <span id="s754">It was here, I knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: What year was that when you started writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: Oh, a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s758">Was there anything that triggered it, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s759">A: No, I decided, I mean, since I had a ma -- an extremely na -- a life full of contrasts and full of extraordinary experiences, I should write it down.</span> <span id="s760">And I have done, but it’s no -- really not finished, and I don’t know -- I would like to -- I would like to have it published, but not because I am l-looking for glory, or -- or for a name or something.</span> <span id="s761">Just because I would like to give it to people and if I have it myself published from my own money, that costs a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: I wanted to go back and -- and ask you one follow up question about the cement poles that you say --</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: -- when you see them, it reminds you of that time that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: -- almost hung.</span> <span id="s767">What -- what -- what feeling comes over you?</span> <span id="s768">Is it -- is it palpable?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Wel -- no, it’s not frightening, but it reminds me of this event.</span> <span id="s770">I mean, I -- I -- I think there must be such poles here too.</span> <span id="s771">I cannot see it without immediately having the association.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: You said you do have nightmares sometimes, or have had nightmares of --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: -- of the bombing.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: Of the bombing, yes.</span> <span id="s776">The -- and you know, that was an additional enemy.</span> <span id="s777">We had the -- the SS and we had the hunger, the beating of the -- by the SS, but the bombing was something -- an extraordinary event.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: I was curious to read where you thought the bombing of th -- o-of the railroad line would have been insignificant because they would have built it back up and that’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Oh yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: -- I mean, still to this day a debate.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s782">I say this because I myself has -- have worked on rebuilding trucks and I know how fast it goes.</span> <span id="s783">And you know, if -- if the -- the rail -- the -- the rails to Auschwitz had really been bombed, so the Germans would have taken the people out and shot them.</span> <span id="s784">They were able to shoot thousands, 10 thousands.</span> <span id="s785">It’s, for instance interesting that the story I heard about my mother -- and I heard it from two sources, spoke always of 30,000.</span> <span id="s786">30,000 people having been massacred there.</span> <span id="s787">In the literature about the Holocaust and about massacres, I think I’ve never read about 30,000.</span> <span id="s788">Perhaps Babi Jar, but I don’t know whether they have been killed at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: You had read -- I had read in -- in -- in the transcripts of your video that you -- you said you considered that you had a lot of luck in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Do you still consider yourself lucky, or fortunate?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes, lucky -- luck -- lucky -- chance is the right word, because chance is a double meaning.</span> <span id="s793">It’s chance [indecipherable] and it’s chance opportunity, yes.</span> <span id="s794">So I was lucky because I had -- there were chances.</span> <span id="s795">And the chances were just chance and -- but also opportunity.</span> <span id="s796">I am satisfied -- not proud, but satisfied that I took certain decisions which were very dangerous, but I dared to take them.</span> <span id="s797">One was to get in -- to get into hiding when the camp was evacuated because if they had caught us, they would have killed us.</span> <span id="s798">They were very jittery.</span> <span id="s799">The SS was very jittery, they were afraid.</span> <span id="s800">And there were other occasions where I took very risky decisions, but I felt that has to be done, that is the impor -- the thing to do.</span> <span id="s801">And now I am older -- not only older, I’m old now, which is -- which amuses me.</span> <span id="s802">You know why it amuses me?</span> <span id="s803">It amuses me because I remember my grandfather, and how old -- I mean, I was on good terms with my grandfather, but how distant in age he was to me as a boy.</span> <span id="s804">Oh, I -- I express it by showing you with my hands where he was.</span> <span id="s805">And now I am in his -- a-at -- in this age.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">Q: Does it feel -- still feel distant?</span></p> <p><span id="s807">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s808">I was in Vienna with a colleague a couple of years ago, and we saw -- we -- we -- we saw -- we passed some [indecipherable] elderly man, well dressed and very respectfully l -- I was l-looking.</span> <span id="s809">And I said to him, look, there still are -- seem to be people whom we owe respect to, but we are their age.</span> <span id="s810">We look the same as they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: I-I’m curious about the -- the fellow survivor who is your friend here.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: What in particular -- you say some -- on occasions you’ll talk about what happened in the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s814">What [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: Well, we -- we often exchange experiences, reminiscences about the events.</span> <span id="s816">I didn’t know him in -- in the camp, and he is 10 - 15 years younger than I, so he was a young bo -- almost still a boy in the camp.</span> <span id="s817">He is of German origin, German is his mother tongue.</span> <span id="s818">So -- and he didn’t look Jewish either, so he sometimes had a certain advantage from this fact.</span> <span id="s819">We had fun coming -- coming -- you know, there was one SS man who both of us knew and we called him Tom Mix.</span> <span id="s820">Tom Mix was a character out -- from out -- out of American movies.</span> <span id="s821">And as far as I remember, Tom Mix was always out either to cheat the Indians, or -- he was a cowboy or something.</span> <span id="s822">And this Tom Mix the SS man was similar, he always wanted to find a -- to -- to -- to surprise us when we did something which we are not supposed to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: So you talk about this fellow and -- and sort of make fun of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Ye -- yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s825">But of course the memories start to vanish.</span> <span id="s826">For instance, it becomes more and more difficult to visualize the camp.</span> <span id="s827">I think, for instance, he was probably in my neighborhood, in a barrack near me, but it’s very difficult to visualize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: How do y -- this is a hard question.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Certainly.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: How di -- does -- how do you think the experience of having survived the holocro -- Holocaust a-affected your out -- general outlook about life?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: Oh, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Can you talk about it, in what ways?</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: Yeah, I can say it in a -- in a few words.</span> <span id="s834">Don’t give up.</span> <span id="s835">I never gave up except when I said I almost di -- died.</span> <span id="s836">There I was so weak, I was so weak that I asked for permission to stay one day away from work.</span> <span id="s837">And you know, that was a voluntary confession that you cannot work any more, but I didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Did you have that attitude of don’t give up before the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s839">Were you a persistent person, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah, ye-yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: -- did it add to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s843">Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Just made you more --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s846">I mean, when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and they stopped the train in which I was and told us to go back, I envisaged to disregard what they were saying and to cross the frontier on my own and then see whether I can cross Germany to come to France.</span> <span id="s847">I gave this -- I gave up because I -- I thought -- I deliberate and thought it’s too risky, I mean, I will not succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: Did surviving make you -- how did it affect your spirituality?</span> <span id="s849">Did it make you more spiritual, or did it have --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: No, it makes me more realistic.</span> <span id="s851">I like intellectual activities, but I don’t like spiritualism.</span> <span id="s852">It makes you realistic.</span> <span id="s853">Incidentally, realism has its own spirituality.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: How does it make you more realistic?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Well, you see what is possible.</span> <span id="s856">You see la -- how human beings behave and you see what can happen.</span> <span id="s857">I mean, the idea of my mother -- come back to my mother, my mother, a very good, nice, non-political middle class lady to be shot in a massacre?</span> <span id="s858">That seems to be incomprehensible.</span> <span id="s859">Unrealistic.</span> <span id="s860">Completely unrealistic.</span> <span id="s861">You can say out of this world, yet it happened.</span> <span id="s862">And so many other things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: Does it make you question the -- the goodness of humanity sometimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s864">A: Human beings are neither good or bad, you know, some are very bad, because they are, as I say, the scum, I mean the lowest level, educationally, morally, in terms of their experiences.</span> <span id="s865">But there are other human beings wi -- who are very, very good.</span> <span id="s866">Astonishingly good.</span> <span id="s867">Willing to sacrifice.</span> <span id="s868">No, I think one cannot say human beings are bad.</span> <span id="s869">There are many bad people.</span> <span id="s870">You know why?</span> <span id="s871">Because they’re weak.</span> <span id="s872">And that is one of the basic explanation for the behavior of the German people.</span> <span id="s873">Just think of the fact that the Germans were one of the most civilized people in the world.</span> <span id="s874">And they were a Christian people, I mean they had to learn certain moral -- moral -- moral be -- about moral behavior.</span> <span id="s875">But don’t you do what we must not do.</span> <span id="s876">And they acquiesced in these horrible events, in this horrible policy.</span> <span id="s877">But they were afraid and fear, fear is one of the most potent motives for human beings.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Do you consider yourself a hopeful or an optimistic person?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yes, I’m optimistic.</span> <span id="s880">Which doesn’t mean that we might not anticipate horrible things to happen.</span> <span id="s881">Horrible things.</span> <span id="s882">Why, the Holocaust could repeat itself on a much larger scale.</span> <span id="s883">Or when the Jews were killed as -- suppose six million were killed, 20 million or more, it’s perhaps 30 million Russians were killed, in one way or another.</span> <span id="s884">They were not only shot, I mean, they died of starvation after the war came to an end.</span> <span id="s885">Millions of Poles have been killed.</span> <span id="s886">So there could be a new Holocaust -- I don’t mean, necessarily an anti-Jewish Holocaust, though it could be an anti-Jewish Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Do you think your -- your testimony and the testimony of other survivors makes that less of a possibility?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: Not to the same extent as some people believe in, particularly the people who founded and who promoted the Holocaust Museum, because the horror of these events is not a sufficient deterrent to prevent its repetition.</span> <span id="s889">And moreover, concentration on the Holocaust alone doesn’t give you a sufficient explanation of what happened.</span> <span id="s890">You cannot understand the Holocaust if you only speak of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s891">You have to see the whole system which ruled in Germany and which was one of the most barbaric systems in history.</span> <span id="s892">Imagine what they did.</span> <span id="s893">Not only did they kill people, murder people, but they took their teeth, their gold teeth or their hair.</span> <span id="s894">Now, the most backward people considered it anathema to utilize parts of human bodies.</span> <span id="s895">I mean, the -- the cannibals, that’s a different -- the cannibals are something quite different.</span> <span id="s896">The Germans, the Nazis were below cannibalism.</span> <span id="s897">Below cannibalism.</span> <span id="s898">So did you bring us sandwiches, Liesel?</span> <span id="s899">[tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: So I was curious why you agreed to take part in this project and to tell your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: I think it is useful to take part in the project because it may contribute.</span> <span id="s902">It does not necessarily contribute.</span> <span id="s903">It may contribute to make the Holocaust or the experiences connected ti -- with the Holocaust more plausible and understandable.</span> <span id="s904">But it probably never can do full justice to the experience of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s905">If for instance I were to tell you, or to somebody else, that one of the most horrible experiences was not hanging and beating and killing, but to be on a very cold day when it was rais -- and raining, the rain was a bit icy, in the open, and not being pushed by the SS because they went into hiding, they wanted to protect themselves against the rain.</span> <span id="s906">And standing there from six o’clock to six o’clock in the evening, doing nothing, just standing there freezing and shivering, that was an extraordinary experience.</span> <span id="s907">Or, how can one -- and one doesn’t do it really -- is in this interview convey what life is like if you are undernourished and hungry.</span> <span id="s908">If you have no soap, no toothbrush for months or years.</span> <span id="s909">I never had -- I never had the toothbrush in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s910">If you’re completely cut off in the outside world, that is to say you’re not supposed to na -- to write, you’re not expected to or -- or supposed to, or permitted to receive any correspondence from wherever.</span> <span id="s911">It could have been, if paper taken from cement bags, which were -- was plentiful and on the construction sites -- the only thing which was plentiful, serves as your handkerchief, as your toilet paper, as a means of protecting yourself against the cold.</span> <span id="s912">This is difficult to convey, but however little you can convey, may be useful.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: You seem to talk about these things with now a sense of detachment.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: Was it always that way, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">A: No.</span> <span id="s917">We were in a relatively favorable position, as far as our attitude was concerned.</span> <span id="s918">When we were in the camps, the greatest powers in the world, America, England and Russia fought against the Nazis.</span> <span id="s919">So there were our allies.</span> <span id="s920">And whate -- whatever success they had was our success, it was a step nearer to liberation.</span> <span id="s921">I always think that in this respect we were favored, if you compare us with the prisoners in Russian camps.</span> <span id="s922">They had no hope that Stalin will die, or if Stalin will die, there will be another Stalin.</span> <span id="s923">They had no hope, or hardly any hope that the regime would change and that they would be libera -- that they can expect liberation.</span> <span id="s924">For us the situation was, in this respect, different and that was the -- th -- that was the -- th-the -- the -- the idea which kept us alive and which made us hopeful.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Do you ever think about what your life would have been like had the Holocaust not taken place?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Yes, but I did -- I do not come very far.</span> <span id="s927">I cannot imagine it.</span> <span id="s928">But there was another thought which we had particularly at the beginning.</span> <span id="s929">When we were deported to Germany, the question was, why are we deported.</span> <span id="s930">And while we thought of ourselves as workers who will have to work, why do they dis -- deport old people and children?</span> <span id="s931">What sense does it make?</span> <span id="s932">These people cannot work.</span> <span id="s933">And there, I personally envisaged that the Germans are going to establish a slave county or country or area somewhere in Ukraine, that’s there -- that that is our future.</span> <span id="s934">We might be slaves forever, if we survive.</span> <span id="s935">And then, you know, there’s another thing, we must not think of it respectively in the sense of drawing conclusion on the basis of knowledge which one acquired only after an event took place.</span> <span id="s936">For instance, I didn’t know, and my colleagues, we didn’t know that the Germans are bent to kill all of us.</span> <span id="s937">Really, not only all of us, that we expected.</span> <span id="s938">We were absolutely convinced if they want, we were 5,000 in this one camp, they might decide tomorrow they will kill all of us.</span> <span id="s939">But that they are going, and are bent, and decided to call -- to kill all Jews, that never occurred to me, and not to the others.</span> <span id="s940">I mean that there was the plan of mass ec-ex-extermination, that we didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: I do -- I don’t think I have any other questions.</span> <span id="s943">Is there anything else that you’d like to say that --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: No, I have nothing else to say.</span> <span id="s945">Are you going to have this transcribed?</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: And can I see a copy before --</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">A: -- before it is finalized?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: I’m sure you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: I’ll ask if that’s possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s954">Because what I should have done before we had this interview was to write down certain points and deal with them, which I didn’t do.</span> <span id="s955">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Oh, I think you did just fine without them.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: -- and -- and then it’s a bit incoherent, you know.</span> <span id="s958">So you -- you had the systematic questionnaire.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Somewhat.</span></p> <p><span
