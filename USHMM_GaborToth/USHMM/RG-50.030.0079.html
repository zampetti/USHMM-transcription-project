1990</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Could you tell me your name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: My name is Marty Glickman.</span> <span id="s13">And I'm, uh, I live in New York City.</span> <span id="s14">I went to school at Syracuse.</span> <span id="s15">I'm 72 years of age.</span> <span id="s16">I'm married, have four children, nine grandchildren, and, uh, two great grandchildren and a third great grandchild on the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s18">Mazel tov.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: Born in 1917 in the Bronx, New York.</span> <span id="s22">Q: Tell me about your family in the Bronx.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Uh, my father and mother were immigrants from Romania.</span> <span id="s24">Uh, they lived in the town of Ia_i, where they knew each other as children, but did not, uh, really get to know each other well until they met in the east side of Manhattan, when they both immigrated over approximately, uh, in 1912.</span> <span id="s25">Uh, they met, fell in love and were married.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: And what was it like growing up in that household?</span> <span id="s27">What was your childhood like?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: My childhood was, uh, I thought, uh, delightful.</span> <span id="s29">Uh, we were, uh, a lower income family, but I wasn't even aware of, uh, higher incomes or low incomes.</span> <span id="s30">I had, uh, uh, a fine time.</span> <span id="s31">I was a, a strong young boy.</span> <span id="s32">I was athletic.</span> <span id="s33">Uh, my grandmother and grandfather owned a tenement house in which we lived and, uh, my grandmother kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, my grandfather was a tailor, and very often he'd bring, uh, work home to the house, and on, on Sundays, uh, I might see him at his sewing machine, uh, hunched over the machine--he was a rather large man--uh, working to support, uh, his own family.</span> <span id="s35">And, uh, it was a six-family, uh, tenement house in Brooklyn, and, uh, four members of the family occupied four of the six apartments.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s37">How did you, uh, as a young man, a young boy, when did you start getting interested in sports?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: Well, I was always interested in sports.</span> <span id="s39">Uh, I was always the fastest kid on the block.</span> <span id="s40">And I, I became interested in sports, uh, when I lived in the Bronx when I was five years of age.</span> <span id="s41">I remember, uh, the bigger kids on the block would, uh, have me race, uh, all the other kids around the block, uh, and, uh, the race was for them to run in one direction around the block and I'd run in the other direction, and the first one back at the starting corner would be the winner, and I could win handily.</span> <span id="s42">I could win all the time.</span> <span id="s43">I was easily the fastest kid on the block, and my father was, uh, a runner also, of sorts.</span> <span id="s44">Uh, not formally as I was, but, uh, he was also probably the fastest kid in his neighborhood in Ia_i, Romania.</span> <span id="s45">Uh, I began doing more than running when, uh, at the age of six or seven, began to throw a ball around, a punch ball, or we'd play stick ball and punch ball and all the sports that, uh, kids played in those days.</span> <span id="s46">Uh, "Johnny on the pony," "chase the white horse," and games like that, in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s47">Then we moved to Brooklyn and, uh, when I went to, uh, uh, grade school I won, uh, uh, my, uh, first trophy which was a public school's athletic league pin--a small silver pin which I still have, uh, for doing a variety of things like, uh, running quickly against time, uh, standing broad jump, uh, the, uh, rope climbing, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: What other kinds of sports did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Uh, I did all sports in season.</span> <span id="s50">I did, uh, join the basketball season, I shot baskets and played basketball.</span> <span id="s51">During the football season I played football.</span> <span id="s52">In the spring I, uh, played baseball.</span> <span id="s53">I swam in the summertime.</span> <span id="s54">I'd take a trolley car from our house in Brooklyn on Coney Island Avenue, and go, uh, to Coney Island--which might have been twenty minutes away by trolley--and swim.</span> <span id="s55">And, uh, I always ran.</span> <span id="s56">Uh, running was part of all those sports.</span> <span id="s57">And I continued to be the fastest kid around.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: Uh, at what point did your running become serious in the sense of joining track teams?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I think it became seri...uh, serious in junior high school when I won, uh, various field days, uh, where the school competed within itself and I would win the sixty-yard dash or the seventy-yard dash, and I'll never forget my homeroom teacher, uh, writing in, uh, the, uh, autograph book we had when we were graduated from grade school, at the end of the sixth year in school.</span> <span id="s60">Uh, he'd been a track man at Yale, and he was my homeroom teacher.</span> <span id="s61">And sometime around, uh, 1930 he wrote, "Be seeing you in the 1936 Olympics.‚Äù</span> <span id="s62">And here I was, uh, maybe twelve years of age.</span> <span id="s63">And he wrote that; and I still have it at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: What happened, where did you choose to go to college?</span> <span id="s65">Where did you end up?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, I..</span> <span id="s67">.</span> <span id="s68">I went to Syracuse University.</span> <span id="s69">I was, uh, a fairly well known high school athlete in New York.</span> <span id="s70">I played football for an undefeated, uh, city championship and state championship team and I was, uh, the star of the team.</span> <span id="s71">I was a tailback in a single-wing formation and, uh, I was a triple threat: I could pass, I could kick, and I could run; particularly run.</span> <span id="s72">And we defeated every other team on our schedule.</span> <span id="s73">Uh, beat a school called Roosevelt High School in the Bronx for the city championship, and we, uh, uh, were accorded the accolade of being the best team in New York State.</span> <span id="s74">We were invited to play in, uh, Miami against a Miami team, but, uh, the school, uh, forbade our going down to Miami because it was too far a trip and, uh, would interfere with our school work.</span> <span id="s75">But we were good and, uh, I was judged, uh, the most valuable player in New York at that time as a football player.</span> <span id="s76">And I, uh, competed in track and field, and I won city championships and state championships and, uh, a national scholastic championship and, uh, also played a season of basketball at James Madison High School in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s77">So I had a, my childhood was fun, uh, for me.</span> <span id="s78">My father had a tough time; those were depression years.</span> <span id="s79">Uh, his business failed.</span> <span id="s80">Uh, he went into bankruptcy; and, uh, the family had a difficult time.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you, uh, feel that you were different in any way because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s82">What was the, what did being Jewish mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Being Jewish, uh, meant going to Hebrew School.</span> <span id="s84">Being Jewish meant, uh, uh, studying for my bar mitzvah with, uh, an aging rabbi, with a long beard down to here, coming into the house and sitting along side of him while we went over my Maftir and Haftora.</span> <span id="s85">And, uh, being, uh, repelled by this old gentleman, because, uh, he had such terr...a terrible body odor about him.</span> <span id="s86">And I, I'd have to sit right along side of him; and we'd look at the same, uh, book, the same Hebrew book, and he would point out the phraseology to me.</span> <span id="s87">And, uh, it was very difficult doing that.</span> <span id="s88">I also found it, uh, even then as an eleven-year-old or twelve-year-old, uh, almost silly, memorizing Hebrew words and not knowing what those words meant.</span> <span id="s89">In those days, when a young man was bar mitzvahed, uh, he read the words but, uh, there was very little meaning.</span> <span id="s90">Because you didn't understand what the interpretation of the words were.</span> <span id="s91">Certainly you knew the Brocha [NB: blessings] and what they meant; and, uh, the Brocha for the wine and the Hamotzi and Shema, and all that.</span> <span id="s92">And you knew what those meant, but to read a paragraph in Hebrew: I could read the paragraph; I didn't know what the words meant.</span> <span id="s93">So I was, uh, a Jewish kid growing up in Brooklyn in a Jewish environment and a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s94">Uh, as I said my, uh, my grandparents, uh, kept a kosher home.</span> <span id="s95">My parents did not.</span> <span id="s96">Uh, I did not eat, uh, non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s97">Uh (laughter), uh, the first time I had pork I was at training table at Syracuse University my my freshman year--and my first meal, uh, my first lunch.</span> <span id="s98">And I said, uh, "Would somebody please pass the lamb chops down to me?"</span> <span id="s99">(Laughter) And they weren't lamb chops.</span> <span id="s100">And everyone started to laugh, because of course they were pork chops.</span> <span id="s101">And they were delicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Tell me about that first year at Syracuse?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Uh, my first year at Syracuse after, uh, uh, my four great years in high school....</span> <span id="s104">I met my wife in high school, and that was, uh, a marvelous opportunity; and, uh, we're still married after, uh, 50 years, going on 50 right now.</span> <span id="s105">Uh, we knew each other six years before we got married, though.</span> <span id="s106">Uh, but the high school years, uh, were, uh, filled with success in terms of athletics.</span> <span id="s107">I was always a fair student.</span> <span id="s108">I never had trouble with my grades.</span> <span id="s109">I was, there was no problem in my being eligible to compete in sports.</span> <span id="s110">In those days eligibility was required.</span> <span id="s111">You had to pass your subjects in order to play on the teams.</span> <span id="s112">And I had no problem doing that.</span> <span id="s113">I went to Syracuse University because a Jewish fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, the ADA chapter at Syracuse, uh, combined among its alumni to provide enough funds for me to go to Syracuse.</span> <span id="s114">My family certainly could not send me to Syracuse, because we didn't have the wherewithall, uh, didn't have anything close to the requirements to go to an away-college.</span> <span id="s115">Uh, but, uh, five Jewish men, uh, banded together to send me to Syracuse so that, uh, Syracuse would have Jewish representation on its sports teams--on the track team and on the football team.</span> <span id="s116">I was a well-known athlete, successful.</span> <span id="s117">And, uh, John Bahsha, who had played football at Syracuse, a Jew, Irving Rosenfeld, uh, Mort Starobin, who was an All-American football player, uh, who was a fraternity brother....</span> <span id="s118">They were all fraternity brothers.</span> <span id="s119">Walter Rose and, uh, Mitch Weill.</span> <span id="s120">Uh, those five men, uh, would, uh, send the money to Syracuse to pay for my tuition, and then I would work my way, uh, for, uh, my board.</span> <span id="s121">I waited...I waited on tables at Sims (ph) Hall up at Syracuse, and I used to brag that I was the fastest waiter in America because I was a track man and, uh, could serve very quickly.</span> <span id="s122">And, uh, I spent my first six months living in the wrestling room of the gym, uh, and...uh, because there was no place for me to live at the fraternity house.</span> <span id="s123">Uh...incoming freshmen couldn't live at the fraternity house according to the, uh, university rules.</span> <span id="s124">So I lived in the wrestling room of the gym with, uh, a teammate and classmate named Al Handler--another Jewish boy who was sent up with me to Syracuse by the same group of five.</span> <span id="s125">And, uh, three of them--young men who became my very close friends through their lives--uh, Charlie Heer from New Hope, Pennsylvania; and Bob Stewart from Rochester, New York, who couldn't spell a word; and, uh, a fellow named Bob Taylor who came out of Ohio.</span> <span id="s126">And, uh, as both, uh, Stuie--Stewart-- and uh Charlie Heer told me, uh, I was the first Jew they ever met.</span> <span id="s127">We had lots of fun in the wrestling room of the gym.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Sounds like it.</span> <span id="s129">When, uh, tell me about your getting involved in track that year at Syracuse University.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Well, uh, I had a reputation as a track athlete from high school and, uh, it was expected that I'd go out for the track team and, uh, so I did.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, I ran the first indoor season after my freshman football season.</span> <span id="s132">I played freshman football in the fall, which, uh, went right into the track season, indoor track, and I used to practice on an outdoor board track around the snow banks of Syracuse, New York and, uh, uh, and I was easily the best sprinter in the school at that time.</span> <span id="s133">We had a great quarter-miler at that time, a fellow named Eddie O'Brien, who was the national six-hundred yard champion.</span> <span id="s134">He too made the Olympic team in 1936 as a quarter-miler.</span> <span id="s135">And, uh, he and I were the two best runners in school.</span> <span id="s136">I was a sprinter and he was a middle-distance runner.</span> <span id="s137">And so I, uh, competed in the indoor track meets, uh, and I had some fair success.</span> <span id="s138">I, uh, won medals in the Melrose Games and the New York AC Meet and the, uh, uh, IC four A's, uh, at the, uh, Knights of Columbus Meet.</span> <span id="s139">Uh, I was invited down to run in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet, and, uh, I competed, uh, that freshman year, uh, successfully.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: how did the Olympics come into the picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: Well, after that, uh, uh, spring season of track and field where I ran, uh, inter...intramural competition, and I couldn't compete for the varsity in those years because, uh, uh, freshmen were ineligible for inter-collegiate sports in those years--you had to be in school for your freshmen year and then compete, uh, in varsity sports starting in your sophomore year.</span> <span id="s142">So I, uh, uh, I ran on the freshman meets and I won all the meets and I, uh, uh, set track records at Syracuse and at Cornell, where I ran in the indoor meet and, uh, various places.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, outdoors I began to win, uh, uh, more important races like the Metropolitan Senior Championships in New York, uh, where I beat a great black sprinter.</span> <span id="s144">I beat Ben Johnson for the first time.</span> <span id="s145">Ben John...not the same Ben Johnson of, uh, the 1988 Olympic games, but, uh, an earlier Ben Johnson who ran for Columbia.</span> <span id="s146">And he was the world's fastest human indoors.</span> <span id="s147">He set a world's record for, uh, sixty yards indoors.</span> <span id="s148">I couldn't beat him at sixty, but I did beat him at a hundred.</span> <span id="s149">And after I beat him for the Senior Metropolitan Championships in New York, I realized I had a chance to make the Olympic Team.</span> <span id="s150">Because Ben was one of the best sprinters in the...in the world, and beating him, uh, made me think that I had a chance for the team.</span> <span id="s151">And, uh, having, uh, won that race, I was invited to compete in the, uh, Regional Championships for the final Olympic Trials.</span> <span id="s152">The Regional Trials took place up at Harvard, uh, and I won up there as well.</span> <span id="s153">I beat Johnson again up there, along with, uh, oh, uh, uh, Billy Hopkins of Virginiaand, uh, uh, a fellow named, uh, Edgar Mason of Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s154">And, uh, I was the best sprinter in the Aast.</span> <span id="s155">Jesse Owens won in the Middle West, and, uh, Ralph Metcalfe won in the Far, uh, Middle West, and, uh, Frank Wykoff won on the Pacific coast.</span> <span id="s156">And by qualifying for the final in those regional meets, I qualified for the Olympic Final Trials at Randall's Island [Stadium], in New York City.</span> <span id="s157">When they were held, uh, uh, I, uh, finished third in one trial heat to qualify for the final.</span> <span id="s158">And then, in the final, I ran ...(laughter), uh, in the final; we drew for lanes--they hand out a pill or, uh, uh, round marbles which have numbers on them.</span> <span id="s159">And you reach into a box and you pick out the the marble, and that's your lane number.</span> <span id="s160">And I had lane number five; and, uh, as I, with my little trowel, garden trowel, began to dig my starting hole....</span> <span id="s161">In those days, you didn't use starting blocks.</span> <span id="s162">You used, you dug a hole.</span> <span id="s163">And I looked in lane number six, and there was Ralph Metcalfe, the world's fastest human in '33 and '34 and '35.</span> <span id="s164">And on my left, was Jesse Owens.</span> <span id="s165">So here I was in lane number five; and lane number four was Jesse and in lane number six was Ralph, which was just as well.</span> <span id="s166">And, uh, we raced, and, uh, uh, they won.</span> <span id="s167">(Laughter) I thought I finished third, but, uh, the judges thought otherwise.</span> <span id="s168">Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, they gave me fifth, finally.</span> <span id="s169">But in films of the race--and there was no photo finish in those years--uh, Bud Greenspan, the Olympic cinema photographer has films of that particular race.</span> <span id="s170">And, uh, I clearly finished fourth, but they gave Foy Draper of Southern Californiafourth, and me fifth.</span> <span id="s171">And I thought I was in a dead heat with Frank Wykoff, who finished third.</span> <span id="s172">Uh, as a matter of fact, right after the race, Ted Husing--the great broadcaster--uh, called all the sprinters over, introduced Jesse, interviewed him; interviewed Ralph, who finished second; and then introduced me, Marty Glickman, who finished third, the kid from Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s173">He said, "Oops, just a moment...uh, they're placing Frank Wykoff third.</span> <span id="s174">And here's Frank.‚Äù</span> <span id="s175">And interviewed Frank.</span> <span id="s176">"And, uh, now here's Marty.</span> <span id="s177">Oops!</span> <span id="s178">Just a moment.</span> <span id="s179">Uh, they put Foy Draper fourth.</span> <span id="s180">And now Marty is fifth.‚Äù</span> <span id="s181">Which was still all right with me, although I was slightly disappointed.</span> <span id="s182">I was on the team.</span> <span id="s183">I was going to be on the relay team.</span> <span id="s184">Uh, Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff were out of Southern California, the University of Southern California.</span> <span id="s185">And their coach was, uh, a power in the track world; and I remember his pushing his way in among the officials as they determined the order of the finish.</span> <span id="s186">And, uh, where I was originally placed third, uh, suddenly Wykoff was placed third and I was relegated to fourth.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">1 William B. Hopkins, from the University of Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">2 Edgar D. Mason, Jr., from the University of Pittsburgh.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">3 NB: University of Southern California.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">And, uh, Cromwell argued the point with the officials around him; and, uh, I was placed fifth, and Draper was placed fourth.</span> <span id="s191">Uh, it's...uh, I sound as though I'm making excuses; but the fact is that the film that Bud has clearly showed I finished fourth, at least.</span> <span id="s192">And, uh, it was as close to a dead heat with Frank as could be, and there was no photo finish.</span> <span id="s193">The...the camera was placed at about the eighty-yard mark, so you couldn't really tell the precise order of finish.</span> <span id="s194">But there was no question about my beating Foy Draper.</span> <span id="s195">And I beat Foy afterwards in several other races.</span> <span id="s196">So I..</span> <span id="s197">.</span> <span id="s198">I..</span> <span id="s199">.</span> <span id="s200">I made the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: You made the team and, uh....</span> <span id="s202">Hold it one second.</span> <span id="s203">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION.</span> <span id="s204">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">You made the team.</span> <span id="s206">Tell me about the team.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: I made the team; and, uh, at the time there was talk of a boycott.</span> <span id="s208">Uh, a boycott because of Nazi Germany.</span> <span id="s209">And the games were being held in Berlin, of course.</span> <span id="s210">The games were awarded to Berlin.</span> <span id="s211">The city of Berlin, mind you, not the German Republic.</span> <span id="s212">But the games are awarded to cities and not to nations.</span> <span id="s213">They were awarded to Berlin in 1931--before Hitler, a couple of years before Hitler came into power.</span> <span id="s214">And there was talk about a boycott.</span> <span id="s215">The boycott talk was not nearly as severe nor, as, uh, it resulted in 1988, in a complete boycott.</span> <span id="s216">But, uh, there was talk about it.</span> <span id="s217">And, uh, no one ever suggested to me that I don't go.</span> <span id="s218">Uh, no one.</span> <span id="s219">Uh, I wanted to go for two reasons.</span> <span id="s220">I wanted to go because as an athlete, it was the goal of any young athlete, uh, American athlete, a Jewish-American athlete, to make the team.</span> <span id="s221">That was a goal that we all strove for.</span> <span id="s222">Secondly, and I stress that it was second, uh, I wanted to show the world, the world that I knew, that a Jew could, uh, compete and do just as well as anyone else, and perhaps better.</span> <span id="s223">And, uh, both Sam Stollerand I made the team.</span> <span id="s224">Sam finished sixth in that race.</span> <span id="s225">I was judged to be fifth, and we both made the team.</span> <span id="s226">We were the only two Jews on the Olympic track team.</span> <span id="s227">Uh, there were two other Jews on the overall squad.</span> <span id="s228">Sam Balter was on the basketball squad--a Jew from California; and, uh, Herman Goldberg--a Jew from Rochester--uh, was on the baseball exhibition team.</span> <span id="s229">And, uh, Herman and I became good friends while we were overseas.</span> <span id="s230">So, uh, I wanted to make the team for those two reasons: first, because I was selfish as an athlete and I wanted to succeed.</span> <span id="s231">I wanted to win.</span> <span id="s232">And secondly, because as a Jew I wanted to show that, uh, Jews were just as good as anyone else and perhaps better.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Tell me about the process.</span> <span id="s234">Just take</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Uh, having, uh, qualified for the team, uh, we spent, uh, two or three days, uh, being fitted with Olympic uniforms.</span> <span id="s236">And there was a great deal of, uh, jubilation amongst my friends and my family that I had made the team.</span> <span id="s237">And, uh, my father was able to gather together--along with my mother--a total of $30 to give me, so that I could go to Europe and have some spending money.</span> <span id="s238">Thirty bucks was what we could raise.</span> <span id="s239">Uh, and so we left; and we left on the S.S. Manhattan.</span> <span id="s240">It took, uh, five days to get to, uh, uh, England, and, uh, we had a wonderful time aboard the boat.</span> <span id="s241">I'd never been aboard a ship like that before.</span> <span id="s242">And, uh, we 4 From the University of Michigan.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">trained lightly on the boat, because there was no running facility.</span> <span id="s244">We jogged on the track.</span> <span id="s245">We did exercises and things like that.</span> <span id="s246">And, uh, the trip was thoroughly enjoyable.</span> <span id="s247">And we arrived in Hamburg, and then took the train from Hamburg to Berlin--uh, perhaps a two-hour ride.</span> <span id="s248">When we arrived at the Bahnhof [Ger: Railway Station] in Berlin, there was a huge crowd waiting for the American team.</span> <span id="s249">We were the big powerful American team; and newspaper men and photographers and camera and newsreel people, photographers of all sorts, were waiting for us.</span> <span id="s250">Perhaps, uh, hundreds of them.</span> <span id="s251">I don't recall.</span> <span id="s252">But there was a huge crowd gathered.</span> <span id="s253">And, uh, we were all in uniform.</span> <span id="s254">And as we milled around on the station platform after getting off the train, uh, I was accosted by a young man in street clothes.</span> <span id="s255">And, uh, looked to be a couple of years older than I--smaller than me, with a wisp of a mustache.</span> <span id="s256">And, uh, he said, "You're Marty Glickman, aren't you?"</span> <span id="s257">And I said, "Yes.‚Äù</span> <span id="s258">He said, "You're Jewish, aren't you?"</span> <span id="s259">And taken back a little bit, I..</span> <span id="s260">.</span> <span id="s261">, "Yes, I am.‚Äù</span> <span id="s262">He was obviously an American, because I could tell the way he spoke and the way he was dressed and the way he was familiar with me--and I with him--in a moment or two.</span> <span id="s263">He was an American.</span> <span id="s264">Uh, he said, "I'm Jewish, also.‚Äù</span> <span id="s265">I said, "What are you doing here?"</span> <span id="s266">He says, "I'm going to med school here.‚Äù</span> <span id="s267">I said, "You're going to med school in Berlin?"</span> <span id="s268">He said, "Yes.</span> <span id="s269">I could not get into an American med school, and I'm in med school here in Berlin.‚Äù</span> <span id="s270">I asked him how things were.</span> <span id="s271">He says, "Well, in Berlin, particularly now during the Olympic period, uh, there was no overt sign of any antisemitism at all.‚Äù</span> <span id="s272">He said in the smaller towns, uh, there might be signs of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s273">There might be some overt acts, uh, but, uh, he didn't feel it.</span> <span id="s274">Uh, not in Berlin.</span> <span id="s275">And, uh, at that time, I rationalized that things in Berlin were pretty much the way they were in America.</span> <span id="s276">In America, as a young college student, I was aware of the fact that there were quotas at schools-- particularly at graduate schools--uh, that there were clubs, uh, Jews could not get into, restaurants they could not go to, resorts that they were not welcome at.</span> <span id="s277">And, uh, there were overt and covert signs of un...of antisemitism in America.</span> <span id="s278">And it was my feeling, as an Olympic athlete there in Berlin, that Berlin was like the United States in that respect.</span> <span id="s279">Uh, I was aware slightly of the Nuremberg Laws, uh, but they were not omnipresent.</span> <span id="s280">Uh, they were not vocal.</span> <span id="s281">They were not described to me.</span> <span id="s282">Somewhere I had read of the Nuremberg Laws.</span> <span id="s283">I had never studied them.</span> <span id="s284">I never knew about them in any detail.</span> <span id="s285">Uh, I knew there was antisemitism in Germany.</span> <span id="s286">I felt antisemitism occasionally in the United States, even in New York; but, uh, there was a similarity it seemed to me between Berlin when I was there in '36 and New York.</span> <span id="s287">We, uh, were taken to the Olympic Village.</span> <span id="s288">Uh, I felt no compunction at all about being a Jew in Germany at that time, because, uh, I didn't necessarily look Jewish--as though anybody could "look" Jewish.</span> <span id="s289">Uh, I was, uh, an American athlete in Berlin.</span> <span id="s290">And there was, uh, no feeling, I had no sense of, uh, animosity, no feeling of, uh, indignation.</span> <span id="s291">I was just an American athlete in Berlin, in the Olympic Village.</span> <span id="s292">And we began to train for the games.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Tell me about that training.</span> <span id="s294">Tell me about your teammates first.</span> <span id="s295">Who were they and what were they like?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: Well, as a sprinter, naturally I trained with the sprinters.</span> <span id="s297">And they were, uh, Jesse Owens, who was a marvelous man.</span> <span id="s298">Uh, one of the smoothest athletes in...in function I've ever seen.</span> <span id="s299">Uh, perhaps the smoothest.</span> <span id="s300">Ralph Metcalfe, who was an experienced track athlete.</span> <span id="s301">He won silver medals in 1932--should have won gold, but he made some mistakes.</span> <span id="s302">And, uh, the officials made some mistakes with Ralph, also.</span> <span id="s303">They had him run in a two hundred-meter, uh, race.</span> <span id="s304">And his lane around a turn was eight feet longer than the other runners in that race, so he finished, uh, third.</span> <span id="s305">As he came off the turn and down the straight-away, he was shocked to find himself as far back as he was.</span> <span id="s306">Uh, again, films prove that he was given an incorrect starting line, but that sometimes happens with, uh, some of the track officials.</span> <span id="s307">So we we trained together: Owens, Metcalfe, uh, Frank Wykoff--who'd been on three, uh, two previous Olympic teams.</span> <span id="s308">He'd been on the relay teams in 1928 and in 1932, had retired, and then, uh, came back to make the 1936 Olympic team.</span> <span id="s309">There was Foy Draper, uh, a student of Southern California.</span> <span id="s310">There was Sam Stoller, a student at, uh, University of Michigan; and there was Mack Robinson--a great two hundred-meter runner, uh, not nearly as good in the one hundred-meter run.</span> <span id="s311">At a hundred meters, he finished seventh in that final Olympic trial; and he finished second to Jesse in the two hundred-meter Olympic final.</span> <span id="s312">He won the Silver medal.</span> <span id="s313">Mack Robinson is Jackie Robinson's older brother, and not nearly as well known.</span> <span id="s314">Uh, he didn't play baseball except as, uh...a, uh...a youngster.</span> <span id="s315">Was a good football player, uh, Mack was.</span> <span id="s316">But he was completely overshadowed by his brother, Jackie, in later years.</span> <span id="s317">But those were the seven track men.</span> <span id="s318">Uh, and we spent a good deal of time together; practicing together, living near each other in...in the same, uh, Olympic, uh, uh, building--a one-story building with perhaps twenty rooms in it.</span> <span id="s319">And, uh, uh, each room had, uh, two beds; and I roomed with my Syracuse teammate, Eddie O'Briena four hundred-meter runner.</span> <span id="s320">He was on the four...uh, sixteen hundred relay--the four-by-four hundred-meter relay.</span> <span id="s321">I was on the four-by-one hundred-meter relay.</span> <span id="s322">And because we were team mates at Syracuse, we roomed together in the same room.</span> <span id="s323">Uh, Eddie died a number of years ago.</span> <span id="s324">Uh, Sam Stoller and I were friends.</span> <span id="s325">We knew we were, uh, fellow Jews.</span> <span id="s326">We made nothing about it.</span> <span id="s327">Uh, you know, we were just two of the guys.</span> <span id="s328">Uh, he was not, um, closer to me than, uh, Foy Draper was, or Eddie O'Brien was, or Frank Wykoff was.</span> <span id="s329">He was just one of the boys, and I was one of the boys.</span> <span id="s330">Uh, I was younger than most of the guys.</span> <span id="s331">I..</span> <span id="s332">.</span> <span id="s333">I guess I was...I was the second youngest man on the team.</span> <span id="s334">I was eighteen; and a hop, step and jumper from LSU named Bobby Brownwas the youngest young man.</span> <span id="s335">He was seventeen years old.</span> <span id="s336">Uh, and Sam was a couple of years older than I--Sam Stoller, a couple of years older than I.</span> <span id="s337">A few days before, three days before the, uh, trials in the relay--to keep the three sprinters sharp who had not competed in the one hundred-meter race--as, uh, Owens, Metcalfe and Wykoff had competed; and they finished first, second and fourth.</span> <span id="s338">Uh, a Dutchman named Oosendork (ph) from Holland was third, a shoulder ahead of Frank Wykoff.</span> <span id="s339">Uh, to keep, uh, Sam and me and Foy Draper sharp, we ran a one hundred-meter run in the Olympic Village under race conditions with a German starter.</span> <span id="s340">"Auf die Pl√§tze, fertig," and then the gun would sound.</span> <span id="s341">Uh, "on your marks, get set, go.‚Äù</span> <span id="s342">"Auf die Pl√§tze, fertig," and, uh, uh, the gun.</span> <span id="s343">And we raced, the three of us did, with judges at the finish line.</span> <span id="s344">And Sam won the race.</span> <span id="s345">I was 5 Edward T. O'Brien.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">6 William Brown, from Baker High School in Baker, Louisiana, competed in the Running Hop, Step and Jump in the 1936 Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">second, about a shoulder back; and Foy Draper was third.</span> <span id="s348">Three days after that, uh, a special meeting was called in the Olympic Village amongst the seven sprinters.</span> <span id="s349">The head track coach, Lawson Robertson of Pennsylvania, and the assistant head track coach, Dean Cromwell of Southern California; and in that meeting, the morning of the day we were supposed to run, Sam and I were told, with the others present, that we were going to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe.</span> <span id="s350">And the reason we were being replaced was that the Germans were hiding their best sprinters and saving them to upset the American team in the four hundred-meter relay.</span> <span id="s351">Uh, when I heard that, being a brash eighteen year old, I said, "Hey, Coach, it's not possible.</span> <span id="s352">In order to be a world class sprinter, you must run in world-class competition.</span> <span id="s353">You can't hide world-class sprinters.‚Äù</span> <span id="s354">Nevertheless, said the two coaches, "there is a strong rumor to that effect and so Jesse and Ralph are going to replace you and Sam.‚Äù</span> <span id="s355">There was no question that Jesse Owens or Ralph Metcalfe were faster than Sam and I, by a yard.</span> <span id="s356">Unquestionably.</span> <span id="s357">But we had practiced passing the baton for the two weeks we were in Europe, uh, during the course of the games, the four hundred-meter relay coming near, near the end of the track competition.</span> <span id="s358">We'd practiced passing the baton amongst, uh, uh, Foy Draper, uh, Frank Wykoff, Sam Stoller and myself.</span> <span id="s359">And, uh, Jesse and Ralph had not even touched the baton until they ran that afternoon.</span> <span id="s360">Jesse said in that meeting, "Coach, I've won my three gold medals: the hundred, the two hundred and the long jump.</span> <span id="s361">I've had it.</span> <span id="s362">I'm tired.</span> <span id="s363">Let Marty and Sam run.</span> <span id="s364">They deserve it.‚Äù</span> <span id="s365">And Dean Cromwell, the Southern California coach, pointed his finger at him and said, "You'll do as you're told!"</span> <span id="s366">And in those days, Black athletes did as they were told.</span> <span id="s367">So did all athletes, for that matter.</span> <span id="s368">So Jesse volunteered not to run.</span> <span id="s369">I'd always loved the man and respected him throughout my complete association with him; but for that moment...from, from that moment on, I mean, I practically revered the guy, for volunteering not to run.</span> <span id="s370">But, uh, the coach said, "Do as you're told.‚Äù</span> <span id="s371">And, uh, the relay was composed of Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, uh, Foy Draper and, uh, Frank Wykoff.</span> <span id="s372">Unusual, too, in that they had Jesse Owens leading off.</span> <span id="s373">He was not the best starter.</span> <span id="s374">And they had Frank Wykoff of Southern California cross the finish line.</span> <span id="s375">'Cause he was from Southern California, and he was white.</span> <span id="s376">Uh, Foy Draper ran third.</span> <span id="s377">Ralph Metcalfe ran second.</span> <span id="s378">So the two Black men ran first and second; and by the time Foy Draper got the baton, they were twelve to fifteen yards out in front.</span> <span id="s379">In that meeting, being as fresh as I was, I said, "Coach, we won that race, no matter who runs, by fifteen yards.‚Äù</span> <span id="s380">And we did win by fifteen yards.</span> <span id="s381">The Germans didn't finish second or third.</span> <span id="s382">They finished fourth.</span> <span id="s383">They were completely out of it.</span> <span id="s384">A fellow named Eric Bochmeyer was their best sprinter.</span> <span id="s385">I mentioned that he finished fifth in the final of the one hundred-meter run.</span> <span id="s386">In post-Olympic competition, in which I competed, I beat Bochmeyer, and he was the best they had.</span> <span id="s387">I also beat Wykoff in Paris, in a track meet held in Paris.</span> <span id="s388">And, uh, I'd beaten Draper just a few days previously, anyhow.</span> <span id="s389">And so had Sam beaten Draper.</span> <span id="s390">If Sam, I and Wykoff ran three races, there could be three different winners.</span> <span id="s391">We were that close.</span> <span id="s392">Uh, we were good.</span> <span id="s393">We were world class sprinters.</span> <span id="s394">Uh, all three of us could beat Foy, Foy Draper; but he ran on the relay.</span> <span id="s395">We did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: Why?</span> <span id="s398">Uh, mostly because of antisemitism.</span> <span id="s399">The Blacks were winning everything, or virtually everything--uh, the one hundred, the two hundred, the four hundred, the eight hundred, the high jump and the long jump were won by Black athletes.</span> <span id="s400">And it was terribly embarrassing for the Nazi hierarchy who gathered every day in the Olympic stadium.</span> <span id="s401">Hitler flanked by G√∂ring and Goebbels and Himmler and Streicher, and the rest of that horrible entourage, uh, were there every day watching the events.</span> <span id="s402">And after Blacks would win, they'd get up and leave.</span> <span id="s403">Uh, they'd see the competition, but then they would go.</span> <span id="s404">And, uh, it's my belief that Avery Brundage, who was chief of the American Olympic, uh, Team,uh, didn't want to further embarrass the Nazis in that myth of Nazi Aryan supremacy by having Jews stand on the winning podium before a hundred and twenty thousand cheering people--Germans mostly--and the world's press and the world's radio coverage of it.</span> <span id="s405">There's no question we would have won.</span> <span id="s406">Uh, the only way we could have lost is to have dropped the baton during the race--always a possibility, but the likelihood of that happening is really remote because we were experienced runners.</span> <span id="s407">And, uh, we practiced assiduously, and, uh, would have won the race handily.</span> <span id="s408">It developed later on that I ran in a four hundred yard relay with Wykoff, Owens, Metcalfe, myself, uh, in, uh, a meet in London at White City Stadium.</span> <span id="s409">We set a world's record for four hundred yards, a record which still stands.</span> <span id="s410">Uh, not many people run four hundred yard relays anymore.</span> <span id="s411">But, uh, we didn't run on the, uh, on the American team.</span> <span id="s412">We should have, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">Q: When you talk about the coaches, you had mentioned another reason when we were....</span></p> <p><span id="s414">A: Uh, Dean Cromwell was the head coach of the [University of] Southern California Olympic, uh, track team and the assistant head coach of the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s415">He wanted to make sure that his runners competed.</span> <span id="s416">He wanted to make sure that, uh, Wykoff ran not only in the one hundred-meter dash, in which he placed fourth, but Foy Draper was to run on the relay as well.</span> <span id="s417">Uh, Draper, who was beaten by, uh, Sam and me just a couple of days previous.</span> <span id="s418">The...the...the four of us should have run together--uh, Draper and Wykoff and Stoller and myself.</span> <span id="s419">That's the way we practiced passing the baton for the several weeks we were in Germany at the Olympic Village, practicing for the relay.</span> <span id="s420">We'd have won the race handily.</span> <span id="s421">That's the way the relay should have been.</span> <span id="s422">Uh, Mack Robinson was competing in the two hundred-meter run; and the two hundred and the four hundred-meter relay came at approximately...on approximately the same days or series of days.</span> <span id="s423">So that Mack would be quite busy running in the two hundred meter-relay trials, uh, uh, quarter finals, semi-finals and finals--in which he finished second.</span> <span id="s424">And Jesse also was quite busy during that time.</span> <span id="s425">Jesse did not want to run that four hundred-meter relay.</span> <span id="s426">And he volunteered, as I said, not to run.</span> <span id="s427">He was tired.</span> <span id="s428">After the Olympic games were ended, he came straight home--with the exception of that one track meet in in, uh, England, in which I told you he ran the relay on which I also competed.</span> <span id="s429">And, uh, he just wanted to get back to the States.</span> <span id="s430">He was tired.</span> <span id="s431">He was beat, 'cause he had been, you know, running virtually every day.</span> <span id="s432">But as I said, he was told to run and so he ran.</span> <span id="s433">The coach of, uh, Southern California was Dean Cromwell; and he 7 Brundage was President of the American Olympic Committee and of the Amateur Athletic Union.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">was, uh, uh, an officious person, who later became an "America First,"uh, had no Blacks on his track team.</span> <span id="s435">It's remarkable [that] even in those years, when Blacks were so dominant in track and field and Southern California--USC--had the best college track team in America, there was not one Black athlete on the USC track team.</span> <span id="s436">All white.</span> <span id="s437">Uh, Dean Cromwell apparently was a bigot.</span> <span id="s438">Being an "American First," he would have to be.</span> <span id="s439">Uh, Lawson Robertson, the head coach, was an older man.</span> <span id="s440">Uh, had a severe limp, walked with a cane.</span> <span id="s441">Uh, I think he was dominated by Cromwell.</span> <span id="s442">He was still his own man.</span> <span id="s443">He was the head coach of the University of Pennsylvania, but he was an older person.</span> <span id="s444">He might have been in his sixties at that time.</span> <span id="s445">I don't know exactly how old he he was.</span> <span id="s446">The day following the trial heats, when the Germans qualified but were well out of contention, walking across the campus on the, uh, Olympic Village I heard a voice calling to me, and I turned.</span> <span id="s447">It was Lawson Robertson, the head coach, perhaps, uh, fifty, sixty yards away, uh, waving to me; and I jogged over to him.</span> <span id="s448">Uh, I didn't wait for him to limp over to me with his cane.</span> <span id="s449">And he said, "Marty," he said, "I want to apologize to you.</span> <span id="s450">I made a terrible mistake.‚Äù</span> <span id="s451">And he apologized.</span> <span id="s452">"You should have run on the relay.‚Äù</span> <span id="s453">And so he apologized.</span> <span id="s454">Dean Cromwell never said a word.</span> <span id="s455">Avery Brundage never said a word.</span> <span id="s456">Whereas my firm belief that, uh, Cromwell's desire to have his men on the team--which could have been met anyhow--and the antisemitism I engendered by, uh, uh, people on the Olympic Team, led by Avery Brundage, uh, prevented the two Jews from standing on that winning podium in front of a huge crowd and, uh, being acclaimed as the best four hundred-meter relay runners in the world.</span> <span id="s457">That was the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: What about Brundage?</span> <span id="s459">What did you know of Brundage, if anything, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Brundage didn't speak to athletes.</span> <span id="s461">Uh, Brundage, uh, uh....</span> <span id="s462">As you probably saw, motion pictures and still shots of Brundage smiling happily in the company of Adolf Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring and people like that.</span> <span id="s463">Uh, he was, uh, uh, a stern, big... uh, uh, uh, obnoxious is what I'm looking to say.</span> <span id="s464">But, uh, in addition to that, uh, he was a truculent gentlemen.</span> <span id="s465">Uh, a dictatorial kind of person.</span> <span id="s466">Ultimately, he became, uh, president of the International Olympic Committee.</span> <span id="s467">At that time, he was president of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</span> <span id="s468">Uh, I never talked to him; as I say, he didn't talk to athletes.</span> <span id="s469">I never accosted him.</span> <span id="s470">Uh, perhaps I was, uh, fearful of accosting him.</span> <span id="s471">Uh, he was, uh, an officious, stern, uh, aggressive individual.</span> <span id="s472">And, uh, he liked to be seen in the company of all the powers that be.</span> <span id="s473">It was he also who decried...decreed that Eleonor Holm be thrown off the team because she drank champagne on the, uh, uh, on the ship going over.</span> <span id="s474">And, uh, his word was law.</span> <span id="s475">I've seen him upon occasion literally brush aside people who would walk up to him.</span> <span id="s476">If he were walking across the infield of a..</span> <span id="s477">.</span> <span id="s478">of a track, and a newspaper man--and I saw this myself--uh, wanted to talk to him, he'd literally shoulder him aside as he walked.</span> <span id="s479">And kept right on walking.</span> <span id="s480">Uh, he was very difficult...a difficult person to be with.</span> <span id="s481">At least, as far as the 8 The America First Committee, of which Avery Brundage was to be a founder, was an isolationist movement which served as an umbrella for anti-British, anti-French, pro-German and antisemitic groups.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">athletes were concerned.</span> <span id="s483">Uh, but as I say, I never talked to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: What did you do after that defeat?</span> <span id="s485">Where did you go from here, after that not being allowed to run?</span> <span id="s486">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: After, uh, the relay... There was the...the trial heats, which we won handily; and, uh the final, which we also won handily--as I say, between twelve and fifteen yards out in front.</span> <span id="s488">Uh, uh, almost anyone could have run on our relay team, and we would have won.</span> <span id="s489">Uh, I was angered, uh, and determined that come 1940--four years hence from the '36 games--uh, I'd be back and win it all.</span> <span id="s490">I'd win the hundred, then two hundred and, uh, run on the relay team as well.</span> <span id="s491">But 1940 never came.</span> <span id="s492">The war broke out in 1939, and so there was no opportunity to, uh, show what I could do, uh, in the Olympic games.</span> <span id="s493">And the games didn't resume, of course, until 1948; and that was long after I was...had stopped competing.</span> <span id="s494">However, I was fortunate in that, uh, I had other interests.</span> <span id="s495">Uh, football in particular.</span> <span id="s496">The Games wound up in August; and we toured Europe for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s497">And I ran in...in England on that four hundred-yard relay.</span> <span id="s498">I ran in, uh, in, uh, Scotland, and, uh, I ran in Paris.</span> <span id="s499">Uh, I ran, uh, a number of places; and, uh, then came right back to the States and went right up to Syracuse to play football for Syracuse University.</span> <span id="s500">And my interest, uh, was, uh, inundated by, uh, the practice workouts and starting of classes at school, and all that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s501">And, uh, the Olympic games didn't fade away from me, by any matter; uh, but it, uh... uh, the other interests I had sublimated to a great extent, uh, what took place in the the summer of 1936.</span> <span id="s502">And, of course, I had 1940 to look forward to as well.</span> <span id="s503">I did well as a football player at Syracuse.</span> <span id="s504">I became a..</span> <span id="s505">.</span> <span id="s506">a broadcaster as a result of, uh, my football playing experiences.</span> <span id="s507">Uh, in my junior year at Syracuse, I had a particularly good day against Cornell.</span> <span id="s508">We were unbeaten, Syracuse was.</span> <span id="s509">We were 2 and 0; and Cornell had beaten Penn State and Colgate and...uh, Columbia, I think.</span> <span id="s510">Uh, either Columbia or Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s511">They were 3 and 0.</span> <span id="s512">They were a national power in those days, Cornell was.</span> <span id="s513">We played at Shoelkopf Field at, uh, uh, Cornell, at Ithaca; and, uh, we beat them.</span> <span id="s514">Upset them 14 to 6.</span> <span id="s515">And I scored both touchdowns.</span> <span id="s516">I ran a punt back for one touchdown.</span> <span id="s517">I bucked over for another.</span> <span id="s518">I intercepted two passes.</span> <span id="s519">I, uh, made a couple of, uh, touchdown-saving tackles.</span> <span id="s520">Best day I ever had by far on the football field.</span> <span id="s521">And the following day, because of the publicity upstate...uh, Upstate New York, and throughout the country as well, uh, I received a phone call from a local haberdasher who introduced himself to me on the phone.</span> <span id="s522">He said, "Marty, frankly, I want to cash in on your publicity.</span> <span id="s523">I want you [to] do to a radio broadcast for me.‚Äù</span> <span id="s524">I said, "You don't want me.</span> <span id="s525">I'm nervous.</span> <span id="s526">I stutter.</span> <span id="s527">I stammer.</span> <span id="s528">I've never been on the air.‚Äù</span> <span id="s529">He said, "I'll pay you $15.00 a broadcast.‚Äù</span> <span id="s530">So I stopped stuttering and I went on the air.</span> <span id="s531">And (laughter) that's how I started my broadcast career; and I continue that since that time on.</span> <span id="s532">I was pretty bad, but, uh, I worked at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: What did you do during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: During the war I was, uh, a Marine Corps lieutenant.</span> <span id="s535">I served in the Marshall Islands, uh, on places like, uh, Kwajalein and Eniwetok, Majuro and Enjebi and so on.</span> <span id="s536">I was a night fighter controller.</span> <span id="s537">I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.</span> <span id="s538">And, uh, the Olympic situation was far, far away.</span> <span id="s539">I might tell you a story about, uh, uh, the war, though.</span> <span id="s540">I..</span> <span id="s541">.</span> <span id="s542">I mentioned running in a track meet in in Paris.</span> <span id="s543">It was a triangular meet among, uh, Japanese athletes, French athletes, and American athletes.</span> <span id="s544">And, uh, we went to the starting line to dig our starting holes again with this trowel, and on my left was a fellow from Japan named Suzuki.</span> <span id="s545">I recognized him, because he had run in the one hundred-meter races.</span> <span id="s546">He was, uh, beaten in the semi-finals, didn't qualify for the final.</span> <span id="s547">And, uh, as we dug our starting holes, we glanced at each other and smiled at each other.</span> <span id="s548">I noticed his warm, lustrous brown eyes.</span> <span id="s549">And, uh, then we, uh, finished preparing for the race.</span> <span id="s550">We shook hands.</span> <span id="s551">I shook hands with the Frenchman along side.</span> <span id="s552">Frank Wykoff was the other American on the race.</span> <span id="s553">I got off to a real good start, and I won the race.</span> <span id="s554">Uh, Wykoff was second and Suzuki finished third.</span> <span id="s555">I jogged back to the starting line; and felt a tap on my shoulder as I jogged back for my warm-up clothes.</span> <span id="s556">And I turned, and I saw Suzuki.</span> <span id="s557">And his arm was outstretched and we shook hands, and again I noticed these warm brown lustrous eyes.</span> <span id="s558">And he was my friend, I was his friend, and, uh, uh, we had just competed against each other for these ten, ten and a half seconds at a hundred meters.</span> <span id="s559">And that was it.</span> <span id="s560">We couldn't speak each other's language.</span> <span id="s561">In the opening days of World War II, when the Japanese were landing on Luzon, I read that a Japanese Olympic athlete, Lieutenant Suzuki, had been killed in those landings.</span> <span id="s562">And I, an American Marine, cried for this Japanese soldier.</span> <span id="s563">I actually bawled.</span> <span id="s564">And, uh, it's just an indication of what the Olympic games and international athletics can do for an individual.</span> <span id="s565">I learned, uh, uh, that the other athletes from France and England and Hungary--and, uh, the athletes from all over the world--were just like me, and I was just like them.</span> <span id="s566">We were the same.</span> <span id="s567">We had the same interests.</span> <span id="s568">We had the same love of sport.</span> <span id="s569">Uh, we had the same respect for each other.</span> <span id="s570">And it was a wonderful experience, having been there.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Tell me about an incident that you described earlier in the New York Athletic Club.</span> <span id="s572">And when that took place.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: When I came back to the States, uh, I played as...uh, a season of football at Syracuse my sophomore year.</span> <span id="s574">And, uh, towards the end of the season, uh, when I began training for track, I was invited to race in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet.</span> <span id="s575">At that time, the Sugar Bowl had other activities besides the, uh, football game itself.</span> <span id="s576">And they had the track meet.</span> <span id="s577">And I was invited down to the Sugar Bowl; and I trained on the boardwalk at Coney Island in mid- winter, in December.</span> <span id="s578">And it was just too rough to train there.</span> <span id="s579">And I encountered a friend of mine, who ran for the New York AC--a fellow named Eddie O'Sullivan--uh, a sprinter.</span> <span id="s580">And, uh, I told him about my difficulty in working out; and he says, "Why don't you join me down at the AC, and practice with me on the indoor track there?"</span> <span id="s581">I said, "That would be great, Eddie!</span> <span id="s582">I'll join you on such and such a day.‚Äù</span> <span id="s583">And so on that day, I took the subway into Manhattan from Brooklyn with my little satchel and I walked into the New York AC.</span> <span id="s584">I was walking across the lobby to the elevators to go to where the indoor track was, on one of the upper floors of the Athletic Club; and, uh, I was stopped by Paul Pilgrim, the director of athletics at the New York AC.</span> <span id="s585">He knew me, and I knew him.</span> <span id="s586">"Uh, what are you doing here, Marty?"</span> <span id="s587">I said, "Well, I've come down to work out with, uh...with Eddie O'Sullivan.</span> <span id="s588">He's asked me to workout with him.</span> <span id="s589">I'm training for the Sugar Bowl Track Meet.‚Äù</span> <span id="s590">And, uh, Paul Pilgrim, this mature adult, uh, said, uh, "I'm afraid you can't, Marty.‚Äù</span> <span id="s591">I said, "Well...well, why not?"</span> <span id="s592">He said, "Well, there's no room upstairs.‚Äù</span> <span id="s593">I said, "But I've just got my little satchel, and I'll...I'll share Eddie's locker.‚Äù</span> <span id="s594">"I'm afraid you can't go up there, Marty.</span> <span id="s595">You can't work out here.‚Äù</span> <span id="s596">"Oh.</span> <span id="s597">Uh, okay, Mr. Pilgrim.‚Äù</span> <span id="s598">And I turned and I walked out.</span> <span id="s599">I got back on the subway.</span> <span id="s600">And it was then I realized that because I was Jewish I could not work out at the New York Athletic Club.</span> <span id="s601">And that was perhaps the second overt sign of antisemitism that I..</span> <span id="s602">.</span> <span id="s603">I felt; the first, of course, being in the Olympic Games itself, and, uh, not being allowed to run there and not being allowed to work out, mind you, at the New York AC.</span> <span id="s604">I've, uh, been unhappy with the New York AC ever since.</span> <span id="s605">Oh, I..</span> <span id="s606">.</span> <span id="s607">I..</span> <span id="s608">.</span> <span id="s609">I ran in the Sugar Bowl Track Meet, and I, I won down there.</span> <span id="s610">So, uh, it didn't make that much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: I'd like to know a little bit more about your teammates, particularly about Jesse Owens.</span> <span id="s612">You maintained a friendship with him, I understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Uh, early on, in 1936, uh, Jesse was, uh, almost, uh, an icon, uh, of athletics.</span> <span id="s614">And I looked up to him, uh, as any young man might.</span> <span id="s615">Uh, after we were together on the team, uh, we were friends.</span> <span id="s616">We became fairly close.</span> <span id="s617">Uh, I visited him at his home in Chicago.</span> <span id="s618">Uh, I saw him at various sports functions through the years.</span> <span id="s619">He and I became good friends.</span> <span id="s620">Uh, we did several broadcasts together; uh, particularly on Home Box Office, where I was, uh, the sports director, and I had Jesse come in and do some programs.</span> <span id="s621">Particularly the, uh, uh, Bud Greenspan Olympiad series, where Jesse was host--except for one program that I hosted, in which Jesse was the star of the program.</span> <span id="s622">And it wouldn't do to have Jesse introduce himself, so, uh, he and I talked on this program.</span> <span id="s623">And, uh...but we saw each other regularly and frequently.</span> <span id="s624">Our wives knew each other.</span> <span id="s625">Uh, I had lunch with Jesse at his apartment in Chicago with Ruth, his wife.</span> <span id="s626">When Jesse died in 1980, uh, I was the only white teammate of Jesse's at his funeral.</span> <span id="s627">Which shocked the Hell out of me.</span> <span id="s628">I mean, there were many many white athletes on the team; but the only athlete, white athlete, who showed up for his funeral was me.</span> <span id="s629">All the Black athletes were there.</span> <span id="s630">Uh, but, uh, I was the only white athlete.</span> <span id="s631">And, uh, I was, uh, shocked and I was pleased that I was there; but also, uh, astounded by the lack of other individuals not being there at his funeral.</span> <span id="s632">Uh, I worked for five years with the Jesse Owens Foundation, from '80 through '85.</span> <span id="s633">Went back to Berlin for the first time in '85, to the Olympic Stadium, uh, to help prepare for the celebration of Jesse Owen's golden anniversary of his winning those four gold medals.</span> <span id="s634">Uh, he had died in 1980.</span> <span id="s635">I went back in '85 along with, uh, uh, two men--Jim McDonald and Herb Douglas--also of the Foundation, to help prepare for the anniversary celebration at a track meet to be held in 1986--fifty years after, uh, Jesse won in the same stadium.</span> <span id="s636">The Olympic stadium still stands.</span> <span id="s637">And, uh, I went to the stadium with my two colleagues; and, uh, excused myself to walk down into the stadium proper and walk on the track to that area which...uh, where I was... where I should have run and didn't.</span> <span id="s638">And I walked along that stretch of a hundred meters or so, and I stopped and looked across at the stands, and saw where Hitler and G√∂ring and Goebbels and Streicher and Himmler and Hess and all those people sat.</span> <span id="s639">And right along side of that was where I sat, where the athletes sat who were not competing; and our section was along side of where Hitler's private box was.</span> <span id="s640">And suddenly, a wave of anger swept over me so that I thought I was going to pass out.</span> <span id="s641">I began to cuss and fume, used every dirty word I know, out loud.</span> <span id="s642">Uh, to the effect that how could those dirty bastards do this to any eighteen year-old kid, or any athlete.</span> <span id="s643">Keep them from competing in the Olympic Games.</span> <span id="s644">And after three or four or five minutes--however long it was--I finally calmed down and realized that I'd kept all that anger bottled up for forty-nine years.</span> <span id="s645">I hadn't been back to Berlin in all that time, and certainly not back to the stadium.</span> <span id="s646">And, uh, I felt purged for the first time of that anger, which, uh, gnawed at me probably all those years.</span> <span id="s647">And, uh, the track meet was held the following year, and celebrating Jesse's fiftieth anniversary of the four gold medals he had won.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s649">All right.</span> <span id="s650">Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
