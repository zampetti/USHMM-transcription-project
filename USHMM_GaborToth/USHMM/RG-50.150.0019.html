born in Berlin in 1901 in July.</span> <span id="s5">In other words, I'm seventy six years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Q: Can you tell me a little about your education?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: I was raised in Berlin and visited the high school there and then afterwards; I came into an apprenticeship in a wholesale place for buttons and buckles.</span> <span id="s8">It was a well- known wholesaler in Berlin.</span> <span id="s9">Later on I changed the position when my apprenticeship was over and became a salesman and I was traveling almost to all parts of Germany, for many, many years with good success.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: When did you become an apprentice?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: In 1916.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Q: When did you become a salesman?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: In 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: While you were growing up in Berlin, how would you describe the relationship between the Jewish and the Christian children that you went to school with.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: This was good – no sign of any anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: When you became a salesman and you traveled all over Germany, did you belong to any organizations – cultural or political?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: No, I never belonged to any organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: What did you do with your free time when you were working as a young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Well, there wasn't much free time left because I can say that I was at least ten months on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Was your father in business?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: My father was a beampter for the Jewish community in Berlin.</span> <span id="s22">He was an inspector and a very religious man.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So you had a religious upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s25">We had a kosher household.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q: How did Hitler's coming to power effect you personally in 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">A: In 1933, I would say in the beginning of his power, I didn't feel too much about him.</span> <span id="s28">You could travel all over as before but by and by, it became worse as many hotels outside of Berlin in the country did not accept Jews as guests.</span> <span id="s29">There were many signs in many – but that was later on – in 1934, in 1935 – Juden Nicht Erwuenscht.</span> <span id="s30">And that was the first problem.</span> <span id="s31">Customers were reluctant to Adolf Hitler.</span> <span id="s32">I had in the first years of his power no difficulty that they say we don't buy from you anymore – you are a Jew or you have a Jewish firm which you represent.</span> <span id="s33">That gave no difficulties in the first years.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: When you say the hotels displayed signs Juden Underwuenscht, did you ever try…</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: No.</span> <span id="s36">I never stayed in them.</span> <span id="s37">We had a choice sometimes.</span> <span id="s38">Let's say you came into a place like Stettin, there were 20 hotels in Stettin.</span> <span id="s39">The one had the sign on and the other has not.</span> <span id="s40">So we changed to the place where we could stay without the signs on.</span> <span id="s41">But then afterwards, when a few years went by, it became more and more difficult.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: Did your firm, or you, when you sold, have more of a Jewish trade or more Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: They had mixed customers – Jewish as well as Gentile.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: But the Gentile customers in the beginning…</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: They did not felt too good to Adolf Hitler in the beginning.</span> <span id="s46">You know everything takes time because Adolf Hitler told the people just the opposite of what they believed in and so it took a while until they became Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: Did you feel at the time that he wouldn't last long?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Nobody could say that.</span> <span id="s49">Ya, the people felt partly so.</span> <span id="s50">And there were even – what I think is quite criminal – before he came to power, we heard references by Jewish people – let him take over and let him show what he can do for us.</span> <span id="s51">And that was criminal in my opinion.</span> <span id="s52">I had many disputes with the people and said you won't be able to get rid of him if he takes over – then it is too late if we feel it what he is saying against Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Did you serve in the first World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Did you feel that the Jews in Germany were very patriotic?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: Oh, yes they were.</span> <span id="s57">More than this.</span> <span id="s58">And the good slogan was not fulfilled – what said – what promised "Das Vaterland Dank is Euch Gewiss" – that was not fulfilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: When did you begin to feel the difference in attitude…?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: I would say it could be the year of 1935 about – there is started.</span> <span id="s61">One day – there I got for instance from one good customer I remember that very clearly – a postcard from my company.</span> <span id="s62">It said, in German, "im interesse unders geschefts, tilen wir ihn mit das wir in zukumpft keine nicht Aryschen vertreter mehr emphangen werd".</span> <span id="s63">That was the beginning – that I could say I felt in strongly.</span> <span id="s64">And the customer was lost for me.</span> <span id="s65">I couldn't go anymore and they sent a gentile man over.</span> <span id="s66">It was about 1935.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: When you were told about that card, how did you feel about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: I was very depressed.</span> <span id="s69">In the first place, I was insulted by being a Jew and secondly I lost a customer, a very good customer.</span> <span id="s70">That was in Hannover-Wunden near Kassel.</span> <span id="s71">And then it became worse and worse from year to year.</span> <span id="s72">And then came the question of the so-called Arisierung of the companies.</span> <span id="s73">And then came lately a new law out – beginning October 1, of 1938, every traveler had a certificate for being able to travel and these cards lost their validity on October 1938.</span> <span id="s74">That means in other words, after this period it was impossible for a Jewish traveler to be on the road anymore.</span> <span id="s75">And that finished everything.</span> <span id="s76">And then came just about this same time the message that my company was Arisiert.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: The boss of this company was a Jewish man.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: They were Jewish men – there were three owners of the company.</span> <span id="s79">And funny enough, the last man of the company was in the Aufbau with a totes anzigen, Mr. Oscar Papenheimer with 93 years, here in New York.</span> <span id="s80">He was the last of the Mohegans.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: Did you know anybody at this time, either customers or former friends who joined the Party?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Up to 1938, did you consider emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s85">In 1938 in the summer, I was on my vacation in Baden-Baden and we talked it over with friends that there will be no staying anymore for Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s86">We knew we had to leave but nobody knew where to go.</span> <span id="s87">Then came first the 9th of November – I was caught in a Jewish hotel in Bad Hartzburg and they brought me to a concentration camp in Buchenwald where I had to stay for two months.</span> <span id="s88">My brother got a boat ticket for me to Shanghai and that gave the cause to let me out of the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: What happened to you in that town – Bad Hartzburg – on Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: Kristallnacht – we were in the hotel and about 2 a.m., all windows were smashed in the hotel and we knew there was going on some organized work of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s91">In the morning then, we were transported to Braunschweig and from Braunschweig out to Wolfenbuttel and in Wolfenbuttel was a penitentiary.</span> <span id="s92">We stood there overnight and then were transported further down to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: How did they transport you?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Trucks.</span> <span id="s95">No, in Brauschweig, we were loaded into trains, transported to Weimar and there we were loaded onto trucks and then down, I don't know how many kilometers, 10-15 km to Buchenwald.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: What was your impression when you came to Buchenwald?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s98">I knew before – the people were mumbling what is going on in the concentration camps and we knew before that it wasn't too friendly a reception – we knew that.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: How did you feel on that 9th of November?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: Very badly, very depressed.</span> <span id="s101">It wasn't a pleasure to be caught by Nazis.</span> <span id="s102">The treatment was not too good.</span> <span id="s103">People were beaten and thrown in the truck and awful thing occurred.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: When you came to Buchenwald, was it worse than you anticipated?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: No, it wasn't worse because we knew before because we spoke to people who had been released from there and that one man had told us what is going on is undescribable.</span> <span id="s106">We knew there were no horrible things.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Did they cause you any bodily harm?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: No, they did not personally attack me, but that was a lucky thing – other people had to suffer.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: What was a typical day there like?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: It was an eternity to stay for two months over there.</span> <span id="s111">It was not as though you were living a regular life.</span> <span id="s112">You were in a barracks under the most primitive circumstances.</span> <span id="s113">No opportunity to wash yourself – nothing.</span> <span id="s114">You get your piece of bread and sometimes, a soup or so.</span> <span id="s115">The food was not even too bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: What did you get to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Soups, a piece of sausage, a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s118">Sometimes coffee, sometimes tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Did you have to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">A: No, we did not work.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Was your brother there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, I was the only one in the family who was caught.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You mentioned that your brother got you a ticket to Shanghai and that enabled you to be released from Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s124">How did you prepare to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: They gave me four weeks time for leaving.</span> <span id="s126">So I prepared – to go shopping, to buy this for Shanghai.</span> <span id="s127">We investigated what is right to take along – what is not right.</span> <span id="s128">But the people didn't give me the right advice.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: When you say the people, were these organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: No, private people.</span> <span id="s131">I bought a tropical helmet in a store on Potsdamerstrasse in Berlin – that was for tropischer austrustung- a store.</span> <span id="s132">And I said, what is good as a transfer, what would you recommend because you couldn't take money along and you looked for objects to sell over there.</span> <span id="s133">He said take soap – the soap was cheaper in Shanghai that it was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Did you have any trouble buying at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: No, none.</span> <span id="s136">The people in Berlin – they felt everything much later than in the provinces.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: That's an interesting point, since you were a salesman…</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: When I came home, you know and I told my parents what is going on, they couldn't comprehend it.</span> <span id="s139">They said how is that possible and my father always said "die machen was sie wollen".</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: There must have been many parades in Berlin…</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: But I didn't feel too much of it because I was always on the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Did you notice any difference between one section of Germany and another in terms of Nazi strength?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: A little bit stronger in some places.</span> <span id="s144">Then one day, the gauleiter of Pommern told Adolf Hitler, "Pommern is Judenrein".</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: When your brother purchased this ticket to Shanghai, was that for you alone or for all of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: For me alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: How did you feel about going to a place – Shanghai was quite far away and quite different?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Ja.</span> <span id="s149">Nobody knew anything about Shanghai.</span> <span id="s150">When I arrived there, I was one of the first immigrants to arrive there and they had a committee, a relief committee, and they rented buildings to shelter the people.</span> <span id="s151">At that time there were not so many, a few hundred, and then it grew up to 18,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: It must have been very difficult on the day you left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: In one respect I was glad because that was unbearable to stay there because by this time they felt it in Berlin as well as they felt it in other cities.</span> <span id="s154">In one respect, I was glad – on the other hand, to leave the parents and sisters and brother was not too good.</span> <span id="s155">We didn't know if there would be a chance to see them in life again anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Were they able to emigrate?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Afterwards, yes.</span> <span id="s158">My brother came one year later to Shanghai and he died over there from typhus and my parents came in 1941 via the last way – via Siberia by train and from Kobe out, they took a boat.</span> <span id="s159">And they died in 1941 within a period of 10 days.</span> <span id="s160">My mother first – they were old people.</span> <span id="s161">My father was 79 and my mother was 71.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: It must have been very difficult for them…</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: My mother like it in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s164">Ach, that was so interesting – there are people over people in the streets and they were selling this and this.</span> <span id="s165">My mother wasn't interested in everything but she said everything would have been fine and smooth if my brother, her son, wouldn't have died over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: You mentioned that you had sisters as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Yes, they went to America.</span> <span id="s168">They had affidavits.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: What was the route you took to Shangai?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: The route was by train to Trieste and from there we boarded the one boat of the Lloyd Trestino Steamboad – Italian company.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Were most of the people on the boat German Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: No.</span> <span id="s173">Only a part but it was fully booked and I was lucky enough to get a ticket for first class.</span> <span id="s174">I paid myself in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: You mentioned when you came to Shanghai, there was a relief committee who had arranged for shelter.</span> <span id="s176">Were these the Heims?</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Right.</span> <span id="s178">They called it Heime.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What kind of condition existed in the Heimes?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: It was very primitive, very primitive.</span> <span id="s181">The food was good in the first time, but then afterwards when the number of people increased, it became worse because it was expensive.</span> <span id="s182">They had relief money from America, from the JOINT and from the HICEM.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Who ran the relief committee?</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: They were people elected and they founded the Jewish community congregation and it sort of grew up by itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: There was a Jewish community in Shanghai before…</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: But that was Russian.</span> <span id="s187">They partly gave money or gave loans for the people which was refunded by American organizations.</span> <span id="s188">So, everything was okay until the second World War broke out because then all the connections were broken – to America and elsewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Before we come to that, how did you earn a living in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s190">A: I had so many jobs over there – it was so – you changed every four weeks – you were peddling with raincoats – I was peddling together with another friend and if this was not lucrative enough, I took over a job selling chemicals.</span> <span id="s191">Then I was a member of a choir – a mens' choir over there and we made a few pennies and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: How did you get these jobs?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Through friends of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Were these jobs within the community or outside in the city of Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: In the city of Shanghai.</span> <span id="s196">I could go looking for customers whenever I want.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Who did you – it's such a different culture - …</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Chinese people.</span> <span id="s199">Most of the Chinese people – the educated people – they speak a good English in Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Did you deal with the Japanese also?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: No, not too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: What were your impressions of Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Impressions of Shanghai – that is a city where you cannot stay forever – from the beginning on – you cannot compete in business with the Chinese people because they are people without any demands – primitive.</span> <span id="s204">If they make a few pennies a day, they are satisfied.</span> <span id="s205">It is not like here – the people have money like hell.</span> <span id="s206">You found in the morning – particularly in the winter time, people dead in the street – starved to death.</span> <span id="s207">They cannot care – they don't know exactly are they a population of 600 millions or 800 millions.</span> <span id="s208">They cannot take care for everybody.</span> <span id="s209">It's improssible.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Were you able to earn enough money to keep yourself going?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s212">In a most primitive way.</span> <span id="s213">You wouldn't believe how little a human being needs to stay alive.</span> <span id="s214">How little he or she needs.</span> <span id="s215">It is no comparison to the United States at all.</span> <span id="s216">And here, very often I have very severe debates and discussions with people.</span> <span id="s217">I tell the people and that is my conviction.</span> <span id="s218">Poverty among the Jews in the United States is almost to me unknown because a poor man is a man in the eyes of American people who has no automobile, who has no color television or he has no sail boat in the river.</span> <span id="s219">That is a poor man in the United States.</span> <span id="s220">In China, a man possesses what he has on his body – the lumpen what he has on his body – that is his possession.</span> <span id="s221">Here, no country – not the most honest country in the world without criminals and not so rich country in the world without poor people – that does not exist.</span> <span id="s222">But expresses in percentages – what is a poor man – what is a poor man in America.</span> <span id="s223">I would say – a man who doesn't know how to pay his rent tomorrow and a man who doesn't know what food to put on the table – without any means.</span> <span id="s224">In China – out of 800 million, 600 million are starving.</span> <span id="s225">There are millions of people who are never able to buy new goods – newly fabricated goods.</span> <span id="s226">The second hand deal is the biggest deal over there.</span> <span id="s227">You have dealers in the streets with old shoes, with old suits, with old ties, everything is old.</span> <span id="s228">They just cannot afford to buy it.</span> <span id="s229">And that is the difference between here.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: Were you selling second hand things?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: We sold in the first place for being able to stay alive what we had in our luggage.</span> <span id="s232">And we took along many things – was it new or was it used – it didn't mean anything.</span> <span id="s233">You could sell anything what you had – except one object, I remember – a so called gefluegel sheerer – a chicken shears – you could not get rid of it because they didn't know what it was – that was the only object.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: How did you get around in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: That was no difficulty – you used the bus, you used the tramway.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: How did you make yourself understood?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: With English.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: Did you know English when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: At that time I knew a good working English.</span> <span id="s240">I had an English teacher in Germany before I left privately.</span> <span id="s241">And then the conductor told you where to go and you had a map of Shanghai city.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: How did the Chinese people react to…</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Very friendly, very friendly.</span> <span id="s244">The people are very nice people.</span> <span id="s245">I can't say anything against the Chinese people.</span> <span id="s246">It is different with the Japanese.</span> <span id="s247">The Japanese are called sometimes the Prussians of Asia and it is so.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: In what sense is it so?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: In the sense that they were war mongers and we were strictly under the rules of the Japanese in the part – Hongkew – of Shanghai.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: When your parents and your brother came, did you all live in the Heim?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: First in the Heim and then we had a private room and that was something.</span> <span id="s252">They felt like a millionaire – like a king – when they were able to live in a private room instead of the home.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did you rent this room?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Yes, from private people.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Chinese People?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, in this part of Shanghai, there were a colony of Russians, White Russians who left Russia in 1917 when the Revolution broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: I read somewhere that there were small alleys that led to these rooms…</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: They were not alleys, lanes they called it.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Were the living conditions there better than in the Heim?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Sure they were better.</span> <span id="s261">You are alone and in the Heim you were together in a hall of maybe fifteen or twenty people.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: In the Heim, did they have any provisions for families to be together?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Mostly couples together and bachelors together.</span> <span id="s264">They had many of these so- called homes.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: How did you adjust to the different climate between Europe and Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: The climate is not too good for Europeans over there.</span> <span id="s267">They have very seldom snow but it is never the less so cold over there that you need a radiator or a heater or something like this and very warm clothing in the winter.</span> <span id="s268">In the summer, is much more humid then it is here.</span> <span id="s269">I put my shoes in a drawer – a black pair of shoes – and when I opened it, they were looking white.</span> <span id="s270">That was all mold.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Were you prepared for these conditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No.</span> <span id="s273">That was new for us.</span> <span id="s274">We didn't know that – we knew very little about Shanghai because there were no people before us over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Did you have trouble with the diseases that existed in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: It was very bad – infectious diseases, they had and many people become victims of these diseases.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Were there any medical facilities?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s279">There were two hospitals – one infection hospital and then for general diseases and good doctors from Europe – Jewish doctors from Europe – from Germany and from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Were these hospital run by the European community?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s282">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: How did the beginning of the war affect the refugee community in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: First, in a financial way.</span> <span id="s285">They were cut off from all parts of the world.</span> <span id="s286">And it was a disaster – they didn't know how to feed the people without money from abroad.</span> <span id="s287">But then I head that the Russian people who were in very good financial conditions, they have a loan and that was refunded after the war by the American institutions here.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: How did you feel about being in Shanghai when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: Very, very lost.</span> <span id="s290">We didn't know what our fate would be in the future.</span> <span id="s291">And what we had brought in the luggage, that was almost sold.</span> <span id="s292">There wasn't much left in the luggage and that was our rescue and many people, they were sold out.</span> <span id="s293">When my parents came in 1941, they brought big trunks along and there were carpets in for sale and such things so maybe we sold a carpet and we had to live for a few weeks or so additionally to that which we got from the relief committee and that was not sufficient in no way.</span> <span id="s294">And that is the reason that many people died over there of under ernehrung (malnutrition).</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: Did your parents have any difficulty in bringing things like carpets out of Germany in 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s296">A: No.</span> <span id="s297">This they could do.</span> <span id="s298">But they couldn't bring along gold, silver or ornaments because of the Juden Abgarbe.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Q: What did you do with any free time you had in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: We had a very big circle of friends over there because everyone was in the same miserable condition as we were and so they were very very close together – much closer than here in America.</span> <span id="s301">And I must say it was much easier to live in Shanghai as a schnorer as to live in the United States as a schnorer – much much easier because most of the people - the majority was without means – two-thirds was without any means.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did you have any other means of recreation?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: They founded a little theater where they played comedies and musicals in a very primitive form, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: Who did they get to perform?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: People who were professional theater people partly and also amateurs.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: How would you describe the morale of the people in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: The morale was excellent I would say.</span> <span id="s308">When you see what is going on here in the United States with the criminals where people have to live are in comparison to the style of living of the immigrants in Shanghai, the people have no reason at all to be a criminal here and you have them by the thousands.</span> <span id="s309">They murder people for a dollar.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Among the German Jews, was the outbreak of the war demoralizing?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Sure it was.</span> <span id="s312">It brought a change in, a, the financial status of many people.</span> <span id="s313">There were many who were supported with good amounts of money from America from relatives and that stopped completely.</span> <span id="s314">So, they were forced – first they had their private rooms and many of them were forced to move into the Heim and that was a terrible change.</span> <span id="s315">People didn't have anything to wear anymore – they were running around without coats – in lumpen.</span> <span id="s316">They had to steal what they had and there was nothing else but the little relief from the committee and that was not sufficient to keep the people alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: What happened when they set up the Hongkew ghetto after the war broke out?</span> <span id="s318">Did it change anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s319">A: It changed in so far as the people couldn't move wherever they wanted.</span> <span id="s320">I couldn't go to the city.</span> <span id="s321">I had to stay without special permission in the district and that was wide enough to have a decent amount of space to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Mrs H: But you told me that you lived together with 60 or 70 people and just had a bed with a curtain around it.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: But that was in the Heim.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: Did you need identification cards in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s326">We got identification cards with a yellow frame around it and that meant Jewish so it could be recognized by anyone very fast.</span> <span id="s327">And that lasted until the war was over and the Japanese surrendered.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Did the Japanese ever discriminate against the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No.</span> <span id="s330">You can't say that.</span> <span id="s331">They were very strict in their regulations.</span> <span id="s332">It was hard to work against it and it followed hard punishment but people shouldn't have done that in some cases, it was their own fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What do you mean, "shouldn't have done that"</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I mean people left the district without having any permission and that was an offense and this offense when it was brought to the court was punishable.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: What kind of court was it brought to?</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: The Japanese court.</span> <span id="s337">There was a man who everybody was very afraid for – with the name Goya.</span> <span id="s338">Goya was acting according to Asiatic measurements.</span> <span id="s339">The man was not very tender and he told the court after the war when they put him in jail – he said he had the permission to have full power about the Jews – he could even kill them if there was a reason for it.</span> <span id="s340">But he didn't do it and sometimes very strong measurements were taken by him.</span> <span id="s341">For instance, they beat up people when he found out that they had offended somehow.</span> <span id="s342">I saw him on a balcony standing with a very tall man.</span> <span id="s343">He asked him questions and so far as I could understand from a distance, the man did something wrong and he slapped him in his face and he did that with many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Was there any chance of defense?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: No.</span> <span id="s346">Immigrant justice did not exist at this time.</span> <span id="s347">That Mr. Goya – he studied the way police in the United States – he had full power and everything was taken to the Japanese court so far as he could not solve the case himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: When the ghetto was set up, you didn't know how long it would last…?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s350">But then one day, we noticed that no airplanes were flying over the Shanghai territory anymore.</span> <span id="s351">And I said to friends of mine – there must be going on something what we don't know about.</span> <span id="s352">And that was the result of the atom bomb what fell over Japan the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: After the war broke out, was it more difficult for you to live than before?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: No, I wouldn't say that.</span> <span id="s355">It was very hard – everything was very primitive.</span> <span id="s356">The cost was very small.</span> <span id="s357">Sometimes in the so-called kasha soup – there were worms in but it didn't harm the people.</span> <span id="s358">The only goals was to survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: When we talked the last time, you mentioned that your parents also came to Shanghai.</span> <span id="s360">When did they come?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: They came in 1940 just one day before Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s362">They arrived by boat.</span> <span id="s363">They came via Moscow with the trans-Siberian railroad.</span> <span id="s364">That was that time the only connection.</span> <span id="s365">They passed the Manchurai and it was an international train with the shutters down when they passed by Manchuria because it was a war territory at that time.</span> <span id="s366">The train was first class and they stopped in Moscow for one night in the Metropol and it was full of the finest delicacies.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: How old were your parents when they came to Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: My father was 77 and my mother was 69 and they survived one year in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s369">They died within ten days of each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: How did they adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Very nicely, but after the death of my brother, of course, the good humor was gone.</span> <span id="s372">My mother never came over it – never.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Your brother died in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s375">On the 7th of June, 1941.</span> <span id="s376">He died of yellow fever and spotted typhus and the whole sickness lasted not longer than five days.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Did he have good care while he was sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s379">He was in the infection hospital ruled by the immigrants.</span> <span id="s380">I talked to the doctor and the doctor said that in this case, there is only one solution.</span> <span id="s381">Either it becomes good in a very short time or it is fatal.</span> <span id="s382">And in my opinion the doctor said, it would be fatal.</span> <span id="s383">"Very sorry to give you that very sad message but I think it will be fatal".</span> <span id="s384">And now the question for me was how to inform my parents about this terrible thing that had to be expected.</span> <span id="s385">At first, I told them it is not very good and the doctors are doing everything what could be done and then he died one night at 2 A.M.</span> <span id="s386">The next morning I came to the parents and said it is very, very bad – I think it is hopeless but at that time my brother was dead already.</span> <span id="s387">I slowly prepared them for the inevitable.</span> <span id="s388">My mother didn't go to the funeral – only my father did and good friends stood with her in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Were there cemeteries?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s391">There were two.</span> <span id="s392">The one was filled and then they started another one – new land was bought.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: How did your brother get yellow fever and spotten typhoid?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s395">The cause of infection nobody knows.</span> <span id="s396">There were people who were of the opinion that it was brought by vermin – but that's not for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: How long was your brother in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: One year.</span> <span id="s399">He came in 1940 and died in 1941.</span> <span id="s400">And then was a rabbi who died of the same cause.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Had your father been self-employed in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Has was an officer in Germany – an inspector with the Jewish community in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Was it a difficult adjustment for him not to work in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: He was at this time already retired in Germany.</span> <span id="s405">He was 77 year old and most of the people in Germany didn't work in that age anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: You mentioned that the hope was to survive and get out.</span> <span id="s407">Did everyone have plans to re-emigrate once they could?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: I would say that almost everyone did because to live among Chinese people is very difficult.</span> <span id="s409">You cannot compare this undeveloped country with America or with other European countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: In what way was it difficult to live among the Chinese?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: The Chinese are a very strong competition.</span> <span id="s412">They work for pennies what we are not used to.</span> <span id="s413">It was very hard to compete with them in respect of business and secondly to live with a foreign race is another difficult question.</span> <span id="s414">It is not only seen financially but in other respects too.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: Do you mean sheer numbers or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: It is not only numbers but culture.</span> <span id="s417">Asian people you never will learn to understand – that is my personal opinion.</span> <span id="s418">The man can stand in front of you with a laughing face and two minutes later, cuts your throat.</span> <span id="s419">The mentality of the Asian people is quite different as the Europeans, quite different.</span> <span id="s420">You will never understand the soul of a Chinese man despite that they are partly harmless.</span> <span id="s421">I mean every Chinese man is not a warrior or a murderer or so.</span> <span id="s422">I wouldn't say this but you cannot understand the mentality of the Chinese people.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: You said before that you did some selling among the Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">We had Chinese customers.</span> <span id="s426">For instance, I sold raincoats for a German man who manufactured them.</span> <span id="s427">He had a tailor with him from Vienna.</span> <span id="s428">He manufactured it and gave us samples and we went over to Chinese people in the city and had partly success.</span> <span id="s429">Other people sold material for suits and coats and made some good money, relatively good money.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: You had been a salesman before in Europe.</span> <span id="s431">How would you characterize the difference between selling in Europe and selling in Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: This is almost the same system.</span> <span id="s433">You call on customers and either you have success or you don't have success.</span> <span id="s434">In this respect it is almost the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: How did you communicate with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: They mostly speak a good English if they are educated people – a good English.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Did they like to buy from the Europeans?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s439">You see the style of dealing with merchandise is quite different as it is here or in Europe.</span> <span id="s440">The second hand deal</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Tape changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Were these raincoats also second hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: No.</span> <span id="s444">That was brand new what we sold.</span> <span id="s445">But you walked through the streets and on each corner wherever you walked where there is a little free space, there is a man – a dealer with merchandise, let it be shoes, china ware – all lines included.</span> <span id="s446">And then of course, when you buy, you have to bargain – that is the main thing.</span> <span id="s447">A man who buys without bargaining is seen in the eyes of the Chinese people as an idiot.</span> <span id="s448">Nobody would buy without bargaining.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: How long did it take you to learn this?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Not long.</span> <span id="s451">This I knew when I made in former years trips to Italy – that is the same thing.</span> <span id="s452">Buying without bargaining did not exist in Shanghai and sometimes you went down to half the price – but – now comes the clue.</span> <span id="s453">The man gives you a notation.</span> <span id="s454">Let's say you ask the man how much, what means in Chinese language – cheedee – and then the man either he shows with his fingers how much dollars – Chinese dollars – this may be or he explains it in half well nice pidgin English how much it is.</span> <span id="s455">Of course, then you don't agree with his price.</span> <span id="s456">If he asks twenty dollars, you offer ten dollars.</span> <span id="s457">The man goes down and he says, "no, no, final fifteen dollars".</span> <span id="s458">You say "no, no", you walk away and then he calls you back and he says okay, ten dollars.</span> <span id="s459">If you made the offer of ten dollars and don't agree with that finally, the man is in a mood to kill you because they call it you lost face – you didn't stay to your word and that is the worst thing in China.</span> <span id="s460">This we learned over there.</span> <span id="s461">You can say, "no, no, no" or don't give him many number of price or so and walk away – that's okay.</span> <span id="s462">But if you make your limit and don't stay to your word, you are a tramp in the eyes of the Chinese.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: Did this ever happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: No, but it happened to friends of mine and I was forewarned.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: When the war was over in 1945, how did the news come to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s467">That was the most enjoyable.</span> <span id="s468">We knew everything was over, but then we had the sorrow of what happened to our relatives who did not leave Germany in time.</span> <span id="s469">There came always messages but they were always misplaced or taken to other territories and we never knew anything.</span> <span id="s470">We got messages sent by the Red Cross back – unknown and so on.</span> <span id="s471">Then we knew there was very little hope for these people.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Did you still have relatives…?</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Oh yes, relatives, an uncle, aunts, cousins, friends, the whole family.</span> <span id="s474">A couple with a little baby, many people.</span> <span id="s475">Is there any family who did not have a loss in this disaster?</span> <span id="s476">I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: Was this the first contact you had in Shanghai with Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s479">After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: How did the people in Shanghai feel about the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Well, some people were lucky enough whose papers – immigration papers – were in good order.</span> <span id="s482">A short time after the war was over, they were called to the different consulates, to the Australian consulate, to the British consulate, to the American consulate and it happened very fast that they could leave Shanghai for their destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: Did you have American papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I had papers for America but it was not sufficient that I had an affidavit.</span> <span id="s485">In Berlin, we first should have for success a waiting number and we did not have that waiting number.</span> <span id="s486">That would have been a chance before the war broke out for me but this main papers was missing.</span> <span id="s487">So I had to wait the seven years until the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: How did you go about trying to get to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: We contacted the consulate – the American.</span> <span id="s490">We knew that papers were at the consulate and then one day they gave me an appointment.</span> <span id="s491">The man contested the papers given by one of my cousins who was already in the States and he found out that it was not quite in order because my cousin made the statement that he possesses I don't know the exact amount anymore and he had only paid taxes on a very small amount.</span> <span id="s492">There was the difficulty but I could overcome it and I got the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: Was America the only place you considered going?</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I made application for Australia but that was denied.</span> <span id="s495">We knew that was hopeless.</span> <span id="s496">We even tried that from Germany before already.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: How did you feel when you left Shanghai?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I was more than happy.</span> <span id="s499">Reunited with my two sisters here and with my cousin who was the affidavit giver and we couldn't wait for the time to leave.</span> <span id="s500">And then I got also a little help – financial support from America.</span> <span id="s501">My sister, when they wrote a registered letter – there was always included a 10 dollar note, a five dollar bill.</span> <span id="s502">It was after the war another style of life for me in Shanghai because I had money in my pocket.</span> <span id="s503">And nobody else than I myself can tell you that when people always holler into the world – nothing else than health, health.</span> <span id="s504">I can assure you the best health – by experience I had – the best health alone does not help you to have a good life – is not … Let's formulate it in this way.</span> <span id="s505">No good life exists even in the best health without a little bit of money on the side.</span> <span id="s506">It is not worth to live in good health without money – that is life in practice.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: How did your life change once you had the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Oh, I went over to good restaurants where they had lunches, and the portions were very small.</span> <span id="s509">I didn't only order one portion, I ordered two menus – that meant two soups, two entrees, two desserts.</span> <span id="s510">That shows you right away that it was another style of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Did you order two meals out of hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Not only because I was hungry.</span> <span id="s513">But that showed me you are in a position to do something for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How far did the ten dollars go vis a vis Chinese rates?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: That was a half of a fortune over there.</span> <span id="s516">We had two currencies of good value.</span> <span id="s517">The Japanese yen and the American dollar.</span> <span id="s518">You could change it all over and get a lot of Chinese paper money.</span> <span id="s519">You know when I came over and I met a friend at Szechuan Road – that was in the middle of the city.</span> <span id="s520">And we were glad to see each other again – he was a man from Berlin whom I knew since he was a little boy.</span> <span id="s521">He said Walter, we are here half a year, we can tell you something about the circumstances about life in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s522">You must be able to live here – as he knew that I was practically out of money at that time – for $5.00 American dollars a month.</span> <span id="s523">I was astonished – was that possible?</span> <span id="s524">Yes, you have to omit this and that – you cannot do things like put after shaving put cologne water on your face, this is luxury.</span> <span id="s525">You have to adjust to the plain life in Shanghai.</span> <span id="s526">But even this $5.00 rate was a fortune in the time of the war where every connection was cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: You must have made a lot of friends in those 8 years in Shanghai…</span></p> <p><span id="s528">A: Oh yes, and I must tell you it was much easier to live as a real schnorer in Shanghai that to live as a schnorer in the US – much easier, because at least two thirds of the emigrants over there – of the 18.000 people had almost nothing.</span> <span id="s529">And you didn't feel that you were a schnorer.</span> <span id="s530">These times of distress brought people closer together.</span> <span id="s531">I had many, many friends over there – really good friends – more than I have in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Was it hard as the Shanghai community broke up?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s534">Many people went back to Germany.</span> <span id="s535">Other people went to Switzerland, Israel.</span> <span id="s536">It didn't help – we had to say good-bye from each other.</span> <span id="s537">And then I had good correspondence with all these people in all parts of the world – years after this as far as they didn't die in the meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: When you came to New York…actually you didn't come to New York.</span> <span id="s539">Where did you arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s541">I came to New York.</span> <span id="s542">I arrived in San Francisco and was there 3 or 4 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Who paid for the passage from Shanghai to San Francisco?</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: The committee and then my relatives here – my two sisters – they sent $100 to the committee to San Francisco for the railroad to New York.</span> <span id="s545">I came by railroad five days and five nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: What was your impression as you came across the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">A: Oh, I was full of expectations.</span> <span id="s548">I thought in a short time I would advance to President of the United States and that lowered them from month to month later on.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What impressed you most when you came through the United States?</span> <span id="s550">You had spent most of your life in Europe, 8 years in Shanghai, and now were coming to a new place again.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I must say you don't see too much from a rolling train window.</span> <span id="s552">I only remember we passed by Salt Lake City and there were beautiful lights on the cathedral at night – that impressed me.</span> <span id="s553">Then you came to snow regions – it was in winter and then you came down and everything was green – it was in March.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: When you came to New York, did your two sisters meet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: Yes, they met me at Grand Central Station – it was on a Sunday.</span> <span id="s556">They took a cab and went home to the Washington Heights apartment of my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s557">I was very much impressed – the driver took the way along the Riverside Drive – the hills of New Jersey and the George Washington Bridge – it impressed me very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Q: Did you stay with your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">A: Yes, for the first month.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: How did you get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Through my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s562">He got me a job at Spears on 14th Street.</span> <span id="s563">He asked for an opening for my brother-in-law – he just came over.</span> <span id="s564">And I was there for a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: Did you like the job?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s567">I liked the job – partly – but I knew it was not for steady.</span> <span id="s568">When you start here, you know, it is not always 100% right.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: How did you get another job?</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: I looked to see if I could get into my old button line and was then successful.</span> <span id="s571">You know, I was in – what do they call the people who are not regular members.</span> <span id="s572">First you inscribe your name as – you are not a regular member.</span> <span id="s573">You are in an interim member and then after a while they make you a regular member.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: A member of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Of the union.</span> <span id="s576">And the union gives you the job.</span> <span id="s577">And that happened that I came into the union which included the button line.</span> <span id="s578">So, I came to Blumenthal &amp; Co.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Were you married at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: No.</span> <span id="s581">I married in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: When you went to Blumenthal did you become a salesman again?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: No.</span> <span id="s584">I did not become a salesman.</span> <span id="s585">I was a so-called order picker, that means I got the order sheets, picked out the merchandise that the customers ordered and that kept me busy.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: What did you think was the biggest adjustment you had to make in the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: I knew the language, I had relatives here, I had a job and could make money – I mean I never felt lost in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: What did you do for recreation in those early years?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Not too much.</span> <span id="s590">I made excursions in the summer, went swimming on the weekends.</span> <span id="s591">And culturally, I went to concerts, to the opera.</span> <span id="s592">We started with the fifth balcony and then improved our seats.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Had you gone to the opera and concerts in Germany too?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s595">Steadily.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Had you attended these kinds of events in Shanghai too?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: There was no opera in Shanghai – not even in the sense as it is here or in Europe.</span> <span id="s598">But music – Chinese or Asian – you don't understand.</span> <span id="s599">It is very strange to your ear and the opera which was there was not of too high value.</span> <span id="s600">They didn't steadily play – that was an, not of too high value.</span> <span id="s601">They didn't steadily play – that was an ensemble where one man sang in Russian, the other man sang in French, the third one in German and the conductor was an Italian man, Mr. Pacci, who died in the meantime.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: These performances, whatever they were, did help to…?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Sure, to put us in a better mood at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Having worked here and in Germany, do you think an employee is better off here or in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: This is a hard question.</span> <span id="s606">One man who has a special job makes money like hell here.</span> <span id="s607">Another man who is not trained in a special line of job doesn't make a tenth of the money that the other man makes.</span> <span id="s608">For instance, I had a late brother in law who (UNABLE TO READ THE LAST LINE).</span></p> <p><span id="s609">He told me that he would never have made so much money in this special line in any other country as here in the United States.</span> <span id="s610">I cannot say the same thing when I was an order picker in the button line.</span> <span id="s611">I don't make not even a tenth of the money as a man who has a trade.</span> <span id="s612">But it was a union job and you were protected and the people don't take too much advantage of you but it is no comparison.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did you ever consider going back to selling here?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: No.</span> <span id="s615">I didn't want to do that.</span> <span id="s616">They offered me to go here in the garment section to call on – I didn't like the people in the garment industry – shrewd people.</span> <span id="s617">They offered it to me but I didn't want to do it.</span> <span id="s618">I knew somebody who tried to do it.</span> <span id="s619">He was never successful.</span> <span id="s620">It was different here – with kickbacks and such shrewd people – not like it was in Europe.</span> <span id="s621">And you know in a big company – they had 10 salesman who called on customers in the garment section.</span> <span id="s622">What was left on customers for me?</span> <span id="s623">What they would have handed me over would have been linke stiebel (left feet).</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Today, are most of your friends of the German Jewish community or American born?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: Mostly German Jewish.</span> <span id="s626">We belong to the Tabernacle, to the Leo Baeck Lodge which is a group of the Bnai Brith.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: No.</span> <span id="s629">I was never back to Germany and will never go back to Germany because you don't go back voluntarily to a country where you were fired from.</span> <span id="s630">That is my opinion.</span> <span id="s631">That would act against my personal honor and character.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: How do you feel about the Wiedergutmachung?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: It is a blessing for all the people here and it will cease by itself when all the people die out.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">Q: Did it change your attitude towards Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: No, it did not – that is in my opinion paying debts of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: By the way, you mentioned that you had dreams of becoming President of the United States.</span> <span id="s637">How did you feel as you were looking for a job and the realities set in?</span> <span id="s638">How did you feel about your hopes and expectations?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: There is a saying here that a man of 50 years is on the job market a dead man and at this time I was already almost 50 years, so my expectations were not too great.</span> <span id="s640">I knew that I couldn't advance to a high position job and took it this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: How do you feel, in looking back, that living 8 years in Shanghai affected you, your philosophy of life?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: You learn something what you did not know before, but in reality it was eight years of lost time, no doubt about it – the eight years were lost.</span> <span id="s643">When I left Shanghai that is right after the war, my weight was 92 pounds and now I am 150.</span> <span id="s644">But that has nothing to do, not only to do with the food you eat, but also with the climate and with what we went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: When you say lost time, how do you mean it?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A It was lost time.</span> <span id="s647">I had to restrain from everything.</span> <span id="s648">I couldn't make any money.</span> <span id="s649">I was a nothing.</span> <span id="s650">It is the same was if you were to ask a man who spends eight years in a prison.</span> <span id="s651">It wasn't a good time, it wasn't lucrative – it was nothing.</span></p></body></html>
