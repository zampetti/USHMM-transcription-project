<span id="s32">And the first name was Siegfried?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">S: It was Siegfried because my parents wanted to put in Freddy.</span> <span id="s34">But that already was the time when Hitler was poking out and everything.</span> <span id="s35">And, so they thought, no they want a German name, they don’t want an American name.</span> <span id="s36">So my parents, they put in Siegfried.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s38">And Siegfried is spelled S-I-E-G…</span></p> <p><span id="s39">S: S-I-E-G-F-R-I-E-D.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">N:

year?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">S: I was born in Leipzig, Germany, 1929.</span> <span id="s45">Uh.</span> <span id="s46">On January the 11th.</span> <span id="s47">My mother told me that the day I was born on, it was the coldest day of the century in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s48">It was Celsius 45 degrees below zero.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">N: Oh, my goodness.</span> <span id="s50">That’s very cold.</span> <span id="s51">And, and it’s really interesting because you just said your parents wanted to give you an American sounding name and this is, well, obviously before you’re born, maybe 1928, right?</span> <span id="s52">When she’s pregnant, your mother?</span> <span id="s53">but they were already concerned about you having a foreign name.</span> <span id="s54">That you should have a German name.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">S: Yes, it is that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">N: Now, now, can you, do you an idea why they were concerned in 1928?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">S: In 1929, I said, my birth year is 1929.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">N: Absolutely, but I’m thinking</span></p> <p><span id="s59">S: Ah, 1920…</span></p> <p><span id="s60">N: probably, they talked about your name a month before, right?</span> <span id="s61">So…</span></p> <p><span id="s62">S: Yeah, but that (progrom?)</span> <span id="s63">happened at the mayor’s office when they registered my birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">N: Ahhhh….</span> <span id="s65">So, so, so was it the mayor who said something?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">S: No, it was one of the employees of the mayor’s office.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">N: Ahhh!</span></p> <p><span id="s68">S: Who had orders to accept only German sounding names.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">N: I see.</span> <span id="s70">Okay.</span> <span id="s71">Well, that’s, that’s really interesting.</span> <span id="s72">Okay, well, then, let’s go back in time before your birth.</span> <span id="s73">Let’s talk about your parents first.</span> <span id="s74">Can you tell me their names.</span> <span id="s75">Let’s start with your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">S: My father’s name was Baruch.</span> <span

id="s93">S: It’s seems that my uh, my uh my grandfather on my father’s side, it seems he came from somewhere small town in the Austrian Hungarian Empire, which was before the Second World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">S: Excuse me, before the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">N: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">S: And, uh, and it seems he came to Leipzig when he was a young man between 20 and 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">N: Okay, and…</span></p> <p><span id="s99">S: But I don’t know where he was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">N: You don’t know which part of the Empire he came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">S: No.</span> <span id="s102">Austrian-Hungarian Empire at that time was very big.</span></p> <p><span

Well, he spoke German, if he spoke any, any.</span> <span id="s119">Mostly German, I don’t remember him talking Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s121">And…</span></p> <p><span id="s122">S: And if he knew any other languages I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">N: You wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s124">Okay.</span> <span id="s125">Okay.</span> <span id="s126">So, your paternal grandfather came to Leipzig from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> <span id="s127">Uh.</span> <span id="s128">In the late 1800s.</span> <span id="s129">And what about your father’s mother?</span> <span id="s130">Baruch’s mother?</span> <span id="s131">Where was she from?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">S: Her.</span> <span id="s133">I don’t know.</span> <span

there were four men and three girls.</span> <span id="s138">And after four men, five, uh, three had uh, diabetes.</span> <span id="s139">Because diabetes comes from the mother, goes only through the male side.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">N: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">S: It never goes through the female side.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">N: I see.</span> <span id="s143">Um.</span> <span id="s144">And do you know when she died?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">S: Uhhhhmmm…</span></p> <p><span id="s146">N: Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">S: I don’t know if she died before I

factory of uh, of uh.</span> <span id="s160">Uh.</span> <span id="s161">When the American forces came in 1945 to Europe, they all were wearing belts.</span> <span id="s162">At that time in Europe

um, the suspenders.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">S: Suspenders, yes.</span> <span id="s168">He had a very big factory in Germany.</span> <span id="s169">I think it was one of the biggest ones.</span> <span id="s170">Making suspenders.</span> <span id="s171">Because everybody at that time was using suspenders.</span> <span id="s172">Nobody used to wear in Europe at that time, belts.</span></p>

Oh.</span> <span id="s208">It was a family affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">S: Right.</span> <span id="s210">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s211">N: So, before the Netherlands, what was your father doing as a profession in Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s212">S: Uh, he was working, he and, of the four boys, he and his younger brother were working at the factory in Germany.</span> <span

salesman for a factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">S: No, he was a partner.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">N: Ahhh…</span></p> <p><span id="s223">S: He and his younger brother were partners in the factory.</span> <span id="s224">Junior partners.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s226">As a partner, he went to South Africa for what?</span> <span id="s227">For

have seven children.</span> <span id="s336">They even had a governess for the children.</span> <span id="s337">Each, they told what the children did wrong, and at the end of the week she made the accounts with my grandfather and then they would get a cut in their pocket money.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">S and N: (laugh)</span></p> <p><span id="s339">S: My father was very, my father was

id="s343">She says, “Why?”</span> <span id="s344">He says, “Didn’t you know it’s the latest mode in London?”</span> <span id="s345">N and S: (laugh)</span></p> <p><span id="s346">S: My father was very very very smart aleck, they say in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">N: I see.</span> <span id="s348">So, there was a governess?</span> <span id="s349">Um, were there any other people who helped around the house in such a big place?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s351">But I wouldn’t know how many.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">S: I even don’t remember their house.</span> <span id="s354">I mean, there probably were there.</span> <span id="s355">But I cannot remember anything from Leipzig.</span> <span id="s356">Not where I lived.</span> <span id="s357">Not where my grandparents lived.</span> <span id="s358">I don’t remember anything from the city.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">N: Do you know the name, what the first name maybe was of this governess of your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">S: No, I wouldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">S: None of the employees.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">S: Even the employees of my grandparents who lived in Holland.</span> <span id="s365">Their names, I have one was named Sarah.</span> <span id="s366">But that’s about all I can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s368">Mhm.</span> <span id="s369">Would you know by any chance whether she was Jewish or Gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">S: Oh, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">N: Definitely?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">S: All the, all the employees of, of the uh, of my father’s parents and my mother’s parents, they all were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">N: They were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">S: And, there in Holland, my uh, my grandparents also were extremely, were also Orthodox in the same way, as in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s376">Now you mentioned.</span> <span id="s377">I think you mentioned that your father did not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s378">Or was it your grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">S: No.</span> <span id="s380">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s381">I speak Yiddish, but he doesn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">N: He didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">S: He understood a little bit, but uh, uh, his Yiddish was rather poor.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">N: Now, does that mean he would not have been interacting with the community that spoke Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">S: In Germany, the community that spoke Yiddish was extremely small.</span> <span id="s386">You know, all in all.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">S: Because if you could speak Yiddish, you usually came from the Eastern part of Europe.</span> <span id="s389">Poland.</span> <span id="s390">Russia.</span> <span id="s391">Etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s393">Well, then, how about your mother’s family?</span> <span id="s394">Can you tell me about your grandparents on your mother’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">S: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s396">My grandfather name on my mother’s side, was Moshe [ph], Moses, but everybody called him Moshe [ph].</span></p> <p><span id="s397">N: Okay, so your grandfather was called Moshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">S: Schoenberg [ph].</span> <span id="s399">Like the composer.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">N: Schoenberg.</span> <span id="s401">Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">S: Schoenberg, but without the, the two double points because the musician is called Schoenberg [ph], and they were actually Schoenberg [ph].</span></p> <p><span id="s403">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">S: And my grandmother’s name was Rosa.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">N: Rosa.</span> <span id="s406">Okay.</span> <span id="s407">And where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">S: They were in Auschwitz, at the time it was called Oswiecim in Polish.</span> <span id="s409">And, uh, in 1931, one year before the First World War, they left and went to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">N: They went to Holland.</span> <span id="s411">I see.</span> <span id="s412">Now, why did they decide to go to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">S: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s414">N: Why did they decide to go to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">S: Because they probably saw the First World War coming on.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">N: The Second World War?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">S: No, I’m talking about the first one.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">N: Oh, I’m sorry did you say that they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">S: 1913, I said.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">N: 1913, I’m sorry, I thought 1931.</span> <span id="s421">1913 they left for Holland.</span> <span id="s422">Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s423">So, they left for Holland?</span> <span id="s424">Do you know why they chose Holland of Western European countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">S: You mean, why they choose Holland?</span> <span id="s426">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s427">That’s what you ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s430">I don’t know why they choose Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s432">And your mother, what was her first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">S: Sala.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">N: How do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">S: S-A-L-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">S: Her Hebrew name is Sala.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">N: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s439">Okay.</span> <span id="s440">And what year was she born?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">S: In 1909 on February the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">N: Okay, so she was already born before they all moved to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s444">She was eight months with my brother younger brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">N: Uh, but your, okay, so I’m a little bit confused.</span> <span id="s446">Your grandparents had moved to Holland in 1913.</span> <span id="s447">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">S: My maternal grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">N: Yes.</span> <span id="s450">And they moved there with your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s453">Alright, alright.</span> <span id="s454">So your mother…</span></p> <p><span id="s455">S: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m very sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">N: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s457">That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">S: I’m confusing this.</span> <span id="s459">My grandparents left Auschwitz 1931 before the Second World War.</span> <span id="s460">Before the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">N: Right, in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">S: And my parents left in 1933, left one month after Hitler came to power to go to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s464">Yes, that’s clear.</span> <span id="s465">Now, I’m just trying to figure out where your mother was between 1913 and 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">S: In Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">N: But didn’t your grandparents take your mother…?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">S: Oh, excuse me, excuse me, you’re right.</span> <span id="s469">You’re right.</span> <span id="s470">You’re right.</span> <span id="s471">My parents got married on 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">N: Ah hah!</span> <span id="s473">And where did they get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">S: In Leipzig.</span> <span id="s475">And my mother then went to live in Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">N: Now, your mother, between 1913, when she leaves Galicia, and 1928, when she marries your father in Leipzig- she is in Holland between that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">S: She’s in Holland, because uh, her father, my maternal grandfather used to do business with my father’s grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">N: I see, that’s where they know each other from. ]</span></p> <p><span id="s479">S: No, he saw her yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">N: So, what did your maternal grandfather do?</span> <span id="s481">What did Moshe do?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">S: He had a, Moshe he had a very big wholesale store, wholesale building.</span> <span id="s483">A big four floor building.</span> <span id="s484">Of everything you can think of in textiles.</span> <span id="s485">Underwear, shirts, trousers, socks, uh, handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s486">Who knows what else?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">N: So, you’re paternal grandfather was selling the, the suspenders to Moshe?</span> <span id="s488">The seller?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">S: To Moshe.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">N: I see.</span> <span id="s491">Okay.</span> <span id="s492">And um, so, how did your maternal family, they were, were they religious?</span> <span id="s493">Sorry, I should rephrase…</span></p> <p><span id="s494">S: No, they were exactly the same as on, exactly the same as on my father’s side.</span> <span id="s495">They’re both the same degree of religiousness.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s497">And also, Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">S: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">N: Also Orthodox?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">S: Also Orthodox, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s502">Did they speak Yiddish amongst themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s504">Yes.</span> <span id="s505">They came from Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s507">Did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">S: Most Jews who come from Poland and from Russia and from… You know what?</span> <span id="s509">I wanna ask you a funny question.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">N: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">S:You know what country the most beautiful way of speaking Yiddish is?</span></p> <p><span id="s512">N: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">S: Lithuania.</span> <span id="s514">All the big Chasidim come from Lithuania.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s516">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">S: I’m sorry I mix in something with the…</span></p> <p><span id="s518">N: No, no, no, no, this is very.</span> <span id="s519">This is very interesting.</span> <span id="s520">And I’m asking these questions because I, I think that having this information is descriptive of a family.</span> <span id="s521">You know, you can better understand the situation of a family.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s523">Yes.</span> <span id="s524">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">N: So, they spoke Yiddish amongst themselves.</span> <span id="s526">So, would you say that your mother’s first language was Yiddish or something else?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">S: Well, Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">N: It was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">S: Yeah, but after she married, she forgot it, she didn’t want to speak it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">N: But does that mean they were speaking Polish at home, with, in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">S: First at home and when she came to Holland she started speaking Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">N: Okay, so basically, after the age of four, she was speaking…</span></p> <p><span id="s533">S: At four years old she came to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">N: Dutch.</span> <span id="s535">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s536">So, in her home, were they speaking Polish, Dutch, or Yiddish, or everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s537">S: Mmmmm… I would say Dutch.</span> <span id="s538">Maybe my, maybe my Oma Rosa and Opa Moshe in between themselves certainly were only speaking Yiddish.</span> <span id="s539">But I think with the children they were only speaking Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">N: So, does that?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">S: None of my uncles on my father’s side or my mother’s side, none of them knew Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">N: I see.</span> <span id="s543">Okay.</span> <span id="s544">So then, your grandparents, Moshe and Rosa, they would not have known Dutch before they went to Holland?</span> <span id="s545">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">S: No.</span> <span id="s547">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s549">So they learned Dutch and they spoke Dutch with their own children.</span> <span id="s550">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s552">Because they had to speak Dutch for business also.</span> <span id="s553">So, like they say in Israel, “Aim doreaha” [ph].</span> <span id="s554">You know what that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">N: No, please tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">S: “Aim doreaha” [ph] means you have no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">N: Ah hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">S: Doreaha [ph] is choice.</span> <span id="s559">Aim [ph] is no.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">N: And um, did your maternal grandmother work or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">S: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s562">(chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s563">N: What did she do?</span></p> <p><span id="s564">S: She was a very good business woman.</span> <span id="s565">My grand, my, my, Moshe Schoenberg, he used to do buying because he knew the quality very well, but who, who, who, who handled the whole business?</span> <span id="s566">And who made the sales was Oma Rosa.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">N: Ah hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">S: She was a very good businessman.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">N: Ah hah.</span> <span id="s570">And on your father’s side?</span> <span id="s571">Your…</span></p> <p><span id="s572">S: My grandmother, my father’s grandmother married a man, my father’s mother, my father’s grandmother died very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s574">But she would not have been working?</span> <span id="s575">Would she?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">S: I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s577">I never met her.</span> <span id="s578">I cannot remember having met her and I don’t know when she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">S: She must have died young.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s582">Now, let’s just talk about your parent’s education.</span> <span id="s583">Your father went to what kind of school?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">S: He went to high school, then he went to kind of a business school for two years.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">N: Do you know which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">S: No.</span> <span id="s587">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s589">This was in Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">S: In Leipzig.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s592">Do you know whether he went to a religious school or a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">S: Public.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s595">What are?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">S: Public school.</span> <span id="s597">Not a lot.</span> <span id="s598">I don’t think in Leipzig they had many religious shuls like they have.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">N: Yeshivas.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">S: Like they have in the states.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s602">Mhm.</span> <span id="s603">And what about your mother?</span> <span id="s604">Did she have any schooling?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">S: She went all through public school, my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">N: Public school in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s608">I don’t think they had Yiddish schools in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s610">Now where in Holland did they move to?</span></p> <p><span id="s611">S: Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">N: And she stayed in Amsterdam until what year when she was growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">S: Til she married in 1928.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">N: Okay, and was it an arranged marriage?</span> <span id="s615">Or did she know your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s616">S: No, she knew my father because my father used to be once or twice a year in Amsterdam to sell, to sell, hosentragers, the</span></p> <p><span id="s617">N: The, the, suspenders.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">S: Suspenders, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">N: Okay, so they had met.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">S: They had met.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">N: And so she moves in 1928 to marry your father.</span> <span id="s622">And then, are you, you’re the first child?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">S: I am the first one.</span> <span id="s624">My brother is uh, four and a half years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s626">So your brother was born when?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">S: In Amsterdam in May 19… uh, excuse me, 1933.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">N: 1933.</span> <span id="s629">Okay.</span> <span id="s630">Um.</span> <span id="s631">Let’s see.</span> <span id="s632">So, do you have any memories of Leipzig?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">S: No.</span> <span id="s634">None whatsoever.</span> <span id="s635">Not for my house, not for my grandparents house, not for the synagogue.</span> <span id="s636">I don’t know if my father took me there on the High Holidays.</span> <span id="s637">I only remember Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">N: Did.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">S: In Holland, I remember we used to go and we used to, on Ramadan [ph] on Yom Kippur, my father went to the big synagogue in the center of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s640">It was one and a half hour walking one way and one and a half hour walking back.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">N: Oh my goodness.</span> <span id="s642">That’s quite the workout.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s644">Did your grandparents also, your maternal grandparents were already in Holland, they had not moved.</span> <span id="s645">Did your paternal grandparents, well your mother, your grandmother I suppose had passed away by then from diabetes, did your grandfather move with you to Holland?</span> <span id="s646">Your paternal grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">S: No.</span> <span id="s648">No.</span> <span id="s649">He left Germany, I think only in 39.</span> <span id="s650">He went to Belgium together with the younger brother of my father.</span> <span id="s651">He went only at the last minute, I must say.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">N: Now, you’ve already talked a bit about this, but I want to get back to your family leaving in 33.</span> <span id="s653">Can you tell me more about how they felt about why they were leaving?</span> <span id="s654">Anything concrete that they said, you know?</span> <span id="s655">There was a… Maybe there was an event that they decided, okay, this is it, we’re leaving.</span> <span id="s656">Or, how did they come to that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">S: My father was a guy who always saw, looked very much in the future.</span> <span id="s658">My father in 1938, 39 uh, when there was still no war in Holland.</span> <span id="s659">He wanted to go to the States.</span> <span id="s660">He had three sisters in the states.</span> <span id="s661">Um.</span> <span id="s662">And my mother didn’t want to go because her parents were living in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s663">In 1940, my father was very good friends with the English Consul, and uh, the Germans invaded Holland in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">S: In May.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">S: And so the consul contact my father and says, “Bruno, I’ve been your guest many times now.</span> <span id="s668">You are my guest.</span> <span id="s669">I have a ship leaving Amsterdam about in an hour from now, only English citizens.</span> <span id="s670">You will be the only people on board who are not English citizens.”</span> <span id="s671">That boat, when it left coast in Holland, it struck two magnetic mines.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">N: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">S: Terrible.</span> <span id="s674">Everything, everything busts and breaks, glass, windows, wash basins.</span> <span id="s675">Everything.</span> <span id="s676">So, we went back to the port in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">N: Are you saying your family was on that ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s678">S: Yes, we were.</span> <span id="s679">The four of us.</span> <span id="s680">We went in the lifeboats.</span> <span id="s681">Luckily enough it wasn’t very far away from the coast.</span> <span id="s682">It was about an hour rowing.</span> <span id="s683">And we arrived in the port of Emerd [ph], that’s the port of Amsterdam, and uh, stayed about two hours, and my father is very impatient, and he says, “Let’s go back to Amsterdam.”</span> <span id="s684">If we would have stayed another two hours, the English sent another ship and took everybody to England.</span> <span id="s685">My life story would have been totally different.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">N: So, he didn’t wait for the second boat, you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">S: No, my father was not.</span> <span id="s688">No, my father was not the kind of guy to wait for things.</span> <span id="s689">Because 1942, when the Germans started deporting Jews in Holland, he was the first one to leave Holland.</span> <span id="s690">My story’s long.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">N: I know you’re story’s long.</span> <span id="s692">I want to bring you back because I think we’re jumping ahead so much.</span> <span id="s693">But before I take you back, do you know what the name was of the British consul that said, “You are now my guests.”</span> <span id="s694">?</span></p> <p><span id="s695">S: No.</span> <span id="s696">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">N: You don’t know the name.</span> <span id="s698">Do you know the name of the boat that struck the mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">S: Renselaer.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">N: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s701">S: R-E-N-S-E-L-A-E-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s703">Would you know what the second boat was, that he didn’t wait for?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">S: Because we took off, so we wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">N: So, let’s get back from 1940 because we have to talk about the time between 33 and 40.</span> <span id="s708">So, getting back to my question, you said that your father always looked ahead.</span> <span id="s709">So, but was there something that pushed him to leave, or had he been thinking about it during the year?</span> <span id="s710">I realize you were only four years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">S: He was afraid of Hitler and he wanted to get away as far as possible from him.</span> <span id="s712">Which wasn’t, which, which in Holland was not the case because Holland is a neighbor of Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">N: Yes, do you know why they chose Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">S: Because my mother, because my mother’s parents lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">N: Do you know whether they, they took their valuables, the worth of their property, their business, were they able to liquidate the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">S: No, I know my father took some of the money of the factory and of my grandfather took away to Holland.</span> <span id="s717">And the German’s discovered it and later he had to send it back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">N: So, he took some of the value of the factory and then he had to send it back?</span></p> <p><span id="s719">S: Send it back.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">N: Wh…?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">S: Look, they worked hard for a couple of years to start a, to build up their business.</span> <span id="s722">It was life at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">N: Do you know, do you know when he had to send back the money?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">S: No.</span> <span id="s725">I think it was two or three years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">N: So, maybe 35, 36?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">S: Yeah, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">N: And, you said that your father had a brother and he was a junior partner.</span> <span id="s729">Where, did he stay in Germany or did he leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s730">S: No, no, my grandfather and his younger son Josef went to Belgium in 1933.</span> <span id="s731">About a year before the Germans invaded Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">N: 39.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">S: And they went in 39.</span> <span id="s734">And in 1940, the Germans invaded Belgium, Holland and France.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s736">Mhm.</span> <span id="s737">So, between 33 and 39, is your father communicating with his father and his brother?</span> <span id="s738">Are they exchanging letters?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">S: Probably, probably.</span> <span id="s740">But I wouldn’t know the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">N: Was your father keeping up with what was happening in Germany?</span> <span id="s742">Did he ever talk about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s743">S: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s744">Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s745">I mean, it was in all the papers all over Europe.</span> <span id="s746">You had it in Belgium.</span> <span id="s747">You had it in France.</span> <span id="s748">Everybody knew the problems with Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">N: Sure, but what I’m interested in is how this played out in your family.</span> <span id="s750">So, was it a topic of conversation?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">S: No.</span> <span id="s752">No.</span> <span id="s753">Not with us children.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">N: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">S: There might have been conversation between my parents themselves and maybe with their friends, but not with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">N: And when you were growing up before the war in Holland, um, did you.</span> <span id="s757">Okay.</span> <span id="s758">Here’s the question.</span> <span id="s759">What identity did you have?</span> <span id="s760">How did you feel about yourself?</span> <span id="s761">Were you a German Jewish boy in Holland?</span> <span id="s762">Were you a Dutch boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">S: I felt, no, I felt like a Jewish boy with no nationality.</span> <span id="s764">At that time we didn’t have passports because we were stateless.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">S: We were stateless for a long time.</span> <span id="s767">But that’s another story?</span> <span id="s768">You know what stateless is?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">N: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s770">Um, so, did your parents have any kind of identity papers during the 30s?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">S: Oh, yes, they were residents in Holland.</span> <span id="s772">And they had a factory and they paid taxes.</span> <span id="s773">The factory made profit and they paid taxes.</span> <span id="s774">And they paid taxes on their private income from the factory…</span></p> <p><span id="s775">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">S: and they were, they were, with the exception of the nationality, they were like Dutch citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">N: What language did your parents speak at home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">S: Only Dutch.</span> <span id="s779">After they left Germany, they never again spoke Germany.</span> <span id="s780">They only started speaking Germany again when we immigrated in 1947 to uh, to New York.</span> <span id="s781">Because uh, my three aunts there, they spoke half the time English with us, half the time, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">N: And why is it that they stopped speaking German in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s783">S: Because my father terrible hate of Hitler and Germany.</span> <span id="s784">I never, after the Second World War ends, finish about 1944, I went, I been going all over Europe because, uh, I live in Brazil since 51, all over Europe, especially for business, because we were in the chemical import business.</span> <span id="s785">I went to Russia, I went to Denmark, went to Poland, to Hungary, uh, but I never went back to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">N: So, your parents imparted this feeling about Germany onto you?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s788">They didn’t want to speak German.</span> <span id="s789">Only when they arrived in the States did they start to speak a little bit German.</span> <span id="s790">Then later on, they went to live in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s791">Because my father was diabetic also.</span> <span id="s792">Because I told you it comes through the mother’s side.</span> <span id="s793">My younger brother was also diabetic.</span> <span id="s794">Uh, Yich, when we came to Brazil in 1951, my parents arrived in 54, three years later.</span> <span id="s795">We worked together in business, my father, also.</span> <span id="s796">And, the diabetes of my father was getting worse because he made a very big mistake of not taking insulin injections.</span> <span id="s797">He only wanted to take pills.</span> <span id="s798">In 1969, the house doctor, my father told him, “Listen, Bruno, you in the wrong business because of your business we alwayshave all these problems, and problems are bad for diabetic people.</span> <span id="s799">You go to live in Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s800">And in 69, they went to live in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s801">And there again, of course, they start speaking German again.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">N: Mhm</span></p> <p><span id="s803">S: That’s where I learned my five languages, in that way.</span> <span id="s804">Because in Holland, I learned Dutch, then we were hidden in Belgium, during the war, and at the Belgian lyceum, you know what lyceum is, middle school, high school, I mean, we had to take four, five languages.</span> <span id="s805">So, Dutch and French were the main languages of Belgium at the time.</span> <span id="s806">So, at school, I learned English and especially, German grammar.</span> <span id="s807">One of the worst grammars in the world is German.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">N: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">S: French is difficult.</span> <span id="s810">The German is much worse.</span> <span id="s811">Irregular verbs in French are nothing.</span> <span id="s812">But the Germans, there (tape jumps) has three conjugations.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">N: It’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">S: Sorry, that I pulled over the, over the…</span></p> <p><span id="s815">N: No, no, no, this is very important.</span> <span id="s816">These are all important things.</span> <span id="s817">So, at home in Holland, they were speaking Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">S: Only Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">N: No Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">S: No Yiddish.</span> <span id="s821">And all the friends of my parents in between themselves, they only spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s822">Some of my best school friends, his parents, were from Dutch.</span> <span id="s823">Which they came from Russia, I think two generations ago, but they were all, they already were born in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">S: And my, my.</span> <span id="s826">The elder sister of my mother also came to Holland, uh, and she also spoke Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">N: And you only had one sibling?</span> <span id="s828">Or more?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">S: You mean, younger brother?</span> <span id="s830">Sibling in which way?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">N: Brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">S: I have sibling would be my child.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">N: No, no, sibling is brother or sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">S: Oh, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s835">Sorry.</span> <span id="s836">I thought sibling was a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">N: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">S: Okay.</span> <span id="s839">I only had one brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s841">And, so when your parents lived in Holland, you said you lived in Amsterdam, do you remember the street where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">S: Number 164 Beethoven Straat, Amsterdam Zuid.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">N: So it was Beethoven Street,</span></p> <p><span id="s844">S: 164 Beethoven Straat, S-T-R-A-A-T, and the neighborhood was called Zuid-south- Z-U-I-D.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s846">Was that a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s848">Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s849">N: Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">S: There were Jewish there of course, but don’t forget the Jewish population of Holland at that time already was big, but it was not more than 10%.</span> <span id="s851">Holland population at that time was 8,000,000 people and there were 800,000 Jews, which after the Second World War only about 30 or 40 were left over.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s853">Did you live in an apartment or in a building?</span></p> <p><span id="s854">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s855">Apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">N: Do you remember how many rooms you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s857">S: Uh, we had three bedrooms, one for my parents, one for my brother, one for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">N: Did, did you have a nanny?</span></p> <p><span id="s859">S: No, we had a Dutch, no, we had a German maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">N: A German maid.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">S: Yeah, but she lived in Holland a very long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">N: I’m sorry, she…</span></p> <p><span id="s863">S: She came to Holland as a child.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">N: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">S: But she was actually German.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">N: Did she live with you or did she just come in?</span></p> <p><span id="s867">S: She lived with us.</span> <span id="s868">No she didn’t live with us because there was no room for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">N: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">S: Margaret.</span> <span id="s871">Margot.</span> <span id="s872">M-A-R-G-O-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">N: Um, and, so did she take care of the children or only the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">S: No, she did everything.</span> <span id="s875">She made the house, she went shopping while my mother worked at the factory and she took care of my brother and I. Although, I remember very early on going to school myself because it was about three, four blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">N: And you’re saying your mother worked at the factory with your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s877">S: Yes, for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">N: And what did your mother do in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">S: I told you, she cut, she cut the pieces of, of, of, of rubber or whatever.</span> <span id="s880">The elastic.</span> <span id="s881">And my father sewed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">N: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s883">Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">S: And later on they got more employees.</span> <span id="s885">But, the first two or three years, they worked long, they worked long, from 8 in the morning until 6 or 7 at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">N: Wow.</span> <span id="s887">And what kind of traditions did they keep?</span></p> <p><span id="s888">S: Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">N: So, it was Orthodox at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">S: Kosher, we made abdalla Saturday night.</span> <span id="s891">You know what abdalla is?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">S: We had Kiddush on Friday evening, challah and everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">N: Um.</span> <span id="s895">Did you go to a religious school?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">S: No, a public school.</span> <span id="s897">Two very public schools.</span> <span id="s898">One was called Dalton’s.</span> <span id="s899">Dalton’s School, which was a system, you know, I don’t if you ever heard of Montessori?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">N: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">S: It was not a school of distance.</span> <span id="s902">And I went to Dalton’s School and I write in blocks.</span> <span id="s903">I don’t write in flowing letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">N: So, why, what is the advantage of writing in blocks?</span> <span id="s905">Or why did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">S: I had, this is what I was taught in school.</span> <span id="s907">I don’t know Mr. Dalton at all.</span> <span id="s908">He invented that.</span> <span id="s909">The problem is, that if you write in blocks like this, as you do in the Dalton School, my school friend, he could imitate my signature as well as I could imitate his.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">N: So, why did your parents choose to put you in something that sounds like maybe some, not very conservative type of school for the time?</span> <span id="s911">Certainly alternative.</span> <span id="s912">Or new.</span> <span id="s913">Or different.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">S: Because it was in that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s915">There were two schools.</span> <span id="s916">Dalton’s School and Montessori school.</span> <span id="s917">You had to choose between one of the two.</span> <span id="s918">Why they chose Dalton’s School, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">N: But why did they?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">S: I don’t remember of having any public schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">N: I see.</span> <span id="s922">So there was no accessible public school.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">S: No, not in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s924">Maybe in other parts of town, yes, I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">N: And can you tell me a little more about this Dalton School, what other specialties did it have, aside from block letter writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">S: Uh.</span> <span id="s927">No, no, it’s not a block letter.</span> <span id="s928">Their teaching system modern, they taught a little bit of everything.</span> <span id="s929">It was the same, at the Montessori, it would be the same.</span> <span id="s930">I think that the teaching system wouldn’t be very much different from any other teaching system at that time in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">N: Um, so you said, you would go to school by yourself.</span> <span id="s932">You were able to walk by yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s935">Did your, uh, brother, who was already born there, was he going to school there a few years later?</span> <span id="s936">Was there a kindergarten?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">S: Mmmm… One minute, one minute.</span> <span id="s938">We left.</span> <span id="s939">He might have gone, but I cannot remember.</span> <span id="s940">I don’t think, no, there was no kindergarten.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">N: Now, aside from Margot, I hope I’m pronouncing her name correctly, did you have any other people helping around the house?</span> <span id="s942">Was there a cook?</span> <span id="s943">Or?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">S: No, no, Because Margot used to cook, used to clean, used to go shopping, I used to go to the market with her to go shopping, and she was the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">N: Now you, of course, said a couple of times that your mother was working.</span> <span id="s946">Do you know whether she had to work?</span> <span id="s947">Or she chose to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">S: She probably choose to work, but uh, again, in Bernarach [ph] she had no other choice.</span> <span id="s949">I mean, she had to help.</span> <span id="s950">It was the beginning of their life.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">N:Mhm.</span> <span id="s952">Mhm.</span> <span id="s953">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">S: Of their business life, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">N: Did she at one point stop working, when they were better off?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">S: Yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s957">I think she worked about, I wouldn’t know, four to five years, three to four years.</span> <span id="s958">You don’t work all, at the time when the factory became big and more people came to work, she stopped working.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">N: So, how many people were working at that factory?</span> <span id="s960">At the Beutel [ph] factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">S: I think between 20 and 30.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">N: And this was around what year, they had that many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">S: Uh.</span> <span id="s964">I think after four or five years, and then til 1942 when we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s966">So, it would have been that many people already in 38, 39?</span></p> <p><span id="s967">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s969">And um, can you tell me a little about your parent’s friends?</span> <span id="s970">Did they socialize?</span> <span id="s971">Did people come over for dinner?</span> <span id="s972">Or card games or tea?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">S: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s974">No, it was more they went out together at night.</span> <span id="s975">Went to have coffee, or to a vegico [ph], to a concert or a theater play.</span> <span id="s976">And it took, I. House visits maybe two, three times a year.</span> <span id="s977">But, not, not, not on a weekly basis, I’d say.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">N: And when they went to a concert, what kind of music was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">S: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">N: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s981">Um, do you know whether their friends came from a certain circle?</span> <span id="s982">How, you know, where were they socializing?</span> <span id="s983">What type of friends did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">S: Well, um, mostly Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s985">My father had about one or two Dutch business friends that they see, but ah, I think that the socializing was only between themselves and between Jews.</span> <span id="s986">I would say that their, their Jewish friend circle must have been between 8 and 10 different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">N: And so, not really many gentile friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">S: No, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">N: Oh, none whatsoever.</span> <span id="s990">Okay.</span> <span id="s991">Um, I don’t know if I asked this before, but Margot was not Jewish, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s992">S: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s993">Who was not Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">N: Margot?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">S: No, Margot was not, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s997">Mhm.</span> <span id="s998">And, um, so, when you went to the Dalton School, I suppose there were Jewish boys and non-Jewish

id="s1134">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">N: 10th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">S: It was the 10th I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">N: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1138">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1139">And do you remember, so you were talking about bombs?</span> <span id="s1140">You were talking about bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">S: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">N : You were talking about bombs before?</span> <span id="s1143">Or bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">S: Yes, they were bombing.</span> <span id="s1145">And there were planes flying all over.</span> <span id="s1146">And the Dutch flew, they had the anti-air craft fires, anti-aircraft fire is murder because the shrapnel when it goes up in the air, it falls back in small pieces of uh, uh, of uh, how do you call it?</span> <span id="s1147">__________ is what you call it in Portuguese.</span> <span id="s1148">It’s not, it’s kind of a metal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">N: Uh huh, like debris?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">S: How do you call it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">N: I’m guessing it’s some kind of debris from the shrapnel, like little pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">S: Debris is actually French word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">N: Yes, it’s true.</span> <span id="s1154">It is.</span> <span id="s1155">So, so, when this was happening, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">S: We were in our house, and then I remember a friend of ours called very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1157">He said to my father, “____________” It means the puppets are dancing.</span> <span id="s1158">It means, it was a way of expressing</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">S: he didn’t know if the lines were monitored or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">N: Ah, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">S: Then, I remember, right away that at noon time we already went to the ship.</span> <span id="s1163">My father took the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">N: The same day, at noon, you were already going to the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">N: Oh, so it was on May 10th, when the Consul called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">N: Wow.</span> <span id="s1169">Now, you had said that your father already wanted to leave for the United States around 1938, is that right?</span> <span id="s1170">And your mother wanted to stay because her parents were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">S: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">N: Do you remember any arguments or disagreements in front of the children about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">S: No, no, it was between my parents and their parents.</span> <span id="s1174">They would never would speak about things like that.</span> <span id="s1175">At that time, they didn’t tell anything children.</span> <span id="s1176">It’s not like nowadays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">N: So, so this.</span> <span id="s1178">The bombing happens in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">S: No, no, all day long.</span> <span id="s1180">We had about 3, 4 days.</span> <span id="s1181">I think that Holland surrendered on the fifth or sixth day.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1183">Yes.</span> <span id="s1184">It’s about…</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">S: In Holland, it was very short.</span> <span id="s1186">In Belgium, it took longer.</span> <span id="s1187">In French, even much longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">N: So, when the bombing was happening were you in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">N: You did not go…</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">S: It started in the morning around five, six o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">N: You did not go to a place that was safe?</span> <span id="s1193">Maybe to a cellar?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">S: At that time, there were no cellars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">N: There were no cellars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s1197">There was no war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">N: So, so, on this, the same day, on May 10th, the British consul calls and invites your family onto the Renselaer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">N: Now, do you remember packing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">S: No, we didn’t pack.</span> <span id="s1202">I remember my father threw some money in a bag, and, uh, uh, uh, we had to leave ship.</span> <span id="s1203">He had a choice.</span> <span id="s1204">(tape unclear) Or… keep the money, the bag of the money, or keep my younger brother because he wanted to go elsewhere.</span> <span id="s1205">So he threw the bag in the in the water (chuckle).</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">N: Where did your younger brother want to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">S: No, he was going to take us to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">N: I’m sorry, he was going to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">S: The ship was going to take us to England.</span> <span id="s1210">It was an English ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">N: No, no, no, but you said there was a choice to either take the bag or your younger brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">S: No, when we were leaving the ship, you have to go into the saving boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">N: Ah, onto the saving boats.</span> <span id="s1214">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">S: Yes, yes, you have to climb into the saving boats.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">N: I see.</span> <span id="s1217">And there wasn’t enough space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">S: My father, all, he would take my younger brother and he would take him into the saving boat or he would take his bag.</span> <span id="s1219">One way or the other, you had to choose.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">N: So what happened to the bag?</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">S: It disappeared in the water.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">N: So, okay, so before you abandoned ship, when you get on the ship, how many people were on that ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">S: It was so full.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">N: And you had mentioned the consul said that your family would be the only ones who were not British?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">S: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">N: Now, how come your father have such a good relationship with such a high ranking British diplomat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">S: Because, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1228">They, they, they.</span> <span id="s1229">My father knew a lot of people.</span> <span id="s1230">He was very, he was very extrovert.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1232">Mhm.</span> <span id="s1233">And, do you remember when the ship hit the mines?</span> <span id="s1234">You said there were some kind of mines?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">S: Of course I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">N: But can you describe it to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">S: There was a terrible noise and you hear everything breaking around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">S: I told you.</span> <span id="s1240">The…</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">N: The glass?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">S: The glass, the windows, the shav-, the thing where you wash your water.</span> <span id="s1243">Sometimes, the word is missing.</span> <span id="s1244">The bathtub was completely in pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">S: And then we ran out.</span> <span id="s1247">They had people of the English, the English sailors, they said what to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">N: Now, what was your um, state at that point?</span> <span id="s1249">You’re about 10 years old, right?</span> <span id="s1250">So, how are you living this?</span> <span id="s1251">What are you feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">S: Not remembering.</span> <span id="s1253">I just remember the noise and everything breaking down.</span> <span id="s1254">And we were running upstairs to get into the boats.</span> <span id="s1255">And, and, then the people were rowing in the boat, and then we came in very big underground cellar there in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">N: I’m sorry you came in a very big…?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">S: A very big cellar where many people were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">N: A cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">S: An underground bunker, let’s say.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">N: So, you’re rowing back, where do you disembark?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">S: In the port of Haven van Amsterdam which is the port of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1262">It’s the canal between Amsterdam and Maarten, and Maarten is on the North Sea, it’s a port.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">N: And then where did your family go immediately afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">S: You mean when we came back to Holland?</span> <span id="s1265">We went back to our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">N: And you said there was a, a second boat that was departing later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">N: How many hours later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">S: I think, uh, they told us later on, it came about 2 or 3 hours later.</span> <span id="s1270">After we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">N: Your father decided not to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">S: No, he, he, he was afraid of waiting.</span> <span id="s1273">He went back to Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">N: I see, so they were telling you to wait in the port and he decided not to wait in the port.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">N: And the cellar was where?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">S: Was near the port also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">N: Near the port.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">S: I wouldn’t remember the exact location.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">N: But they were telling people from the boats to go into the cellar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">S: Well, you had to go somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">N: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">S: You row the boat, you come into the port, you have to get out of the boat.</span> <span id="s1286">You can’t stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">N: Sure.</span> <span id="s1288">It’s just for me to understand where you know, like, what comes first in the sequence.</span> <span id="s1289">Okay.</span> <span id="s1290">So, your father decides not to wait, he takes everyone back to the apartment where he used to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s1292">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1293">N: And then what happens?</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">S: Then, what happens?</span> <span id="s1295">Life goes on.</span> <span id="s1296">He went back to the factory and uh, six months later, he got a, a German supervisor from the German ministry of commerce.</span></p> <p><span

shot.</span> <span id="s1307">So, there was sometimes good Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">N: But you don’t remember his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">N: And, and obviously, this person knew that your father was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1311">Your father was not hiding the fact?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">S: Yes, yes, obviously because after six months, we had to wear those, those uh…</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">N: Stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">S: Magen David stars.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">N: Right.</span> <span id="s1316">Okay, then, describe to me what happens after the Germans come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">S: The first six months it was almost nothing happened.</span> <span id="s1318">Then things started happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">N: Were you able to go to school normally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">N: Okay, there was no distinction made between children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">S: No, but but for instance, uh, it’s called Sou… Do you know what licorice is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">N: I’m sorry, how do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">S: Licorice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">N: Oh, licorice.</span> <span id="s1326">Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">S: Yeah, well in Holland they made it the salt way.</span> <span id="s1328">Completely salt, in black.</span> <span id="s1329">Well, in Holland, this was a delicacy and every second day I used to go to the drug store to buy myself a little package of these licorice.</span> <span id="s1330">In Dutch, it’s called drupples, zoethout drupples [ph].</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">S: Sold drugs.</span> <span id="s1333">Uh, uh, uh, after six months Jewish were only allowed to go into stores between 6 and 8, between 6 and 8 pm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">S: After 12 months, I remember Jews were not allowed to go on the streets between 8pm and 6am.</span> <span id="s1336">One restriction came after the other.</span> <span id="s1337">I cannot remember them because there were many of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">N: So, when these first restrictions came in, what did you think about them as a boy who is not very old yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">S: Well, they were a pain in the neck, but that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">N: That’s about all.</span> <span id="s1341">But…</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">S: As a child, what can you remember?</span> <span id="s1343">I mean, you don’t realize what’s going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1345">Did anything change in school after a while?</span></p> <p><span id="s1346">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1347">N: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">S: At school, no.</span> <span id="s1349">Because I remember when I finish my primary school, which was in 1941, uh, I had to go, there was a high school for Jewish.</span> <span id="s1350">I had to go to a Jewish high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">S: There were only Jews and it was a high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">N: What was the high school called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">S: Joodse HoBS.</span> <span id="s1355">Hogere [ph] (Jewish Higher Citizen’s School).</span> <span id="s1356">Joodse, uh, Jewish.</span> <span id="s1357">Hogere, uh, in Dutch is Hogere burger [ph] school, which means higher</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">N: Education?</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">S: No, hogere is someone who lives in the country.</span> <span id="s1360">A higher citizen’s school.</span> <span id="s1361">A Jewish Higher Citizen’s School.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1363">And where was it located?</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">S: Near the Hotel Amstel, which was the most expensive hotel in Amsterdam and it was just the corner of the River Amstel, which is the biggest river which is crossing Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1366">Um.</span> <span id="s1367">So, you have to go to this Jewish school?</span> <span id="s1368">Did you, did that seem odd to you, or did you have any thoughts about going to an only Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1369">S: No, one went to do what was one told to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1371">What was one told.</span> <span id="s1372">And what about Margot?</span> <span id="s1373">How long did she stay with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">S: Until we fled in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">N: So, she was still working there after occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">S: Oh, wait a minute!</span> <span id="s1377">Wait, wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s1378">You got me there.</span> <span id="s1379">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1380">This I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1381">No, I think she left earlier, after the Germans marched in they forced her to leave, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">N: And there was no other person helping in the house after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">S: At that time, I don’t think so, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">N: So, tell me, when did you have to start wearing the star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">S: Uh, six months or one year after the Germans arrived.</span> <span id="s1386">I don’t remember the exact date.</span> <span id="s1387">It was not immediately.</span> <span id="s1388">It was probably in 1943 or after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">N: 43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">S: Yes, because the Germans.</span> <span id="s1391">No, actually, 41.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">S: 41.</span> <span id="s1393">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">S: I am mixing my dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">N: And where on your clothes did you have to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">S: On the left side of your shirt or jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">N: And was it only the shirt or the jacket that you wore outside?</span> <span id="s1398">So, like, like an overcoat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">S: No, no, if you have a, had a shirt which had no Magen David, you could wear it inside the house.</span> <span id="s1400">But, with that shirt you couldn’t go in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1402">Um, did, who sewed on this piece?</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">S: Don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">N: How did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">S: Probably my mother.</span> <span id="s1406">But, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">N: And how did you feel about wearing something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">S: Everybody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1410">Did you ever get any kind of um, did you ever get into any altercation because of it?</span> <span id="s1411">Did anyone say anything on the street?</span> <span id="s1412">Do anything on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">S: No.</span> <span id="s1414">Dutch were very, very, Dutch were very in favor of Jews.</span> <span id="s1415">They were even strikes in, I think in 1940, 1941 in favor of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">S: Dutch were very, very, very were very Jewish friendly.</span> <span id="s1418">Like in Belgium, the Walloon [ph], the French side, the southern part of Belgium, they were also very friendly with Jews.</span> <span id="s1419">In the northern part, which is the Flemish part, they always were way anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">N: And do you know why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">S: I wouldn’t know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">N: So, so you’re saying nobody, nobody hurt you, nobody taunted you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">S: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">N: Okay, and how long were you in the situation where you had to wear the Star?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">S: Til, til we fled in 19</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">N: And when did you flee?</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">S: In 42, when the deportations started.</span> <span id="s1430">In June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">N: Okay, so summer of 42.</span> <span id="s1432">And, um, during, from the point where the Germans came in in summer 40 to the point where you flee in summer 42, was your father able to continue working as he had been working before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">N: So, he only had a new supervisor, but he, he could do the same things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">S: The rest was as before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1437">And, so you were saying, this supervisor, later on tried to help your family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">S: He took in my parents one or two nights to sleep because they had no place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">N: And so why was this, were they already on root to Belgium?</span> <span id="s1440">Or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">S: No, we fled in 1942, uh, uh to Brussels because there was somebody there who was to take us back out to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1442">And then we were betrayed by a Jew in Belgium who knew many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">N: Okay, so what, first, my first question is, what made your father decide to flee exactly in 42?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">S: Well, because Belgium was occupied also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">N: No, but what did, flee from Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">S: Because he knew that the deportations were going to start in July, so we left in June.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">N: And how did he know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">S: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1450">Did he, did he talk about this, did he say, “This is why we are leaving?”</span> <span id="s1451">Or did he just?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">S: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1453">No.</span> <span id="s1454">No.</span> <span id="s1455">We were children at that time you know.</span> <span id="s1456">And they were people.</span> <span id="s1457">And my parents sort of said as less as possible because you never know if the Germans would arrest or something, arresting you, the better it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">We were in 42, we were arrested by the Devisenschutzkommando (Foreign Currency Control Administration).</span> <span id="s1459">Which was a branch of the German government to protect foreign exchange.</span> <span id="s1460">And, I, I was examined by two Germans when they arrested us for about three, four hours and I always denied everything.</span> <span id="s1461">Then later on, my father came in and told me, “You can answer now.”</span> <span id="s1462">I didn’t know everything.</span> <span id="s1463">Then my father made an agreement with them that he would give them the money he had in Switzerland if they would let us go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1464">Instead of that, they sent us back on the train to Holland with two German air force officers.</span> <span id="s1465">And when we arrived in Amsterdam, excuse me, the Hague, the capitol, my father asked them could leave the train and we children had to go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s1466">And so they said we could leave the train.</span> <span id="s1467">The train was stopped in the station.</span> <span id="s1468">They probably knew we were going to run away.</span> <span id="s1469">So, we ran away and we went to that uh, that house.</span> <span id="s1470">My parents stayed there.</span> <span id="s1471">And, I don’t know how they arranged it, my brother and I, we were in Haarlem, which is a small town near Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1472">We stayed there six months.</span> <span id="s1473">We were in a small maternity of about 12 or 14 bedrooms.</span> <span id="s1474">And we stayed six months, we stayed in Holland.</span> <span id="s1475">And we never went in the street.</span> <span id="s1476">We always stayed inside the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">N: So, this is fascinating, but I’m afraid that I’m losing some details.</span> <span id="s1478">Let’s go back to, to your father decides in the summer of 42 in June of 42, before the deportations to leave.</span> <span id="s1479">So, who, is he helped by anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">S: Yes, but I wouldn’t know who.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s1482">So, you say yes because you know that someone was there?</span> <span id="s1483">Do you remember someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">S: I remember we were in a car together with a friend of my parents.</span> <span id="s1485">Salo Lieberman [ph].</span> <span id="s1486">Uh, and it was the driver.</span> <span id="s1487">The rest I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1488">I remember what happened, driving outside of Brussels, the Germans stopped us and arrested us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">N: So, you had got, you had not even gotten to the other country?</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">S: No, no, we’re half an hour outside of Brussels.</span> <span id="s1491">In the suburbs of Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">N: And they arrested you.</span> <span id="s1493">Now, how did you get from Holland to Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">S: Uh, by one of these smugglers which take you across the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">N: So, it was on foot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">N: And how did you get to the border in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">S: By train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">N: And what happened when you first tried to leave?</span> <span id="s1500">What happened to the apartment?</span> <span id="s1501">And to the factory?</span> <span id="s1502">Did he sell it to someone?</span> <span id="s1503">Did he give it to someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">S: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1505">We left, I think my father made the decision in a fort night or maybe even less.</span> <span id="s1506">He just left the factory as it was.</span> <span id="s1507">He left the apartment the way it was.</span> <span id="s1508">He gave the key I think to friends of his, non-Jewish friends who lived one floor higher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">N: Do you remember their name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">S: Willis.</span> <span id="s1511">W-I-L-L-I-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1513">So they were driven to the border.</span> <span id="s1514">And did you say that there was another family with you?</span> <span id="s1515">Or that was later outside of?</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">S: No.</span> <span id="s1517">Only one man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">N: Only one man drove you to the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s1520">He drove my parents.</span> <span id="s1521">He was younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1523">And then you were supposed to, by foot, cross the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">N: Do you remember what time of day this was?</span> <span id="s1526">(beeping noise)</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">S: I do not remember crossing the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">N: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">S: I say, I do not remember crossing the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">N: Oh, you don’t remember this.</span> <span id="s1531">Okay.</span> <span id="s1532">So, once you were in Belgium, did anything happen before they got to Brussels?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">N: Um, and then you said, did you stay any time in Brussels before you were trying to escape to Switzerland?</span> <span id="s1535">Or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">S: Maybe one day, but I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">N: Do you know whether they were um, leaving through some kind of network or organization?</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">S: Probably.</span> <span id="s1539">No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1540">There were people who were organized to smuggle people across the border, to smuggle them into Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1541">I wouldn’t call it a network.</span> <span id="s1542">It was probably a group of people, maybe one or two people.</span> <span id="s1543">It was not an organized network like we know nowadays.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1545">So, and so they’re going.</span> <span id="s1546">They’re leaving Brussels, hoping to get toward Switzerland, but they get already stopped by the police in the suburbs of Brussels you said.</span> <span id="s1547">So, do you remember how the police stopped them?</span> <span id="s1548">Or any memories of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">S: Well, was, there was a barricade on the street.</span> <span id="s1550">So, you had to stop the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">N: And then what happened?</span> <span id="s1552">They told them to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">S: We had to go back and my parents went, were sent to prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">N: Which prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">S: Prison.</span> <span id="s1556">Ah, prison for burglars and murders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">N: But do you know the name of the prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">S: Yes, Saint Gilles.</span> <span id="s1559">S-A-I-N-T and Gilles is G-I-L-L-E-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">N: Okay, Gilles is the second word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">S: Gilles.</span> <span id="s1562">G-I-L-L-E-S.</span> <span id="s1563">And the first word, the first word is Saint.</span> <span id="s1564">Saint is a saint.</span> <span id="s1565">S-A-I-N-T.</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1567">Like a, like a Catholic saint.</span> <span id="s1568">St. Gills.</span> <span id="s1569">Okay.</span> <span id="s1570">I see.</span> <span id="s1571">And it was a prison for common criminals?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">N: And where, where…</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">S: My brother and I, we were sent to a, a place where they kept Belgian prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">N: So, what was that called?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">S: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">N: And, well you were pretty young, so this is, you’re thirteen, right?</span> <span id="s1578">And your brother was nine?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">N: And you’re sent to this place where there are prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1581">Are there other, are there children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">S: No, only us two.</span> <span id="s1583">Because at that, I was 13.</span> <span id="s1584">We left in June 1942 and in January I had my Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1585">And at the time of my Bar Mitzvah there were about fifty people in my apartment for the party.</span> <span id="s1586">And the people came at 7:00 and they left at 8:00 in the morning because nobody could go in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">N: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">S: It was quite a night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">N: So everyone was up all night.</span> <span id="s1590">That might have been a great party.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">S: It was quite a night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">N: Um, so when you get to this prison, and you say you don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s1593">What do they do you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">S: No, we weren’t in a prison.</span> <span id="s1595">We were in a prisoner camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">N: Oh, I’m sorry a camp for prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1597">What does it look like?</span> <span id="s1598">What is its structure?</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">S: It was a very big barracks, many beds.</span> <span id="s1600">Things like that.</span> <span id="s1601">I really don’t remember if we ate there or what we ate there.</span> <span id="s1602">I wouldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s1603">I think we stayed about 3, 4 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">N: Three, four days.</span> <span id="s1605">Were there, were there adults around you, in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s1607">Only sol, sol, only prisoners of war, Belgian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">N: But, so they were adults?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1611">And you were the only children there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">N: Did anyone talk to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">S: No.</span> <span id="s1615">If they did it, I wouldn’t remember.</span> <span id="s1616">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">N: Well, do you remember being worried, confused, frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">S: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">N: So, did you know?</span> <span id="s1620">Did you have some sort of understanding of where you were?</span> <span id="s1621">Did you comprehend it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">S: Yes, I knew I was in Belgium.</span> <span id="s1623">I knew I was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1624">I knew I was in a prisoner camp because they told us that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">N: And, you knew that you were with your younger brother?</span> <span id="s1626">Were you concerned about taking care of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">S: No, I always took care of my younger brother.</span> <span id="s1628">My whole life.</span> <span id="s1629">(chuckle) Well, we were in Belgium for two years.</span> <span id="s1630">And I always took care of him.</span> <span id="s1631">I know.</span> <span id="s1632">Do you want details of our life in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">N: Everything.</span> <span id="s1634">But just chronologically.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">S: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">N: So, you’re still in this prisoner of war camp.</span> <span id="s1637">Do you remember anything going on, any events?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">S: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1639">I remember that about five, six days later my parents came, picked us up with two German air force officers, they, we ran away on the train in Holland.</span> <span id="s1640">My parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">N: Let’s talk about running away because that sounds very exciting.</span> <span id="s1642">So, you’re being escorted by these two German officers back to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">S: Yes, my father asked them if he could leave the train.</span> <span id="s1644">The train had stopped in the Hague, which is the capitol of Holland,</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">N: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">S: to see if we could go to the toilet.</span> <span id="s1647">They said yes we could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">N: Is that because if there were not toilets on the train?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">S: Good question.</span> <span id="s1650">He asked him, my father asked him if we could go out to go to the toilet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">N: Ah, okay.</span> <span id="s1652">And so you say, they say yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">N: So, can you describe what your family did then?</span> <span id="s1655">They get off the train and?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">S: My parents went to that one house of the German, they stayed one or two nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">N: No, no, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s1658">But, in the train station.</span> <span id="s1659">Where do they go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">S: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1661">Noemi, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">N: You don’t remember if you had to run, or…</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">S: No, no, no we left walking normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">N: Walking normally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">S: If you run, that’s a problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">N: That would have been suspicious.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">S: Yeah, then you’re in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">N: Were your parents kind of coaching you, like don’t turn around or don’t speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">S: No, I don’t remember where, we split up right away.</span> <span id="s1670">I don’t know how the hell they did it.</span> <span id="s1671">They sent us to that house.</span> <span id="s1672">To that maternity house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">N: By maternity house you mean where, where babies are born?</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">S: Yes, yes, babies are born.</span> <span id="s1675">On the first floor there was about 12 or 14 rooms for expecting mothers and there was a, a, a, how do you call the top of the house, a, a, a- the other way, the opposite of a basement.</span> <span id="s1676">What’s on top of a house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1677">N: Ah, attic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">S: Attic, right.</span> <span id="s1679">I was looking for the word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">S: There was an attic where all the nurses slept and my brother and I slept.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">N: And do you know how they arranged for you to be there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">S: Well, they put in two beds, and they put in a closet.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">N: No, your parents, how they arranged with the nurses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">S: No.</span> <span id="s1686">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1687">I even don’t know how they arranged.</span> <span id="s1688">They slept, they stayed six months at an elderly lady in Amster… in the Hague and I don’t know how they arranged that either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">N: But first you were saying they stayed with your father’s former supervisor for like a night or two, right?</span> <span id="s1690">(beeping noise)</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">S: Two nights only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">N: Okay, two nights.</span> <span id="s1693">And you were already.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">S: How they did all these things, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">N: You were already in the maternity house in the same nights that they were sleeping with the, at his former supervisor’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">S: I don’t even know how we came to that maternity house because my parents didn’t take us there.</span> <span id="s1697">Who took us there, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">N: Do you remember the name of the maternity house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1701">So, how long were you in the maternity house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">S: Six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">N: Six months!</span> <span id="s1704">And you were in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">S: We sat all day long.</span> <span id="s1706">And at that time, I still was kosher and I didn’t eat any meat for six months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">N: What did you eat instead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">S: Uh, cheese, bread, fish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">N: Was there enough food?</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">S: But no, no, no meat parts, no chicken, no meat, no nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">N: Was there enough food during those six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s1713">There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">N: And your little?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">S: But after, after, after, in December 42, we again crossed the border.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">N: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.</span> <span id="s1717">Too fast.</span> <span id="s1718">Too fast.</span> <span id="s1719">So, you were sleeping in the attic with the nurses.</span> <span id="s1720">Is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">N: How many people in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">S: 6 to 8, 4 to 6 nurses and two other servants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">N: And were you the?</span> <span id="s1725">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">S: The attic was divided in small rooms.</span> <span id="s1727">And my brother and I, I think we had a room to ourselves.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">N: Were there any other children in the attic?</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">N: Were there any other children in the maternity house?</span> <span id="s1731">Or just babies and?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">S: No, no, just babies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">N: Pregnant women?</span> <span id="s1734">Um, were you the only Jewish people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1736">N: Did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">S: If I,</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">N: Were you aware?</span></p> <p><span id="s1739">S: I knew the people were there were Dutch people, there were no Jews there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1740">N: But you were aware that you were basically hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1741">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s1742">Uh, yes, yes, because they didn’t let us go out in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1743">N: And did the nurses or anyone who ever worked there ever talk to you about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">N: Do you remember anybody’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">S: No, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">N: Do you remember what you did during the day for those six months.</span> <span id="s1748">How did you keep yourself, you know, amused?</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">S: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1750">They had a garden in the back.</span> <span id="s1751">I was allowed to go into the garden.</span> <span id="s1752">But what my brother and I did actually in six months.</span> <span id="s1753">I, we slept a lot.</span> <span id="s1754">That’s a bad habit I still have.</span> <span id="s1755">I sleep each afternoon.</span> <span id="s1756">Uh, we slept a lot.</span> <span id="s1757">That’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s1758">What we did, I do not remember at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">N: Were you in contact at all with your parents for those six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">S: No, no, not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">N: So, what, how did that affect you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">S: Somebody picked us up in December 1942, uh, said that your parents called us to pick you up and you’re all going to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1763">Across the border.</span> <span id="s1764">So we, at night, crossed the border, walked across the border, and we came to Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">N: But this is without your parents.</span> <span id="s1766">So this is just a person taking you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1767">S: No, it was the four of us, all together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1768">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1769">So someone picked you up and brought you to your parents.</span> <span id="s1770">And then, the four of you crossed the border.</span> <span id="s1771">But for those six months when you were not communicating with your parents and I supposed you don’t know when you will see them again.</span> <span id="s1772">What kind of impression did that leave you with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">S: At that age, you don’t have an impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">N: You don’t?</span> <span id="s1775">Even though you’re?</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">S: You go from day to day and and, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">N: Yeah, but you know, you’re 13, you’re 14 right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">S: No, but yeah, we lived in a topsy-turvy world.</span> <span id="s1779">If you lived in a normal world, you would be worried.</span> <span id="s1780">You were worried about so many things.</span> <span id="s1781">Actually, if I was worried, I might be, but I wouldn’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">N: And your brother, how did he cope with all of this?</span> <span id="s1783">Did he show any signs of stress?</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">S: No, but he was much younger, he was 4.5 years younger, so, it was about 7.5 or 8 years or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">N: So, he wasn’t missing his mother or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">S: I don’t think so, he never mentioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">N: Did he keep kosher like you did at the maternity home?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">N: So he was eating meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">S: I was always a hardheaded boy.</span> <span id="s1791">(laughter)</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">N: And at the time, at this time in the maternity home, when you went out of your way to keep kosher, what was the rationale for that?</span> <span id="s1793">What were you feeling about the kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">S: I was taught to eat kosher and I could eat kosher.</span> <span id="s1795">I had that kind of a training, upbringing.</span> <span id="s1796">I mean that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1798">So, you’re saying a stranger came and said, I need to take you to your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1799">S: It might have been the owners of the maternity ward who told us that that stranger had come to fetch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">S: But I cannot remember the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1803">So you’re reunited with your parents and do you leave for Brussels immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">N: Did they tell you anything?</span> <span id="s1806">Talk to you about anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">S: No.</span> <span id="s1808">No.</span> <span id="s1809">Because at that time, the father of my father lived in Brussels and his younger brother lived in Brussels also.</span> <span id="s1810">But I remember we stayed, my brother and I, I think we stayed only one or two days in Brussels, and then they sent us to an orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">N: Do you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s1813">Um.</span> <span id="s1814">Wait one minute.</span> <span id="s1815">Orphelinat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">S: Called orphanage in French</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">N: Orphelinat.</span> <span id="s1819">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">S: But I don’t remember the name.</span> <span id="s1821">It was in a city called Namur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">N: Can you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">S: N-A-M-U-R.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">S: And they took care of us.</span> <span id="s1826">There was a, a Catholic priest, he was an Abbe.</span> <span id="s1827">Abbe?</span> <span id="s1828">Abbe?</span> <span id="s1829">What was his name?</span> <span id="s1830">I can’t remember his name.</span> <span id="s1831">That’s all.</span> <span id="s1832">It’s a long time now.</span> <span id="s1833">And there were also three sisters at a shoe store.</span> <span id="s1834">And she also took care of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">N: Well, I just want to make sure I’m, I’m understanding everything.</span> <span id="s1836">So, you get to Brussels and you’re immediately put in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s1837">In the orphelinat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1838">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1839">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s1840">And how long do you stay in the orphelinat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">S: One year.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">N: One year.</span> <span id="s1843">And this this Abbe, whose name you don’t remember, was he after?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">S: Abbe Andre was his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">N: Ah hah!</span> <span id="s1846">Okay.</span> <span id="s1847">Was he after the orphelinat, or during?</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">S: No, he, he, he had a church of his own in the town of Namur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">N: He had a what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1850">S: He had a church</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">N: A church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">S: of his own in the town of Namur.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">S: And from time to time he came to look at us to see if everything was okay.</span> <span id="s1855">It was those three sisters who were friends of his also, once in a month, or once in two months, they came to have a look of us.</span> <span id="s1856">Sometimes, they brought something to eat.</span> <span id="s1857">There we that first year, in Namur, we were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">N: So, describe, describe hungry.</span> <span id="s1859">I mean describe what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">S: You know what hunger is?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">N: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1862">I want to understand what it meant to you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">S: Well, you’re hungry, there’s a pain in your stomach.</span> <span id="s1864">You want to eat and there’s nothing to eat.</span> <span id="s1865">Very little food.</span> <span id="s1866">My parents used to send us cans of sardines and some other cans of something.</span> <span id="s1867">But it didn’t help much.</span> <span id="s1868">Not only us, but that orphelinat had about 2 or 300 orphans.</span> <span id="s1869">Everybody was hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">N: So, your parents would come to visit you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">N: No.</span> <span id="s1873">Where were your parents while you were in the orphelinat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">S: First, they were in the same block.</span> <span id="s1875">My father was on one side of the block, my mother was on the other side of the block.</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">N: Because it was safer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1877">S: Safer.</span> <span id="s1878">And they would see each other very seldom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">N: And who were they living with?</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">S: My father lived with a lady who had an apartment for rent, he rented it from her.</span> <span id="s1881">And my mother lived in a house, in a room in which she rented there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">N: And were they living with false papers, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">S: Yes, false papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">N: How did they get the false papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">S: This Abbe Andre, he was a specialist in forging papers.</span> <span id="s1886">I remember when we were, when I was in Brussels.</span> <span id="s1887">In the last six, in the first half, in the middle, of 44, uh, Mallone was starting being bombarded and they sent us back to Brussels.</span> <span id="s1888">I remember this Abbe Andre, used to give me false identity cards, which I had to put inside my shoes, below my stockings, and I had to bring it from one town, one part of town to the other part of town.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">N: Well, this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">S: He worked in the underground, he, together with eveque, eveque, it’s a big shot in the Catholic Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s1891">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">S: They were, uh, they were organizing an underground resistance.</span> <span id="s1893">False papers.</span> <span id="s1894">Help for the people, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">N: Well, I want to hear all about this, but, but just in the right sequence.</span> <span id="s1896">So, let me make sure I know the dates.</span> <span id="s1897">When you were, before you went to…</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">S: From middle of 42 to middle of 43 we were in orphelinat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">N: Middle of 42 to middle of 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">M: But what about the maternity home?</span> <span id="s1902">Wasn’t that six months?</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">S: That was the second half of 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">N: So, in 42 you were in maternity home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">N: So, it was only in 43 that you were in the orphelinat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">N: So, how long do you stay in the orphelinat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">S: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s1910">Yes, 43.</span> <span id="s1911">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">N: 43.</span> <span id="s1913">So how long did you stay in the orphelinat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">S: One year until the middle of forty, uh, uh, uh.</span> <span id="s1915">We went to the orphelinat in the middle of… uh, middle of, no, 42 we left, then they send us back.</span> <span id="s1916">So, the second half of 42 we’re in Holland.</span> <span id="s1917">Then we came in the beginning of 43, uh, we, maybe I’m mixing up dates.</span> <span id="s1918">I know we were probably here 43 about ¾ year of 43 in the orphelinat.</span> <span id="s1919">Then they took us out from there, and they sent us to the biggest school in Belgium .</span> <span id="s1920">It was called, uh Ecole de Malonne [ph].</span> <span id="s1921">Ecole des Frers [ph].</span> <span id="s1922">Ecole, you know how it writes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">N: I’m sorry, it’s Ecole and then what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">S: Des Frères- the brothers</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">N: Des Frères- the brothers, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">S: - and then- Creche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">N: Creche.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">S: Sient Malonne.</span> <span id="s1929">S-I-E-N-T.</span> <span id="s1930">Malonne is M-A-L-O-N-N-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">N: Okay, but you stayed nine months at the orphelinat?</span> <span id="s1932">About?</span> <span id="s1933">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">S:

sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">N: Was he working there?</span> <span id="s1965">But, was he working there, or would he come by and visit for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">S: Maybe.</span> <span id="s1967">Maybe he would give Sunday services at orphelinat.</span> <span id="s1968">This I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">N: Do you remember whether you were, at

<span id="s1994">And when you were in the orphanage for nine months, I suppose you were made to go to services.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">S: Oh, yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1996">On Sunday.</span> <span id="s1997">My knees are still hurting.</span> <span id="s1998">(chuckle) You know you have to kneel all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span

day.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">N: How did you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">S: I had to go.</span> <span id="s2006">I had no way.</span> <span id="s2007">There was nothing to feel about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">N: Nothing to feel, you just had to go.</span> <span id="s2009">But it was, I suppose it was unfamiliar and you didn’t know the liturgy.</span> <span id="s2010">I mean, how… how?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">S: Well, we mumbled.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">N: Mhm</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">S: There we did not go to confession.</span> <span id="s2014">When we went to Malonne, we went to confession.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">N: How come you didn’t go to confession at the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">S: Maybe Abbe Andre had arranged it in that way.</span> <span id="s2017">But at Malonne, only two people in the whole college who knew we were Jews.</span> <span id="s2018">It was the general director and the guy to whom you went to make confession because we didn’t make confession.</span> <span id="s2019">We spoke about, about school things and things like that.</span> <span id="s2020">Let me go back to Malonne because Malonne is much more interesting than the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">N: But we will talk about both.</span> <span id="s2022">Yes, okay, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">S: Malonne was a school of 6,000 pupils.</span> <span id="s2024">It had a lower school, it had high school, it had a university, it had a military school.</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">N: Why were you taken there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">S: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2027">Abbe Andre arranged it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2028">N: Did, did your parents?</span> <span

id="s2035">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2037">And, and, and in Mallone, there was no hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">N: There was no what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">S: These people were so big, they had, they had cellars full of coffee.</span> <span id="s2040">And nobody had coffee in Belgium, but they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">N: There was no hunger.</span> <span id="s2042">There was no hunger in Malonne.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">S: Plenty of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">N: So, tell me about the food in Mallone.</span> <span id="s2045">What did they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">S: Oh, everything.</span> <span id="s2047">At that time, I already ate meat because my father told me to eat meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">N: When did he tell you to eat meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">S: When we, in 42, when we went across the border to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">N: So, after the six months of being in the maternity house when you didn’t eat meat, he told you to eat meat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">S: Yeah, he told me to eat meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">N: How did he?</span> <span id="s2053">What did he say?</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">S: He just told me, eat meat because you have to uh, grow up.</span> <span id="s2055">I don’t remember the exact terms he used.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">N: And he said, it doesn’t matter that it’s not kosher, or how did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">S: No, no at that time it was not the occasion to be very specific.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2059">He just said eat meat.</span> <span id="s2060">And you knew that that meant, “I don’t have to keep kosher”?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">S: If, excuse me, I didn’t understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">N: So, when he said, very directly, “you need to eat meat”, you knew, you understood that that means you don’t have to keep only, eat only kosher?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">S: Of course because he said to eat meat.</span> <span id="s2064">There was no kosher meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">S: It was meat, meat meant ______________, like they say in Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">N: So, you were eating meat in Malonne, you said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">S: Malien.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">N: Malonne, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">S: There were big dining rooms.</span> <span id="s2071">There was one dining room for about uh, each dining room was about 300 pupils and you would sit at a big bench and one guy, one of the boys had to say a prayer before starting to eat.</span> <span id="s2072">In Malonne, I went more to the church, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">N: How did you go more to the church because you said you were doing three times a day in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">S: I think during the week, we had to go in the morning and at night, I think.</span> <span id="s2075">And the high holidays, their holidays it was even worse.</span> <span id="s2076">But, never mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">N: And, you had to go to confession, in Malonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2079">Yeah, because otherwise it would show that we didn’t go to confession.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">N: So, can you tell me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">S: These, these, these, brothers, these frères.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">S: They were pedagogues.</span> <span id="s2084">They were tremendously good pedagogues.</span> <span id="s2085">I, I never had such good teachers in my life.</span> <span id="s2086">Afterwards, we went to normal school in Brussels after the war, but these people were top top teachers.</span> <span id="s2087">And you know that, uh, you know what catechisme is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">S: You know what marks were?</span> <span id="s2090">My notes were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">N: What were your

impressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">S: I didn’t mean to interrupt your, but I remember something that I want to get out of my</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">N: No, no, please every time you remember something, tell me because what’s important are your memories.</span> <span id="s2124">Not my questions.</span> <span id="s2125">It’s about your story.</span> <span id="s2126">So, so, you said you had to go to confession in Malonne?</span> <span id="s2127">Can you tell me about what, so, the interaction with the priest in the confessor booth.</span> <span id="s2128">What happened

getting ahead of ourselves.</span> <span id="s2166">So, let’s just go back to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">S: Go ahead, you’re the boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">N: (chuckle) No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">S: No, I have to follow your way because you have the practice.</span> <span id="s2170">And, I sometimes, sometimes go out of the seams like this.</span></p>

his eyes- t might be black or brown.</span> <span id="s2190">I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">N: Now, was he ever interacting with you directly?</span> <span id="s2192">Was he talking to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">S: Well, he would just ask how things were doing, if everything was okay.</span> <span id="s2194">He didn’t speak much to us.</span> <span id="s2195">Maybe he didn’t want to do it on purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">N: But, he was asking you or a whole group of children if you were okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">S: No.</span> <span id="s2198">Just my brother and I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">N: Just your brother and you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">S: Yeah, because we were the only two Jewish boys in the Malonne…</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">N: Not in Mallone.</span> <span id="s2202">In the orphanage?</span> <span id="s2203">The orphelinat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">S: Both.</span> <span

id="s2252">Nobody knows.</span> <span id="s2253">Uh, nobody knows even what happened to him after the war.</span> <span id="s2254">Uh, so you know all the Jewish customers, so he, he, he went around with Germans picking up Jews.</span> <span id="s2255">Because one know, one Jew knows the face of another Jew.</span> <span id="s2256">In general.</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">N: He went around pointing out Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s2258">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">N: To the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2261">So, he was in a car of Jews.</span> <span id="s2262">When he was, when my father was walking, he told my father to stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">N: Where was your father working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">S: Walking, on one of the streets in the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">N: Oh, walking.</span> <span id="s2266">Not working, he was walking.</span> <span id="s2267">He wasn’t working.</span> <span id="s2268">But he wasn’t working at the time?</span> <span id="s2269">Making money?</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">S: No.</span> <span id="s2271">They had reserve money.</span> <span id="s2272">They had diamonds.</span> <span id="s2273">I remember, my mother had, the buttons of my mother’s dress were diamonds, not buttons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">N: Do you remember any other valuables that they were able to take with them from home, from Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">S: Mmmm… No.</span> <span id="s2276">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">N: So they were living off of whatever they had smuggled into the country when they were escaping?</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">S: The only thing I know that my father before the war uh started in Holland, he had money in Switzerland and in the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">N: Oh, he was already sending money?</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">N: Smart man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">S: It was how much.</span> <span id="s2283">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2284">I was only a child.</span> <span id="s2285">Now, let’s go back a minute to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">N: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2287">S: So, the guy Jacques says to my father, “Drop your pants.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">S: So, my father dropped his pants, and it is short, so Jacques says to the Germans, you see he’s gemalet [ph].</span> <span id="s2290">You know what gemalet [ph] means?</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">N: Uhh… circumcised?</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">S: Yes, right.</span> <span id="s2293">And the German says, “Ah.</span> <span id="s2294">Come on.”</span> <span id="s2295">So, they took him to the Gestapo headquarters.</span> <span id="s2296">They took him to the cellar.</span> <span id="s2297">There were hundreds of Jews in the cellar.</span> <span id="s2298">So one guy says, “Bruno, what are you doing here?”</span> <span id="s2299">So, Bruno says, “Don’t speak to me.</span> <span id="s2300">You don’t know me.”</span> <span id="s2301">So, they called my father in for interrogation and uh, so, there was a young SS officer asked my father, “Uh.</span> <span id="s2302">You’re circumcised?”</span> <span id="s2303">My father said, “No, I’m not.</span> <span id="s2304">I had a kidney operation and it was part of the kidney operation.”</span> <span id="s2305">So this, German, this young German SS officer, he called in an old German army doctor.</span> <span id="s2306">He started yelling at him, saying, “Tell me!</span> <span id="s2307">Tell me!”</span> <span id="s2308">So, my father saw that this old German army doctor was grinding his teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">N: He showed him what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">S: My father saw that old German army doctor grind his teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">S: He was angry with the way this young SS was yelling at him.</span> <span id="s2313">So, he said to the SS, “Yes, this man was operated on his kidneys and that was part of the operation.”</span> <span id="s2314">That saved my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2315">N: So, he believed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2316">S: He believed him, yeah.</span> <span id="s2317">He had to believe him.</span> <span id="s2318">It was his doctor.</span> <span id="s2319">If the doctor says to the man, he’s not circumcised, he’s not circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">N: I’m sorry, so the person who was vouching for your father, who is he?</span> <span id="s2321">He’s an older officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">S: He was a German army doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">N: And how come he believed your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">S: He didn’t believe my father.</span> <span id="s2325">He was angry at the SS officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">N: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2327">S: He knew, he knew my father was circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">N: But he was angry at the SS officers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">S: I mean, the uh, those air force officers took us to the Hague, they didn’t like their job that they had to escort Jews on the train because they figured they had nothing to do.</span> <span id="s2330">There were Germans who were not in favor of that.</span> <span id="s2331">Not many unfortunately, but there were.</span> <span id="s2332">They let my father go.</span> <span id="s2333">You know my father, from the Gestapo headquarter to the house he was living, he took 8, 7, 8 different trams.</span> <span id="s2334">You know what a tram is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">N: Yes.</span> <span id="s2336">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">S: A trolley.</span> <span id="s2338">He took 8 different trolleys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2339">N: In order not to be followed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2340">S: Right</span></p> <p><span id="s2341">N: Hmmm… This is a great story and I’m very, very glad you told me.</span> <span id="s2342">And if you have any other stories like this, please, at any time, feel free to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">S: Well, this my ____ I told you already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">N: Well, okay, so I feel like there are so many stories.</span> <span id="s2345">The one that you just told about your father getting out of the Gestapo headquarters or, or offices.</span> <span id="s2346">When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">S: This was in, uh, in Spring 43.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">N: So, you were where in spring 43?</span> <span id="s2349">You were in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s2350">Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">S: In the orphanage.</span> <span id="s2352">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2353">Father, my father told us after we were liberated here in the town.</span> <span id="s2354">He even did not tell when.</span> <span id="s2355">We were hidden about three months in Brussels because Malonne was closed because of bombardments.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">N: So, this was after Malonne?</span> <span id="s2357">You were hidden in a third place?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2359">Yeah.</span> <span id="s2360">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">N: So, when your father was detained by the Gestapo was it when he was living together with your mother or separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">S: Yes, at that time, he still was living.</span> <span id="s2363">I think after that, they got scared and they separated.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2365">And after that, did your father continue walking on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s2366">S: No.</span> <span id="s2367">You know my father?</span> <span id="s2368">You know what my father’s speciality was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">N: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">S: After that happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">N: What’s that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2372">S: Baking your own bread.</span> <span id="s2373">He used to bake his own bread.</span> <span id="s2374">Not to have to go out in the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">N: How did he learn to bake his own bread?</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">S: (chuckle) I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2377">Maybe my mother, my mother taught him.</span> <span id="s2378">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">N: And, um, well, I mean this is a pretty private question, but I suppose that you yourself would have been recognized as a Jewish boy if you were made to undress?</span> <span id="s2380">And you were in…</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">S: Of course, I am.</span> <span id="s2382">Look we were religious.</span> <span id="s2383">Both my brother and I were circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">N: So, how come you were around so many children?</span> <span id="s2385">Were you?</span> <span id="s2386">Did you have to hide?</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">S: No, because we were never naked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">N: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">S: Only when we went into showers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">N: You were never naked?</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">S: Only when you went into showers and then nobody saw us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">N: How come nobody saw you in showers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">S: Because it was done in such a way that there was a little ante-room before you left your clothes there.</span> <span id="s2394">You went in the shower and there was nobody else but you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2395">N: Well, I’m just, I’m curious, because I would think in a place with hundreds of children, who all need to bathe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">S: Yeah, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2397">But that’s Belgium.</span> <span id="s2398">It was cold.</span> <span id="s2399">There was only.</span> <span id="s2400">When we came to Brazil, there were very good friends of ours picked me up at the airport 1951.</span> <span id="s2401">So, I told her, “Dona Susannah,” that was April, “how’s the weather here?”</span> <span id="s2402">She said, “Well, it’s three months warm and nine months hot.”</span> <span id="s2403">Well, in Belgium, it was nine months cold and only three months medium.</span> <span id="s2404">Not even hot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">N: Not even warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2407">You never undressed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">N: So, you were never in a situation where there were other boys in the shower?</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">S: No.</span> <span id="s2410">Each one had his own shower.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">N: Each one had his own shower?</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">S: Yeah, there were hundreds of showers in the basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">N: Were you ever concerned about being seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">S: You know, it might be part of the Catholic mentality.</span> <span id="s2415">That they did not want to, they did not want to, they did not want to see one naked boy and another naked boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">N: I see.</span> <span id="s2417">And were you ever concerned?</span> <span id="s2418">Did you ever take precautions not to show yourself?</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">S: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">N: So, what kind of precautions did you take?</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">S: I never took my underpants down.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">N: So, you would maybe wait until other people were already in the shower?</span> <span id="s2423">Or how exactly did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">S: I guess I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2425">I guess I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">N: Did you ever?</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">S: We were all kids.</span> <span id="s2428">I mean, uh, kids are not curious on these things in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">N: I don’t know about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">S: Nowadays, maybe yes.</span> <span id="s2431">But not at that time.</span> <span id="s2432">We are going back now, 70, 80 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">N: Did you ever need to talk about this with your younger brother because you were helping him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">S: No, I think it was automatic.</span> <span id="s2435">I might have, I might have talked to him, but I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">N: Um.</span> <span id="s2437">You said a story way before about.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">S: Excuse me interrupting you because now you’re talking about how much I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">N: No tell me, tell me.</span> <span id="s2440">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">S: When we lived in Belgium, when we lived in Holland as children, we were at the Pensionale Orphanage [ph].</span> <span id="s2442">We only</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">N: In Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2445">We only took one shower in 2 weeks.</span> <span id="s2446">In Holland each week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2447">N: Ahhh… Ah hah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">S: Yah.</span> <span id="s2449">You’re very secretive.</span> <span id="s2450">In Holland also.</span> <span id="s2451">This business of taking shower each day, this is an American custom, which after the Second World War, the American soldiers brought to Europe.</span> <span id="s2452">In Europe, people used to take showers once every two weeks, at the most every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">N: I see.</span> <span id="s2454">So it was not a common occurrence.</span> <span id="s2455">And so you were not undressing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">S: No.</span> <span id="s2457">There was no need to.</span> <span id="s2458">It was a cold climate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">N: Right.</span> <span id="s2460">Right.</span> <span id="s2461">Right.</span> <span id="s2462">Right.</span> <span id="s2463">Right.</span> <span id="s2464">Well, that’s important to know.</span> <span id="s2465">So, thank you for sharing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">S: (chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">N: So, you told me a story before, it was earlier, but I feel like the story might have been later in your travels or what you went through.</span> <span id="s2468">You said that, at one point you were all detained, and you were interrogated and your father told you later, It’s okay, they know everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">N: When is this in the story?</span> <span id="s2471">I’m confused.</span> <span id="s2472">Where is this and when?</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">S: And the headquarters of the Devisenschutzkommando.</span> <span id="s2474">In the uh, the uh, the people who used to take care of foreign currency, exchange control.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">N: Exchange control.</span> <span id="s2476">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s2477">So, when did they take you there?</span> <span id="s2478">When they stopped you from escaping the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">S: No, right away, the car, the soldiers stopped us.</span> <span id="s2480">And then, they, one of the soldiers in the car, they went straight, we went straight into the building of the Devisenschutzkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">N: And this was the first time you were trying to get to Switzerland and you’re turned back to Holland or is this later?</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">S: That’s the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">N: So, this is 194…</span></p> <p><span id="s2484">S:There was no, there was no second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">N: Right.</span> <span id="s2486">This is 1940, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">S: 1940 was to England, not to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2488">Ah, I’m, wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2489">Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2490">Now I’m confused.</span> <span id="s2491">We only tried</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">N: It’s, it’s after you tried to get to England…</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">S: Wait a minute.</span> <span id="s2494">Now I’m confused.</span> <span id="s2495">We only tried tried to go to Sw.</span> <span id="s2496">In 1940, we tried to go to England.</span> <span id="s2497">In 1942, we tried to go to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s2498">And in 1940, that’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2499">N: Okay, but this is before you’re in the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">S: This was before I was in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2502">So can you tell me precisely what happened when you were stopped by the Germans?</span> <span id="s2503">You were brought to the headquarters and then what happened?</span> <span id="s2504">Were you separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">S: They took my parents to one room for questioning and my brother and I, the another.</span> <span id="s2506">My brother they didn’t ask any questions because he was very small at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">S: Me, they asked the question, where I was, where I lived, what’s my name.</span> <span id="s2509">So I told, I always answer, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2510">Fifth amendment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">N: I’m sorry, you said, I don’t know and?</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">S: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2513">That’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">N: So, you were kind of playing dumb?</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2516">I didn’t want to answer to them.</span> <span id="s2517">So, I told them I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">N: And okay, what else did they ask or what happened afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">S: Now, well, then after two or three hours my father came and told me he already had told them who we are, and I could tell them.</span> <span id="s2520">So, I told them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2521">N: Did they hurt you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2522">S: No.</span> <span id="s2523">No, it bearable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2524">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2525">And then where were you taken?</span> <span id="s2526">I’m just trying to remember the arc of the story.</span> <span id="s2527">So,</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">S: And then, from there we were taken, I think to the train to send us to Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2530">The escort back.</span> <span id="s2531">And then you escape by saying you need to go to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">S: Right.</span> <span id="s2533">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2534">N: And in the interrogation room, how many adults were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2535">S: Two or three women, I think one or two men.</span> <span id="s2536">Most of the questioning was made by a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">N: Uh, what were you at a table?</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">S: No, I was sitting on a chair, if there were tables I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">N: Uh, do you remember feeling frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2540">S: No, to the contrary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">N: Sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">S: To the contrary, I was not frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">N: Why were you not frightened?</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">S: Because I was hardheaded.</span> <span id="s2545">I didn’t want to give them answers.</span> <span id="s2546">I was angry in a way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">N: You were angry.</span> <span id="s2548">You were feeling anger?</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">S: I was feeling anger that we were stopped and that we sat there with all these Germans.</span> <span id="s2550">Only anger, I was not afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2552">So, um.</span> <span id="s2553">So, Abbe Andre came and visited you just a few times and he came and visited you both in the orphanage and at the Malonne Ecole de’ Freres Creche [ph] and you were saying that basically, you remember in the orphanage there wasn’t enough to eat.</span> <span id="s2554">When you did have to eat something there, what kind of food did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">S: Hmm… Mashed potatoes, potatoes is cheap.</span> <span id="s2556">Uh, very little meat.</span> <span id="s2557">Uh, vegetables they had because they had their own vegetable garden.</span> <span id="s2558">Ah, very much little quantities.</span> <span id="s2559">There were many children, wasn’t that much food.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">N: How many children were at the orphanage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">S: I remember we were hungry enough, I don’t know why, and I don’t know the quantities we ate.</span> <span id="s2562">I only remember that we were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2563">N: That you were hungry.</span> <span id="s2564">Okay.</span> <span id="s2565">Were you also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">S: Once we were in Malonne I remember, we were never hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">N: Never hungry.</span> <span id="s2568">Now at the orphanage, was

you would do at the orphanage aside from being in school?</span> <span id="s2589">Any organized activities?</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">N: Or

id="s2621">No, not in the orphanage and not in Malonne.</span> <span id="s2622">But it happened in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2623">My brother and I we were hidden in another apartment about four, five blocks away from my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">N: This was after Malonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">S: This was, yes, this was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">N: Why did you

bombarding.</span> <span id="s2630">They close the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">N: They closed it.</span> <span id="s2632">So all the children left.</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">S: And then when we were in Brussels, uh, uh, in the woman, in the bedroom at the back of an apartment of people there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">N: Did you, did your parents arrange this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2637">S: And we were lucky.</span> <span id="s2638">One of the nights these people had inspection by a German, by German army people, and they checked the whole house except our room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">N: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">S: Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2641">N: Why did they miss your room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2642">S: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">N: Was it a hidden room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">S: I wouldn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">N: But, was it a hidden room?</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">S: I even didn’t hear them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2647">N: Oh, you didn’t hear them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2648">S: I only found out the next day when they told us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">N: Was it a hidden room?</span> <span id="s2650">Was it like some kind of secret passage?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s2652">It was room at the back of a, at the end of a corridor.</span> <span id="s2653">It wasn’t hidden, but it was a, it was a little bit farther away than the rest.</span></p> <p><span id="s2654">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2655">Mhm.</span> <span id="s2656">So, you, who arranged for you to be in that house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">S: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2658">Probably Andre or the eveque.</span> <span id="s2659">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">N: Do you remember where the house was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2661">S: Ahh… If I go there, I might know, but I don’t remember the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">N: Do you remember any names of any people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">S: I only remember the name of the first place where my parents used to live uh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2664">N: Roosevelt.</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">S: This Franklin

name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2675">S: Yes, fake name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">N: Why did he choose that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">S: They gave it to him probably.</span> <span id="s2678">Probably Ferdinand de’Montagne [ph] died, and they did not put it on the register so they could give out an identity card with that name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">N: So, can you tell me about how they changed the identity card?</span> <span id="s2680">Do you know anything about how they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2681">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s2682">It was all these underground groups and they had the organization and they had these people at the mayor’s office and they were controlling, people were dying.</span> <span id="s2683">Things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">N: But do you, do you know anything about how they were forging?</span> <span id="s2685">What materials they were using to change things?</span> <span id="s2686">Or?</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">S: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2688">This I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">N: Do you know how your father got the fake identity papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">S: Probably from Abbe Andre.</span> <span id="s2691">I remember his name Ferdinand de’Montagne [ph].</span> <span id="s2692">De means that, if de is written with small d it means that the person is a noble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2693">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">S: If the de- if it’s in German also Van, if it’s written with small v is a noble, if it’s written with big V, then it’s just a plebeo [ph].</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">N: Ah hah.</span> <span id="s2696">I did not know that.</span> <span id="s2697">Do you, do you remember what your mother’s false name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2699">Of course.</span> <span id="s2700">Betrinolle van Achter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">N: Oh, also noble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">S:

<span id="s2715">(chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">N: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2717">S: It was Betronille from behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s2718">N: So, am I understanding correctly that there is no such real name or do people actually have that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">S: I don’t know if they made up the names or if they’re people who died.</span> <span id="s2720">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2721">I don’t know how they did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2722">N: Now, did you have a fake paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s2723">S: Oh, yeah.</span> <span id="s2724">My name was Francois.</span> <span id="s2725">F.</span> <span id="s2726">You know how Francois is spelled in French?</span></p> <p><span id="s2727">N: Well, yes, it’s Francis or Franz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2728">S: F-R-A-N-C-O-I-S Demblon.</span> <span id="s2729">D-E-M-B-L-O-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s2730">N: And you were given this?</span> <span id="s2731">You did not choose it or?</span></p> <p><span id="s2732">S: No.</span> <span id="s2733">We were given it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">N: And can you describe what this identity paper looked like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">S: It’s, it’s an identity card like you used to have at that time.</span> <span id="s2736">It’s the same all over the world.</span> <span id="s2737">It’s not as modern as nowadays.</span></p> <p><span id="s2738">N: Now, who gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">S: There was a photograph glued in, a couple of stamps,…</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">N: But it was your photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s2741">S: Yes, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2742">N: And who gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2743">S: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2744">N: When did you get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">S: Uh, before we went to the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">N: Oh, so you were already Francois in the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2747">S: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s2748">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s2749">I have I have kept as a souvenir all my school records and all my school reports.</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">S: And school results.</span></p> <p><span id="s2752">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">S: From the orphanage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2754">N: Mhm</span></p> <p><span id="s2755">S: I think, especially from Malonne, with my false name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2756">N: With your false name.</span> <span id="s2757">And what was your brother’s false name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">S: Jacques.</span> <span id="s2759">J-A-C-Q-U-E-S.</span></p> <p><span id="s2760">N: And the last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2761">S: Also Demblon.</span> <span id="s2762">It was my brother, wasn’t he?</span></p> <p><span id="s2763">N: So, so you were lucky enough to have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2764">S: The same name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2765">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2766">Because I suppose if it’s uh, a person who died, I mean, they must have…</span></p> <p><span id="s2767">S: The probably, they somehow, I don’t know how they did it.</span> <span id="s2768">They did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2769">N: And was it hard to explain and get you’re your brother who was younger than you to remember that he has to act as if he has a false name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2770">S: Oh.</span> <span id="s2771">My parents told him and I told him.</span> <span id="s2772">And after all, he was already an age that he could understand the danger if he would do anything, uh, which he is uh, which could imperil him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2773">N: Did he ever make a mistake?</span></p> <p><span id="s2774">S: No.</span> <span id="s2775">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2776">N: And he never called you Freddy or?</span> <span id="s2777">Those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s2778">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2779">N: It was always Francois?</span></p> <p><span id="s2780">S: Francois.</span></p> <p><span id="s2781">N: Did you…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2782">S: His name actually is Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">N: Yes, Jacques.</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">S: Not Jacques, Jack.</span> <span id="s2785">The American way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">N: Oh, the American way.</span> <span id="s2787">Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2788">S: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2789">It is not the French way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2791">So, are you saying that he kept that name after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2792">S: (chuckle).</span> <span id="s2793">No.</span> <span id="s2794">Ah, you mean Jack.</span> <span id="s2795">No he was born Jack Schumer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2796">N: He was born Jack.</span> <span id="s2797">And so he was, oh, so his false name was really like his real name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2798">S: His first name was Frenchified.</span></p> <p><span id="s2799">N: I see, now, now did either of you speak French at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2800">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2801">N: How did of you get away with having a French name and not speaking French?</span> <span id="s2802">That wasn’t suspicious to anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2803">S: Oh, no, no.</span> <span id="s2804">In Belgium, it didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s2805">People could, people lived in the Flemish part and spoke Dutch or Flemish, sometimes they had French names.</span> <span id="s2806">It didn’t mean.</span> <span id="s2807">In Belgium, there was no connection made between your name, if it was a French sounding name or a Flemish sounding name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2808">N: I see.</span> <span id="s2809">And, um.</span> <span id="s2810">Okay, well let’s go back a little bit to Malonne.</span> <span id="s2811">What were your activities in Malonne, besides your studies which really impressed you, and the level of education?</span></p> <p><span id="s2812">S: I think we had gymnastic lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s2813">N: What kind of gymnastics?</span></p> <p><span id="s2814">S: General gymnastics.</span> <span id="s2815">You know, bars and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2816">Maybe handball also.</span> <span id="s2817">I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2818">N: Were you good at that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2819">S: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2820">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">S: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2822">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2823">I even don’t remember much, probably had gymnastics, but I have no, I have no recollection of it.</span> <span id="s2824">The rest of the time, we had to study a lot.</span> <span id="s2825">Because they, they were very hard on the studies.</span> <span id="s2826">They would give you lessons in the morning and then you had to study all afternoon.</span> <span id="s2827">There wasn’t much time left over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2828">N: Did you have any friendships with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2829">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">N: Was it all boys?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">N: And in the orphanage did you have any friendships with anyone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">S: No, not either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">N: And that was all boys too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">S: Only boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s2836">N: And what were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">S: Because the Catholics don’t mix sexes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2838">N: Right, right, right.</span> <span id="s2839">And what were your, was there any reason why you weren’t having friendships?</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">S: No, I didn’t look for friendship because it was a way of protect yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s2842">So this was a way of, a very, you were aware of it and you were not making friends for this reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">S: Oh, yes, of course I was aware.</span> <span id="s2844">I was, you had to act accordingly and friendships, uh.</span> <span id="s2845">To be by yourself.</span> <span id="s2846">And no friends.</span> <span id="s2847">It’s safer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2848">N: So, when did you start transporting fake identity cards for Abbe Andre?</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">S: In spring 44.</span> <span id="s2850">When we left Malonne.</span> <span id="s2851">I was in Brussels.</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">N: So when you leave Malonne, you’re still together with your little brother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">N: And you’re going to this apartment where there was that one raid and they didn’t find you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2855">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">N: Okay, so, do you remember, was it, was it Abbe Andre who asked you to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2857">S: No, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">N: And how did he describe it?</span> <span id="s2859">Or how did he ask you to do this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2860">S: No, he told me to put it in my socks.</span> <span id="s2861">To put it in my shoes.</span> <span id="s2862">And he gave me the address where to bring it.</span> <span id="s2863">And more than once, I was stopped by German soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">S: Pushed you against the wall, you have about three soldiers behind you with arms, but they never looked inside my shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">N: And they never made you undress?</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">S: No.</span> <span id="s2868">They touched the body, but uh, the arms, and the stomach and the legs, but they never looked in the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2870">So your father asked you to do this, did he say where you were taking these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">S: Well, he gave me the address where to deliver them of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">N: And he didn’t give you any context?</span> <span id="s2873">Did he give you a name that you were supposed to give these things to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">S: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2875">He told me to go there, deliver to, this I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2876">Probably at the address where you ring the bell, the guy who opens the door is probably the guy who wants to have the documents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">N: So, when you would deliver one of these things.</span> <span id="s2878">He opens the door.</span> <span id="s2879">What do you say?</span> <span id="s2880">I suppose you have to go inside to take your shoes off, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2881">S: Uh, good question, but no memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s2882">N: No.</span> <span id="s2883">Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s2884">S: No, probably guy, when he saw a young boy there, he probably.</span> <span id="s2885">Maybe somebody told him a young boy going to come, so he probably already knew beforehand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">N: So, when your, do you know why your father was asking you to make these deliveries?</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">S: Yes, to help people who need false identities.</span></p> <p><span id="s2888">N: And how come as a person who himself is obviously in danger and is hidden, how is he actually active in this?</span> <span id="s2889">How does he become active in this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">S: Because he had contact apparently with Abbe Andre.</span> <span id="s2891">But I don’t know the reason or the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s2892">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2893">So, so basically he just came to you and said I need you to make this delivery.</span></p> <p><span id="s2894">S: Yeah, he says go and bring this there and there and he told me where to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2895">N: And how big was it?</span> <span id="s2896">Did it fit in your shoe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2897">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2898">Yeah, it just wasn’t comfortable, but the distance was not very far.</span> <span id="s2899">But it was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">N: And how many times did you have to make these deliveries?</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">S: Oh, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s2902">Half a dozen times, maybe less.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2904">Mhm.</span> <span id="s2905">And how many times were you stopped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">S: About once or twice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">N: And they didn’t find anything.</span> <span id="s2908">And they let you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2910">N: What was it like…?</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">S: I wasn’t the only one who was stopped.</span> <span id="s2912">There was a, there was a line.</span> <span id="s2913">About three, four people standing on line so they took one and the next guy and the next guy, etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s2914">N: What were you thinking when you got stopped?</span> <span id="s2915">How?</span> <span id="s2916">What, what was crossing your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2917">S: Mmmm… You get worried that uh, you get worried, but you try to calm yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">N: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">S: By keeping, by keeping calm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">S: There, ah, there is no other way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">N: So, so what’s curious to me is that this is after your father got caught and went to the Gestapo, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">S: Which I didn’t know at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">N: Which you didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s2925">But.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">S: I only knew that after we were liberated by the English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">N: And you had said that after that he gets worried and he lives separately from your mother as a precaution.</span> <span id="s2928">He doesn’t go outside as a precaution.</span> <span id="s2929">So, after all of these things, how come he asks his own son to go out and make a dangerous delivery?</span></p> <p><span id="s2930">S: Story of Abraham and Isaac, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">N: Yes?</span> <span id="s2932">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">S: Look, it had to be done.</span> <span id="s2934">Somebody had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">N: And why was it you and not him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">S: I, because he didn’t go out in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2937">N: But for the same reason, I mean you could have gotten…</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">S: No, no, but when we came back from Malonne we went out on the streets in Brussels.</span> <span id="s2939">Us two children.</span> <span id="s2940">Because about three or four blocks away from the apartment where we lived to go to my mother or to my father, mostly to my mother’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">N: So you were already in the practice of going out on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">S: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2943">N: And you were not under suspicion.</span> <span id="s2944">How often would you visit your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">S: Maybe once a week, but I really don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">N: And did you visit your father at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2947">S: Much less, but I don’t remember either.</span> <span id="s2948">I remember we used to eat at the house where we were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2949">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2950">Was there enough food there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2951">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2953">Did Abbe Andre ever wear civilian clothes?</span> <span id="s2954">Like you know, not priestly clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">S: Not to my knowledge.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">N: Did your, do you think at the time, did your parents or your father, did he have certain political inclinations or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">N: Political beliefs?</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">S: No.</span> <span id="s2960">I don’t think he ever belonged to a political party.</span> <span id="s2961">Not even when they, not even when they went.</span> <span id="s2962">I mean, because of the war, I think that my whole family, also my father, my mother, my brother and I, we became apolitical.</span> <span id="s2963">You know what that means, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2964">N: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">S: My brother and I here, we don’t belong to any party.</span> <span id="s2966">My parents, when they lived in the states, they didn’t belong to any party.</span> <span id="s2967">And in Switzerland, they didn’t belong to any party either.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">N: Were any of the children who were at the orphanage or in Malonne, were they, were any of them foreign, or were they all Belgian?</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">S: So, the way I saw them, they were all Belgian.</span></p> <p><span id="s2970">N: They were all Belgian, as far as you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2971">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2972">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2973">Mhm.</span> <span id="s2974">So, you were never caught delivering these identity cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2975">S: No, thank God, otherwise I wouldn’t be speaking with you.</span> <span id="s2976">(chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s2977">N: (chuckle) Did you know of anyone, people you knew, who were caught doing anything like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2978">S: No, no.</span> <span id="s2979">Many people died, but I don’t know any specific case.</span> <span id="s2980">People died.</span></p> <p><span id="s2981">N: Was your brother ever transporting these cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">S: No.</span> <span id="s2983">He was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s2984">N: So, you weren’t really interacting with the people.</span> <span id="s2985">You would just drop off the card and leave, right?</span> <span id="s2986">There was no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2987">S: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s2988">Just take them and just go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2989">N: So, you didn’t know who they were, you had no relationship to them, did you have any idea how your father was getting the information of who to drop these off to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2990">S: The only contact my father had, as far as I know, all the time, were Abbe Andre and his chief, the eveque.</span> <span id="s2991">And I cannot remember the name of the eveque.</span></p> <p><span id="s2992">N: The people that were keeping you, or hiding you in this apartment where there was that one raid, were they being paid to hide you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s2994">Yes.</span> <span id="s2995">Because they gave us a room and they fed us, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2996">N: So, they were paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s2999">Um.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">S: Maybe they, I am not sure these people knew we were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s3001">N: Ah, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">S: I don’t know because uh, when they, in spring 40, uh, 44, when the bombardments started in Belgium, many schools were emptied and the children were sent home.</span></p> <p><span id="s3003">N: Oh, so there were many displaced children.</span></p> <p><span id="s3004">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s3005">I don’t know if they knew or not, but of course, we had to pay rent for that woman.</span> <span id="s3006">We had to pay for the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s3007">N: And at that time, did you have enough food, clothing and warmth?</span></p> <p><span id="s3008">S: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3009">N: So, there was no hunger?</span></p> <p><span id="s3010">S: In Belgium, with the exception of the orphelinat, there was no hunger.</span> <span id="s3011">Holland was the other way around.</span> <span id="s3012">In Holland, many people died from hunger.</span></p> <p><span id="s3013">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3014">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3015">S: My father, I don’t know if this is pertinent to it, but, uh, my father, after we were liberated in September 44, he, one year he didn’t work.</span> <span id="s3016">He went to join the American Joint</span></p> <p><span id="s3017">N: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3018">S: Company and he worked for them to help find Jewish children.</span> <span id="s3019">Only after working there for a year that he started his own business.</span> <span id="s3020">He wanted to, wanted to, do his part.</span></p> <p><span id="s3021">N: Of helping the community.</span></p> <p><span id="s3022">S: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3023">N: When your father ge, interested you with the false identity cards, did he give you any instructions on what to do if you did get caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s3024">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3025">N: So, you had no instructions.</span></p> <p><span id="s3026">S: No, it wouldn’t be intelligent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3027">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3028">S: It is better not to know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3029">N: Sure.</span> <span id="s3030">Sure.</span> <span id="s3031">I understand.</span> <span id="s3032">It’s interesting how a, how a parent can manage this, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s3033">S: Well, okay, look, during the war, there are many.</span> <span id="s3034">People managed many things which under normal circumstances you cannot understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s3035">N: Were you ever, were you ever scared when transporting the cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s3036">S: No.</span> <span id="s3037">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3038">N: Did anyone ever come to you and ask for help?</span></p> <p><span id="s3039">S: Not to me, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3040">N: Not to you, no.</span> <span id="s3041">So you wouldn’t know who was contacting your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s3042">S: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3043">N: Um.</span> <span id="s3044">It’s just.</span> <span id="s3045">It’s such a unique story.</span> <span id="s3046">I’m just trying to understand how it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3047">S: Well, isn’t my story, in a way similar to the stories of other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s3048">N: Ah.</span> <span id="s3049">Not so much, really, no I mean, this is, it’s pretty unusual.</span> <span id="s3050">So,</span></p> <p><span id="s3051">S: Okay.</span> <span id="s3052">I’m happy, I’m happy that the time you’re giving me is your worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s3053">N: Oh, absolutely, much more than worthwhile.</span> <span id="s3054">And so how much time did you spend in this, in this apartment, after Malonne where at that time you were transporting the cards?</span> <span id="s3055">How many months is this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3056">S: I think about three, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s3057">N: Three, four months and then the British arrive?</span></p> <p><span id="s3058">S: The British arrived in the beginning of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s3059">N: So, that was three, four months before September then, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3060">S: It must have been March, April that uh, that the schools were closed.</span></p> <p><span id="s3061">N: So, when you were going on these errands to deliver the cards, where was your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s3062">S: Uh, he s, probably s, I would say he stayed in the apartment where we were sleeping, but I wouldn’t know.</span> <span id="s3063">Maybe he was with my mother.</span> <span id="s3064">I cannot remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3065">N: And the people who were keeping you obviously had no idea what you were up to, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3066">S: Right.</span> <span id="s3067">Obviously.</span></p> <p><span id="s3068">N: Um, so do you remember when you first heard that the Allies had come in, that the British were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3069">S: I don’t remember, I think it was the, the second of September because everyone was telling in the streets “L’anglais sont arrives!”</span> <span id="s3070">“The English have arrived!”</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">N: Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">S: So, and then you saw the English marching.</span> <span id="s3073">And you saw, German prisoners of war, which were taken by the English and other people.</span></p> <p><span

immediately after liberation.</span> <span id="s3092">Your father was going around trying to find the Jewish children in these group homes or orphanages, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3093">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3094">N: Was that immediately after liberation?</span> <span id="s3095">Or later?</span></p> <p><span id="s3096">S: Um, no I would say about two or three months later.</span> <span id="s3097">It takes time to get things organized.</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">N: So, who was he going with?</span> <span id="s3099">Were, were these?</span></p> <p><span

id="s3197">N: So, what did he ask for?</span></p> <p><span id="s3198">S: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">N: So, he went into the headquarters of the German army and he kind of passed himself off as a German gentile?</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">S: Yes, right (chuckle).</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">N: Well, that takes some chutzpah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">S: Yes, war

Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3241">N: So, these Allied service members with your father, what is their interest in finding Jewish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3242">S: Of course, they’re Jewish children.</span> <span id="s3243">They’re Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3244">N: The Allied service, the British?</span> <span id="s3245">Those were the British?</span></p> <p><span

furrier in London.</span> <span id="s3283">There were many furriers.</span> <span id="s3284">My father went to go to London and about 20 friends there who went to Leipzig were in the fur business.</span></p> <p><span id="s3285">N: Uh huh.</span> <span id="s3286">Uh huh.</span> <span id="s3287">So they, they somehow met up or found each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s3288">S: Oh,

apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s3305">N: Uh huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3306">S: The same day or the day before, this I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3307">I think there were rumors going around already one or two days before that the British are very nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s3308">N: And did you move back?</span> <span id="s3309">I’m sorry, where did you move to?</span> <span id="s3310">You hadn’t been living there before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3311">S: Oh, um, we went back you won’t believe to where.</span> <span id="s3312">We went back to Rue Franklin Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s3313">It, to the same room where my parents were hidden.</span> <span id="s3314">But only, we took a bigger part of the house.</span> <span id="s3315">I think we took two floors.</span></p> <p><span id="s3316">N: Two floors?</span></p> <p><span id="s3317">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3318">N: So, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3319">S: The widow, and, and the French, the Belgian widow, she used to live in the basement.</span> <span id="s3320">And her name was Madame Nicodeme.</span></p> <p><span id="s3321">N: Oh, Nicodeme.</span></p> <p><span id="s3322">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s3323">N-I-C-O-D-E-M-E.</span></p> <p><span id="s3324">N: And, so to take two floors, I suppose your parents must have still had some, some valuables, right?</span> <span id="s3325">To be able to rent so much space?</span></p> <p><span id="s3326">S: They probably had.</span> <span id="s3327">Thank God they had money left over.</span></p> <p><span id="s3328">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3329">Was your, did your father start working immediately at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s3330">S: No.</span> <span id="s3331">I uh, he worked for a year for the Joint

<span id="s3335">Mhm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3336">S: And then he started working.</span></p> <p><span id="s3337">N: And when he was working for the Joint, he was helping Jewish displaced children?</span></p> <p><span id="s3338">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s3339">He was working whatever.</span> <span id="s3340">They sent him to Holland because my father obviously spoke Dutch.</span> <span id="s3341">And they wanted to have things, Holland’s situation was very bad for the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s3342">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3343">S: They gave him, they gave him, they gave him staff colonel, a full colonel’s staff.</span> <span id="s3344">They sent him to Holland for a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s3345">N: They gave him a full colonel’s staff.</span> <span id="s3346">What does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s3347">S: That means again, he was dressed as a colonel and they gave the _____ a colonel.</span></p> <p><span id="s3348">N: But, how did the Joint have the authority to give him a?</span></p> <p><span id="s3349">S: They were probably authorized to do it.</span> <span id="s3350">(chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s3351">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">S: They wouldn’t do it if they were not authorized.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s3354">So how many staff people does that mean?</span> <span id="s3355">How many people were working for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s3356">S: At that time, I think it two or three.</span> <span id="s3357">There were not many.</span> <span id="s3358">And, so he went to Holland and he stayed about two weeks to reorganize things and, but then he went back to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s3359">N: So, what kind of tasks was he doing exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s3360">S: Finding children, helping people.</span> <span id="s3361">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3362">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3363">Did he ever talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s3364">S and N: Talking at the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s3365">N: I’m sorry?</span></p> <p><span id="s3366">S: Uh, whatever had to be done.</span></p> <p><span id="s3367">N: Whatever had to be done.</span> <span id="s3368">He, he didn’t really talk about what work he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s3369">S: No.</span> <span id="s3370">He didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s3371">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3372">N: So, when did you first remember hearing about what had happened to the Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s3373">S: I didn’t, I didn’t understand your question.</span></p> <p><span id="s3374">N: Do, do you recall a moment when somebody, when you somehow learned what had happened to the communities in Europe?</span> <span id="s3375">The Jewish communities in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s3376">S: Oh, right away after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s3377">N: Right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s3378">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3379">N: And what exactly do you remember hearing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3380">S: Hearing how many people got killed.</span> <span id="s3381">I mean, in Holland you used to have.</span> <span id="s3382">My father went to Holland.</span> <span id="s3383">Amsterdam used to have 800,000 Jews.</span> <span id="s3384">When he came back to Amsterdam, you had a registry of Jews, there were 80,000 of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s3385">N: Did he talk about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3386">S: Yes.</span> <span id="s3387">He told us.</span> <span id="s3388">It’s a known fact as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s3389">The two things about Holland which people don’t know very much about.</span> <span id="s3390">The number one is that 90% of the Dutch Jews were killed.</span> <span id="s3391">And number two, that’s relevant today, that 11% of the Dutch population is Muslim.</span></p> <p><span id="s3392">N: Uh.</span> <span id="s3393">I… though they were not Muslim at the time.</span> <span id="s3394">I mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s3395">S: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s3396">Because they are Indonesia.</span> <span id="s3397">That was the colony of Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s3398">N: Sure.</span> <span id="s3399">So, you’re talking about Holland today?</span></p> <p><span id="s3400">S: Yeah, I’m talking about Holland today.</span> <span id="s3401">I’m talking about France today.</span></p> <p><span id="s3402">N: Yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s3403">I am aware of that.</span> <span id="s3404">But I’m, I’m curious about just how this information was communicated at the time about what had happened to the Jews of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s3405">S: In the papers.</span> <span id="s3406">Mouth to mouth.</span> <span id="s3407">Conversations between people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">N: Do you remember having a conversation about it?</span> <span id="s3409">With an adult?</span></p> <p><span id="s3410">S: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s3411">I was too young for that.</span> <span id="s3412">I went to school, I went to my Belgian school there.</span> <span id="s3413">I had a very good school there.</span> <span id="s3414">Uh, uh.</span> <span id="s3415">They had to call it artene [ph].</span> <span id="s3416">Artene [ph] is like a lyceum.</span> <span id="s3417">Do you speak French?</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">N: I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">S: I heard a very, I heard a very nice something or other, a very nice.</span> <span id="s3420">___________ (French)</span></p> <p><span

expression.</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">S:________________ (French)</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">N: And what made you think about this expression?</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">S: Most of the time, I use when I’m sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">N: But something reminded you of, of this, what exactly?</span></p> <p><span id="s3428">S: Many things of Europe.</span> <span id="s3429">I mean I speak five languages.</span> <span id="s3430">I try to keep them speaking all day long.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">N: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">S: My brother, we speak Dutch and English.</span> <span id="s3433">Especially Dutch when we don’t want people to understand.</span> <span id="s3434">And we don’t realize between us what language we are speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s3435">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3436">You’re not conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s3437">S: I have many friends in Europe who are tri or four lingual.</span> <span id="s3438">You speak with them, you don’t realize the language if you know they speak several languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s3439">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3440">So, you you were saying basically people knew about what happened to the Jews.</span> <span id="s3441">But at the same time, you were saying, as someone who was still a young boy, if not a child, they weren’t really talking to you.</span> <span id="s3442">So where were you getting this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s3443">S: Very much of this information you get later on.</span> <span id="s3444">You read books, you read papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3445">N: Yes, but at the time.</span> <span id="s3446">I’m trying to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s3447">S: At the time, I might not have known.</span> <span id="s3448">At the time, I didn’t know much.</span> <span id="s3449">I was too young.</span> <span id="s3450">And part of that knowledge, the what happened to the people as a whole, in the whole circumstance, uh, it uh, you didn’t know at the time that things had been so terrible.</span> <span id="s3451">Yes, many people came back from the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s3452">And it was terrible, the stories were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3453">N: Do you remember encountering people who had come back from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s3454">S: There were two or three of them.</span> <span id="s3455">Their stories were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s3456">N: Can you tell me what the stories were?</span></p> <p><span id="s3457">S: Well, so, all those things which they went through.</span> <span id="s3458">The hunger.</span> <span id="s3459">The death.</span> <span id="s3460">The beatings, etc., etc.</span></p> <p><span id="s3461">N: Do you remember if these?</span></p> <p><span id="s3462">S: None of these people who come back, who came back, psychologically ever got cured.</span></p> <p><span id="s3463">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s3464">Do you remember when you interacted with these people, or where?</span> <span id="s3465">Was it in Belgium?</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">S: It was in Belgium, yes.</span> <span id="s3467">Because we were working with a young guy, also came back.</span> <span id="s3468">At that time in Belgium we started a nylon business which was a very hot article at that time.</span> <span id="s3469">There was also a young guy, uh, who came from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s3470">He very often told us things that happened there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">N: So, so, what were the names of these guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s3472">S: (pause) I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3473">I only remember the partner.</span> <span id="s3474">My father had a Danish-Jewish partner.</span> <span id="s3475">His name was Arnold Erteschik and one of this brother’s was a Danish writier.</span></p> <p><span id="s3476">N: Can you, can you spell his first name and last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s3477">S: Arnold, Arnold you know.</span> <span id="s3478">And Erteschik is E-R-T-E-S-C-H-I-K.</span></p> <p><span id="s3479">N: And he was a concentration camp survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">S: No.</span> <span id="s3481">No.</span> <span id="s3482">No.</span> <span id="s3483">I don’t know, I don’t know how he got out alive or what he went through.</span> <span id="s3484">I remember he was my father’s partner when he restarted doing business in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">N: So your father restarted doing business in Europe about one year after the war because the first year he was working for the joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s3486">S: Right.</span> <span id="s3487">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3488">N: But that was only one year.</span></p> <p><span id="s3489">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3490">N: And then he started his business.</span> <span id="s3491">Did he go back to, to, to clothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s3492">S: No, he first bought from a Dutch friend of his in Holland.</span> <span id="s3493">He bought a firm which was importers of furs.</span> <span id="s3494">Fur importer.</span></p> <p><span id="s3495">N: So, so, he bought a firm already in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s3496">S: I think in 45 already.</span></p> <p><span id="s3497">N: So how, I’m just really curious, how is it that he still had money to buy a firm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3498">S: Maybe at the time he already was able to have money come his sisters and from the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s3499">N: What had happened to the apartment in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s3500">S: Oh, that was rented.</span> <span id="s3501">That was not ours.</span></p> <p><span id="s3502">N: So, you never go the value of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3503">S: No.</span> <span id="s3504">No.</span> <span id="s3505">No.</span> <span id="s3506">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3507">N: In any way?</span></p>

id="s4007">Why didn’t you want to go to Korea?</span></p> <p><span id="s4008">S: Because I escaped, I escaped the Second World War.</span> <span id="s4009">And I didn’t feel like dying in, in, in on

id="s4030">S: My brother did not have it.</span> <span id="s4031">And my brother did not go because he left before he was 18.</span> <span id="s4032">I think he left a week or two before he turned

it’s not a joke.</span> <span id="s4037">It was April the first.</span> <span id="s4038">He came about two months later.</span></p> <p><span id="s4039">N: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s4040">S: My parents came three years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s4041">N: Your, your brother felt the same way about Korea that you did?</span> <span id="s4042">About the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s4043">S: He had no opinion at that time.</span> <span id="s4044">My parents told him to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s4045">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s4046">So, your parents were very concerned about you being in a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s4047">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4048">N: And, how come your parents, obviously I have a sense of the answer, but how come your parents didn’t only decide to send the two boys somewhere?</span> <span id="s4049">You know, while the war is on?</span> <span id="s4050">Why did they decide to move out of the United States, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s4051">S: Because we had to register at the uh, uh, we had to register at the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s4052">N: No, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s4053">S: They couldn’t send somebody away.</span> <span id="s4054">You had to register anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s4055">N: No, no, but when you left for South America, because at this point you leave for South America, why didn’t your parents decide, okay the boys go to South America.</span> <span id="s4056">But why, why did they follow?</span></p> <p><span id="s4057">S: Oh, you mean when the war was over, why we didn’t come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s4058">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4059">S: Because uh, that war took another two, three years, if I’m not mistaken.</span> <span id="s4060">And anyway, we got accustomed and we started a business.</span> <span id="s4061">It didn’t make sense to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s4062">N: And you, this was in Rio?</span></p> <p><span id="s4063">S: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s4064">N: This was already in Brazil, immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s4065">S: This was in Rio, yes.</span> <span id="s4066">I live in Rio 61 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s4067">N: Why didn’t your parents for example, make the decision in 1950, okay or 51, okay, the boys leave for South America, but we stay.</span> <span id="s4068">How come they left?</span></p> <p><span id="s4069">S: Yeah, because they came in 54.</span> <span id="s4070">They wanted to see how things would work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s4071">N: Aha.</span> <span id="s4072">So, they came three years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s4073">S: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4074">N: So, so, okay, so tell me about when you got to Brazil without your parents first.</span></p> <p><span id="s4075">S: Um, it was, the tough part was to learn the language.</span> <span id="s4076">And the most difficult part was to make a paranosa [ph].</span> <span id="s4077">I told you what that means, a paranosa [ph], to make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s4078">N: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4079">S: We tried to start an import textiles because we know textiles, but at that time it was forbidden to import textiles into Brazil for because they had a weak currency.</span> <span id="s4080">So, they only accepted Brazilian made textiles, no imports.</span></p> <p><span id="s4081">N: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4082">S: So, a couple of months later, one of our friends, one of our friends here asked me, “Freddy, can’t you get me some DDT.</span> <span id="s4083">I need it.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4084">N: Some what?</span> <span id="s4085">DDT?</span></p> <p><span id="s4086">S: You know what DDT is?</span></p> <p><span

Yes, So, I says, “Okay, I’ll ask my father.”</span> <span id="s4092">So, my father got DDT.</span> <span id="s4093">I started importing DDT.</span> <span id="s4094">I got into that business.</span> <span id="s4095">Just to show you how little I knew about the business.</span> <span id="s4096">After six months, I went, you had to go in for an import license.</span> <span id="s4097">So, I went in for an import license for a thousand tons of sodium chloride.</span> <span id="s4098">So, they called me in about the import license.</span> <span id="s4099">He says, “You went in for an import license of sodium chloride.</span> <span id="s4100">Do you know what sodium chloride is?”</span> <span id="s4101">No, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s4102">I didn’t know at that time, chemicals.</span> <span id="s4103">He says, “Sodium chloride is table salt.”</span></p> <p><span id="s4104">N: Right.</span> <span id="s4105">(chuckle)</span></p> <p><span id="s4106">S: (chuckle) I learned my business the hard way.</span></p> <p><span id="s4107">N: So, who was this person who first asked whether you could help with DDT?</span></p> <p><span id="s4108">S: Eh.</span> <span

are?</span></p> <p><span id="s4117">N: Ices [ph]?</span> <span id="s4118">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4119">S: Advice.</span> <span id="s4120">I’m learning you Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s4121">N: Yeah, Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s4122">S: Yiddish words on the way.</span> <span id="s4123">Uh, no, the business started growing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4124">N: So, you were importing chemicals?</span></p> <p><span id="s4125">S: Chemicals.</span></p> <p><span id="s4126">N: DDT only?</span> <span id="s4127">Or others?</span></p> <p><span id="s4128">S: Pharmaceuticals raw

<span id="s4131">Mhm.</span> <span id="s4132">And this was before your parents came to Brazil?</span></p> <p><span id="s4133">S: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4134">N: Okay.</span> <span id="s4135">And, so were you, were you working alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s4136">S: This was before my father came here with my mother, and we went into business together.</span> <span

reason why you chose Brazil?</span> <span id="s4305">Was there any contact?</span></p> <p><span id="s4306">S: Well, because my father met the Steinberg’s, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s4307">He didn’t like Argentina.</span> <span id="s4308">He never thought of going to Chile or Venezuela or to Colombia, so he choose a big country.</span></p> <p><span id="s4309">N: Okay.</span></p> <p><span

id="s4313">N: I mean, by then you’re an adult so it’s not as easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">S: I know.</span> <span id="s4315">To learn it well, probably a year.</span> <span id="s4316">But after three months I was speaking Portuguese.</span> <span id="s4317">Probably was making mistakes, but when I wanted a loaf of bread, they gave me a loaf of bread.</span> <span id="s4318">When I wanted a pineapple, they gave me a pineapple.</span> <span id="s4319">So,</span></p> <p><span id="s4320">N: Mhm.</span> <span id="s4321">MHm.</span></p> <p><span id="s4322">S: So, the more, more, complicated things, it takes about a year or two, but you learn it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4323">N: So, how long after meeting your wife did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s4324">S: One
