with Ms. Pearl Herling, done on March 16, 1981 by Josey Fisher.</span> <span id="s3">Could you tell us when you were born and where and a little bit about your family background?</span></p> <p><span id="s4">PH: Okay.</span> <span id="s5">I was born in Budapest in 1924, August 24.</span> <span id="s6">My father was in the wholesale textile business and we were what you would call upper middle class.</span> <span id="s7">I went to elementary school and, since I was a good student, I went to a special school which they call gymnasium.</span> <span id="s8">But in the fourth year the Nazis, Hungarian Nazis, discontinued all the Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s9">So I was raised and educated by private tutors, except I was for a half year in Switzerland in a finishing school.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">JF: What year was this that the Hungarian Nazis discontinued the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s11">PH: The schooling was stopped, the special Jewish schools, in the 1930's.</span> <span id="s12">They were gradually discontinued.</span> <span id="s13">So you understand what is was to be a Jew in Hungary.</span> <span id="s14">You would say it was just about the situation like you have with the black people now.</span> <span id="s15">They were not discriminated openly but there were parts of the city where Jews could not get an apartment.</span> <span id="s16">Banking was closed for Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">JF: You mean the field of banking?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">PH: The field of banking was closed for Jews.</span> <span id="s19">The merchants, the doctors, and the lawyers were mostly Jewish.</span> <span id="s20">But to go to the university was a very difficult thing because it was what we call numerus clausus, which means that there are six percent Jews in Hungary and only six percent of the Jews could go to the universities, which meant that women absolutely had to give up their places.</span> <span id="s21">I don't know of any woman who could get into the university because of the six percent, that was the law, that had to be given to the talented young men.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">JF: When did this social discrimination start?</span> <span id="s23">In the early '30's or earlier than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">PH: Early '30's, but it came to the surface when it was not disguised any more in 1938.</span> <span id="s25">This is when the hard lines started.</span> <span id="s26">The newspapers would say six percent Jews to the university.</span> <span id="s27">Before that, it was more or less practiced but not talked about.</span> <span id="s28">But in 1938 the newspaper came out with a big, black headline.</span> <span id="s29">It was in front of my eyes because we just came out from the theater and they were selling the next morning's papers.</span> <span id="s30">In the biggest possible print, it was "Six percent for Jews."</span></p> <p><span id="s31">JF: Can you tell me, before that time, whether your family or you personally felt antisemitism and in what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">PH: Always, always.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">JF: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">PH: There was absolutely no intermingling with gentile people.</span> <span id="s35">There were always Jewish jokes.</span> <span id="s36">Jews were always pictured as money grabbers.</span> <span id="s37">There were not actual ghettos but there were parts of Budapest, especially Buda, which was more aristocratic, where you could not get an apartment.</span> <span id="s38">There were resorts that you could not get a hotel room.</span> <span id="s39">And there was always one Jew in a high position for show.</span> <span id="s40">Every time they talked about antisemitism, they would say, "Oh, it isn't, because Mr. so-and-so is in the cabinet."</span> <span id="s41">In a minor job, not a major job.</span> <span id="s42">We had a summer place in the country where there were mostly Germans.</span> <span id="s43">The farmers were Germans.</span> <span id="s44">And their children were told that they cannot make antisemitic remarks, only in the winter.</span> <span id="s45">In the summer when the Jews were around, they cannot make antisemitic remarks.</span> <span id="s46">We always knew who we were--second class citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">JF: Was there any kind of positive interchange with the Christian population?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">PH: I had only Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s49">But it might be we were just as anti-gentile as they were antisemitic.</span> <span id="s50">My father who was in the First World War was very proud that he was able to send high-ranking soldiers who were antisemitic to the fronts where it was very unlikely that they came back, because he was in transportation.</span> <span id="s51">And after the First World War, when we had a short Communist era under Bela Kun, who was Jewish, Hungary has the distinction that they were the first one who were beating up Jewish students on the front of the university.</span> <span id="s52">That was the distinction of the Hungarians who were way ahead of the Germans or the Italians.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">JF: What was your Jewish experience like, your religious experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">PH: I come from an Orthodox Jewish family.</span> <span id="s55">My grandfather on my mother's side was from Poland.</span> <span id="s56">They came to Hungary to escape the pogroms and they were very Orthodox.</span> <span id="s57">My grandfather on my mother's side was a very learned man.</span> <span id="s58">He did not do anything in his life, only study the Torah.</span> <span id="s59">And my grandmother and the children worked.</span> <span id="s60">My grandparents, from my father's side were Hungarian, so way back that we really don't know.</span> <span id="s61">There is a story that the Hungarian Jews came before the Magyars came.</span> <span id="s62">So they were strictly Hungarian and there was a great deal of animosity between my Polish and Hungarian grandparents because my Hungarian grandfather was extremely wealthy and looked down at my Polish grandfather who was very poor.</span> <span id="s63">My Polish grandfather was very learned and looked down at my Hungarian grandfather who didn't study the Torah.</span> <span id="s64">So I was exposed to both families and we were a very close-knit family.</span> <span id="s65">I was very close to my Polish grandparents, much more than to my Hungarian.</span> <span id="s66">My Hungarian grandfather was a high officeholder, something like you would call an alderman, but only because he owned a part of the city, streets and streets and houses.</span> <span id="s67">And he owned that part of the city where he was an alderman.</span> <span id="s68">My father grew up very rich, really.</span> <span id="s69">It was a great tragedy that he married that Polish girl.</span> <span id="s70">So I was exposed to a very religious--but underneath it all, we were always a little bit ashamed of being Jews.</span> <span id="s71">In fact, Hungarian Jews changed their religion very easily.</span> <span id="s72">They turned.</span> <span id="s73">In fact, when the Nuremberg law came to Hungary where you had to have four sets of Aryan grandparents, there was a great wave of suicide because antisemites found out that they don't qualify under the Nuremberg law.</span> <span id="s74">They did have Jewish grandparents.</span> <span id="s75">And there was no way for them--they were half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s76">They would have to wear actually a white armband, and they just couldn't face it, so they killed themselves.</span> <span id="s77">But we were very conscientious Jews and proud Jews.</span> <span id="s78">I was a Zionist ever since I was a small child.</span> <span id="s79">In fact, I had to be a Zionist in secret because my father thought that Zionists were communists.</span> <span id="s80">I could not go to Zionist meetings openly, but I did go anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">JF: This is as a young child, you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">PH: Yes.</span> <span id="s83">So my background is like upper middle class.</span> <span id="s84">I went to good schools.</span> <span id="s85">We were exposed to all sports.</span> <span id="s86">In fact, I was very athletic.</span> <span id="s87">But I was an excellent swimmer and I trained with the group which actually went to the Olympics.</span> <span id="s88">But from the beginning on, I was told I was not going to make the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s89">I trained with them, but as a Jew I could not go on the Olympic team.</span> <span id="s90">And then I started learning to fence.</span> <span id="s91">I was good at that.</span> <span id="s92">Now that definitely was not for Jews.</span> <span id="s93">And once I said I would like to learn to ride a horse and my family practically disinherited me because it was just not to be done by Jewish children.</span> <span id="s94">There were just certain limits what a Jew could do.</span> <span id="s95">But education was pressed very hard.</span> <span id="s96">When I couldn't go to the public school any more, my parents went to every kinds of pain to have private tutors.</span> <span id="s97">They were pressing that just because I am not going to graduate from the gymnasium, I had to read books and I will have the same kind of education only I won't have--in fact, I'm carrying a chip in my shoulder ever since.</span> <span id="s98">But I never really graduated from high school.</span> <span id="s99">So I am going to every kind of school now.</span> <span id="s100">I am studying everything I can.</span> <span id="s101">And that's why, I imagine, my children went to college.</span> <span id="s102">Against all odds, they graduated from college with every kind of honor.</span> <span id="s103">I'm a good Jewish mother--I have to put that in.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">JF: Can you go back to 1933 and recall if you had, or your family had, a reaction to Hitler being made chancellor of Germany, and what changes this might have brought to you in Hungary?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">PH: Well, we didn't feel the changes until, really, 1938.</span> <span id="s106">1933 it was just the news.</span> <span id="s107">In fact, we had relatives in Germany and they didn't take it seriously.</span> <span id="s108">They thought it is a fad from the beer halls and it's going to go away.</span> <span id="s109">We never knew that Hindenberg was going to cave in.</span> <span id="s110">And we absolutely could not believe that the German people are going to fall for that.</span> <span id="s111">But I must tell you I was really too young to know.</span> <span id="s112">It was much more important what kind of dress I'm going to wear for this or that ball.</span> <span id="s113">We didn't take it seriously.</span> <span id="s114">In '38 when the numerus clausus came, when it was impossible to go to a university, when we really realized that Hungary is going to be an antisemitic state.</span> <span id="s115">And that was when Jewish people who were merchants had to take in gentile people and put the businesses on their names.</span> <span id="s116">Eventually, naturally, they were robbed of everything.</span> <span id="s117">But at that time it was just a front, that the Jews gave over their businesses and their property to gentiles as co-owners.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">JF: This was a front, you say, at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">PH: It was a front at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">JF: And what experience did your father have where this was concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">PH: Well, my father actually just disappeared.</span> <span id="s122">I don't know.</span> <span id="s123">He went out one day to the street and he never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">JF: When was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">PH: That was in 1941, 42.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">JF: He went down to the street and he never came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">PH: Never came back.</span> <span id="s128">He might have been taken to some of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s129">Or he might have been shot in the Danube, which was a very popular execution.</span> <span id="s130">We really don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JF: You never heard anything at any later point about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">PH: No, no.</span> <span id="s133">That was the time when my brother, who was about 14, my younger brother, never came back from the school.</span> <span id="s134">Not until after the war when he showed up did we find out that he was taken to work in Yugoslavia to a salt mine.</span> <span id="s135">He was just 14 years old.</span> <span id="s136">He's still an emotional cripple who never could forget it or forgive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">JF: This was the same time, around 1941?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">PH: Between 1940-44, things started to disintegrate.</span> <span id="s139">Very often I was asked why didn't we do anything against the Nazi era.</span> <span id="s140">And it came lawfully--one day that posters and in the newspaper that young men born between, let's say, 1918 or 1916 and 1924 to go for--it is like military service, but they are not going to carry any guns.</span> <span id="s141">Anybody who is Jewish wears a yellow band.</span> <span id="s142">Anybody whose parents or grandparents were converted will wear a white band and they're going to be work forces.</span> <span id="s143">They are going to be in the armed forces without a gun and they are going to work in fields, in hospitals, or in workshops.</span> <span id="s144">So young people, young men, certain aged young men, had a military service.</span> <span id="s145">There was nothing to be done about it.</span> <span id="s146">Then a month or two later another age group went.</span> <span id="s147">So by the time we realized what's happening, there were nothing but old people and women and children.</span> <span id="s148">All the young men went, and since we were the allies of the Germans, they had to be in military service.</span> <span id="s149">In fact, some of them were in the Ukraine in workshops and they did come back.</span> <span id="s150">But after they came back, they were taken to concentration camps, never to hear from them.</span> <span id="s151">But in the beginning it was just a war effort.</span> <span id="s152">That the Jews had to pull the same kind of military service, only without their guns, but they had to work.</span> <span id="s153">We didn't realize until 1944 when the Hungarian Nazis took over.</span> <span id="s154">There was nobody to defend us.</span> <span id="s155">Everybody was in the labor camp or in the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">JF: How did you see the antisemitism in Hungary during this time?</span> <span id="s157">Did you see it as part of the Hungarian antisemitism or did you see it as a part of the greater Nazi plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">PH: The Hungarian Nazis grossly outdid the Germans.</span> <span id="s159">They accomplished in a very short time because we didn't have Nazis.</span> <span id="s160">The Hungarian Nazis took over in 1944, June 6, 1944.</span> <span id="s161">By the time the Russians occupied which was in January-February, they demolished 85 percent of the Jewish population.</span> <span id="s162">They did a wonderful job and they enjoyed every minute of it.</span> <span id="s163">They were cruel, they were greedy.</span> <span id="s164">They killed, raped, robbed, and enjoyed it.</span> <span id="s165">The only place where Jews stayed alive was Budapest, Hungary, and just because of the effort of Waldheim1 with the Swedish consulate and the Swiss consulate who saved us.</span> <span id="s166">But there was a time--well, first of all, they started ghettos.</span> <span id="s167">They established houses with the yellow stars and ....</span></p> <p><span id="s168">JF: This was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">PH: In Budapest.</span> <span id="s170">That was in 1944.</span> <span id="s171">That's how they started.</span> <span id="s172">By then we had no men around.</span> <span id="s173">By then the men were already in workshops or concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">JF: Can you tell me about your experience and the other members of your family who were left during the early '40's after your father disappeared and your brother was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">PH: Both of our houses where my sister lived and my house where I lived--by that time I was married and my husband was already taken.</span> <span id="s176">That was 1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">JF: You got married in what year, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">PH: In 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">JF: And you were not living...?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">PH: I did not live with my parents.</span> <span id="s181">We had a fur shop connected with our apartment.</span> <span id="s182">It was on the first floor.</span> <span id="s183">We occupied the first floor of a house.</span> <span id="s184">Part was a fur shop and part was our living quarters.</span> <span id="s185">And I lived there.</span> <span id="s186">And my husband was taken.</span> <span id="s187">In fact, he was the very first one in our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">JF: He was taken where?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">PH: He was taken.</span> <span id="s190">He went first to the Ukraine in a fur shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JF: In what year was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">PH: That was in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">JF: Did you have any kind of contact with him during that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PH: When he was in the Ukraine, yes.</span> <span id="s195">He would send soldiers to visit.</span> <span id="s196">I would give them some furs and for that I would take food and warm clothes.</span> <span id="s197">In fact, my husband was very religious Jew.</span> <span id="s198">He never ate non-kosher food.</span> <span id="s199">I was able to send him food.</span> <span id="s200">Then he came home for exactly one week.</span> <span id="s201">Then they took him down to Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s202">There was a salt mine,1 Bor.</span> <span id="s203">My brother who was also there met him.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">JF: How did you find that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">PH: My brother came home.</span> <span id="s206">My brother is here in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">JF: He told you this after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">PH: He met him there.</span> <span id="s209">If you want to hear a really miracle story, I don't know how far you want to go in.</span> <span id="s210">Jews believe in fate.</span> <span id="s211">My husband was put in a group which supposedly was to come home to Budapest.</span> <span id="s212">That was when Horthy, the head of the Hungarian regent, the head of the Hungarian government, declared that he's out of the war.</span> <span id="s213">He's breaking with the Germans.</span> <span id="s214">And for about a week we were out of the war.</span> <span id="s215">The yellow stars came down.</span> <span id="s216">Everything was to be--we will have peace.</span> <span id="s217">So they took that group of men in Bor, Yugoslavia, and they were about to come home.</span> <span id="s218">My husband was in the group that's supposed to come home but my brother was not.</span> <span id="s219">They said he would be in a week or ten days--the second group will return.</span> <span id="s220">So my husband went up to one of his comrades and said, "Look, here is my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s221">He's only a kid.</span> <span id="s222">He's only 16.</span> <span id="s223">Why don't you change dog-tags with him and the minute I go home, I'll give a substantial amount of money to your family.</span> <span id="s224">I know that they are in need," which that man did.</span> <span id="s225">About half an hour before they started marching, the man goes up to my husband and says, "Listen, I might need that money but I want to go home.</span> <span id="s226">I'm not giving my place to your brother-in-law."</span> <span id="s227">So they changed dog-tags.</span> <span id="s228">Nobody came home from that group, not a soul, including my husband.</span> <span id="s229">And my brother escaped.</span> <span id="s230">My brother came home.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">JF: What happened to that group?</span> <span id="s232">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">PH: We know that one night they were in a brick burning factory by 20's.</span> <span id="s234">Twenty people in each brick factory where they made bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">JF: Yes.</span> <span id="s236">In where?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">PH: On their way home from Yugoslavia to Hungary.</span> <span id="s238">They were marching home.</span> <span id="s239">And I know he was there because we got a letter.</span> <span id="s240">I got a letter where they said they are starving, if I could send somebody down.</span> <span id="s241">I did that.</span> <span id="s242">They could not be found.</span> <span id="s243">So as we later find out, they were taken out by 20's and they were machine gunned.</span> <span id="s244">That was the night in June, 1944, when the Nazis took over, the Hungarian Nazis.1 Now I am hoping that he was in that group because, as I understand, those who stayed alive, they went to Bergen Belsen so they suffered some more.</span> <span id="s245">But nobody came home.</span> <span id="s246">We know about this night.</span> <span id="s247">Just after the war we sent out investigators and I heard that from the farmers around.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">JF: And where was this place that it happened, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">PH: We don't know exactly.</span> <span id="s250">In one of the little villages between Yugoslavia and Hungary.</span> <span id="s251">It was on the way home.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">JF: Did you know that your husband might be home?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">PH: On the way home.</span> <span id="s254">I knew that he was in that group because my brother was almost in that group.</span> <span id="s255">My brother saw him leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">JF: You found this out after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">PH: After the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">JF: You husband was in that group.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">PH: But it was written up in the newspapers.</span> <span id="s260">The whole incident was written up in the newspapers because it was reported by the farmers, whoever saw it and heard it.</span> <span id="s261">But I actually don't know where my husband when and how.</span> <span id="s262">I'm just hoping that he was shot, that he didn't have to walk because that's quite a walk from there to Bergen Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JF: You said that you had a fur shop during those years.</span> <span id="s264">You were permitted to run it until 1944?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">PH: No.</span> <span id="s266">In 1942 they stamped it.</span> <span id="s267">They put stamps on it and we could not use it.</span> <span id="s268">It was then full and then one day it was carted away.</span> <span id="s269">The merchandise was carted away.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">JF: And then how were you able to support yourself at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">PH: How do you support yourself?</span> <span id="s272">Maybe I stole a little fur out of that store and sold it.</span> <span id="s273">Well, anyway there was nothing to buy because when these houses with the yellow stars were established, we only could leave between two and four o'clock to do our shopping.</span> <span id="s274">And the merchants, the gentile merchants, made very sure that that was the time when they had their lunch hour, and all the stores were closed between two and four.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">JF: This was in 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">PH: This was in 1944, 1942-1944.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">JF: And you had to move into one of these houses?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">PH: Yes.</span> <span id="s279">It happened that my house was a--so I took in my friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JF: And where was your mother at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">PH: My mother's house--my sister's house also was a yellow star house.</span> <span id="s282">So the rest of my family, we moved in there.</span> <span id="s283">You've got to hang on to your apartment because you knew it will be over and once it will be over--for some strange reason it never, ever occurred to me that I'm not going to survive.</span> <span id="s284">I just, not in my wildest dreams did I think that anybody would be able to kill me.</span> <span id="s285">I was a very cocky young 19-year old.</span> <span id="s286">You can do everything when you are that young.</span> <span id="s287">So I hung on to my apartment and my sister hung on to her apartment.</span> <span id="s288">Then eventually we went back to it after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JF: Do you have any idea why you felt that

toilet and wanted to take us.</span> <span id="s442">My sister took out golden cufflinks what she had from her husband who was also in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s443">She handed it to

morning--we slept in a stairway that night.</span> <span id="s497">After that we went to an office where they were handling refugees from the part of Hungary which was by then occupied by the Russians.</span> <span id="s498">We were very lucky because that's the part where we had our summer home, so we were very familiar with it.</span> <span id="s499">So we got papers that we are refugees.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">JF: How did you get those papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">PH: There was an office set up for refugees.</span> <span id="s502">And they also were put in

apartment you want.</span> <span id="s507">We were picking an apartment.</span> <span id="s508">It was my sister at that time and also my mother and the two children because we decided that if we lived we wanted to live together, if we died we wanted to die together.</span> <span id="s509">This is what was left from our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">JF: Where had your mother been during this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">PH: My mother was a--very strange [unclear] in that German occupation.</span> <span id="s512">The Germans were protecting part of my family because my uncle, who's also a furrier, but a real furrier, was working on fur coats.</span> <span id="s513">Don't forget, the Germans are fighting the Russians.</span> <span id="s514">They needed fur hats, fur mittens.</span> <span id="s515">My uncle was working in a German work camp in Budapest.</span> <span id="s516">And the whole family including my very Orthodox Jewish grandfather, grandmother, my mother, and my uncle's wife--they were under German--and when the Hungarian Nazis came and said, "Give me your Jews," the head of the German camp said, "If I want to kill my Jews, I'm going to kill them myself.</span> <span id="s517">I don't need your help."</span> <span id="s518">And he said, "Stick with me.</span> <span id="s519">You're going to live."</span> <span id="s520">And everyone stayed alive.</span> <span id="s521">In fact, after the war when he was arrested, in droves they went and they testified that he was very human.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">JF: The German?</span></p> <p><span id="s523">PH: The German, very human.</span> <span id="s524">He saw to it that my grandfather and my grandmother had kosher--not kosher but enough milk and cheese that they never had to eat non-kosher meat.</span> <span id="s525">But at that time my mother said she wants to be with us.</span> <span id="s526">So we all went and chose this apartment.</span> <span

it to you.</span> <span id="s529">This couple took it, just the very same apartment.</span> <span id="s530">But I have one a block away, this and that.</span> <span id="s531">Would you like this?"</span> <span id="s532">And we took it.</span> <span id="s533">That apartment building which we wanted was totally demolished, totally by an air raid.</span> <span id="s534">Not a person stayed alive.</span> <span id="s535">We would have not been around.</span> <span id="s536">Now, in this building where we lived, up on the sixth floor, it was Christmas Day and everybody had to go down to the shelter because there were no more windows, were broken.</span> <span id="s537">It was ice cold.</span> <span id="s538">We had really air raids.</span> <span id="s539">If you want to read about that, I had an article in the Inquirer; it was printed, how we escaped.</span> <span id="s540">So my mother said, "We must go down to the shelter."</span> <span id="s541">The shelter was nothing, just an old coal--where they kept coal.</span> <span id="s542">So, my sister goes down.</span> <span id="s543">Remember, there's a little Jewish boy who is circumcised.</span> <span id="s544">There is no bathroom.</span> <span id="s545">We have to have a place somewhere in the corner where we can put that kid on the potty and nobody can see that this is a Jewish child, because in Hungary only a Jewish child is circumcised.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">JF: You were at this point using papers that said what?</span></p> <p><span id="s547">PH: We are refugees from Neimorosh [phonetic] from the place where we spent our summers, and we are all non-Jews.</span> <span id="s548">We are all refugees.</span> <span id="s549">In fact, we might be Nazis because we are running away from the Russians, so if we run away from the Russians we probably have something to hide.</span> <span id="s550">And we are surrounded with people who are Nazis.</span> <span id="s551">At that time we already had a lot of men who were escaping from the army, lots of deserters.</span> <span id="s552">There were men around who were deserters, every kind of false papers.</span> <span id="s553">So my sister goes down and looks for a place which is not in the center of the room, somewhere in the corner.</span> <span id="s554">She sees a little corner where there is an emergency exit and she wants to occupy that.</span> <span id="s555">The superintendent of the house comes in and says, "You cannot have this because this is for me and my family because this is the closest to the exit."</span> <span id="s556">So my sister took what she could.</span> <span id="s557">Naturally the space was very limited.</span> <span id="s558">we had a mattress.</span> <span id="s559">Four of us slept on this mattress, my sister with the two children and me.</span> <span id="s560">And my mother who's a very heavy-set woman had a mattress of her own.</span> <span id="s561">And that was it.</span> <span id="s562">That was our home.</span> <span id="s563">One night, as we later found out, we were next to a school which had a big red cross painted on the top that it was a Red Cross building.</span> <span id="s564">But it was none of that sort.</span> <span id="s565">It was a place where they stored TNT, explosives.</span> <span id="s566">This school was--got a full blast on top of it.</span> <span id="s567">And we were next door to it.</span> <span id="s568">The six-floor building went up like a card and collapsed on top of the shelter where we were.</span> <span id="s569">In that shelter must have been 150 people.</span> <span id="s570">Sixteen people stayed alive--us, five of us.</span> <span id="s571">That part where we wanted to be--it was bulldozed.</span> <span id="s572">They were never even able ever to get the bodies out.</span> <span id="s573">Because a fire started, and the only way they had to flood then the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s574">That blast was so strong that a friend of mine, who was a doctor with a wife, he was converted and he was working in an emergency hospital about six or seven blocks away.</span> <span id="s575">By this--I was looking for him after the war.</span> <span id="s576">He was killed by this blast because he was thrown against the wall and he crushed his skull.</span> <span id="s577">That's how powerful that blast was.</span> <span

his wife was killed, presumably, in Bergen-Belsen where, presumably, my husband was also killed.</span> <span id="s588">I don't know whether I expect that anybody would believe me, but that's all the truth.</span> <span id="s589">I have my whole family to vouch for me.</span> <span id="s590">You'd have to go to Israel to talk to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">JF: And did you stay together at

mother and we talked about old times.</span> <span id="s607">My mother said how much joy she had from us, how good children we were, and we said how good parents they were.</span> <span id="s608">We kissed and we just--this is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">JF: You had children of your own at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">PH: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">JF: These were

raped, they stole.</span> <span id="s620">We were very, very lucky because we heard what's happening and part of my family--my sister's in-laws were Czechoslovakian, they spoke Czech which is very close to Russian.</span> <span id="s621">And she taught us how to say that we have venereal disease.</span> <span id="s622">So when the Russian soldiers wanted to try something, which they did, we just said that we have syphilis.</span> <span id="s623">So we really never had any bad experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">JF: And they immediately left you alone?</span></p> <p><span

<span id="s629">So she taught us how to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">JF: Where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">PH: We went back to my sister's apartment house which was in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">JF: This was in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">PH: In Budapest.</span> <span id="s634">We went back there.</span> <span id="s635">By that time I understand there were 38 people to a room in that ghetto.</span> <span id="s636">I only knew that never in my life saw that many bedbugs in my life.</span> <span id="s637">In fact, I slept in the same bed with my sister.</span> <span id="s638">There was no electricity but we had some candles.</span> <span id="s639">So when I slept, my sister picked the bedbugs and put them into the candle.</span> <span id="s640">And a half an hour later she went to sleep and I picked the bedbugs.</span> <span id="s641">The most horrible thing what happened is that my little niece, who's now a happy mother in Israel, she had gorgeous, gorgeous long hair and it was full of lice.</span> <span id="s642">We tried to save it.</span> <span id="s643">We just cut off little pieces and put some petroleum on it to kill the lice, but it was a losing battle.</span> <span id="s644">We had to shave her head to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s645">The filth was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s646">The hunger was not to believe--how hungry we were.</span> <span id="s647">And let me tell you something, I don't care how intelligent you are, I don't care how educated you are, I don't care how humanitarian you are, if you are hungry, you are nothing but a wild animal.</span> <span id="s648">We got, by some miracle, two slices--a hunk of bread which would have been like two or three big slices.</span> <span id="s649">So we decided right then this is for the children.</span> <span id="s650">I went to sleep and I just could not think of anything else but that bread in the cupboard.</span> <span id="s651">It was probably half sawdust because it was very dark and very heavy.</span> <span id="s652">I said, "I don't care about what happens to the children.</span> <span id="s653">I have to have a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s654">I didn't have bread for a month."</span> <span id="s655">So I go out in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s656">There is my sister, the mother of the children, standing over the bread with a knife in her hand.</span> <span id="s657">She said, "If it's the last thing I do, I have to have a taste of the bread."</span> <span id="s658">I said, "Muncie, bless your heart.</span> <span id="s659">You are just absorbing me because that's why I came."</span> <span id="s660">So we cut a hair of the bread and we ate it.</span> <span id="s661">That's what food will do for you.</span> <span id="s662">We went into totally demolished houses.</span> <span id="s663">We climbed the steps which were falling apart underneath us to search.</span> <span id="s664">And it was a great day--we found a jar of pickles, rotten pickles.</span> <span id="s665">And we ate them.</span> <span id="s666">We got diarrhea but it was all right because for a while our stomach was full.</span> <span id="s667">It's unbelievable.</span> <span id="s668">You have no idea how good horse meat tastes.</span> <span id="s669">There were dead horses on the street and we cut big chunks of horse meat.</span> <span id="s670">Except that it's a little bit sweet, it's very good.</span> <span id="s671">My mother only would eat it because we said it's a cow or a beef or she wouldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s672">And that's the first time I ate non-kosher meat.</span> <span id="s673">But we ate it and we survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">JF: How long did that period of time go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">PH: Well, just about a week after, I went down to the provinces which were much better off.</span> <span id="s676">It was a funny adventure.</span> <span

mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">PH: Debrecen and Szeged, you know the farms.</span> <span id="s681">Budapest didn't grow anything.</span> <span id="s682">It was only houses.</span> <span id="s683">But Budapest is an agricultural city, so there is food being grown except the Russians took most of it.</span> <span id="s684">But the Hungarian peasants would hide food and we still had some jewelry left or something left to exchange.</span> <span id="s685">So I was going down to Debrecen on the front of the engine.</span> <span id="s686">I sat on the front of the engine.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">JF: On a train?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">PH: On the train.</span> <span id="s689">The little engine in the very front, I was like a mermaid on a boat.</span> <span id="s690">And it was terrible because it would stop and we wouldn't know when it would start and they pushed us in the side.</span> <span id="s691">And we didn't know when it would start, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s692">This was February, March, and it's very, very cold in Hungary.</span> <span id="s693">Finally, I arrived in Debrecen and I ate and ate and ate and I was so sick, terribly, terribly sick from all that food.</span> <span id="s694">But I took a lot of food with me and I brought it back to Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">JF: How did you get food when you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">PH: You exchange whatever you could.</span> <span id="s697">I had--we had some friends, non-Jewish friends--people who hid our things.</span> <span id="s698">You would give, let's say, two bracelets.</span> <span id="s699">And I said, "If I survive, you keep one bracelet and you give me back one."</span> <span id="s700">Or from my fur shop, I took fur coats and I said, "If I come back, you keep one of them and you give me back one."</span></p> <p><span id="s701">JF: Who were these non-Jewish friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">PH: The workers who worked in my store, workers who worked in my family.</span> <span id="s703">They were no friends.</span> <span id="s704">They were hoping that I'll never come back and they'll never have to give back.</span> <span id="s705">The only one who gave back everything and didn't keep anything was one of the furriers I worked with, a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s706">He kept everything for me and he gave back everything and he would not take anything from me.</span> <span id="s707">So we either sold it for dollars--the Russians were buying furs--or we would exchange it.</span> <span id="s708">So then a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s709">I walked in with my packages and everybody was eating when my brother showed up, the very same day.</span> <span id="s710">We didn't know if he was dead or alive.</span> <span id="s711">He also came with a big package of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">JF: And how did he come back?</span> <span id="s713">He was liberated?</span></p> <p><span

two and four.</span> <span id="s738">I could go out of my building because on the first floor there were stores and there was a beauty parlor that I could go through in and out any time of the day.</span> <span id="s739">I could walk through and I could go in like I was customer.</span> <span id="s740">So I went and visited my mother whenever I could.</span> <span id="s741">One day I'm coming home and the street where I lived led to one of the most famous bridges, the Cattle Bridge.</span> <span id="s742">Budapest is famous for their bridges.</span> <span id="s743">I am on the subway and we hear a tremendous explosion.</span> <span id="s744">I hear that the Germans blew up the Cattle Bridge.</span> <span id="s745">That's a very famous bridge.</span> <span id="s746">I wanted

identification getting off from the subway.</span> <span id="s749">The whole area was surrounded because of the tremendous explosion.</span> <span id="s750">I have no identification.</span> <span

to.</span> <span id="s753">I am a Jew and I don't have any papers."</span> <span id="s754">He said, "Where do you live?"</span> <span id="s755">"I live in [unclear] 24, I had my fur shop there."</span> <span id="s756">He said, "Fur shop?</span> <span id="s757">Are you the wife of Raul Phillips?"</span> <span id="s758">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s759">He said, "I know him very well."</span> <span id="s760">He took my hand, he took out his papers, he took my hand and led me into the beauty parlor, and from there I went to my apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Tape 2,

it from the "Voice of America," which was forbidden to listen to.</span> <span id="s778">So we just could huddle together around the radio and catch whatever we could get.</span> <span id="s779">We

wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s915">So he wanted to save people.</span> <span id="s916">That's an even much better prospect that he had in mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">JF: You mentioned before that the man that you met in the basement of the building that you were in became your future husband.</span> <span id="s918">Can you tell me any more about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">PH: Well, my papers as a refugee I had made out with a very typical gentile name, Daniel, which is a very typical gentile name.</span> <span id="s920">And when we went down to the basement, next to us was another gentile man whose name was Horvath.</span> <span id="s921">These are very typical Hungarian names.</span> <span id="s922">And the second day my sister comes to me and says, "I have a feeling that that Horvath is Jewish."</span> <span id="s923">I said, "How do you know?</span> <span id="s924">He looks very non-Jewish, blond and blue eyes, very non-Jewish."</span> <span

sister-in-law.</span> <span id="s927">I said, "Try to turn him that way, because I think they are Jewish."</span> <span id="s928">They didn't look Jewish.</span> <span id="s929">Then, there were a lot of escaped soldiers in that building and one day a patrol came looking for AWOL soldiers and this one disappeared too.</span> <span id="s930">And my sister said, "Now why did he disappear?"</span> <span id="s931">Is he AWOL from the army or is he from a concentration camp?</span> <span id="s932">And after that he reappeared.</span> <span id="s933">And we knew that he was not kosher or kosher.</span> <span id="s934">[Laughing.]</span> <span id="s935">So after the war he comes up to me and said, "You know, my name is not Horvath.</span> <span id="s936">My name is Herling."</span>

back?</span></p> <p><span id="s961">PH: They didn't save him because they wanted to save a Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s962">They saved him because they wanted a convert, a Catholic child.</span>

the child back?</span> <span id="s969">Did he need to use legal pressure?</span></p> <p><span id="s970">PH: No.</span> <span id="s971">When he showed up--when he showed up they said, "Why don't you wait until your wife comes back.</span> <span id="s972">Maybe it will be easier for you if we had him, and we'll give him a good--but we knew, we knew.</span> <span id="s973">We heard from friends, what happened with friends when Jewish children were converted.</span> <span id="s974">So we got married.</span> <span id="s975">Then one Sunday morning the telephone starts ringing like crazy.</span> <span id="s976">They said, "Did you see this and this magazine?"</span> <span id="s977">We had a magazine which was very much copied from Life Magazine.</span> <span id="s978">We said, "No, what is it?"</span> <span id="s979">They said, "Go and get one and look at the picture."</span> <span id="s980">So my husband goes down, he buys the magazine and he come home white as a sheet.</span> <span id="s981">He said--"This picture-'Who knows this woman?'"</span> <span id="s982">"This picture, this is my wife.</span> <span id="s983">This is a picture of my wife."</span> <span id="s984">They found a woman in Bergen-Belsen who just recovered from some sickness, who could not talk, could not remember anything what she was.</span> <span id="s985">Babbling, they thought it was in Hungarian, had amnesia, didn't know anything.</span> <span id="s986">So they put her picture on this magazine with the caption, "Who knows this woman?"</span> <span id="s987">And we had fifteen telephone calls that this is Clara, my husband's first wife.</span> <span id="s988">So here I am already married and pregnant.</span> <span id="s989">"So, what is there to do?"</span> <span id="s990">I said, "You'll have to go and see if it's her.</span> <span id="s991">And then we'll have to divorce and this child will have no father."</span> <span id="s992">But he didn't have a passport and it was impossible to get a passport from the Russians.</span> <span id="s993">It was under the Russian occupation.</span> <span id="s994">So by some miracle my brother-in-law, the first wife's brother, had a passport.</span> <span id="s995">He went out to Bergen-Belsen to look for his sister who died the day before he arrived.</span> <span id="s996">But there was a moment, and my husband said, "Who am I going to choose?</span> <span id="s997">Which is my wife?"</span> <span id="s998">I said, "Well, there is no question that she's your wife.</span> <span id="s999">You don't think you'd let her come home from that hell--and this child has not been born, mine, but that one is already seven years old.</span> <span id="s1000">It is just not possible for her to come home and not to have a husband and a home."</span> <span id="s1001">Besides, we were living in their apartment.</span> <span id="s1002">When I married, I moved in the apartment where they lived.</span> <span id="s1003">So there I was being pregnant and probably having an illegal child, with an illegal marriage.</span> <span id="s1004">We didn't even know if it would be annulled or we will have to divorce or how it's going to be handled.</span> <span id="s1005">And what's going to go on my child's birth certificate?</span> <span id="s1006">This is not 1970 America.</span> <span id="s1007">This is 1940 Hungary, where a child has to have a mother and a father in the birth certificate.</span> <span id="s1008">So we really don't know who she was because I understand that people by the droves showed up, [saying] that "This is my wife," "This is my daughter."</span> <span id="s1009">Even though it resembled very strongly my husband's first wife, lots of people felt that it's their relative.</span> <span id="s1010">They wanted to find somebody, so they felt--but there must have been something because acquaintances and relatives called up: "This is her."</span> <span id="s1011">So we never knew.</span></p> <p><span

his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">PH: On his own.</span> <span id="s1217">His father wanted to bring him out.</span> <span id="s1218">Otherwise I would be in great trouble.</span> <span id="s1219">He said he was very sick and he had a fever and I forced him to eat beans because that was the only food I had.</span> <span id="s1220">I gave him [unclear].</span> <span id="s1221">Well, he's happily married.</span> <span id="s1222">He has two children.</span> <span id="s1223">He's a wonderful teacher and he's a very well adjusted young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">JF: He's here in the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">PH: He's in the States.</span> <span id="s1226">The only thing is--only a psychiatrist should listen to that.</span> <span id="s1227">This child is an absolute genius.</span> <span id="s1228">I can say that because I had nothing to do with his mental capacity.</span> <span id="s1229">His IQ is 176.</span> <span id="s1230">We lived in Vienna for two years before we came here and he spoke fluent German, was a very good student.</span> <span id="s1231">When he came here, and he needed--he went to the university.</span> <span id="s1232">He needed another language.</span> <span id="s1233">I said, "George, you spoke so well German.</span> <span id="s1234">Why don't you take German?"</span> <span id="s1235">He said, "Oh, it's a good idea."</span> <span id="s1236">A week later he comes home and says, "Mama, I cannot speak German.</span> <span id="s1237">I have an absolute mental and emotional block.</span> <span id="s1238">I have to take Spanish or French or something.</span> <span id="s1239">I cannot speak the language."</span> <span id="s1240">And he never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">JF: This was the first time you had tried to leave Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">PH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1243">The second time is an absolute and complete miracle.</span> <span id="s1244">There was a truck which we were supposed to take with my uncle.</span> <span id="s1245">This is the very uncle who escaped from the Germans--with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1246">The Germans protected him, that furrier-uncle.</span> <span id="s1247">I was supposed to go with him, with my baby, with the two children in that truck to take us over to Vienna.</span> <span id="s1248">We were supposed to meet at nine o'clock in a certain place.</span> <span id="s1249">I understand that at 8:30 there's a big flurry that they have to leave right away; they cannot wait until nine o'clock.</span> <span id="s1250">So my uncle says, "My niece with the two children are not here."</span> <span id="s1251">They are sorry, they cannot wait.</span> <span id="s1252">There is some confusion.</span> <span id="s1253">This was all very hush-hush, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s1254">The truck leaves without us.</span> <span id="s1255">The truck is being shot at before they left the outskirts of Budapest.</span> <span id="s1256">The woman next to my uncle is being shot in the shoulder.</span> <span id="s1257">With a stretch of imagination, I would say that with my baby in my hand that's where I would have been shot, maybe the baby through the head.</span> <span id="s1258">So everybody ran helter-skelter.</span> <span id="s1259">They caught some.</span> <span id="s1260">My uncle was caught and they put my Uncle Voldak in the mental institute so they couldn't reach him.</span> <span id="s1261">His daughter went to the doctor who worked in a mental institute.</span> <span id="s1262">So they locked him in so they couldn't reach him.</span> <span id="s1263">They couldn't find him; he was there for a week.</span> <span id="s1264">I arrived at 9 o'clock to that meeting place and I took [unclear] and I was coming with the two children.</span> <span id="s1265">We were arrested.</span> <span id="s1266">So I gave the baby, the children, to my mother and they took me to 60 undrashut [phonetic].</span> <span id="s1267">Now this is a very famous place because that was the headquarters of the Nazis and and the G.P.U. [Russian Secret Police].</span> <span id="s1268">They both used the same building.</span> <span id="s1269">So they really didn't do anything to me.</span> <span id="s1270">They just stood me in front of a white wall and they let me stand there.</span> <span id="s1271">It's hard to believe that after ten minutes looking at the white wall, you start to get dizzy and you start to sway and you just get disoriented.</span> <span id="s1272">They didn't hit me, they didn't curse at me, they didn't do anything to me.</span> <span id="s1273">So I decided, for God's sake, they are not going to beat me.</span> <span id="s1274">So I started to paint pictures on that wall, like a seder night when my grandfather and my grandmother stood there.</span> <span id="s1275">And the gefilte fish came and the matzo was there and we were singing.</span> <span id="s1276">And all of a sudden I was just with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">JF: You drew these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">PH: I drew that picture on the wall and I was part of it.</span> <span id="s1279">And I was standing there for two hours and I didn't fall apart.</span> <span id="s1280">I felt after 15 minutes I would confess that I killed my mother, just let me look at something which is not white.</span> <span id="s1281">But it wasn't white because the only white thing was the white tablecloth on the seder table.</span> <span id="s1282">We had all the fun and I looked at the haggadah.</span> <span id="s1283">I remember we were very, very Victorian.</span> <span id="s1284">We looked at the haggadah at the number nine, that it takes nine months that a baby should be born.</span> <span id="s1285">That was pornographic for us.</span> <span id="s1286">I remembered all those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">JF: With this kind of...</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">PH: And then a miracle happened.</span> <span id="s1289">They took me in front of an interrogator and he said, "Why did you stand there?</span> <span id="s1290">Why did you wait for that bus?</span> <span id="s1291">We know that that bus went to--that truck went to Vienna."</span> <span id="s1292">And I said, "Look, I lost my first husband in the war.</span> <span id="s1293">My second husband escaped from me with a blonde to Vienna, left me with two children and one of the child is his.</span> <span id="s1294">I just wanted to take his child down to him and I would have come back.</span> <span id="s1295">I didn't want to join the decadent West.</span> <span id="s1296">I just wanted to get rid of that kid who's not mine."</span> <span id="s1297">From all of this he heard that my first husband died in the war.</span> <span id="s1298">He said, "How did your husband die in the war?</span> <span id="s1299">Was he a soldier?"</span> <span id="s1300">I said, "No, he was killed in the concentration camp."</span> <span id="s1301">So he says in Yiddish to me "Bist du a yid?</span> <span id="s1302">Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1303">I said, "Of course."</span> <span id="s1304">He takes a piece of paper, stamps on it "Released," and said, "Go."</span> <span id="s1305">My mother is standing there.</span> <span id="s1306">Now this is about four hours, four or five hours, was standing there in front of undrashut 60, with the two small children and she's crying.</span> <span id="s1307">She's ready to accept that she'll never see me anymore, that I will be shipped to Siberia or something.</span> <span id="s1308">And here I come out because the interrogator himself probably escaped from a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1309">I had to come to Philadelphia because [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">JF: So at that point you were able to get to Vienna then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">PH: Yes, we bought--an Israeli--an Israeli couple was visiting and they sold their passport.</span> <span id="s1312">The next day they went then, after I called up that I arrived to Vienna, they went to the police and reported that their passport was stolen.</span> <span id="s1313">So I went out as an Israeli citizen.</span> <span id="s1314">I tell you, when they looked at that passport and they gave it back to me before we reached Austria, that was a wonderful feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">JF: When they returned...</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">PH: When they returned the passport and they let us go.</span> <span id="s1317">It took me eight months to get away from Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">JF: Did your mother leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">PH: Yes, they went to Israel.</span> <span id="s1320">They emigrated legal to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">JF: Around the same time or did it take them...?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">PH: Almost the same time.</span> <span id="s1323">A little after me they emigrated legally.</span> <span id="s1324">My sister with her two children, with her husband and my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">JF: You mentioned that the drawing you made in the police station was of a religious holiday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">PH: In my mind.</span> <span id="s1327">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1328">JF: And you had been raised as an Orthodox Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">PH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">JF: During those years of the Nazi occupation and the Russian occupation and the anti--severe antisemitism, how did your religion affect your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">PH: Well, I'll tell you honestly, they almost succeeded to make me feel a second grade citizen.</span> <span id="s1332">Because if you walk by a restaurant and it says, "No gypsies, no dogs, and no Jews allowed," and the Jew comes after the gypsy and the dog, it's very hard not to have some complex.</span> <span id="s1333">But I also realized that we had a five thousand year tradition and that we gave the Ten Commandments.</span> <span id="s1334">So it was pretty much balanced.</span> <span id="s1335">And I said I was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s1336">It was a conflict between being a proud Jew and being a second-grade citizen.</span> <span id="s1337">They did their very best to do it.</span> <span id="s1338">I never denied my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1339">In fact there was a time, if you converted, they promised that you are not going to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1340">It was not true, but an awful lot of Jews, my own uncle and aunt went to the priest and they converted.</span> <span id="s1341">And my very religious grandfather said that it's in the Torah that if you can save your life--they did it during the Inquisition.</span> <span id="s1342">I did not convert, not converted because I didn't want to give up my Jewishness, I didn't want to join the non-Jews who were out to kill me.</span> <span id="s1343">I went as far as I had my coat on.</span> <span id="s1344">I had my appointment with the priest.</span> <span id="s1345">I never got there.</span> <span id="s1346">I could not.</span> <span id="s1347">I would not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">JF: Did you feel that the church was able to help Jews in any other way other than by these conversions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">PH: I don't know if they could, but I knew that they would not.</span> <span id="s1350">They wanted to convert.</span> <span id="s1351">Their function is to convert Jews.</span> <span id="s1352">Their function is not to save Jews.</span> <span id="s1353">What did the Pope do?</span> <span id="s1354">But I can tell you when I gave up my Jewishness.</span> <span id="s1355">In fact, I don't know if I am an atheist, and that would make me a nonbeliever.</span> <span id="s1356">I gave up my Jewishness when I heard the story of what happened to my husband who was a very religious Jew and a very good person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">JF: You're talking now about your first husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">PH: Yes.</span> <span id="s1359">The story came out in the newspapers and I read it.</span> <span id="s1360">I went down the street and I headed straight to the basilica where I never was allowed to go.</span> <span id="s1361">I went to a Catholic church and I finished with God.</span> <span id="s1362">And I ate my non-kosher meat on purpose.</span> <span id="s1363">I was not hungry anymore.</span> <span id="s1364">But I went to my girlfriend's house who was married to a non-Jew and I had pork and I ate my first pork in my life.</span> <span id="s1365">I threw it up, but I ate it.</span> <span id="s1366">And after I threw it up, I ate another portion.</span> <span id="s1367">That was the end of my religion.</span> <span id="s1368">I never ever--I haven't been to a synagogue except when my two children were bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1369">I got married to Mr. Elfant.</span> <span id="s1370">He's a very good Jew and we went to the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1371">I had such a strange experience when I made my peace with God.</span> <span id="s1372">I said, "I forgive You, God; I wonder if You forgive me?"</span> <span id="s1373">But I really didn't, because I saw people put in the concentration camp in Budapest before they were put in the cattle car.</span> <span id="s1374">They were interned in Budapest waiting their turn.</span> <span id="s1375">I saw many with peyos and beard, little children with their side locks, with their hat, and they were killed.</span> <span id="s1376">Why?</span> <span id="s1377">I don't think that any, any super being who would let that happen.</span> <span id="s1378">We just happened to be here.</span></p> <p><span

Nazi if your life depended on it.</span> <span id="s1382">They are charming.</span> <span id="s1383">I hate the Austrians and I hate the Germans because at least the Germans stood up and said, "I hate the Jews.</span> <span id="s1384">I want to kill them."</span> <span id="s1385">Those Austrians, they loved the Jews!</span> <span id="s1386">They hate the Germans!</span> <span id="s1387">And I saw them in the movie standing in Gardnerstrasse, waving a Nazi flag and being hysterical when the Anschluss came.</span> <span id="s1388">They couldn't tell me that they were not antisemitic.</span> <span id="s1389">It was just a horror and they wouldn't let us work.</span> <span id="s1390">We were refugees.</span> <span id="s1391">We worked on the black market.</span> <span id="s1392">And of all people, we made our money making fur coats for the Russian soldiers.</span> <span id="s1393">That was just--we just lived in one room.</span> <span id="s1394">I washed the diapers for my kid in that room.</span> <span id="s1395">We cooked on an kerosene oven one meal.</span> <span id="s1396">It was always soup meat with the soup, always.</span> <span id="s1397">And then I was working on the black market.</span> <span id="s1398">I sold the textile, handkerchiefs.</span> <span id="s1399">I delivered to the Russian soldiers their fur coats to the Russian headquarters because my husband is a man who can be more liable not to come out.</span> <span id="s1400">It was horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">JF: Did you experience any direct antisemitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">PH: No, it was against the refugees, not against the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">JF: Refugees in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">PH: Because there were also Nazi refugees there who escaped

after the war we had to work for the Russians and that was a bad mark on our--we really didn't have to tell them but we did.</span> <span id="s1411">So there was a point when we were almost ready to go to Australia.</span> <span id="s1412">Then we had a hearing and we cleared ourselves.</span> <span id="s1413">Because we did live under the Russians for two years and they wanted to be very sure.</span> <span id="s1414">I wished they would have been that thorough to screen the Nazis because on the boat we came over, there were plenty of Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">JF: You don't feel that they screened the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">PH: They absolutely did not because I knew by their names, prominent Nazis, they were on the boat, and they made antisemitic
