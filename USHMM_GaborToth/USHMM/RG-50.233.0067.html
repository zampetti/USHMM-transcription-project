id="s4">Abstract Lillian Lazar, née Guzenfiter, was born in Warsaw on June 16, 1924 into a middle class Jewish family.</span> <span id="s5">She was an only child who recalls being pampered.</span> <span id="s6">Her father, Jacob, and grandfather were in the jewelry business.</span> <span id="s7">Her father had been an officer in the Polish army in World War I.</span> <span id="s8">Her mother, Natalia, a housewife, was an intellectual like the rest of her family.</span> <span id="s9">Lillian had dreamed of becoming Poland’s second female district attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Beginning in late 1940, Jews had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s11">She rebelled and did not wear the star occasionally, but was beaten by Polish children.</span> <span id="s12">She and her parents were sent to the small ghetto in Prosta.</span> <span id="s13">Her father got papers as an Aryan, and left the ghetto to make papers for his wife and Lillian to live as Aryans.</span> <span id="s14">Lillian got work at the ghetto’s Tobbens factory that made German military uniforms.</span> <span id="s15">She worked 12 hours daily for one bowl of soup, which she shared with her mother, whom Lillian hid.</span> <span id="s16">Her mother became increasingly weak from starvation and a heart condition.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Her mother, extremely weak, left to search for her husband.</span> <span id="s18">Germans shot her in January 1943.</span> <span id="s19">Most of their family had been taken to the large ghetto, and most died from starvation.</span> <span id="s20">When Germans surrounded the ghetto, her grandfather took only his prayer shawl and prayer book, and told people not to cry.</span> <span id="s21">Lillian’s grandparents, all her cousins, aunt, and mother were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">Just before the ghetto uprising, Lillian saw a German shoot a mother with baby in arms, refuse to “waste a bullet” on a baby, and throw the child who “fell in pieces.”</span> <span id="s23">On May 8, Germans surrounded the factory.</span> <span id="s24">Lillian took scissors to defend herself.</span> <span id="s25">When a German saw the scissors, he hit her with a rifle in the thigh, face, and arms, leaving her unconscious.</span> <span id="s26">She and the remaining few hundred factory workers were sent in cattle cars to Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">She was beaten there twice, once for trying to eat a carrot, and once for trying to eat bread.</span> <span id="s28">She escaped by hiding in a large pipe that was being laid for water or sewage.</span> <span id="s29">She got on a train going to Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna), where she worked making bullets for rifles.</span> <span id="s30">“I guess luck was always behind me watching over me.”</span> <span id="s31">A German soldier sneaked bits of garbage to her, and was sent to the front lines.</span> <span id="s32">She performed sabotage by approving several bushels of bullets that were not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">She gained freedom on January 18, 1945, exactly two years after her mother was shot.</span> <span id="s34">She says that Russians enslaved women they liberated.</span> <span id="s35">They raped one woman and she hanged herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">She married a man she’d known in the ghetto, got pregnant, and went to Italy.</span> <span id="s37">With their baby, they immigrated to Uniontown, PA, which was a “paradise”.</span> <span id="s38">They had a second child but divorced.</span> <span id="s39">Lillian says that she and her second husband are very happy together.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">She is the only survivor among 109 family members.</span> <span id="s41">“You're always thinking of those that perished.”</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Interview 001 Anthony: Today is December 9, 1991.</span> <span id="s43">I am Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Anthony and Lillian Lazar.</span> <span id="s44">I'm here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and I am about to interview Lillian about her experiences during the time of the holocaust.</span> <span id="s45">Lillian, good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Lillian: Good morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Anthony: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">002 Lillian: I was born in Warsaw, Poland, June 16, 1924 into a middle class Jewish family.</span> <span id="s49">My mother's name was Natalia.</span> <span id="s50">They were called Kanaja and my father Jacob.</span> <span id="s51">As far as I remember, we were comfortable, maybe because I was the only child.</span> <span id="s52">That's why I don't remember any discomforts.</span> <span id="s53">My father was in the jewelry business.</span> <span id="s54">My grandfather, my father's father, was also in the jewelry business.</span> <span id="s55">We had a store in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s56">I remember as a little girl of three or four years old going with my mother to the store, bringing my father lunch.</span> <span id="s57">In Poland, there wasn't the same way of living as we have in the United States that you run out to a grocery or to a candy store for a cup of coffee.</span> <span id="s58">So my mother was bringing my father lunch into the store every day and I remember going with her.</span> <span id="s59">The store was quite big.</span> <span id="s60">I still have it in my memory a big iron safe, I don't know why I remember it, where we always put the jewelry for the night and in the morning we're taking it out from the safe and displaying it.</span> <span id="s61">My father was more of a businessman, quite successful.</span> <span id="s62">I don't think I'm prejudiced, but I think quite smart in the business.</span> <span id="s63">Well, my mother's side, my mother's father, my mother were more intellectuals.</span> <span id="s64">Whenever I was going to my grandparents, and it was quite often because I was the only girl in the family, they were always trying to tell me stories, trying to teach me something.</span> <span id="s65">It was never just a day spent there but my grandfather, the minute I came in he knew already, to read me something or tell me a story.</span> <span id="s66">In the meantime, they were feeding me, I was a bad eater.</span> <span id="s67">So always in my memory the stories my grandfather used to tell me.</span> <span id="s68">It was like two sides of the families -- my father's side the business people, my mother's side the intellectuals, with the books and stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Anthony: Did your grandparents live in the same home or did they live in a different house?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">026 Lillian: In the same city, in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Anthony: I mean did they live in the same house as you or did they live separately?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Lillian: Separately, but they were the best sitters.</span> <span id="s73">So whenever my parents wanted to go out in the evening, I didn't mind.</span> <span id="s74">I was going to my grandparents, spending a night, a day, or sometimes two days with my grandparents.</span> <span id="s75">I was the youngest grandchild and the only girl so I was quite pampered.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Anthony: Was your mother a housewife or did she work outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Lillian: A housewife, just helping out in the store sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Anthony: But an intellectual.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Lillian: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Anthony: She read books and… Lillian: Always books as far as I remember.</span> <span id="s81">There were not too many people at that time speaking many languages, but I remember my grandfather.</span> <span id="s82">He spoke good Russian; he spoke German.</span> <span id="s83">My father and my mother spoke French because my father's sisters were in Paris, and they were planning when I grow up to send me to Paris to study and probably they were trying to pull me in to listen to the language, or to speak it.</span> <span id="s84">But just because they were trying so hard, I didn't really want to learn French.</span> <span id="s85">I don't know for what reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Anthony: Which languages were spoken in your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">037 Lillian: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Anthony: Polish.</span> <span id="s89">No Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Lillian: My grandparents spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s91">With me, they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s92">There was always a reason for it.</span> <span id="s93">In school, if you didn't speak a perfect Polish, the children were making fun of you and beating you up because you are a Jew and you don't speak fluent Polish, or with an accent, and because they were intellectuals the way they were so they were trying to speak Polish with me so that my Polish would be perfect and clear and I wouldn't have problems in school later.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Anthony: Did you attend public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">Lillian: I was going to a private kindergarten, and as a matter of fact I met my teacher from the kindergarten.</span> <span id="s96">She's alive and she's in Florida.</span> <span id="s97">Of course, an old woman.</span> <span id="s98">After that private kindergarten, I was going to a public school, what you call here the first school, elementary school.</span> <span id="s99">After six years of schooling in Poland if you want to go to high school, you were automatically transferred to like a junior high that they started at that time.</span> <span id="s100">That was four years of junior high.</span> <span id="s101">If you didn't want to go to high school, then you had to go to school for seven years.</span> <span id="s102">Of course, my mother wouldn't hear of something else but sending her only child to a high school so I went only for six years.</span> <span id="s103">I pretty good and I skipped one year.</span> <span id="s104">That was, I think, thanks to my grandfather with his always helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Anthony: So your schooling came to an end when you were a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">054 Lillian: My official schooling came to an end in 1939 when the war started, when they bombarded Warsaw and when the Germans marched into Warsaw.</span> <span id="s107">That was the end of especially Jewish schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Anthony: So you did attend high school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Lillian: At that time, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Anthony: Was that a Jewish high school or a public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Lillian: It was more on the private side.</span> <span id="s112">But only Jewish children attended.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Anthony: Was there Jewish religious instruction and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Lillian: If we want to attend, we had Jewish instructions.</span> <span id="s115">Who didn't want to attend could walk out from the class and didn't have to attend.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Anthony: Was your home a religious home?</span> <span id="s117">Did you observe the kosher laws?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Lillian: My grandparents, yes.</span> <span id="s119">My parents, no.</span> <span id="s120">But out of respect for their parents, they wouldn’t hurt them, so they conducted more or less a traditional home, not to hurt the parents, but they were not deeply religious people.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Anthony: Did you live in a mixed neighborhood, predominantly Jewish neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">064 Lillian: Mixed.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Anthony: In downtown Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">Lillian: It was *Placka Saski[ph] 115.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Anthony: That's the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">Lillian: It still exists because I went to visit Warsaw a few years ago.</span> <span id="s127">It's there but not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Anthony: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s129">Did you have any experiences with anti-Semitism when you grew up in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s131">That was one of the reasons that I had to speak Polish at home.</span> <span id="s132">In the elementary school, it was all Jewish people so we didn't feel too bad.</span> <span id="s133">But many times, the Aryans were waiting when we were coming out of school and chasing us, beating us up, pushing, kicking.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Anthony: These are children, Polish children?</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Lillian: Polish children what they did to the Jewish children.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Anthony: So they harassed you, they chased you?</span></p> <p><span id="s137">075 Lillian: Yes and called like filthy Jew, other not very pleasant names that I really wouldn't repeat.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Anthony: This is when you were in grade school?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Lillian: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Anthony: Did your parents talk about the anti-Semitism in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Lillian: Not my parents, my grandfather.</span> <span id="s142">He was in a way always telling me stories and trying to prepare me that something might happen, something could happen.</span> <span id="s143">Little stories that I should know what to do, how to react.</span> <span id="s144">But how can you prepare somebody to know how to react if something happens, that I shouldn't be afraid.</span> <span id="s145">He wanted me to be careful, but not grow up to be afraid.</span> <span id="s146">As a matter of fact, when I finished elementary school, I wrote once a letter to (at that time he was like saying here in the United States) the President of Poland.</span> <span id="s147">I wrote letters.</span> <span id="s148">I liked to write.</span> <span id="s149">And I wrote to his wife and two daughters.</span> <span id="s150">His name was Marshal Pilsudski.</span> <span id="s151">He was in command of the army.</span> <span id="s152">He was very good to Jewish people.</span> <span id="s153">As long as he was alive, it wasn't so bad.</span> <span id="s154">After his death, it was getting worse by the minute the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s155">And I wrote to him that I would like to attend high school that was mixed; that were gentiles and a few Jews, just to mix with other people.</span> <span id="s156">Or maybe it was a bigger challenge for me to do it.</span> <span id="s157">I don't really know why.</span> <span id="s158">I wrote that if he could help me I would love to go to a school and the name of that high school was Urszulanli [Ursuline].</span> <span id="s159">Who was from Poland, from Warsaw knows that name.</span> <span id="s160">A lot of government officials send their children to that school and to me it was a challenge that I will go to that school with them together.</span> <span id="s161">I was there for a few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Anthony: So you were admitted to the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">094 Lillian: I was admitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Anthony: And how old were you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Lillian: At that time, 12, 13.</span> <span id="s166">I just started.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Anthony: And he answered your letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">095 Lillian: He answered my letter, and he told me that he called up the school and I should go with the letter and I'll be admitted.</span> <span id="s169">I wrote another letter that I have a very religious grandfather and I wouldn't be able to attend school on Saturday, that's our Sabbath.</span> <span id="s170">And he said not to worry about it.</span> <span id="s171">Again he answered to go to the school with the letter and they'll admit me and excuse me from attending school on Sabbath.</span> <span id="s172">I went to school for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s173">I felt miserable because the whole school probably had five or six Jewish pupils in it.</span> <span id="s174">But right in the middle of a session, they were yelling that we should go on the other side.</span> <span id="s175">The Jews should sit on the left side to make sure that everybody knows who is the Jew and who is the gentile.</span> <span id="s176">It was really the nicest way of getting your education beside being pushed around always, up and down the stairs.</span> <span id="s177">After a few weeks, I decided I wouldn't be able to go on with my schooling to a school like that.</span> <span id="s178">It's silly.</span> <span id="s179">You cannot attend it.</span> <span id="s180">My ambitions or my challenge came true.</span> <span id="s181">I had enough of it, and I went to a Jewish high school.</span> <span id="s182">It was the end of that school that were mixed, the Poles and the Jews together.</span> <span id="s183">By the way, my father was an officer in the Polish army.</span> <span id="s184">That was one of the reasons it was easier for me to attend that school because he was an officer, and I never thought being a daughter of an officer from the Polish army that I'll be treated in school the way I was treated.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Anthony: Did your father know Marshal Pilsudski personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Lillian: Yes, because he was the chief of the military in Poland at that time, and that was from the First World War.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Anthony: Right.</span> <span id="s188">And then President?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Lillian: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Anthony: What did you want to be when you grew up?</span> <span id="s191">Here you are going to school.</span> <span id="s192">You obviously had ambitions to go this top high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">124 Lillian: You wouldn't believe it what I want to be, at that time what I was dreaming of.</span> <span id="s194">I read once a book.</span> <span id="s195">The name of the book of course in Polish was prokurator Alicja Horn.</span> <span id="s196">That means District Attorney, Alicja Horn was her name.</span> <span id="s197">I don't know for what reason.</span> <span id="s198">According to the book, that was the only woman district attorney in Poland, and I said I'll be the second.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Anthony: You wanted to be the second district attorney in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Lillian: I don't know why.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Anthony: And what did you parents think of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Lillian: They wouldn't care less; they would be very pleased with it if those dreams would come true.</span> <span id="s203">And I was telling my children when they were born and old enough to understand that that was my ambition and I would love to see them go to law school.</span> <span id="s204">Of course they didn't.</span> <span id="s205">They have other professions.</span> <span id="s206">But my youngest daughter married a district attorney.</span> <span id="s207">She said you see your wishes will come true eventually.</span> <span id="s208">You didn't go to law school, you didn't become a district attorney but Wayne, that's my son-in-law's name, he went to law school in Houston, Texas.</span> <span id="s209">His first job was an assistant district attorney, a district attorney, now he's a very famous lawyer in Houston, a criminal lawyer.</span> <span id="s210">So my daughter told me that my wishes in a way came true.</span> <span id="s211">It was fulfilled.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Anthony: But not in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Lillian: Not in Poland, and not for myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Anthony: So you planned eventually to go to a university.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">144 Lillian: In Paris because my aunts, my father's sisters, were in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Anthony: The Sorbonne?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s218">So that was the plan.</span> <span id="s219">My father was going twice I think he was in Paris, that I remember.</span> <span id="s220">Once was, I think, in '35 that they had a gathering of all the countries like we had here in the United States the...how do you call it, I forgot already.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Anthony: Something political, economic?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Lillian: No, the exhibitions.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Anthony: Oh, the exhibition, an exposition, okay.</span> <span id="s224">I think it was in 1937.</span> <span id="s225">It would be like a World’s Fair?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Lillian: Something like that.</span> <span id="s227">'35 or '37.</span> <span id="s228">I hardly remember as a little girl.</span> <span id="s229">He was in Paris trying to prepare the ground that eventually [unintelligible] but of course it didn't work out.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Anthony: Did you pay attention to politics when you were growing up, when you were a teenager?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Lillian: Not really.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Anthony: How about someone like Hitler one of your neighbors after 1933?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">159 Lillian: That had already more contact with our personal lives because people from Germany were sent into Poland.</span> <span id="s234">Those were people who were born in Poland and the Germans would not accept them as their citizens.</span> <span id="s235">Even if they were living all their lives in Germany, they were sent back to Poland, without money, without anything, whatever they could carry, a little suitcase with them.</span> <span id="s236">After a short while, there was no housing for them.</span> <span id="s237">In Warsaw, I remember they had kitchens where they were coming, and the Polish Jew was feeding them and giving them clothing, whatever help they could give them.</span> <span id="s238">That's how I started paying attention what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Anthony: So before that you really didn't pay any attention to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Lillian: Not to politics, no.</span> <span id="s241">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Anthony: Going to school and growing up.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Lillian: Growing up, playing, having, if you can say so, a nice life.</span> <span id="s244">Probably because I was the only child, I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Anthony: You were spoiled?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Lillian: Probably.</span> <span id="s247">I don't remember, but probably yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Anthony: Did you have any non-Jewish girlfriends in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">175 Lillian: Yes, one boy that lived in the same house and was exactly the same age.</span> <span id="s250">We were going to school as youngsters, but as we were growing up, the age of ten, he knew already that I'm Jewish and that's something to look down to, and I knew that he's gentile and I'm not going to be treated right by him because he is not Jewish.</span> <span id="s251">It was even hard to explain why.</span> <span id="s252">What was the difference between us?</span> <span id="s253">Here we grew up together, we're the same age, but all of a sudden our ways were in different directions for no reason, no purpose to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Anthony: He was your only non-Jewish friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Lillian: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Anthony: He doesn't sound like he was a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">186 Lillian: We grew up together because we lived in the same house.</span> <span id="s258">You couldn't hold onto non-Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s259">They didn't want to accept the Jewish people as friends.</span> <span id="s260">We had neighbors.</span> <span id="s261">We were talking with them saying hello, how are you, what was going on.</span> <span id="s262">I remember when I used to come to my grandfather, he had quite a few neighbors, non-Jews, they were frankly coming and talking about politics, what is going to happen.</span> <span id="s263">But you didn't feel a closeness between a Jew and a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s264">There was always a looking-down at a dirty Jew.</span> <span id="s265">That's how they called us always, dirty Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Anthony: Did your parents ever think about leaving Poland during the 1930's?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Lillian: Not really leaving, maybe going to Paris because my aunts, my father's sisters were living there.</span> <span id="s268">But to leave Poland and to leave their parents and their families, no.</span> <span id="s269">Maybe for a short time, like for a few years and then come back, but not to leave permanently.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Anthony: Did you notice any changes after Marshal Pilsudski died?</span> <span id="s271">I remember you saying that he was considered a friend of the Jews and yet he died right around this time, I believe 1936 [1935].</span> <span id="s272">Did your parents discuss changes after 1936 when different leaders start… 207 Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s273">You couldn't discuss business freely.</span> <span id="s274">Like for instance years back when I was a little girl you could close the stores on Saturday because it's your Sabbath, and keep them open Sunday as a Jew.</span> <span id="s275">Later on, they wouldn't allow us to do this.</span> <span id="s276">If you want to keep your business open Saturday you can, and even they force you to keep it open so people can shop and Sunday everything had to be closed if you like it or not.</span> <span id="s277">That's what I remember the difference already.</span> <span id="s278">After Marshal Pilsudski died, in the schools we felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">221 The Jewish children were treated different.</span> <span id="s280">Like before, we were not harassed coming out of schools where later on, after his death it was like a free hand.</span> <span id="s281">Do whatever you wanted with the Jews.</span> <span id="s282">So as little as I understood at that time, I knew that there is a difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Anthony: What do you recall doing on September 1, 1939?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">226 Lillian: I was still in the country.</span> <span id="s285">We were usually going in the summer for two months to the country like you go here to the Catskill Mountains or to the seashore.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Anthony: So you weren't in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Lillian: No, not in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s288">They were talking about it and we started packing our things to go right back home.</span> <span id="s289">They thought that fall might come any minute, and I remember my mother was afraid, because my father was an officer in the army, that he might be one of the first to go back to the service.</span> <span id="s290">We left the country, we came back to Warsaw before the first, a day before.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Anthony: The day before the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Lillian: Right.</span> <span id="s293">On the first the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Anthony: So you were in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Lillian: Yes, and I think school was supposed to start within two or three days and of course, after the war started, the first to close were the Jewish public schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Anthony: Now there was a rather fierce battle for Warsaw in September 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">244 Lillian: It took probably a month when we saw the Germans marching into Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Anthony: Was your father ever called up in the Polish army?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">Lillian: Before the Germans even came in to Warsaw, all the young men started leaving Warsaw.</span> <span id="s300">They were afraid that they would be called into the army and the Germans are right behind them and we heard already that they were catching up with the Polish army and some they are taking as prisoners and some they are killing.</span> <span id="s301">And I asked who are they killing?</span> <span id="s302">Of course, the Jew.</span> <span id="s303">So who from the Jewish population was in the army was killed right away.</span> <span id="s304">Most of the young Jewish men including the officers were trying to leave Warsaw so they wouldn't be called into the army because of that purpose they knew already from other places that that's what they were doing with the people that they were catching in the uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Anthony: But your father remained.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">264 Lillian: No, he left for a few weeks, and then he came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Anthony: But not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Lillian: Not in the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Anthony: What changes did you notice after the war came to an end and the Germans occupied Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">268 Lillian: For Poland, the war came to an end very fast, after a month or six weeks Poland was occupied, the Germans came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Anthony: Were you surprised, or was your father surprised, that the war ended so quickly and so disastrously, or was it expected?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Lillian: We were talking politics more with my grandparents, and I still remember my grandfather telling us Germans are bad, they'll hit you or they'll kill you from the back, but don't think that the Russians are much better.</span> <span id="s313">They'll hit you in the front, facing you, and the Germans will be behind you, but one is as bad as the other.</span> <span id="s314">He hated the commies and he hated the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Anthony: And he didn't expect the Poles to win?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">283 Lillian: He didn't expect the Poles to win or to help us as Jews, altogether.</span> <span id="s317">As I mentioned before, my mother's side was the intellectuals.</span> <span id="s318">The schools of course right away they close all the Jewish schools.</span> <span id="s319">Some schools on the Aryan side were functioning, they were open, but no Jew had arrived to go to school.</span> <span id="s320">But my mother and other people like her would try very hard.</span> <span id="s321">They hired the teachers from those schools with the pupils and we had private lessons, not to miss out on time.</span> <span id="s322">They were so gullible probably, and they believed that another few months, another few months everything will come back to normal so we shouldn't lose time and we should be tutored privately so we can attend school after the war is over and everything comes back to normal.</span> <span id="s323">Each time, the lessons were in another friend's house.</span> <span id="s324">We were altogether about eight or nine kids with one teacher and that one teacher was teaching us a little of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Anthony: Were there other changes with the German occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">302 Lillian: Plenty.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Anthony: Could you describe some of them and how they affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Lillian: No food.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Anthony: No food.</span> <span id="s330">That's a major change.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Lillian: That's one of the major changes.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Anthony: You weren't planning on going on a diet then, were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">310 Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s334">I was always a bad eater, so I had no problems with diets.</span> <span id="s335">The Aryans we suppose somehow they could buy food and in the stores was more available for them; where in the Jewish neighborhoods there was nothing available.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Anthony: How about your father's store?</span> <span id="s337">Were there any changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">313 Lillian: The store was closed of course.</span> <span id="s339">Nobody would buy any jewelry at that time.</span> <span id="s340">I remember he brought a suitcase of the most valuable things from the store and he distributed everything equally to each one of the closest family.</span> <span id="s341">That means my grandmother, my mother, myself, my grandfather, each one of us had a few things always on them in an emergency, to have something if we need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Anthony: So you had jewelry in 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Lillian: I had jewelry.</span> <span id="s344">I grew up with jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Anthony: Did you encounter any German soldiers in the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">324 Lillian: As I found out later like our store was taken over by Poles and the Germans were there because when my father was trying to go into the store quite a few months later in 1940 already everything was taken over.</span> <span id="s347">They were almost trying to kill... How dare could you even come and inquire about your store.</span> <span id="s348">You're supposed to come and give everything to the German people yourself.</span> <span id="s349">The Germans gave out orders that whatever the Jewish families have -- even radios -- everything has to be brought to the police, and the Germans probably took it from the police.</span> <span id="s350">All silver, gold, all jewelry, even fur coats, radios, everything had to be brought into the precinct and the Germans took it away.</span> <span id="s351">So what we had on us, the few things were hidden, and nobody knew about it, but it was in case of an emergency or something that we have something to save us from death.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Anthony: So you kept your jewelry?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">348 Lillian: Not too much.</span> <span id="s354">Just enough for insurance.</span> <span id="s355">For one diamond ring, you could get one loaf of bread if you're lucky, if somebody wants to take that ring from you because there was no food so the gold had no value.</span> <span id="s356">You could buy nothing for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Anthony: What kinds of things did you have to give up that personally belonged to you?</span> <span id="s358">Did you have to give up coats?</span> <span id="s359">Did you have a radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Lillian: We had a radio.</span> <span id="s361">We had to give it up.</span> <span id="s362">My mother had a fur coat, my grandfather, my grandmother, my father had a fur coat.</span> <span id="s363">In Europe, men were wearing fur coats that they were lined with fur in the winter because the winters were very strong, very cold winters and men were wearing winter coats lined with fur.</span> <span id="s364">So everything, right away, was taken away.</span> <span id="s365">My personal jewelry as a young kid, a teenager, of course right away I had to give it back.</span> <span id="s366">Everybody knew what I was wearing so they were expecting us to give it back.</span> <span id="s367">But still from the store we had a few things on us.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Anthony: At any point were you forced to wear any identifying badges?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">370 Lillian: That was later in the end of '40 when the Germans settled down already in Poland.</span> <span id="s370">Then we had to wear the yellow star.</span> <span id="s371">I was, of course, one of the rebels.</span> <span id="s372">I didn't like the idea of wearing it, and here and there, I was beaten up by Polish youngsters, so I had to wear it already because otherwise it was a matter of life and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Anthony: Occasionally you wouldn't wear the yellow star… Lillian: Occasionally, if I could, I would walk without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Anthony: But the Polish children would beat you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Lillian: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Anthony: The Germans didn't know you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Lillian: They couldn't tell a Jew from a non-Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Anthony: How did the Polish children know you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s379">They knew you personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">384 Lillian: They knew from the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s381">I don't know how.</span> <span id="s382">They had a better way of recognizing us or sometimes just plain trying to get something out of that person so that if the guess is right if they are Jewish they would give them whatever they had on them, some money or food or jewelry or whatever they could get hold of.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Anthony: Sounds like extortion to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Lillian: Like blackmailing.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Anthony: Occasionally, it's been said that Poles very often, non-Jewish Poles could tell who was Jewish by the way they spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s386">My understanding is that you grew up learning how to speak Polish without any kind of accent.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">397 Lillian: Right.</span> <span id="s388">But there was another way.</span> <span id="s389">A Jewish person when you saw a Pole, you were walking a little faster.</span> <span id="s390">You were looking around you a little different because you were always scared.</span> <span id="s391">Somehow they found out or they were guessing many times.</span> <span id="s392">We had no documents, no papers as Poles.</span> <span id="s393">If they approached and they asked you are a Jew, yes?</span> <span id="s394">If you say no, show me your papers.</span> <span id="s395">If you don't have any identification that you are a Pole, a gentile, then you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s396">So that's how they knew.</span> <span id="s397">We didn't have papers, I suppose.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Anthony: And these were Poles that would stop you?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Lillian: They were Poles, neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Anthony: Germans had never at that point....</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Lillian: Not from the beginning.</span> <span id="s402">Germans were walking with Poles to help them identify a Jew.</span> <span id="s403">Like when they need a Jew for work, it wasn't the German that found out who was the Jew.</span> <span id="s404">It was the Pole that pointed out, oh that must be a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Anthony: Now when was the ghetto established in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">417 Lillian: It started in '41.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Anthony: Do you recall the time of the year?</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Lillian: I think it was in the fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Anthony: This was after you had to wear the yellow star?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s411">They were trying to push the Jewish population more to one section and the Poles, the Aryans on the other side, the other sections.</span> <span id="s412">The ghetto was closed in '42.</span> <span id="s413">They were pushing in more and more and more, and in the meantime, don't forget, that so many were being taken away.</span> <span id="s414">The Germans were surrounding two or three blocks, catching the people that were there.</span> <span id="s415">If they were Jewish they would put them on a truck and right away to Umschlagplatz and from Umschlagplatz, the trains were taking them to different concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Anthony: Did you know of anyone who was taken away during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">438 Lillian: A lot of our friends.</span> <span id="s418">A lot of our relatives.</span> <span id="s419">In' 42 my grandparents, all my cousins, my aunt, my mother was killed but that was when she was trying.</span> <span id="s420">...I have to go back to the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Anthony: Yes.</span> <span id="s422">We're still getting into the ghetto now.</span> <span id="s423">The Germans...</span></p> <p><span id="s424">445 Lillian: There were two ghettos in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s425">There was one big ghetto where there were more factories working for the Germans, and there was a small ghetto where there was one factory Tobbens factory.</span> <span id="s426">That was the small ghetto on Prosta.</span> <span id="s427">The Jewish people had to live in one of those two ghettos.</span> <span id="s428">Between the small ghetto and the big ghetto was a little bridge-like going from one to the other on Leszno.</span> <span id="s429">We had to leave our homes, everything we had there, only what we could carry that was very little, find a place and move into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Anthony: Which ghetto were you moved into?</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Lillian: Part of my family was in the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s432">I was in the little ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Anthony: With your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Lillian: With my parents from the beginning.</span> <span id="s435">Later on my father left.</span> <span id="s436">He got some papers as a Pole, as an Aryan and he left to the Aryan side with an understanding that he'll make papers for us and later on we'll be able to go out from the ghetto and live as Aryans.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Anthony: Do you have any idea how he got these papers?</span> <span id="s438">Was there an underground active?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Lillian: There was an underground, yes, that was trying to help people that didn't look Jewish and trying to give them some papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Anthony: Were these Jews or non-Jews that were helping?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">480 Lillian: Jews and non-Jews together.</span> <span id="s442">Now, to get into a factory, you couldn't live in the ghetto doing nothing.</span> <span id="s443">Not that there was too much to do, but you didn't have any papers.</span> <span id="s444">If a German would catch you in the ghetto, the first thing is who are you and where are your papers?</span> <span id="s445">If you could identify with a factory that works for the Germans, or that you are in any contact or you have a connection with somebody that does work for the Germans, then you got your papers and you could get into the factory or whatever and have the right to live in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s446">If you didn't have the working papers, you had no right to live altogether.</span> <span id="s447">In other words, if a German would catch you, you went on the track and they took you right away to Umschlagplatz, from Umschlagplatz to Treblinka, that was the gas chambers where they were gassed and killed.</span> <span id="s448">I had the luck since I was the youngest in the family.</span> <span id="s449">My grandparents and my parents decided to get a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s450">With a sewing machine, you could get into a factory where they were making uniforms for the German soldiers.</span> <span id="s451">They felt since I was the youngest in the family...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Anthony: Now you're working in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Lillian: I had to be in the line with the sewing machine for two days.</span> <span id="s454">That's how big the lines were to get in.</span> <span id="s455">They looked me over to figure out if I'm strong enough or young enough, whatever, because many people they turned away.</span> <span id="s456">Maybe they were too old, whatever, I don't know the reason.</span> <span id="s457">They accepted me, and I was officially a worker in the Tobbens shop.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Anthony: Were these Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Lillian: Tobbens yes.</span> <span id="s460">Germans, making uniforms for the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">516 Anthony: Private sector or were they army?</span> <span id="s462">The people who were running the factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Lillian: Those were private people making uniforms for the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Anthony: Were you paid?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">518 Lillian: No, of course not.</span> <span id="s466">No pay at all.</span> <span id="s467">Once a day they gave us a little soup.</span> <span id="s468">That was during working hours but we worked 12 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Anthony: So your reward was the working papers and the ration card?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Lillian: I had a paper that I'm working in that factory.</span> <span id="s471">At that time, I was alone already and living across the street from that factory because the ghetto was getting smaller and smaller, and at the time they accepted me in the Tobbens factory it was closing already.</span> <span id="s472">So we couldn't move freely from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s473">They gave us like a family of four or five people sometimes in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Anthony: Was the factory in the ghetto or outside the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">526 Lillian: In the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Anthony: You were in the small ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Lillian: In the small ghetto, in the factory working.</span> <span id="s478">The big ghetto that was connected with the small one through a little bridge called Chlodna, they had other factories like in one they were making brushes, combs, other things probably also for the army's supplies.</span> <span id="s479">There was a hospital in the big ghetto for whoever got sick.</span> <span id="s480">Very few people came out of that hospital.</span> <span id="s481">Who went in, I don't know, probably they were killed or they didn't survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Anthony: Who were the doctors in the hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">534 Lillian: Jewish.</span> <span id="s484">All Jewish, nurses and Jewish doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Anthony: Were there any Germans in the ghetto at any time?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Lillian: Only when they were surrounding a few blocks and trying to catch people without papers.</span> <span id="s487">They said that they are relocating them to other working places.</span> <span id="s488">What they actually did straight to Umschlagplatz from Umschlagplatz there were the cattle trains that were going straight to Treblinka, Majdanek, or other places.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Anthony: You didn't know they were going to Treblinka.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">539 Lillian: At that time, we were not sure of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">Anthony: Where did you think they were going?</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Lillian: Probably to other places to work like I was working in one factory, maybe they were going someplace else where they need people more to work in another factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Anthony: Did you know they were going in cattle cars?</span> <span id="s494">Did you ever see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">542 Lillian: This we knew.</span> <span id="s496">People started escaping from the carriages.</span> <span id="s497">That's how we found out where they were taking them and how it looked.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Anthony: So eventually you began to realize… Lillian: Putting two and two together, we realized from people that were escaping from Treblinka and were escaping from the cattle trains because they were holding them in the trains for days sometimes.</span> <span id="s499">They were pushing into one cattle train a hundred people.</span> <span id="s500">It was one on top of the other standing.</span> <span id="s501">There was no air.</span> <span id="s502">The train was closed, and even the little window there that was supposed to be open was also closed so the air didn't come in at all and people were just dying in the cattle trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Anthony: Do you recall when you first realized that these cattle cars were going to such terrible places and the people were dying on these relocation trips?</span></p> <p><span id="s504">554 Lillian: That was not too long after I started working.</span> <span id="s505">Like I said, my mother's sister, my grandparents, cousins, they were all in the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s506">I was the only one in the little ghetto with my mother.</span> <span id="s507">My father went out of the ghetto to the Aryan side to make some papers for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Anthony: Who were you living with?</span> <span id="s509">Were you living with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Lillian: With my mother in one small little room.</span> <span id="s511">In that room was only one bed and a tiny little table.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Anthony: You didn't have to share it with others, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">561 Lillian: That was one apartment.</span> <span id="s514">And that apartment had probably seven or eight rooms so each room had another family.</span> <span id="s515">And somebody escaped and came over and told us what happened.</span> <span id="s516">My mother didn't work, didn't have any working papers.</span> <span id="s517">I was hiding her during the day.</span> <span id="s518">I was going into the factory.</span> <span id="s519">And that little soup they gave us in the factory was shared with my mother when I came back.</span> <span id="s520">There was no food to be gotten and the jewelry, whatever we had was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Anthony: So you were getting food because you were working in the factory, and you were the only source of food that your mother had.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">569 Lillian: Right.</span> <span id="s523">My mother became sick from not eating, from being sick, whatever.</span> <span id="s524">I found out from one of the doctors that lived in the same vicinity that she had a heart condition.</span> <span id="s525">She was getting weaker and weaker by the day.</span> <span id="s526">I remember one day I didn't know anymore where to hide her and I was leaving the room to go to work and an idea came to my mind to go down to the basement.</span> <span id="s527">We had from feathers, pillows, and I opened the pillows, and my mother was sitting there.</span> <span id="s528">I covered her with the feathers.</span> <span id="s529">The Germans wouldn't go near something that was dirty, so I knew that when they see the feathers they wouldn't go into that basement, the Germans I mean, being afraid that they would get dirty from it and they probably would leave it alone, and that's what exactly happened.</span> <span id="s530">Always everybody was being taken out from that building where we were living except my mother and maybe another two or three people.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Anthony: Do you recall when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s533">That was the end of '42 or the early beginning of '43.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Anthony: In the middle of winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">587 Lillian: January.</span> <span id="s536">There was no heat.</span> <span id="s537">There was no electricity.</span> <span id="s538">Water was sometimes cut off, too, so the people who were living in the ghetto wouldn't have almost nothing, no electricity, no water, except they couldn't cut off the gas pipes and somehow some buildings had the gas pipes.</span> <span id="s539">That was the light at night.</span> <span id="s540">I opened the pipe and lit a match and the little flame that came out from the pipe because we didn't have gas stoves or anything.</span> <span id="s541">Don't forget it's Europe.</span> <span id="s542">In '43 there was no descendant of living quarters that it was here.</span> <span id="s543">I don't know, the United States had stoves, probably yes, but we didn't.</span> <span id="s544">That was the light and the heat, the little flame that came out from that pipe and that pipe was connected once to another pipe, who knows.</span> <span id="s545">That was the heat and the light for the room.</span> <span id="s546">Cooking, we had nothing to cook and no place to cook.</span> <span id="s547">Forget cooking.</span> <span id="s548">Whatever I brought from that factory when I was working there, a slice of bread and that little soup, that's what we had.</span> <span id="s549">Once in a blue moon, when I could exchange clothes or sheets or linens or whatever we had left yet in that little room, for a piece of bread or a potato if we could get it.</span> <span id="s550">That's all we had, so I was actually the supporter of the whole household, that was my mother and myself.</span> <span id="s551">My cousins, aunts, uncles, my mother's sister that was in the big ghetto they didn't have much more.</span> <span id="s552">So it wasn't like go to somebody else, maybe they'll feed you.</span> <span id="s553">Nobody had.</span> <span id="s554">People were dying.</span> <span id="s555">You were walking over dead bodies in the ghetto like you walk over a piece of paper here.</span> <span id="s556">It was nothing.</span> <span id="s557">You were surrounded with dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">Anthony: Did anyone die in your building?</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Lillian: All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Anthony: No one you knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">612 Lillian: My grandmother from hunger, my other relatives.</span> <span id="s562">My grandfather, he was such a beautiful good-looking man.</span> <span id="s563">I remember when they surrounded the buildings, the Germans, and they took him out of the building -- my aunt was telling us how it happened.</span> <span id="s564">He put on his slippers.</span> <span id="s565">He said he doesn't even need shoes like he was sure where he was going.</span> <span id="s566">That that's the end.</span> <span id="s567">He only took his prayer shawl with him and a prayer book and he told everybody not to cry that probably he'll see us in a different place.</span> <span id="s568">Like the way he sounded like he knew where he's going, that that's the end.</span> <span id="s569">He doesn't need nothing, just the prayer shawl.</span> <span id="s570">You know that the Jewish people pray with a special shawl, a special garment that they put on them and a prayer book and that was a good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Anthony: Were you able to say good-bye to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">626 Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s573">I wasn't there.</span> <span id="s574">My aunt saw him.</span> <span id="s575">As I mentioned before, my mother was getting more sick by the day, swollen from not eating.</span> <span id="s576">I couldn't get in touch with my father.</span> <span id="s577">I didn't know if he was alive or not.</span> <span id="s578">He couldn't get in touch with us or probably he wasn't alive either, who knows.</span> <span id="s579">The whole family that was with us in the ghetto was gone except my aunt, my mother's sister was still alive and one of her sons that was living in the same building with her in the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s580">I asked the doctor what to do with my mother.</span> <span id="s581">She's so sick I couldn't even move her out of bed anymore.</span> <span id="s582">She had a heart condition.</span> <span id="s583">So he said that if she would be able to get into the hospital for a few days they would help her a lot and she would be able to come back and be all right again.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">641 I got in touch with my aunt because my mother suggested that she wanted to get in touch with her, go into the hospital for a few days to get medical help.</span> <span id="s585">There was no other way of getting any medical help.</span> <span id="s586">There was no medicine except in the hospitals.</span> <span id="s587">They had a little something.</span> <span id="s588">And then my mother said that she'll go out on the Aryan side to look for my father who got out.</span> <span id="s589">We can't survive here any longer.</span> <span id="s590">There was no way of transportation to go from one place to another.</span> <span id="s591">They had rickshaw -- a little like a bicycle with in front two seats and that's how one was driving that bicycle taking you from one place to another.</span> <span id="s592">So I put my mother in that rickshaw that she wouldn't have to walk to go across on that little bridge that was connecting the small ghetto with the big ghetto and the next day trying to get in touch with my aunt to call her if my mother's there, should I come too if she's going to the hospital or what she decided.</span> <span id="s593">If she wants to go to see my father to look for him or where she's staying and I found out that my mother was shot crossing the bridge by Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Anthony: Trying to go from the small ghetto to the big ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">658 Lillian: Right.</span> <span id="s596">My aunt was waiting for her, her sister, in the big ghetto and they were trying to figure out what to do, how to get medication or go across to the Aryan side.</span> <span id="s597">When she heard that my mother was shot she got a heart attack and on the spot died together with her sister.</span> <span id="s598">So I was left all alone with nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Anthony: Was your mother alone when she was shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Lillian: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Anthony: No reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s602">665 Lillian: No reason whatsoever.</span> <span id="s603">The German just decided with the rifle whoever was at that time, at that moment on that little passage was killed.</span> <span id="s604">And my mother was just one of them.</span> <span id="s605">That was January 18, 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Anthony: How did you find out about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">670 Lillian: The next day when I was trying to get in touch with my aunt if my mother arrived, if they're going across to the Aryan side or if she can get some medication or if she has to go into the hospital or if I should come over.</span> <span id="s608">I found out that my aunt is dead.</span> <span id="s609">Her son answered that she's dead.</span> <span id="s610">She got a heart attack when she saw what was happening to my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Anthony: So your cousin told you.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s613">And by the way, my cousin a few weeks later was killed by a German thought he was hiding in a bunker.</span> <span id="s614">The Germans came.</span> <span id="s615">They took everybody out of that bunker.</span> <span id="s616">That was during the uprising already in April and they killed him too.</span> <span id="s617">I was left all alone in the ghetto, a teenager, 15, 16 years old.</span> <span id="s618">But my 15 was like now 10 or 8.</span> <span id="s619">I was always sheltered.</span> <span id="s620">I was the only child.</span> <span id="s621">I never had to work.</span> <span id="s622">I never had to take care of myself.</span> <span id="s623">I didn't even know how to prepare anything.</span> <span id="s624">So it's not like a mature 15, 16 year old now but it's like an eight-, ten-year-old child.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Anthony: By now you had learned how to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Lillian: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Anthony: So you were working in the factory - 687 Lillian: I was working there.</span> <span id="s628">I remember I put on a button nobody could button it.</span> <span id="s629">I didn't know how to sew.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Anthony: So you did a bad job?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">689 Lillian: I did a bad job so I got a slap or a smack.</span> <span id="s632">They hit me, and then somebody else was trying to put on the next button to show me how to do it the next time, and I learned little by little.</span> <span id="s633">Not to be a professional.</span> <span id="s634">Then they gave me another job to pin the things with pins -- the clothing that had to go under the machine.</span> <span id="s635">Because I didn't know how to sew, so I would be better with the pins putting two pieces of fabric like together with a few pins and somebody else did the sewing so I was doing that for a while, and I was better at pinning it.</span> <span id="s636">That was already the end of winter 43 and we heard that something is going on in the big ghetto, and people are starting to rebel.</span> <span id="s637">They know what's going on.</span> <span id="s638">We didn't believe it.</span> <span id="s639">We couldn't believe the horrors that we heard, that it's impossible.</span> <span id="s640">Why would they do this to innocent people?</span> <span id="s641">They would just kill and take them to gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Anthony: The rumors were of gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">703 Lillian: The rumors were there because people were escaping and coming back but nobody could really believe in it.</span> <span id="s644">It's impossible.</span> <span id="s645">The stories were so terrible.</span> <span id="s646">One day, it was after walking in the street in the big ghetto, I was trying to get in touch with my cousin he was still alive at that time and again they were surrounding four or five blocks cutting off from the rest and whoever was there without any papers that is working someplace or belonging someplace they were putting them on the trucks and straight into the cattle trains.</span> <span id="s647">And I see the Germans screaming and killing people, and that I'll never forget I guess for as long as I'll live.</span> <span id="s648">In the street, a mother was running with a baby and he killed the mother.</span> <span id="s649">She was willingly going to the truck to be taken away but evidently she wasn't running fast enough or whatever.</span> <span id="s650">He killed her.</span> <span id="s651">She fell down and the little baby was there next to her crawling and crying.</span> <span id="s652">And another German was standing next to him, he was pointing at the baby, to kill the baby and he said something in German that for a baby you're not wasting a bullet.</span> <span id="s653">He took the baby [Mrs. Lazar was in tears] by a leg, threw it in the air and showed the other German that's what you do with babies, you're not wasting bullets on them.</span> <span id="s654">I was with a small group of people that had working papers that we're working in that factory so we had to stay there and wait and watch them.</span> <span id="s655">We couldn't even put our heads down.</span> <span id="s656">We had to keep our heads up and look.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Anthony: These were SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Lillian: SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Anthony: And then came the rebellion.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">741 Lillian: I don't think you can ever get it out of your mind.</span> <span id="s661">But I don't talk about it.</span> <span id="s662">It's dead, buried in your subconscious mind but when you start remembering and talking about it, it comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Anthony: This is the first time you saw somebody killed right in front of your eyes.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">Lillian: Yeah, and I had to look at it.</span> <span id="s665">I heard shots.</span> <span id="s666">I saw people falling down, being killed.</span> <span id="s667">But I never saw anybody taking a baby by a leg throwing it in the air and the baby fell in pieces.</span> <span id="s668">I left the ghetto at that time and went back to the little ghetto to go to work.</span> <span id="s669">That was June.</span> <span id="s670">Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Anthony: So you were ready for the rebellion?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">755 Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s673">The rumors were what they were doing in the gas chambers and in the showers and I witnessed it myself already and was telling others what I saw.</span> <span id="s674">And as we were putting two and two together, we were making sure in our minds that that's actually what was going on.</span> <span id="s675">Who was next.</span> <span id="s676">That's the handful of people that is left in that factory.</span> <span id="s677">It was a few hundred of us.</span> <span id="s678">That was all that was left and those are mostly teenagers, the ages between 13, 14 up to 20, 21, 22.</span> <span id="s679">The younger ones that looked older and were very developed, somehow the Germans accepted them more as the healthy element to work because they were young and well-developed.</span> <span id="s680">None of the older people above 35 were accepted by Germans as working element.</span> <span id="s681">So we were a few hundred left in our factory thinking of what to do.</span> <span id="s682">After dark, we couldn't work anymore.</span> <span id="s683">We had to be in our rooms.</span> <span id="s684">There was no food.</span> <span id="s685">People were lying in the streets crossing over dead bodies.</span> <span id="s686">It was an every day incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">770 In the beginning of April, we had the big ghetto getting ready for an uprising.</span> <span id="s688">We knew that something is going on, but there's nothing to fight with.</span> <span id="s689">There was no ammunition, nothing.</span> <span id="s690">How can we ever defend ourselves if we have nothing to fight with to defend ourselves.</span> <span id="s691">We said that whatever they'll decide to do, they should let us know that we want to be part of it, the little ghetto with the big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">786 April, I think, the 19th, I got up in the morning, and I saw flames from the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s693">You could see the flames were there.</span> <span id="s694">Something was going on there.</span> <span id="s695">And, as we later found out, the big ghetto was trying to defend themselves, and wouldn't let the Germans in.</span> <span id="s696">Probably it took them five or six weeks.</span> <span id="s697">They wouldn't let the Germans in through the ghetto gates.</span> <span id="s698">Fighting with whatever they had.</span> <span id="s699">What we had there was no ammunition at all.</span> <span id="s700">Throwing bottles or handmade ammunition, whatever they could get for the little they had to offer, money or jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">802 There was very little help from the outside.</span> <span id="s702">The underground was working somehow together with the Jewish people, but really not helping.</span> <span id="s703">I don't know if they didn't have the money or didn't have the power to help, but they didn't give us anything to protect ourselves.</span> <span id="s704">After six weeks or so of fighting, the big ghetto was in ruins.</span> <span id="s705">Everything was burning down.</span> <span id="s706">The Germans couldn't get into the buildings.</span> <span id="s707">The people were fighting, throwing hand-made bombs, so they were afraid to approach a building.</span> <span id="s708">What they did was try to burn one after the other, and they felt that the fire would burn the Jews alive and somehow make a way for them to come in.</span> <span id="s709">It was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s710">We felt good when we heard that the Germans are actually afraid of that handful of Jews to go into the ghetto.</span> <span id="s711">But it was the truth.</span> <span id="s712">They did not go into the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">822 The beginning of May, when the big ghetto was almost finished, we heard there are still a few people hiding someplace in the bunkers.</span> <span id="s714">The bunkers were places that they built for themselves in a cellar someplace or in a corner wherever they could cover it up that nobody knew that a place exists there.</span> <span id="s715">There was room enough in a bunker for somebody to sit or to stand stiff without moving or to lay down without being able to sit down, just like you make room for a coffin to put in.</span> <span id="s716">Even those bunkers the Germans found and killed whoever they got hold of and in one of them was my cousin that he was killed too one of those bunkers.</span> <span id="s717">It was the last one of my family that was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">840 So now I'm the only one.</span> <span id="s719">Not even any friends from my school that I went together with were alive.</span> <span id="s720">They were all transported to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s721">So according to our knowledge, there was nobody left in the big ghetto, just a few bunkers maybe if the people could survive.</span> <span id="s722">How could they survive without food and without water?</span> <span id="s723">What the Germans did at the minute they cut the gas pipes so they would be poisoned by the gas whether could survive someplace or not in a basement.</span> <span id="s724">So the gas finished them, and then they were throwing in whatever was flammable so the gas exploded.</span> <span id="s725">So the fire was spreading from one building to the other.</span> <span id="s726">On the eighth of May, that's another date that I don't know why because we were living without a calendar, but I remember for the rest of my life -- the Germans came to our factory.</span> <span id="s727">We were like the last ones already a few hundred people that was left.</span> <span id="s728">They surrounded the factory.</span> <span id="s729">We didn't even go home anymore to sleep like we were working constantly, being afraid to leave the place.</span> <span id="s730">The factory, if we leave, would be caught in the street and sent out right away to the concentration camps or gas chambers or wherever they sent at that moment.</span> <span id="s731">So we were actually staying and working continuously.</span> <span id="s732">They told us to leave everything and come out from the factory in a big courtyard that was next to it.</span> <span id="s733">The rumor spread from one to the other -- don't go, defend yourself just like they did in the big ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">873 How can you defend yourself if we have nothing to defend ourselves with?</span> <span id="s735">I was working at that time by the uniforms and somehow I see a pair of big scissors on the table.</span> <span id="s736">I grabbed the scissors thinking of it -- I had to defend myself with what.</span> <span id="s737">I found the scissors.</span> <span id="s738">I'll defend myself with the scissors.</span> <span id="s739">We'll fight.</span> <span id="s740">We're not going.</span> <span id="s741">And in the meantime, the Germans start yelling that we should come out fast, come out to that courtyard.</span> <span id="s742">And I'm going with the rest -- not going but you're being pushed actually out with the scissors and the German sees me walking with the scissors he comes over.</span> <span id="s743">What is this?</span> <span id="s744">I didn't know what to answer, before I had a chance even to answer, with the rifle he started hitting me.</span> <span id="s745">He hit me here and I have a big scar here on my thigh.</span> <span id="s746">Then he hit me in the face.</span> <span id="s747">Here is the scar.</span> <span id="s748">And I covered my face and the blood was running.</span> <span id="s749">So here I had a third scar.</span> <span id="s750">He hit me.</span> <span id="s751">He almost broke my arms, or maybe he broke, I don't know.</span> <span id="s752">And that's when I lost consciousness.</span> <span id="s753">The blood was running, probably they wiped off, whoever was next to me wiped off the blood from me.</span> <span id="s754">I don't remember how I arrived in Majdanek.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Anthony: So your girlfriends picked you up and took you.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">894 Lillian: They dragged me just into the train, however they took us, into Majdanek.</span> <span id="s757">Because the whole lot whatever was still alive went to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s758">I woke up actually in the cattle train when it stopped in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s759">I came to, and one of my friends that was next to me told me to cover my arm and to cover my leg so they wouldn't see the scars.</span> <span id="s760">In the meantime, the face was bleeding.</span> <span id="s761">They washed me up.</span> <span id="s762">And I came out from those cattle trains.</span> <span id="s763">I think I was there probably 24 hours because they came in the morning and they took us out.</span> <span id="s764">I was unconscious, they said, the whole night, so it must have been the next day when I woke up still in the cattle train.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Anthony: This would be May 9th you were in the cattle train?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">911 Lillian: But probably 24 hours because they said I was the whole night unconscious and they gave up already.</span> <span id="s767">They thought that I'm dying but somehow I survived.</span> <span id="s768">There was still a selection.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Anthony: This is after you get out of the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Lillian: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Anthony: Your face had been cleaned and you covered your arms when you were in the car?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">916 Lillian: They told me to put the cloth over my arm and my leg and my arm was covered.</span> <span id="s773">And I said, but what will I do with my face.</span> <span id="s774">It's a big scar there all cut up.</span> <span id="s775">Hold it with your hand so nobody will see it.</span> <span id="s776">And I was holding it and that's how I passed.</span> <span id="s777">We went in, we washed up luckily they were going left and right and left and right and I was the one that had the showers not with gas but with water.</span> <span id="s778">We survived.</span> <span id="s779">We washed up.</span> <span id="s780">They gave us clothes.</span> <span id="s781">The clothes were spitefully.</span> <span id="s782">For a small person, they gave big clothes.</span> <span id="s783">For the big ones, they gave very small clothes so nobody could put nothing on to look like a human being.</span> <span id="s784">They looked like a circus.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Anthony: Clowns.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">932 Lillian: Clowns.</span> <span id="s787">Luckily I was small, so I got a big garment and I could tear pieces to make bandages out of.</span> <span id="s788">So that's how I was the lucky one.</span> <span id="s789">There was no medication of course for a Jew.</span> <span id="s790">There was the Red Cross but they didn't help us.</span> <span id="s791">They would give medication for the Poles, for the gentiles.</span> <span id="s792">Majdanek had political prisoners.</span> <span id="s793">They had Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s794">They had gypsies.</span> <span id="s795">They had communists.</span> <span id="s796">The Red Cross was helping everybody except the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Anthony: So the Red Cross was at Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">945 Lillian: Yes but not the Jews.</span> <span id="s799">The Jews they didn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Anthony: What kind of help did they give these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">947 Lillian: They cleaned them up if they were cut up with something and they let them go.</span> <span id="s802">They wouldn't keep them there.</span> <span id="s803">There was a hospital, but nobody wanted to go into that hospital because whoever went in wouldn't come out alive, but at least it was the first aid.</span> <span id="s804">I was getting infected from the wounds that I had.</span> <span id="s805">I remember friends, older people that were in the same group with us, they told me that maybe the only thing that is good to keep it clean because there was no medication to get leaves and cover the wounds with leaves.</span> <span id="s806">Maybe this will help.</span> <span id="s807">I was still running a fever from time to time which means I wouldn't be able to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Anthony: What kind of work were you doing there?</span></p> <p><span id="s809">962 Lillian: In Majdanek, there was no work.</span> <span id="s810">We were carrying stones from one place to the other like one day carrying it one place and the next day bring them back.</span> <span id="s811">The stones were heavy -- even for three people would be too heavy to carry or push that little wagon that we had and here one had to do it.</span> <span id="s812">Sometimes here and there one or two were lucky that were picked to work in the kitchen or segregate the clothes like shoes, glasses, coat, silver.</span> <span id="s813">They separate piles out of it.</span> <span id="s814">It was at least a little easier work than to carry the stones, and many of us among clothing or pictures their own friends or relatives because it was the same time that we came and their belongings we had to segregate.</span> <span id="s815">We didn't know it that time, but later on we figured out how come if my cousin or my aunt left a month earlier and here I'm finding something that I recognize belonged to somebody, relatives or friends.</span> <span id="s816">That's what they did.</span> <span id="s817">They're not alive anymore.</span> <span id="s818">So we knew already for sure what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Anthony: Did you discover any clothing or items of people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s820">989 Lillian: I discovered pictures, but you couldn't hold on to them.</span> <span id="s821">You couldn't keep nothing.</span> <span id="s822">You were beaten up right away.</span> <span id="s823">These are photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Anthony: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">993 Lillian: Photos of relatives or friends from the same time approximately that they were making the segregations, and we knew that they were supposed to take them to another place of work, but then we figured out that was the working place where they killed them in the gas chambers because they're not here anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Anthony: When did you suspect there were gas chambers at Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">000 Lillian: The smell was terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Anthony: So, immediately?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">002 Lillian: After a few days.</span> <span id="s830">Men were working and cleaning up the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s831">There were five divisions.</span> <span id="s832">Four were for men and the fifth was the women.</span> <span id="s833">And somehow, as we were going from one place to the other to work or something, we exchanged ideas or notes.</span> <span id="s834">Oh, do you know what happened to this and this one, or did you see that one or you heard what's going on now?</span> <span id="s835">Now the ovens are on.</span> <span id="s836">Don't think that they're cooking there a meal for you.</span> <span id="s837">Those are your relatives and those are my relatives.</span> <span id="s838">I was working there.</span> <span id="s839">I know what's going on.</span> <span id="s840">Like here and there sentences that we started realizing what's going on.</span> <span id="s841">Usually, they wouldn't let people work there more than a few days.</span> <span id="s842">They were killed on the spot or exchanged like to another part of Majdanek for another work.</span> <span id="s843">Those that were stopped from one work and sent to another could exchange ideas or whatever gossip was going around.</span> <span id="s844">That's how we found out, one from the other.</span> <span id="s845">Like let's say if I was working selecting the clothes, and another group of men was passing by, and you could whisper something.</span> <span id="s846">You know, I was working with clothes and I found this and this clothes.</span> <span id="s847">Is she alive someplace?</span> <span id="s848">So they were laughing yeah she's alive in the crematoriums because I come from there.</span> <span id="s849">I was working there four days and they all gassing them in the showers.</span> <span id="s850">Instead of the showers, the gas comes out, they're gassing them and sometimes they're half alive and they're putting them straight into the ovens.</span> <span id="s851">That's how we're finding out, by exchanging the gossips and the news that we had from each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Anthony: Could you see the gas chambers and the ovens from where you were staying.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Lillian: Yes.</span> <span id="s854">They had very high big chimneys and you could see the smoke coming out.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">Anthony: Where were your living quarters like at Majdanek?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">045 Lillian: It was one huge room with to explain to you for people that didn't see it like bunk beds.</span> <span id="s857">One on top of the other but here you have two bunk beds one on top of the other.</span> <span id="s858">We had three.</span> <span id="s859">On each bed were three or four people.</span> <span id="s860">On one side two and on the other side two.</span> <span id="s861">You couldn't turn.</span> <span id="s862">When you had already your bunk bed and you're lucky as we came in those bunk beds were occupied and we were sitting on a stone floor or standing and to sit down everybody had to be willing to sit down because we were so tight together as a group that one couldn't sit down by himself or by herself.</span> <span id="s863">You would be stepped on or squashed to nothing.</span> <span id="s864">So everybody had to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s865">If you sit down and then you want to turn around, everybody had to turn around.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">Tape II, Side A Anthony: So we were describing the big room - 500, 600 women.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">001 Lillian: No water, no toilet facilities nothing in the room, just a stone floor.</span> <span id="s868">One big barrel that's supposed to be the toilet for everybody.</span> <span id="s869">During the day you could go out to the outhouses that they had, but the minute it got dark, you were not allowed to leave that barrack, whatever they called it.</span> <span id="s870">Of course, that one barrel that was put by the door in that room was not enough for 5, 600 women so it was always overflowing, the smell was unbearable.</span> <span id="s871">Cold, it was winter, early winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Anthony: So you were there from May 1943 through the winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">012 Lillian: Through the summer, starts the fall.</span> <span id="s874">Months I don't know.</span> <span id="s875">Nobody had a calendar.</span> <span id="s876">I just know when they came to take us out of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s877">That was the last day of the ghetto uprising.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Anthony: Then it was warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">015 Lillian: It was May the eighth 43.</span> <span id="s880">One day we had some news that they put in some pipes.</span> <span id="s881">They were supposed to be water pipes or sewer pipes, we didn't even know.</span> <span id="s882">We were carrying it from one place to another.</span> <span id="s883">As we were walking there, the women, we got one idea.</span> <span id="s884">The pipes are big, maybe we can hide, and on the right time, maybe we would be able to escape some place.</span> <span id="s885">There was a group of us that we decided there is nothing that we can lose.</span> <span id="s886">Another few weeks without food.</span> <span id="s887">Getting up when it's dark, so it's dark, so probably it was three or four o'clock in the morning.</span> <span id="s888">It was dark, yet when they woke us up to stay on an appeal that we are counted every single day the same for hours till a German SS man or SS woman came to count us, and sometimes you were standing there and we had to stay stiff like for three, four, five, six hours, rain or shine.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">030 They didn't give us too much even of food, a little colored water we called it that was to wash up and to drink and to eat.</span> <span id="s890">That was the breakfast.</span> <span id="s891">A little cup of that water, whatever it was, I don't know.</span> <span id="s892">At lunchtime, it was some sweet soup made out of who knows what but the taste of it was sweet.</span> <span id="s893">Later on during the day, one slice of bread that was as heavy as stones, it wasn't even made out of flour.</span> <span id="s894">I don't know what it was made of, dark and terribly heavy.</span> <span id="s895">The gossip was going on later on that some of the soups were cooked with human bodies.</span> <span id="s896">So we knew that we cannot survive much longer under those circumstances, being beaten up every day for no reason.</span> <span id="s897">I was beaten up once.</span> <span id="s898">I was taken to clean up a little garden for a German that was in front of her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Anthony: Her house?</span></p> <p><span id="s900">044 Lillian: Her house.</span> <span id="s901">An SS woman.</span> <span id="s902">With another few women.</span> <span id="s903">And as I was cleaning, I saw carrots growing there.</span> <span id="s904">I was so terribly hungry, not eating for days when I saw the carrot.</span> <span id="s905">Of course, I grabbed the carrot and put it in my mouth.</span> <span id="s906">The SS woman probably saw it.</span> <span id="s907">She was riding a horse.</span> <span id="s908">On the horse, she came to me and started screaming and beating me up.</span> <span id="s909">I should spit out what I had.</span> <span id="s910">She saw me swallowing the carrot.</span> <span id="s911">So I was beaten up till I was half unconscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Anthony: How did she beat you?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">052 Lillian: With a whip.</span> <span id="s914">With a whip from the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Anthony: Is this the woman whose house it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s916">053 Lillian: I don't know if it was her house or not, but she was on a horse riding around and she must have seen me eating that carrot.</span> <span id="s917">Another time I was beaten up I had in my mouth that last piece of jewelry, a little diamond, a tiny little diamond, a ring with a diamond and I was keeping it in my mouth when I was afraid that somebody would see it on me and that piece of jewelry I exchanged for a slice of bread.</span> <span id="s918">In Majdanek, the Poles were coming there to work too, in the kitchens, in the offices.</span> <span id="s919">I don't know what kind of work they did, but not the same work that we did, Jewish people.</span> <span id="s920">And one gave me a slice of bread for that diamond ring.</span> <span id="s921">You couldn't save it for later because you wouldn't have it anymore.</span> <span id="s922">There was no place to hide or to save.</span> <span id="s923">So as I got that slice of bread, I put it in my mouth and one of the Germans must have seen me eating it and also ran over what I'm doing there.</span> <span id="s924">I said nothing.</span> <span id="s925">What you have in your mouth?</span> <span id="s926">So I'm trying to swallow it as fast as I could but they saw me swallowing it, and I was beaten up again.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Anthony: By the German guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">070 Lillian: By the German guard.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Anthony: And these guards at Majdanek, they're all Germans or did you notice whether they were… 071 Lillian: They were a few so-called Volksdeutsche.</span> <span id="s930">Those were Germans that they claim that they were born in Germany or they come from German parents or they were born in Germany living in Poland something like this.</span> <span id="s931">So they were working there too.</span> <span id="s932">So we knew that we could not survive there, and we knew already what was going on.</span> <span id="s933">And that group, those few young girls, we said that one night when it's raining and that they're not going to count how many of us are still alive or whatever, that maybe we hide in one of those pipes and we can escape some place.</span> <span id="s934">One night came, a very dark raining night, and we were hiding in the pipes.</span> <span id="s935">A few heard the Germans yelling, screaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">089 They were counting or they were trying to tell the people to get in line to go back to the barracks, and one of them came out from a pipe was shot, killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s937">Another two were killed a little bit later.</span> <span id="s938">I was still hiding in one pipe with one other girl.</span> <span id="s939">It was already very dark and quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Anthony: This was the next night.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">093 Lillian: That was at night, the middle of the night probably or the next night.</span> <span id="s942">We decided it's safe to look out, maybe the Germans aren't around.</span> <span id="s943">Around Majdanek farther up where the homes of the Germans that were watching the camp, there was no place to escape.</span> <span id="s944">We realized that later.</span> <span id="s945">Without clothes and without proper papers, we could go nowhere.</span> <span id="s946">As we were walking, we found the railroad station and again a transport going to a camp to Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna).</span> <span id="s947">They were there being counted and standing and again standing and being counted.</span> <span id="s948">We got into that transport when nobody looked around pretending that we are one of them.</span> <span id="s949">We asked where they're going.</span> <span id="s950">They said that they are going to a factory for work.</span> <span id="s951">They needed some workers and they picked them to go there to work and we were one of them.</span> <span id="s952">At that point, at that time we didn't know if we are the lucky ones to go to another working place or to another concentration camp and be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Anthony: And you had no idea where this place was?</span></p> <p><span id="s954">109 Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s955">But there was no way out to escape anyhow.</span> <span id="s956">So what difference is where we go if we'll be killed today or the next day doesn't matter anymore.</span> <span id="s957">We knew that is coming any minute.</span> <span id="s958">As it came out we went to a munitions factory Skarzysko (Skarzysko Kamienna) where they were making the ammunition for, the part I was in, for rifles.</span> <span id="s959">I guess luck was always behind me watching over me.</span> <span id="s960">The part that I was assigned to work was the last step almost where they put the bullet on a scale.</span> <span id="s961">If the bullet reaches a certain size and a certain weight if it’s okay then it goes one place and if it's not, then it goes another and then it goes into the boxes and being packed.</span> <span id="s962">So that was like the last step of packing the bullets.</span> <span id="s963">We had to work with white gloves because the finger marks on the bullets would damage the weight of the bullets.</span> <span id="s964">And I was working there.</span> <span id="s965">Again we had one big room with the bunk beds sleeping like herring one next to another.</span> <span id="s966">Food was a little better than in Majdanek but not too much more.</span> <span id="s967">We were working around the clock, sometimes night shifts, sometimes day.</span> <span id="s968">The rumors were going around if we can do something to damage the bullets would be very helpful for us.</span> <span id="s969">That was from the underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Anthony: So the underground had contacts in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s971">134 Lillian: Here and there, yes.</span> <span id="s972">Some Poles were coming into work too, in the same factory so they were spreading the rumors and telling us.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Anthony: Were you all women again in this factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Lillian: Yes Anthony: Were they Jewish or were they non-Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">137 Lillian: Jewish.</span> <span id="s976">The supervisors were only the Poles, gentiles.</span> <span id="s977">But the workers were all Jewish.</span> <span id="s978">Sometimes men were coming like when the bullets were packed already in the boxes to take outside into the trucks, the boxes.</span> <span id="s979">Sometimes men were coming to take it, transporting from one place to the other.</span> <span id="s980">But where I was in that place were only women.</span> <span id="s981">They called that part Werk [Factory] A.</span> <span id="s982">There was a Werk B and C. Werk C people were getting yellow from the powder they were using for the bullets and dying like flies.</span> <span id="s983">Nobody survived too long on that Werk C they called it.</span> <span id="s984">Werk A and Werk B people survived longer.</span> <span id="s985">The powder, the gasses, whatever they used, were not as dangerous for the body as the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">152 Once I had a lucky incident with one of the Germans.</span> <span id="s987">I guess it’s worth to mention it that here and there maybe that there were some human beings.</span> <span id="s988">I was working as I said before with white gloves, you couldn’t touch the ammunition any other way, just in gloves, and I hurt my finger in the machine and all of a sudden I see the gloves are getting red from blood.</span> <span id="s989">I must have hurt it badly.</span> <span id="s990">A German passes by.</span> <span id="s991">He sees me and he says in German, wait, don’t do nothing.</span> <span id="s992">He comes back in a few minutes.</span> <span id="s993">He gave me another pair of clean gloves to put on and at first he tells me to put them on that nobody should see it.</span> <span id="s994">In the meantime, I stopped the blood from my finger, put on the other gloves and went to work.</span> <span id="s995">If another German would see it I would be killed on the spot.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Anthony: Was this a soldier or SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">164 Lillian: A soldier, not SS.</span> <span id="s998">A few days later he passed by and he was pretending like he dropped something like he would throw a bag with garbage towards my side.</span> <span id="s999">Then he passed away already and I picked up the bag.</span> <span id="s1000">I saw that it was maybe one bite of a piece of bread and one bite maybe of a cucumber or something like that.</span> <span id="s1001">Instead of throwing it in the garbage, he threw it in my direction that I could have it.</span> <span id="s1002">Even that one bite was worth more than a million dollars.</span> <span id="s1003">We had no food so that one bite had to be enough for I don't know how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Anthony: He could tell that you were quite skinny, hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">176 Lillian: Terribly hungry.</span> <span id="s1006">We were eating potato peels, whatever we could get hold of.</span> <span id="s1007">After a few weeks, the same German soldier, as he was dropping the bag with the garbage that I'm sure he wouldn't eat this, that instead of throwing it in the garbage he threw it under my machine.</span> <span id="s1008">He told me that he has a daughter back home, and I remind him of her.</span> <span id="s1009">His daughter must look like I do now, the same age probably, and looked like me.</span> <span id="s1010">A short time later, we find out that he was sent to the front lines because he was too friendly.</span> <span id="s1011">Because I started to cry what happened I don't see him anymore.</span> <span id="s1012">And that's what the men that were working in the office, cleaning the offices whatever, they told us that the SS man they saw that he was talking to me and to others probably too and he heard the gossip that they sent him straight to the front lines because of his friendship with the workers and I never saw him again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">196 I was trying to do something to spoil the bullets that they wouldn't be able to use it, the Germans.</span> <span id="s1014">And once as they were coming out from the machine after being checked if they could or not and we could tell when they were not the right size, whatever, that they're not good that we shouldn't okay that bushel of bullets.</span> <span id="s1015">They were coming into the machine in bushels and packed.</span> <span id="s1016">And I was pretending I didn't see it.</span> <span id="s1017">They were all ruined.</span> <span id="s1018">Quite a few bushels went through.</span> <span id="s1019">I okayed them, that they are okay, pretending that I don't know that they are spoiled.</span> <span id="s1020">And that was my satisfaction that I let through bad ones that they wouldn't be able to use them to fight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Anthony: These were bullets that had less gunpowder in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">200 Lillian: The weight of it wasn't right so that means they wouldn't explode or something.</span> <span id="s1023">That's what we were told by the underground.</span> <span id="s1024">The gossip was going around, if we could do something to do it.</span> <span id="s1025">Then one day, the gossip comes the Russians are not far behind.</span> <span id="s1026">That they heard that the camps would be evacuated again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Anthony: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s1029">No calendar, no dates.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Anthony: Summer, winter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Lillian: Not very cold.</span> <span id="s1032">It must have been fall.</span> <span id="s1033">And we were sent to another city, Czestochowa where they were also doing the same thing, just another part of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Anthony: In the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Lillian: Away from the Russian border, more to the south.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Anthony: Another munitions factory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Lillian: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Anthony: You're still with that girl.</span> <span id="s1039">Remember you were with the girl in that pipe?</span> <span id="s1040">Were you still together at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">225 Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s1042">She went one way, I went another.</span> <span id="s1043">I don't know what happened to her.</span> <span id="s1044">I saw the people that are going as a group being sent someplace and I forget.</span> <span id="s1045">There is no other way of surviving, of escaping anyhow, if I'll die here or if I'll die in the cattle train or if I'll die in another place wherever they send us is just the same.</span> <span id="s1046">I'll take my chances of going with that group.</span> <span id="s1047">And that's how I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Anthony: But I mean did you separate at the rifle munitions factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">Lillian: No, No before.</span> <span id="s1050">I didn't see her with my transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Anthony: So she didn't go with your transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">233 Lillian: No, but I know that she went some other place.</span> <span id="s1053">She wasn't killed.</span> <span id="s1054">Now we are in Czestachowa, in that other ammunition factory.</span> <span id="s1055">The work was more or less the same, working around the clock.</span> <span id="s1056">Food, very little.</span> <span id="s1057">Sometimes in the garbage you could find a cigarette that a German was throwing away and that one drop could go among five, six or seven to take one puff.</span> <span id="s1058">That was a substitute for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Anthony: Otherwise you had never smoked before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">243 Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s1061">You had to be one of the very lucky ones if you could share one cigarette among five or six or ten people.</span> <span id="s1062">One puff.</span> <span id="s1063">That had to satisfy your hunger.</span> <span id="s1064">Many times when somebody died overnight, we were keeping him on the bunk bed on the bridge for another day or two till the body started smelling already so we could get an extra portion of soup or bread for him, pretending that she's alive and we’re taking that portion for all of us, or taking her name that we're taking that portion.</span> <span id="s1065">That's how we changed names by the hour, by the day just to get an extra slice of bread or something so you could stay in the line, let's say twice, if they didn't recognize you.</span> <span id="s1066">Once as yourself; the next time as the person that was dead.</span> <span id="s1067">But we were sharing it among ourselves.</span> <span id="s1068">But usually there were groups of five, six, and whatever extra food we could get, one was helping the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">259 And it became already standard like if somebody dies, till the Germans come and smell it already miles away and know that somebody is dead, that body was lying there, and we had an extra slice of bread for it.</span> <span id="s1070">We were working there under conditions -- they are not human, because even a dog you don't treat that way.</span> <span id="s1071">I don't know how you could ever survive to get that far, if it was luck or if it was meant to be.</span> <span id="s1072">I know that among ourselves we were always talking that probably we are the only ones that survived that it's impossible that there is somebody else, another group or another factory or another place of Jews that survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">277 That we must be the only ones and the lucky ones so in a way we have to survive to tell what happened, where is the rest.</span> <span id="s1074">And that's what kept us going.</span> <span id="s1075">When we heard the rumors again that the Russians are in back coming very fast towards our direction.</span> <span id="s1076">The Germans surrounded all the people from the factory, the workers, men and women and started a march towards the woods.</span> <span id="s1077">Later, quite a while later, we found out that most of them were killed in the woods, they didn't even get to the railroad.</span> <span id="s1078">I was working in that last stage of packing the bullets, so I was left to the last minute to put everything in boxes that's supposed to be transferred to another place or to the front, we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s1079">That was just a few hundred people.</span> <span id="s1080">Those that were packing the boxes, packing the documents, packing the bullets in the boxes.</span> <span id="s1081">All of a sudden it was night, a night shift.</span> <span id="s1082">And we're looking around we want to ask for something, what to do or where to put it away and we see there are less and less Germans around.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">296 Finally, we don't see any of them and we don't know where to go and look for them and we look at each other.</span> <span id="s1084">What's going on?</span> <span id="s1085">No Germans.</span> <span id="s1086">We look into the office, no Germans.</span> <span id="s1087">What happened?</span> <span id="s1088">That night the Russians were really coming.</span> <span id="s1089">They were so close, all the Germans as fast as they could they escaped and they left that handful of people to pack the bullets.</span> <span id="s1090">They couldn't do nothing to them.</span> <span id="s1091">They didn't have the time to destroy them or destroy the factory so they ran away, changing into civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1092">When we were looking what to do next when we finished with our work, we realized that nobody's around.</span> <span id="s1093">And we start walking.</span> <span id="s1094">We would take advantage of it.</span> <span id="s1095">Nobody's around.</span> <span id="s1096">We walk straight to the gate and we see fire.</span> <span id="s1097">Again they put the places, the living quarters and part of the factory on fire.</span> <span id="s1098">We couldn't go back and we couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1099">Out was where the train was, the railroad where they were packing the bullets.</span> <span id="s1100">We couldn't get to the trains because they put everything on fire when they escaped.</span> <span id="s1101">And we couldn't get back to our barracks because on the other side that was fire and we're standing in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Anthony: With gunfire, with bullets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">318 Lillian: With nothing.</span> <span id="s1104">The bullets are in the boxes.</span> <span id="s1105">What can we do?</span> <span id="s1106">We didn't have the rifles.</span> <span id="s1107">We couldn't do nothing.</span> <span id="s1108">Just a bullet without the rifle you can do nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Anthony: You realized that the flames if they reached the bullets that everything would go up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">322 Lillian: That's the end of us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1111">And a very large group of people marched out already of the camps.</span> <span id="s1112">They were taking them into the woods, we didn't know where.</span> <span id="s1113">The Germans were telling us that they're taking them to another place of work.</span> <span id="s1114">But later on we found out that they were killed on the way to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s1115">And we see nobody' s around, no Germans, so we start walking.</span> <span id="s1116">Somebody said that they broke a little opening not a gate but it was a fence.</span> <span id="s1117">The place was fenced in and there is an opening someplace that we could get out not to be burned alive.</span> <span id="s1118">We're all pushing toward that opening and we start walking.</span> <span id="s1119">We walk and walk and walk and then we see one of the buildings that must have been occupied by Germans.</span> <span id="s1120">We walk in, dark, no light, no electricity.</span> <span id="s1121">Instead of going up, I don't know how we wound up going down to a basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">340 We walk into that basement terribly hungry and thirsty and there's absolutely nothing to eat and nothing to drink.</span> <span id="s1123">One starts screaming she found a bottle and there's some liquid in it, some fluid.</span> <span id="s1124">Probably it was a basement where the Germans had like a wine cellar.</span> <span id="s1125">The Germans were hiding wine there.</span> <span id="s1126">We were so terribly thirsty.</span> <span id="s1127">That was one of the German tricks.</span> <span id="s1128">They gave us sometimes salty food without water.</span> <span id="s1129">So we started taking each one a sip from that bottle, whatever it is, as long as it's some fluid to drink.</span> <span id="s1130">And of course we were drunk, sick.</span> <span id="s1131">Half of us was left dead.</span> <span id="s1132">They died actually from the liquor or whatever they could get hold of.</span> <span id="s1133">Then we found honey.</span> <span id="s1134">So we had a little of that honey.</span> <span id="s1135">I think we were standing there for two days in that basement.</span> <span id="s1136">A group of women.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Anthony: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Lillian: In ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Anthony: Do you remember the month?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Lillian: Beginning, January.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">Anthony: January, still winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">360 Lillian: Still winter.</span> <span id="s1143">After two days it's very quiet.</span> <span id="s1144">We don't hear anymore.</span> <span id="s1145">The fire probably was out because we looked out.</span> <span id="s1146">It was early in the morning.</span> <span id="s1147">How long can we stay here?</span> <span id="s1148">There were a few dead already in the cellar from drinking and eating that honey, whatever?</span> <span id="s1149">How long are we going to stay there in that cellar?</span> <span id="s1150">And as we're coming out somebody approached us from the underground, a Pole, gentile.</span> <span id="s1151">And he said he's from the underground, go back, stay there for another few hours till I'll tell you it's safe to come out and he was telling us that the Russians liberated the area and they're here already.</span> <span id="s1152">We're actually free but that it's not very safe to be in the area, the bullets are still flying.</span> <span id="s1153">He'll come back and he'll tell us when it's safe to come out.</span> <span id="s1154">I think it was the following day that he came and he said now it's safe that you can come out from that basement and he brought us some bread and water and I remember I asked him, he was a young fellow, "What day is it?"</span> <span id="s1155">It was January 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">382 It was the same day two years later that I lost my mother.</span> <span id="s1157">I lost my mother January 18.</span> <span id="s1158">My mother was shot in 1943.</span> <span id="s1159">January 18, 45, approximately the same time I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1160">What came to my mind right away like my mother gave her life so I can live and survive.</span> <span id="s1161">Probably it was a coincidence that the same time the same day two years later I was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Anthony: You realized it that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Lillian: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1164">And I asked what day is it?</span> <span id="s1165">He said January 18.</span> <span id="s1166">So we must have been liberated the seventeenth.</span> <span id="s1167">I don't know.</span> <span id="s1168">Who knows the time when we were standing there in that cellar.</span> <span id="s1169">But that was the time I was liberated, January 18, when my mother was killed trying to go to the other side, to the big ghetto.</span> <span id="s1170">Now if you think that the liberation was a picnic for us, that starts another story with the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Anthony: This was an underground man, a Polish.</span> <span id="s1172">Do you recall which army he was in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">401 Lillian: No, civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s1174">No army.</span> <span id="s1175">He was just probably a nice human being that brought us bread and water and whoever came out survived.</span> <span id="s1176">And he said go into the city.</span> <span id="s1177">In the city were a lot of Germans living wherever you find an empty apartment or an empty place go in and stay there.</span> <span id="s1178">Don't walk around in the streets it's not very safe.</span> <span id="s1179">Whatever place you find after a German, you can stay there and live there for a while.</span> <span id="s1180">The Russian army will come into the city; they'll take care of you.</span> <span id="s1181">We came into the city and as we're walking, we're trying to get water and that's where we met the Polish people and each one of them said the same.</span> <span id="s1182">So many of us still alive?</span> <span id="s1183">We thought you were all killed.</span> <span id="s1184">Who needs you?</span> <span id="s1185">What for so many.</span> <span id="s1186">Like we should go back and be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">422 That was our welcome after all that hell that we went through.</span> <span id="s1188">We found an apartment in Czestochowa where that factory was.</span> <span id="s1189">There was no food.</span> <span id="s1190">We went out to look for food.</span> <span id="s1191">We couldn't find nothing.</span> <span id="s1192">We found one bakery.</span> <span id="s1193">They were baking bread.</span> <span id="s1194">We took hot bread that they gave us, the bakers.</span> <span id="s1195">Some started eating right away that hot bread and they got sick from it.</span> <span id="s1196">Many of them died.</span> <span id="s1197">I never liked hot bread.</span> <span id="s1198">I didn't eat it.</span> <span id="s1199">As you saw me, I made hot the bagels for you people, I didn't eat it.</span> <span id="s1200">Maybe that was a miracle that I survive.</span> <span id="s1201">If I would take that hot bread maybe I would die because a lot of the girls died from the hot bread, too.</span> <span id="s1202">Their stomachs couldn't accept or whatever it was they got sick from.</span> <span id="s1203">So I took that bread home, ate later, and I was okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Anthony: Cold bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">441 Lillian: Cold, not hot.</span> <span id="s1206">The Russians gave us like coupons that we're supposed to come everyday and get food from the army.</span> <span id="s1207">But they were not a bowl of cherries to swallow.</span> <span id="s1208">They felt that each one that they liberated they owned that woman.</span> <span id="s1209">And that woman or that girl was supposed to be their slave or go to bed with them.</span> <span id="s1210">As a matter of fact, they raped one of the girls and she hanged herself.</span> <span id="s1211">She couldn't accept the fact that after what she went through a Russian soldier will rape her and then what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Anthony: This was the liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Lillian: That was the liberation.</span> <span id="s1214">So we were not too long in that city, Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s1215">That's supposed to be a holy city, they call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Anthony: The Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Lillian: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Anthony: Yes, the Black Madonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Lillian: So you know the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Anthony: Yes, the savior of Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">460 Lillian: Right.</span> <span id="s1222">That was maybe the savior of Poland but not the savior of the Jews.</span> <span id="s1223">And not the savior of humanity either.</span> <span id="s1224">The memories were too bad and we couldn't stay there any longer.</span> <span id="s1225">Besides, there was no food.</span> <span id="s1226">We couldn't turn to the Russians.</span> <span id="s1227">They wouldn't give us nothing.</span> <span id="s1228">Where we heard on the American side or on the English side they fed the survivors like human beings.</span> <span id="s1229">Here, the Russians felt that we are their slaves and we're supposed to in return sleep with each one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Anthony: So what are you going to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">471 Lillian: We went to another city.</span> <span id="s1232">We couldn't go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1233">There was no Warsaw left.</span> <span id="s1234">Not even enough to stay overnight.</span> <span id="s1235">Everything was in ruins so we went to Lodz, Litzmannstadt that's in German.</span> <span id="s1236">That was a bigger city and more places to stay and somehow the Jewish population from all around from the smaller places came into the big cities.</span> <span id="s1237">They felt more security or more friendly people.</span> <span id="s1238">We liked it better.</span> <span id="s1239">So we stayed in the big city and the rumors were that we found out later that was true that the Poles were killing the Jews after the liberation just like the Germans were killing them during the war, the pogroms.</span> <span id="s1240">It was one big one Radom and Kielce, all the smaller cities, even in the big cities.</span> <span id="s1241">Poles it was the Armia Krajowa.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Anthony: Yeah, the Home Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Lillian: The Home Army.</span> <span id="s1244">You understand Polish already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Anthony: AK 495 Lillian: AK and they were the biggest anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s1246">So they were killing.</span> <span id="s1247">Again how long can you stay there?</span> <span id="s1248">Is that what I survived for to be killed now by my so-called friends?</span> <span id="s1249">I'm supposed to be a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s1250">I am a Polish citizen.</span> <span id="s1251">My father was an officer in the army, and again now they're going to kill me.</span> <span id="s1252">Why?</span> <span id="s1253">Just because I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s1254">Nobody could even tell us apart, the Jew and the non-Jew.</span> <span id="s1255">We were going to school together, playing together, living together next to each other.</span> <span id="s1256">Why are they killing us?</span> <span id="s1257">Some couldn't even say why.</span> <span id="s1258">Like when we asked why are you hitting us?</span> <span id="s1259">They were coming in the middle of the night into the apartments where they knew that a group of Jewish people lived and killing them one after the other.</span> <span id="s1260">Why are you doing it?</span> <span id="s1261">Because you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s1262">That's enough to be killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">515 At that time, I met somebody during my staying in the factory that we got very friendly and we were so-called couple.</span> <span id="s1264">You couldn't call it a marriage because there wasn't a marriage like you see today, you go the Justice of the Peace and you sign up it's a marriage.</span> <span id="s1265">There was no rabbi or priest or anybody to marry you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Anthony: So you had a boyfriend in the factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Lillian: Yeah, so whoever knew how to say it, whatever, that’s how they pronounced them husband and wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Anthony: And when did you tie the knot so to speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">530 Lillian: Right after the war.</span> <span id="s1270">All we were thinking of is that we are so terribly lonely.</span> <span id="s1271">We're all alone, no family, that we have to start another family just not to be all alone.</span> <span id="s1272">The couples were not even couples that had something in common.</span> <span id="s1273">It was just couples not to be alone, not to wait for that knock on the door that the Russians would come and rape you, or the Poles will come and kill you.</span> <span id="s1274">As long as you're more than one, you're safer.</span> <span id="s1275">So that's how marriages started.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Anthony: To not be alone in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Lillian: Not to be all alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Anthony: When did you first meet this boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Lillian: In the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Anthony: Which camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Lillian: That was before we even got into the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Anthony: In Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Lillian: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Anthony: From the ghetto then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Lillian: Yeah, and here and there we were meeting and we got together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Anthony: And he was Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Lillian: Yeah, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Anthony: So there you are 1945, married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">532 Lillian: Married, and of course the first thing that came to his mind is start a new family.</span> <span id="s1290">I was against it.</span> <span id="s1291">I was still afraid of the killing and the shooting and the pogroms what was going on.</span> <span id="s1292">When I found out I'm pregnant there were two ways.</span> <span id="s1293">I leave Poland immediately or I get rid of the pregnancy.</span> <span id="s1294">But I wouldn't give birth where my whole family perished, and where the grounds are soaked with Jewish blood.</span> <span id="s1295">And that's where I start a new life now.</span> <span id="s1296">And that's how we left Poland and wound up in Italy where I gave birth to my first child.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Anthony: So your child was born an Italian citizen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Lillian: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Anthony: Male or female?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Lillian: Female.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Anthony: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Tape II, Side B 571 Lillian: I named her Isabella.</span> <span id="s1303">It's an Italian name.</span> <span id="s1304">When we came to the United States, they were calling her Isa and from Isa came Liz because Isa is not an American name, and from Liz we changed officially the name to Liz as Elizabeth and that's how she wound up to be Elizabeth because everybody was calling her already Liz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">[Tape II, Side B is blank from here onward] Anthony: Elizabeth, born in Italy in December 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Lillian: December 22.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Anthony: So you didn't waste much time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Lillian: No.</span> <span id="s1309">We didn't believe it that we can start even a new family.</span> <span id="s1310">It was one of the miracles that happened.</span> <span id="s1311">After what we went through, no food, and the circumstances we're surviving.</span> <span id="s1312">It was really a miracle how we could create a new family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Anthony: So your family, your entire family was Elizabeth and your husband, and his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Lillian: Edward.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Anthony: And how did you get to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Lillian: I was thinking at that time of going to Israel but I was torn away from the group three times.</span> <span id="s1317">Once it was in my eighth month.</span> <span id="s1318">They said that it's too dangerous for me to go.</span> <span id="s1319">I should wait till the baby is born.</span> <span id="s1320">When the baby is born, maybe I'll get legal papers and go with the baby.</span> <span id="s1321">I was waiting when the baby was born.</span> <span id="s1322">When the baby was six weeks old, I came the second time to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1323">They said the baby is too small.</span> <span id="s1324">They don't have room for small babies.</span> <span id="s1325">I should wait till the baby is older.</span> <span id="s1326">How long am I supposed to wait now?</span> <span id="s1327">At least till the baby is three months old.</span> <span id="s1328">I was waiting.</span> <span id="s1329">When the baby was three months old, I came the third time.</span> <span id="s1330">They didn't have room for me.</span> <span id="s1331">They don't want to take the risk of sending women and babies when there is no peaceful time and they cannot give me legal papers to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1332">So I said if three times they're turning me back, that means that it's not meant to be and I'm not going anymore.</span> <span id="s1333">At that time in one of those DP camps they were signing up people who want to go the United States.</span> <span id="s1334">We signed up, and we said we want to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s1335">In a few years later we came to the United States to a small town in Pennsylvania, Uniontown.</span> <span id="s1336">It's not far from Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1337">It's farther north.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Anthony: And it was much better than anything… Lillian: It was paradise.</span> <span id="s1339">If there is a paradise, that was our paradise.</span> <span id="s1340">Like the saying if there is a Santa Claus and if there is a paradise after the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1341">Italy was the small paradise and that was the big paradise.</span> <span id="s1342">And here I had my second child.</span> <span id="s1343">My marriage didn't work out.</span> <span id="s1344">Like I said those were not marriages because we had something in common as a couple, just not to be alone, to have whoever you have just as long as it's two, not one and start another family.</span> <span id="s1345">That was the end of that marriage.</span> <span id="s1346">But I always had in mind one thing.</span> <span id="s1347">Knowledge is something that you never lose in your life and I have to make sure what I couldn't reach, my children would.</span> <span id="s1348">So I pushed them as much as I could.</span> <span id="s1349">I actually brainwashed them.</span> <span id="s1350">That without knowledge, without finishing they would be nobodies.</span> <span id="s1351">And if you're a nobody, you cannot survive.</span> <span id="s1352">So it was actually brainwash.</span> <span id="s1353">And they knew that well Mommy said if we're not going to go to school what will happen to us?</span> <span id="s1354">We'll be nobody.</span> <span id="s1355">So we'll have to go to school, we'll have to finish and we have to study even harder and go to college and so on.</span> <span id="s1356">And they did go through college and they're professionals.</span> <span id="s1357">I'm very proud of them.</span> <span id="s1358">That's why I said I feel I made my contribution to society.</span> <span id="s1359">If my life is fulfilled, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Anthony: You never got to be a district attorney.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">Lillian: I don' t know what would become of me, how my life would turn around.</span> <span id="s1362">There are many things that are missing in life that would never be because under the circumstances, that's the best I could do.</span> <span id="s1363">I couldn't go to school in the United States.</span> <span id="s1364">The small town I was living in there was no night school; there was no day school for newcomers.</span> <span id="s1365">Beside, I had a baby in my arms.</span> <span id="s1366">How can you leave a baby and go to school.</span> <span id="s1367">You can't go to school with a baby.</span> <span id="s1368">You can't without.</span> <span id="s1369">So I don't know what would become of me under normal circumstances.</span> <span id="s1370">That's why I said my life is never fulfilled.</span> <span id="s1371">In a way of thinking what I would do if I would be with my family together how I would find out.</span> <span
