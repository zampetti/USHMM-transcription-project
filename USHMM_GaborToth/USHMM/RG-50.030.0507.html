like?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: She came from Vienna, Austria, and she came to the Netherlands, because after World War І, that was the land of milk and honey.</span> <span id="s158">And she found a job at the bank, and through mutual friends, my mother and father met.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: And there were 10 years between them, and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: And your father was 10 years older?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s165">Mother was -- came from a family that -- from Vienna fo -- culture, and everything, and my dad, he was the fifth boy in the family, the fifth and the last boy.</span> <span id="s166">And he has three or four, five lu -- five name.</span> <span id="s167">And my father -- when my father came along, there was just enough money for prep -- vocation such as pastry baker.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s169">So he comes fr -- he came from a different economical --</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Different environment --</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: -- di-different environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: -- altogether.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: And Mother came fr -- from -- well, her dad was from Galicia, and her mom was from Hungary.</span> <span id="s175">And her mom’s dad was a rabbi, and so my -- my grandma was very fine, very soft spoken, intelligent woman.</span> <span id="s176">My grandfather was from Galicia, and he had a toy store in Vienna.</span> <span id="s177">That’s how they make a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: That must have been nice for you as a kid to go to Vienna and visit them, with a toy store.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you get lots of toys from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: No.</span> <span id="s184">We went a lot of -- through a lot of parks, walking, and sightseeing, and looked at the opera house from the outside, we didn't go in.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: You didn't go in.</span> <span id="s186">Were you -- did you find your grandmother easier to be with than your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">A: Definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s190">Yeah, and I think my -- my mother got a lot of personality traits from her dad.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s192">So she was more difficult to be with.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s194">She was a -- he was a perfectionist, and so was she.</span> <span id="s195">And if I came home with a report card that had two B’s and all A’s, she would say, that’s not good, why don’t you have all A -- B -- A’s on there.</span> <span id="s196">And my dad would say, that’s a pretty good report card.</span> <span id="s197">And that was the difference between those t --</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Yes, so was that -- that must have been difficult for you as a child growing up, having these expectations.</span> <span id="s199">Or -- or was it good for you?</span> <span id="s200">Do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: At that time it was good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s202">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s204">It became more difficult as I -- after.</span> <span id="s205">When I had to live with my uncle, who was Mother’s brother, who was -- he was somewhere in the genius range.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: And he couldn’t understand why I couldn’t understand some things, or get some things as quickly as he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: As he did.</span> <span id="s209">And of course you were much younger also, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: -- the expectation was -- so it became difficult.</span> <span id="s212">You know, I forgot to ask you, what was your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Jacques -- that’s -- Jack is named after him.</span> <span id="s214">This is the French Jacques.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: Jacques, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: Theobold Alfred Karl Frederick.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: So it’s many names, and Cohen is the last name.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: How come he had so many names, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: Because he had -- he was the last one in a row of five boys.</span> <span id="s221">There were five boys in that family.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: But you -- you did say earlier that -- that each child, depending upon where they were in the birth sequence, they would get more names?</span> <span id="s223">So your father had five names because he was the fifth?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Yes, but I don’t believe they did that with the children before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: With -- but just with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: With him.</span> <span id="s227">Because he was also the last one.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s229">So he got all the names --</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: -- that they didn’t give to other -- was he known as Jacques?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Or was he -- that’s -- that’s how he was known?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Did you notice when -- when you were growing up that your parents got along well, or -- because they seem so different.</span> <span id="s236">From your description --</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">Q: -- they seem so very different.</span> <span id="s239">It seems as if it might be difficult in the house.</span> <span id="s240">Was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Yes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Mm-hm, sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Did you all eat together as a family?</span> <span id="s245">Did you eat --</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: -- dinner together at n --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Yes, we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: -- noontime or something.</span> <span id="s250">You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Was there a lot of discussion then, did they ask you and when Hedy was old enough to speak, did they ask her questions, or was it a very quiet meal, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: They mostly talked to each other, they didn’t ask too many things --</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: No, huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: -- from us.</span> <span id="s256">That came later -- I mean later in the day, because we would always have tea about an hour after dinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: And the tea we would have in our living room upstairs, whereas we had dinner in the kitchen, downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s260">And would your mother and father be upstairs at tea, or just your father with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Everybody --</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Everybody was --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: -- wa -- was there, yeah, and that’s when we got to talk some more.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: I see, so that was a more informal --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: -- situation.</span> <span id="s267">So was dinner a very, sort of formal meal?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: That was really not formal --</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: -- except -- well, Mother was working and then she was telling some events of the day --</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: -- to -- to my husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s276">You mean to her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: To her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: To her -- her husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Right, you said my, right.</span> <span id="s281">Were you surprised when Hedy was born?</span> <span id="s282">Were you told that your mother was pregnant?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: You were told.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: I was told, but I was told I would have a sister, or a little brother.</span> <span id="s286">No, not little, I’d have a sister or a brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: And I was eight years old at the time, and I thought I would have a sister just like me, just as old as I was and everything.</span> <span id="s289">And so when I saw her in the crib in the hospital, and she was the sister, well oh, I can’t play with her.</span> <span id="s290">I was very surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: And you -- were you disappointed?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: Yes, yes I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Cause you expected to have someone who was your equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s295">I -- I expected to have a playmate.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Instead I had to have -- I was -- became a babysitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s299">So your parents didn’t really explain to you that it was a baby that was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">A: No, not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Not at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: And so when you said to them, I can’t play with this, this is a -- this is a baby, did -- did they think you didn’t -- that you should have understood?</span> <span id="s304">I mean, what did they do?</span> <span id="s305">Did they try to explain it to you then, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: So were you annoyed at this baby who can’t do anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s311">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s312">And did you became a babysitter pretty quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: So at age eight you’re taking care of a little teeny baby?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s316">And I had to take her to the park for walks.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Spent the whole -- at that time we had no school on Wednesday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span

else called her Hedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: But would you have spelled it the same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: No, you wouldn’t, right?</span> <span id="s347">Would you have spelled it H-a-i-d-y, Haidy?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Haidy?</span> <span id="s349">H-e-d-y.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: You would have spelled it that way --</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: -- the same way as she spells it now.</span> <span id="s353">But you don’t pronounce it the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: Yeah, Hedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">Q: Hedy.</span> <span id="s356">Hm.</span> <span id="s357">So was there a point as -- as Haid -- I’m going to call her Hedy, when -- as she’s growing up that you find that she can become a playmate, or is the age difference so big -- cause you’re eight years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: That’s a big -- it’s a big --</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: It was a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: So

school?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: What did you like about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: I liked -- I was an only child, and I was lonely.</span> <span id="s377">And I enjoyed being with all the children, and -- with whom I could play, and to whom I could talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: So before you went to school, did you not have a lot of friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Not of my own age, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q:

always take me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Not always a great thing, but out, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s396">So when you started school, were you five years old or six years old?</span> <span id="s397">Do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: I was six.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: You

--</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: What -- what -- which is sort of unusual I would guess, in some respects, so what did you -- what did you do when you were by yourself?</span> <span id="s408">What kinds of things did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Well, at the time Queen Wilhemina had reached a 40 year reign, and they made tiles for that, and distributed them to the children in school, and all kinds of other little things to m-memorize this.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: And I always liked nice little things, so I had a lot of them on my nightstand.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: Little toys you mean, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Yeah, little toys, or a little wooden statue, or a very beautiful what do you call these round things that you play with, they are made out of glass.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Oh, a top?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: Not a top.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Not a top.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">A: No.</span> <span id="s418">Ye -- they’re round, they’re glass, and you play with them, they have games.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Marbles.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: You played with marbles.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: Yes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: They’re quite beautiful

<p><span id="s427">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s428">And did you read a lot when you were a kid?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Read?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">A: Oh yes, my dad took me to the library.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: And introduced me to everything in the library, and I fell in love with reading.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: In fact, I fell so much in love with reading that after I was supposed to go to bed and sleep, I had myself a little flashlight and crawled over the cover and read.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">A: For awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Was it hard to read under the covers?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Yes, it’s pretty difficult, isn’t it?</span> <span id="s443">But it’s wonderful that you were reading so much.</span> <span id="s444">What was -- what kinds of things were you reading, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yes, Jules Verne.</span> <span id="s446">My dad liked Jules Verne.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: So I started reading Jules Verne.</span> <span id="s449">I got several of his books and was fascinated by that.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Then I discovered my mom had an anatomy book in her closet, and when I could get at it, I took it and -- and studied it, and read about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s453">In her closet?</span> <span id="s454">How did you know it was in her closet?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: Well, she had like upstairs [indecipherable] was -- we have -- the offices were downstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">A: And our little quarters upstairs, except for the kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s460">Q: And where was the kitchen?</span></p> <p><span id="s461">A: The kitchen was sort of in the back part --</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: -- sort of sticking out.</span> <span id="s464">And my room was above that kitchen, and that was very nice because I was partly already in our own backyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: And with a view on the coal shed.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: And the coal shed was a gathering place for cats, and they came there and they -- they sang their horrible song.</span> <span id="s469">And I would get up, take a big glass of water and throw it.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s471">So -- I see, would they wake you up?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: They did, cause they were talking to each other, right.</span> <span id="s474">But you also got the smells from the kitchen, so that must have been very nice.</span> <span id="s475">Or did you?</span> <span id="s476">You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: No, I didn't get any smells.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Did you also -- was there somebody in the apartment complex that was playing the piano and you would sit and listen to the piano?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s483">Do you like -- did you like music?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: I like piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: You like piano in particular.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Did you want to take lessons?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: No?</span> <span id="s490">How come?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, it was like -- well, I felt I didn’t have the patience.</span> <span id="s492">I didn’t want to spend time practicing.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">A: I wasn’t that crazy about it that I wanted to do it myself.</span> <span id="s495">I just felt I -- I wasn’t -- I -- I wasn’t cut out for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: And -- and Hedy, she had to take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">A: When we came to uncle and aunt in the States --</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: In the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: -- Hedy had the piano lessons, and was I ever glad, because Hedy was always on the piano, bang, bang.</span> <span id="s502">I-I still didn’t want to take them when I had another chance, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: But you didn’t want to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I preferred to listen.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">Q: And would you sit on the windowsill in your -- in your room?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">A: Yes, I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: And listen t --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: Yes, I would.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: And was this person good?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">Q: Yes?</span> <span id="s512">So it was your own private concert in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: -- in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: I don’t even think that he knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: That you were sti --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: -- that I was listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s519">And did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Just enough to say hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: He was a young man in his 20’s and that’s all I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s524">But you didn't say to him, you know, I listen to you and it’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: No, no, I was too shy.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Were you too s -- too shy.</span> <span id="s529">We’re going to have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Betsy, the neighborhood that you lived in, I know that in Amsterdam there was a kind of Jewish neighborhood, but you didn’t live in that neighborhood, right?</span> <span id="s533">You lived in a -- a mixed neighborhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Were there many Jews who lived there, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: No, there weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: It was -- was a little -- no, it was sort of a ritzy street --</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: It was.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: -- on which we lived.</span> <span id="s541">And the whole neighborhood, from our house to the school was sort of -- not rich, but upper middle class.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And would you remember the name of the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: What was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Pieter de Hooch Street.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Pieter de Hooch Street.</span> <span id="s547">Was your family religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: No, my father was actually an atheist, and he taught me that so far as he was concerned, I didn't have to do anything until I was 18, and then, he said then I could make up my mind, did I want to be Jewish, did I want to be religious too.</span> <span id="s549">But Mother came from a more religious family.</span> <span id="s550">But so that I didn’t go to school on the high holidays and I didn’t go to school on Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s551">Q: So -- go ahead.</span> <span id="s552">You were going to say something.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: We didn’t -- we didn’t celebrate Chanukah because in Holland they celebrate Saint Nicholas, and that is December the fifth.</span> <span id="s554">And he is not the Christmas man who comes here at Christmas, no.</span> <span id="s555">He was a -- a saint from Turkey, and he helped poor children.</span> <span id="s556">He would -- as the legend goes, he would throw food into the orphanage backyard, and he was supposed to come every year from Spain, with his ship, and a black assistant, Schwartze Piet, and a white horse.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: That way he would come, every year.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s560">So everybody celebrated --</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yes, ev-everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: So was that a religious holiday in some way or not?</span> <span id="s563">It wasn’t terribly religious, was it -- is --</span></p> <p><span id="s564">A: No, it was not at all religious.</span> <span id="s565">It was a fun day.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Everybody had parties, and it was a little bit of a tradition to write a little poem, when you gave somebody a gift, and you could -- you could be very -- you could be criticizing the person to whom you gave it, but make fun, in a fun way.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: So it was a really wonderful celebration.</span> <span id="s570">I never heard the word Chanukah until I came to the States.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s572">But you knew of other Jewish holidays --</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">Q: -- because you did --</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: So were you very conscious of being Jewish, or somewhat conscious, what do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s577">A: Well, it was my mother who made me conscious.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Not your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: And well, in retrospect, I can see what happe -- my mother kept saying to me I was Jewish and I had to be careful because there were so many anti-Semites in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: And she said that to you when you were quite young?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">Q: What did you think about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: I didn’t agree with her because I hadn’t -- I-I hadn’t felt any until the very last year, I used to pick up two friends along the way to school.</span> <span id="s584">And the first ones were quite -- you know, did you ever hear the word [indecipherable]?</span> <span id="s585">They were very conservative and the father came from a family that had a plantation in the East Indies.</span> <span id="s586">So they were very well-to-do, but they were not very friendly, they were cold.</span> <span id="s587">And so even was the girl whom I picked up, but I didn’t want to go to school all by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s589">So at what point would -- we were talking about whether you ever experienced anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s590">Was she antis -- was that family anti-Semitic?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: No, just cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: Just cold.</span> <span id="s593">So when your mother is warning you that there are a lot of people who are anti-Semitic in the world, you just don’t find this to be the case, you’re not -- that’s not your experience.</span> <span id="s594">It was --</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, that was not my experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: -- until Hitler came.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Until Hitler came.</span> <span id="s599">And did your father hear that your mother was saying this to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: And did he say to you, don’t pay attention, this is no --</span></p> <p><span id="s602">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: He didn't say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: He didn’t say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s606">So did you say to him wh-why is she saying this, I don’t -- you know, where -- where are the anti-Semites?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: Cause you’re not -- you don’t -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: You didn't question that.</span> <span id="s611">So un -- when you’re a very young child, cause you’re born in 1928, in 1933 the Nazis take over in Germany.</span> <span id="s612">So when you are six or seven years old, do you hear about things that are happening in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: We heard that the Jews were in plight there, and that they fled to Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: Uh-huh, Holland, yes, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: -- a lot.</span> <span id="s616">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: And so you heard that?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: I-I heard that and I had a friend who was one of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: She became my bosom friend all the way through, as long as we knew each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: And did she tell you what was going on in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Did we -- and you didn’t ask her?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No.</span> <span id="s625">There wasn’t that much talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: -- at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: And the father was a lawyer and her mother was a -- a music teacher.</span> <span id="s630">And my friend herself was very ta-talented.</span> <span id="s631">And I -- I always came, and he had to practice, but for me this was a pleasure to listen to.</span> <span id="s632">And then afterwards she practiced, then we’d do our own thing, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s634">So did you sit in the room when she was practicing?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s637">That’s very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: So you really loved music, didn't you?</span> <span id="s640">Do you still love music?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Now, let me ask you something.</span> <span id="s645">Bef -- before you were born, so you can only talk about what you’ve heard, I think.</span> <span id="s646">Your parents didn’t live a-at Pieter Hooch Strasser, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: They lived somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: And this has some significance because of a bakery that’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: That your mother goes to.</span> <span id="s653">So can you talk about -- where did -- where did she go?</span> <span id="s654">She went every day to buy some bread --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: -- from a woman who came to be known as Tante Toos to you, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: So how long did they live in this other place?</span> <span id="s659">Do you know?</span> <span id="s660">A few years?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Maybe four.</span> <span id="s662">That was a different neighborhood they were -- it was called the -- the old new south.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: The old new south?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: South, yeah.</span> <span id="s665">And somehow many of the German Jews settled around there, that neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s667">But your mother had lots of conversations with this woman.</span> <span id="s668">Every time she went in she would talk with her, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s671">So I-I’m just mentioning this because later on this woman is going to become extremely important, in fact ends up saving your lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s674">Do you hear about the anschluss in Vienna, in -- in Austria?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Because your grandparents were there, is this very -- di-did they stay in Austria, or did they leave and come to Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: They came with us for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: And then they got an apartment of their own, and that’s the last I know of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: And you don’t know what else happened, right.</span> <span id="s681">But did your mother’s brother Sam, who ends up taking care of you when you come to the United States, he and his wife, does he come to stay in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: He does.</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Yes, he did stay with us for a year because I think he had to wait for a -- his quota number to come up.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s686">So when does he come?</span> <span id="s687">In 1940, 1939, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: Well, I was 10 -- 11.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: So it’s ’38 - ’39.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: 20 -- ’38 - ’39, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: So he comes after the anschluss --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: -- with the grandparents.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: So for awhile it’s your uncle and your grandparents that are in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: Well, my grandparents didn’t stay in the house very long --</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: I see, so he stayed longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: -- a year, and then they got their own apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: So he stayed for longer than that?</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Yeah, he stayed at our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Now, was he trying to convince your parents to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: But they wouldn't do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Well, my father would have, but my mother thought she has a good job, and she expected a big pension and why should she go and forsake all that?</span> <span id="s707">And so she was not ready to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: To do that.</span> <span id="s709">Did you know that at the time?</span> <span id="s710">Did you hear these conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: Some.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Some of them.</span> <span id="s715">So were they arguing, was your -- was your uncle saying you must go because Hitler’s going to do terrible things, or -- do you remember any of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No, I don’t think they were arguing.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Uh-huh, you don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: So how did you know that your uncle was going to leave and he was asking your parents to take you, the kids, and themselves out?</span> <span id="s720">Did you overhear these conversations?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: No.</span> <span id="s722">Hitler came into Holland in May, ’42.</span> <span id="s723">When he occupied Holland, my father said to me, if ever anything happens to us, get in touch with your Uncle Alfred in America.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Do you think he told his -- hi -- his brother-in-law the same thing?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: He did before.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: So the Nazis take over in 1940 I believe, May of 1940, right?</span> <span id="s729">So your father -- but your father tells you directly --</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: -- this, right.</span> <span id="s732">Did you want to leave?</span> <span id="s733">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: So you didn’t feel danger until the Nazis actual --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Well, until the last few months, because the -- the Wehrmacht, they had their offices, and they took over the house right next to us.</span> <span id="s739">And when they were right next to us, and I saw them wherever I walked, then I did get scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Then you were sca --</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: And that was also the time that they told us to wear a star on our --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: -- on our garments.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s745">But that’s a little bit later.</span> <span id="s746">When -- when you start -- you finish grammar school --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: -- in 1939, is that right?</span> <span id="s749">And go to gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: Yeah, I guess so.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Is it 1939 or 1940?</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: See, I had the year on a quarter of gymnasium, and that quarter was in ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s754">So maybe it’s ’40 -- you start in ’41 or late --</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s757">Right, 1939.</span> <span id="s758">So at a certain point you can’t go to school, as a young Jewish girl, right?</span> <span id="s759">You have to go to a Jewish school.</span> <span id="s760">The Nazis come in in 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Yeah, they came and then after awhile they chased out all the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: -- professors, and all the Jewish students, and they mi -- they took a building that used to be a really Jewish school, but they took over that building, and people -- Jewish people from all over Amsterdam were congregated there, and -- and classes were held there.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s765">D-Do you remember when the Nazis came in to the Netherlands?</span> <span id="s766">When they marched in?</span> <span id="s767">Do you have an --</span></p> <p><span id="s768">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: -- do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: Ah, no, except that I did hear a lot of shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: And because we had -- Amsterdam was at the time, a port at the [indecipherable] that little inland sea that -- that the Netherlands has.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: And it was a pretty big port, and well, if anything was happening there, we could hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: So we could hear very much shooting.</span> <span id="s777">And then that died down, and at first they were very friendly, and then came one bulletin after another banning the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Had your uncle left by this time?</span> <span id="s779">Did he leave before the Germans came?</span> <span id="s780">Your Uncle Sam?</span> <span id="s781">He had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: He had left.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: So he was lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: Yes, he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Was he married at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: To your Aunt Anne, was that right?</span> <span id="s788">So they were -- were -- were they both in the house with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: They weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: He went first.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: And she went later, and she has an adventure.</span> <span id="s794">You want to know?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: She has a what?</span> <span id="s796">An adventure?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Was something happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: They were the last train out of Austria, they were the last people allowed to go out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: And they came to the Dutch quarter and they took them all out, and they were going to shoot them.</span> <span id="s802">Now, the border was marked off by -- what you have around the chicken coops, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: And my aunt saw a place where she could possibly go on the knees, but not very quickly, and the Dutch people pulled her over.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: And did they shoot these other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s810">Oh my.</span> <span id="s811">So did she come alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Yeah, she came alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: I see, so she came separately from.</span> <span id="s814">Wow.</span> <span id="s815">And when did you hear this story, when you came to the United States, or did you hear it --</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Oh, we had been here sometime already when I heard that.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: When you heard that, so you didn’t hear it when you were in the Netherlands --</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Not then, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: Not then, right.</span> <span id="s820">Okay.</span> <span id="s821">When the Nazis took over bef -- before you father unfortunately he was taken somehow in 1942, but was -- was he arrested and then came back and arrested a couple of times before this final time?</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: Well, they cloaked it all on the taxes, and my father got a notice that he owed some taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: He owed taxes.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: But -- well, among the taxes were also our radios.</span> <span id="s825">We had to hand in the radios, and he went there, they talked to him and they let him go back.</span> <span id="s826">And they wanted him back the next day.</span> <span id="s827">And he told us, you better go under, because I don’t know if I’m coming back.</span> <span id="s828">He went.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: He went back by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: He went back by himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: So nobody came to your house to take him away.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: No, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: He just went back.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Why do you think -- who was he going to talk with?</span> <span id="s836">With the Germans or Dutch?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Yeah, Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: With Germans.</span> <span id="s839">And they were saying he hadn’t paid taxes?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: Yeah, or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Sounds odd, doesn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Some -- some odd thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: So did -- did the f -- his -- your mother, Rose, say to him, don’t go back?</span> <span id="s844">Why are you going back?</span> <span id="s845">Did somebody say, don’t do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: You don’t know.</span> <span id="s848">Did he say good-bye to you?</span> <span id="s849">Do you remember that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s850">A: Yeah, but not -- not -- not an unusual --</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Did you know where he was going?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: You did know.</span> <span id="s854">Were you scared?</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s857">Cause by then you knew these guys were not good guys.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: So once he goes, you never see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: No.</span> <span id="s861">And I never knew whether he was alive or dead after the war, until the Red Cross released some report, and it turned out that he then died.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: And where -- where was he taken, do you -- did it say?</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: A part of Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Birkenau?</span> <span id="s865">Was it Birkenau?</span> <span id="s866">Was he in Westerbork first?</span> <span id="s867">Did they bring him to Westerbork and then he was deported from Westerbork.</span> <span id="s868">But you did not know that and your mother didn't know it.</span> <span id="s869">Or do you not know whether your mother knew it?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We knew that he would go to Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: You did know that, because that’s where they were sending the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: That we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: And the brother of Tante Toos was in the underground and he had heard that they had took -- where they took my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s876">So did you -- your mother knew that before you did.</span> <span id="s877">Your mother must have known that when you were in hiding.</span> <span id="s878">You think?</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: I-I was there when he told.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: When he s -- so you knew too.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: When your father said I’m going to go and you should get out, he was saying to his wife, your mother, take the kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: -- and leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Go into hiding, yes?</span> <span id="s887">But you had no idea that there was a preparation being --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s889">Q: -- had -- preparations had been made for hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s890">A: No idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: No idea at all.</span> <span id="s892">So is it very soon after your father goes and leaves and he’s not there, that your mother says we’re going?</span> <span id="s893">Does she do it right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So what does she say to you?</span> <span id="s898">I mean, what is it like, is this in the e -- at night, is it in the morning, when -- when is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Well, we went at dusk.</span> <span id="s900">We took our stars off because we weren’t supposed to be on the street after dusk --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: -- at that time.</span> <span id="s903">I don’t remember even whether we took the tram or walked all the way.</span> <span id="s904">She said we are going to Tante Toos, we are going to stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: She did say that?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Did you know who Tante Toos was?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: Cause -- and you had -- you had met her?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: Yes, because I always went th -- bread with m -- with my mother, I went to the bakery that Tante Toos was managing at the time across, and ju -- it was right across the street from us.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s912">So you lived in that older apartment?</span> <span id="s913">Yes, not -- not the one at Pieter Hooch?</span> <span id="s914">Or did she -- di -- was her bakery near --</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: Well, when we moved from the street where we lived, where she had the bakery, we moved to a different street.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: And so far as I know, they had no contact any more, but they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: But they did.</span> <span id="s919">So they were clearly very close in some way in order to make these kinds of plans.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Well, she was very grateful to my father, because she had worked for my father for many, many years.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s922">In his café?</span> <span id="s923">Is that where she worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yeah, like a little coffeehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: You could get coffee and tea and pastry.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: And she had married a man who was 25 years older than she.</span> <span id="s929">He was in the military but he had done something bad, and he was out of it, and he was old, so she -- she was the breadwinner.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: And when we went to the Pieter de Hooch Strat, she became the manager of a liquor store in an entirely different neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s933">But obviously they -- your mother and she obviously had something in common in that they were both the breadwinners in their house.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Which in some ways was unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yes, they -- they were really pretty good friends, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Really, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: -- but there was a bond with my father because Tante Toos had eight miscarriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: And each time she had to stay out of work.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: And m-my dad kept the job open for her each time.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: Each time.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: And she was very grateful to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: That’s what did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: So there were a lot of connections with the family, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s952">So you -- you remember that -- your mother saying we’re going to Tante Toos.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: And did she have a bag that she took?</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yes, we had a little bag, not -- nothing big.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Nothing big.</span> <span id="s957">Were you able to take something for yourself, or did she just grab the two kid -- the two of you, put on your coats, take off the Jewish stars --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: I -- I could take a couple of things, and I think that’s when I took my diaries.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s960">Cause by then you had been writing in them for a few years.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Right, for three years or four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: And wa -- then I was supposed to go to Tante Toos’s sister and brother-in-law who lives nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: But they lived on the third floor in a small apartment and I was to stay with them.</span> <span id="s968">But after a few weeks they -- they got cold feet and they said, “We don’t -- we can’t keep you here because there is no place to hide you anywhere.”</span> <span id="s969">So in the dark one night, Oome Cor, we called him, he took me to Tante Toos.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">Q: We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Let’s see, I think I’ve been confusing some things.</span> <span id="s974">I think that I said that it was Uncle Sam who came to stay with you, but it’s not Uncle Sam, it’s Uncle Alfred, is that right?</span> <span id="s975">So it’s Alfred Schwartz, who is the brother of your mother, who came to stay with you, and then with whom you stayed when you came to the United States, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s978">So when you go with your mother and Hedy, your sister, you -- you don’t remember whether you walked or whether you took a tram to Tante Toos?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Oh, they lived close by, we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: You walked.</span> <span id="s981">It was close by, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: I mean, when I went from Oome Cor to Tante Toos, we definitely walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Yes, but now I’m talking about when you first went to Tante Toos --</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Toos --</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: -- from your house, do you re -- do you have a recollection whether you were walking, or whether you --</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: I have a -- a hunch that we were walking because then, if we would have taken the tram, we would have been more visible.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Uh-huh, right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: It was far, but I think we -- we walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: You think you walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Because we didn’t want to attract any attention.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Attention.</span> <span id="s992">Now let me ask you something, when you -- you had to wear a star on your outer clothing and on your clothing, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: -- just on your coats?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: On -- on --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: On the arm?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah, arm.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: What was that like for you when -- when that first started, when you were walking?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: Awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: It was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: And that’s when I got in touch with anti-Semitism, because I had the other chum in school who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s1002">Her father also took her to school, and her father and my father became friends, and we became friends, too.</span> <span id="s1003">And after the star, she came to tell me that she couldn’t walk with me any more, that her parents didn’t want her to walk with me any more because of that star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">Q: What did you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: It was awful, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: That was hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: Did she feel bad, too, or did she just state, well this is what my parents say, this is what I have to -- you don’t know, or y --</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">A: I couldn’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: I couldn’t tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">Q: And you were 14 at the time.</span> <span id="s1013">Was 1942, with the star --</span></p> <p><span id="s1014">A: When I went into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: No, but when you -- when the s -- when you first have to wear the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Oh, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Remember.</span> <span id="s1018">I think it was ’42.</span> <span id="s1019">So you’re -- you’re not a kid.</span> <span id="s1020">You are -- I mean, you’re a kid in a certain way.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">Q: But you’re not a child child --</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: -- you’re -- you’re -- if it was 1942, so you’re 14 years old.</span> <span id="s1025">So that was really hard on you, cause you’re very conscious of who you are as a young person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Did anybody else do that to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: And when you were walking on the street, and you had the Jewish star, people stare?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: No, they didn’t.</span> <span id="s1032">So did the Dutch treat you in a o-okay way as far as --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: They did.</span> <span id="s1035">Except for that one incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1037">There were a couple of h-homes that the Germans had occupied and the so -- some of the Soviets were sitting outside in the front yard and I would pass with my star, and they would whistle at me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: They would whistle.</span> <span id="s1039">What’d you make of that?</span> <span id="s1040">It’s a little stran --</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: They were very young ones, very young soldiers, all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: So did you think they were whistling at you because you were a young, attractive girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Not because you were wearing the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, no, I don’t even think they saw the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1049">So they were on your street?</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: Yuck, that must have been horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: Oh, it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1054">So were you nervous when your mother took off the star that night when you were going to walk to Tante Toos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: And -- and think that you were very vulnerable?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1058">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">Q: Did you have baptismal papers, I mean did your mother have some false papers for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So if she was stopped, they would have known you were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Did you have an identity card --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: -- that had a J in it?</span> <span id="s1066">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: So there was nothing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: -- in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No identity card.</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1073">So when -- when you got to Tante Toos and you walked in, did you feel, i-if you can remember, did you feel more secure, not secure, because you knew who this person was, and you felt safer, or did --</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: And the set up was better, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Excuse me, the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: The set up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: The set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1079">Because we could know beforehand when somebody was home to come.</span> <span id="s1080">She -- the front of the house was the store, the back of the house was a little bedroom and living room, kitchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: And the front of the store starts here, and just there was the door to the basement.</span> <span id="s1083">So when somebody came, we quietly went through that door.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: To the basement, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: And when the store was closed, we could come in the living room.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: You could?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yes, we could, unless a neighbor upstairs was always going to shave Uncle John.</span> <span id="s1088">Did Hedy tell you exactly who Uncle John was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: No, tel -- you tell me.</span> <span id="s1090">He was -- he was Tante Toos’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: He was her husband, he was the 25 year over husband --</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: -- who had done something.</span> <span id="s1094">But he was from -- somehow from the nobility, and his first wife came to visit him every week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: And of course his first wife, she was also from the [indecipherable] and she was not supposed to know, so Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Was not supposed to know that you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: So that was a whole day for us in the basement for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Was there a toilet in the basement, or nothing?</span> <span id="s1102">No.</span> <span id="s1103">So you had to just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Chamber pot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Chamber pot.</span> <span id="s1106">So you’re 14, and Hedy is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Six.</span> <span id="s1109">So she’s -- how does sh -- how is she in this circumstance?</span> <span id="s1110">I mean, she’s a -- a kid who must be noisy, or you know, wants to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: She was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">Q: She was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">A: It was unbelievable because before, she was a brat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: And after fi -- after things sort of normalized in this States, she came a brat for a little while longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: But she was not a brat when you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: So she must have understood how --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: She must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">Q: -- how -- how dangerous it was.</span> <span id="s1121">So talk about something of what it was like to be -- could you go outside?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: No, you had to stay inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: So nobody around could know that you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: That must have been very hard.</span> <span id="s1128">Was like being in prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1130">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: But -- but nicer, cause people --</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: -- were nice to you.</span> <span id="s1134">Tante Toos was taking a big risk, wasn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Yes, she was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">Q: Why do you think she did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">A: Out of loyalty to my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: She was very grateful that he kept the job open for her --</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: -- through eight miscarriages.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1143">But still, this is a time when you know that the Nazis are there, this is extremely dangerous.</span> <span id="s1144">Now when -- wh-when you left her -- it’s her sister and brother-in-law, or her brother and sister --</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">A: Her sister and brother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: And brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s1147">When they brought you back, was she aggravated with them, or did sh -- and -- or did she just welcome you and say okay, so it’s three people instead of two people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Well, she welcomed me but reluctantly, because that was not the way it was supposed to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s1150">So she was better than the sister, wasn’t she?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">Q: But of course her circumstances were such that there was a place for you to hide, whereas there wasn’t a place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">Q: But you spoke fluent Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Did you look Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Well, when I was in grade school, some people thought I looked Indian or Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Spanish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: But I don’t think I looked outspoken --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: -- dut -- Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: Or different than the other kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1166">No, not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: And what -- who were you supposed to be when you went to her sister’s, were you supposed to be -- I mean, if somebody came and visited and they saw you, were you supposed to be a relative?</span> <span id="s1168">I mean, who were you supposed to be?</span> <span id="s1169">Did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: No, you don’t know.</span> <span id="s1172">Did you have the same name, or were you given another name when you were in hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: You weren’t given another name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So you didn’t have any other papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: No</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">Q: So you were there without papers, you were just there?</span> <span id="s1179">Okay.</span> <span id="s1180">So what was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: No, what was it like, what was it like to be in hiding there.</span> <span id="s1183">Was -- was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Not good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Was it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: I -- I -- I felt like -- you know, I was 14, I was going to go to the second grade in gymnasium, and we were all getting friendly, the whole class was Jewish and Christian and -- and I had my Jewish chum still, and -- no, I didn’t have her then, she was already gone.</span> <span id="s1187">One time I went to see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: This was a friend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: She was really my bosom friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: We were always together.</span> <span id="s1192">I went up there to see her, she lived on the third floor, across from the grade school.</span> <span id="s1193">And the neighbors across the hall came out and told me that she was picked up by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: So she was taken to Westerbork probably, and then deported.</span> <span id="s1195">So that must have been really awful for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: I had [indecipherable] a cousin for awhile, who was in the underground.</span> <span id="s1197">She was walking around with false papers and blonde colored hair.</span> <span id="s1198">She somehow knew a person who was related to the math professor in gymnasium.</span> <span id="s1199">And this relative wrote a book on the students who all had to go to that quickly established Jewish school.</span> <span id="s1200">And he did a lot of research and -- with another author.</span> <span id="s1201">I should have brought the book.</span> <span id="s1202">And he found out that she was killed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1203">Me -- I still didn’t know until I got that book --</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1205">Is this Presser?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: -- from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Is this Jacques Presser, is that the professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Jacques Presser, no that -- Jacques was the history professor.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1210">But you had him as a professor, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1212">Oh, did I adore him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: How do you know his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Because he wrote a book about Dutch Jews and the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: So you had him as a professor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: He was fantastic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">A: Because history is difficult to teach, and he made it come alive for us, he brought -- he brought pictures.</span> <span id="s1221">He was talking at the time about Greek and Roman architecture, which can be boring.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Ah, no, we got the pictures and he showed us the difference in -- little differences in architecture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1225">A: And then we had our workbook, and then we pasted in this thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: -- and you had to write something next to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1229">A: And it was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: And he was nice.</span> <span id="s1232">He was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1234">So this -- this happens, of course, before you go into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: So you go into hiding and stop school because you go into hiding.</span> <span id="s1237">Or -- or did school stop before you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: No, the school -- and that’s exactly what this relative of the other [indecipherable] remained, only the classes became smaller and smaller and smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1240">And is it -- does -- is this the Jewish school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: This is where the Jewish --</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: -- children from all of Amsterdam were put together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Right, and it becomes smaller and smaller because they deport more and more --</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: -- kids, right.</span> <span id="s1249">Did you know Tante Toos’s son before you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: You didn’t.</span> <span id="s1252">So you didn't know she had a son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">Q: So he is what, 19 and you’re 14 when you first come there, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Is he in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: He’s not.</span> <span id="s1259">But he has a radio.</span> <span id="s1260">Is there a radio in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Yes, there was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: There was.</span> <span id="s1263">So that was not confiscated.</span> <span id="s1264">They kept their radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, but they were Christians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: So they never confiscated radios from Christians?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: So did you listen to that radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: And did you hear war news?</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yes, I heard Churchill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: You heard Churchill from the BBC.</span> <span id="s1273">Did you understand English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">A: No, I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">Q: You don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: Just a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: So did Hans understand English?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: So he would tell you what Churchill was saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: And did you follow the war by putting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1283">Hans did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: -- pins on a map?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Hans did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: Hans did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: He put the map on the wall and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: -- we put the pins then as the war went on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: Did you think the war was going to last as long as it did?</span> <span id="s1291">Or did you think it would be shorter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: For a long time I thought it would be shorter.</span> <span id="s1293">But when it dragged on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: -- up until the time of the invasion, I thought I don’t know how long this is going to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: But when they invaded France, that was when my mother died.</span> <span id="s1298">When they invaded France, Mother died right on that day, that night, but at the same time everybody began to get a little more hope that that war --</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: Would be over, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: -- would end soon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1302">Did you hear rumors about what the Nazis were doing, that they were killing people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: You did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: And what sort of rumors did you hear?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Well, Uncle Cor brought most of the rum -- the news and Uncle Cor also brought us our false food stamps.</span> <span id="s1308">We -- we would -- everybody get a food stamp card each week, and these -- so many stamps for milk and so many for meat, etcetera.</span> <span id="s1309">He would get a set for us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: That -- that were false [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">A: But I -- di -- I don’t know how he got it or -- but it was through the underground.</span> <span id="s1312">And Tante Toos could take them and buy food for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: And did anybody question that there must be more people in the house, or they just didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: The neighbor, I found out later, the neighbor upstairs who came to shave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: He questioned it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: I think he had seen us slip, or somebody’s back, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: But he didn’t say anything to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: No.</span> <span id="s1323">A -- Tante Toos had another brother-in-law, who did see us, and that was about in the March before they invaded.</span> <span id="s1324">He -- he had a long talk with Tante Toos, telling her to get rid of us and why, and how, and how the consequences, and -- he was trying to get rid of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: But she wouldn’t do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">Q: So what was she like?</span> <span id="s1328">A: I hardly knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1329">Q: No, her.</span> <span id="s1330">Tante Toos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: Tante Toos?</span> <span id="s1332">Q: Yes, what was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: She was unique.</span> <span id="s1334">She was -- how can I say that?</span> <span id="s1335">In London there is a -- a neighborhood that’s called Cockney or something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Well, so in Amsterdam there is a neighborhood that’s called the Jordaan, and they have also a slightly different -- which she was originally from the Jordaan, and because she had all this business experience she -- she didn’t have that language with her any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">A: But we -- the swearing words --</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: She did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: -- she kept.</span> <span id="s1342">And she [indecipherable] was very loyal to my dad and she was a happy person, an optimistic person, and somebody who liked to make a joke, even a off color joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">A: And so she -- she was an up person, most of the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q: And as you remember it, how did she get along with your mother?</span> <span id="s1346">Your mother seems as if she’s a very different kind of person than Tante Toos.</span> <span id="s1347">And the friendship seems al-almost odd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1348">A: Well, it wasn’t really odd.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: They only put -- because they didn’t live together --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: Yes</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">A: -- they were -- they were really good friends.</span> <span id="s1353">But on living together, this thing deteriorated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: It did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: My mother was the -- the head of the household.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: She was the hausfrau.</span> <span id="s1358">Then she had to go in a little place and do what this lady said, eat what this lady brought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">Q: So she didn't like it.</span> <span id="s1360">So they didn’t get along very well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Did they fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1364">Q: Did they argue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1366">They would get very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1368">And they never were able to work it out?</span> <span id="s1369">It was always --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: No, that -- it came worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: It -- in what way does it -- it -- it -- you mean the -- there -- they became less and less friends as the time went on, not more and more.</span> <span id="s1372">So that must have made it very difficult for you and your sister living in that sort of circumstance.</span> <span id="s1373">Did -- did you take sides, do you think, in your head?</span> <span id="s1374">And you were on the side of Tante Toos?</span> <span id="s1375">Yes.</span> <span id="s1376">And you feel a little guilty about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: But do you now, as you look back as an adult person, do you think she was right, or your mother was right, or there’s no right and wrong here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Well, it’s difficult to say exactly who was right.</span> <span id="s1382">It was understandable that my mother would not feel so happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Because she wa -- used to be the boss --</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">A: -- and she wasn't any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: And she’d lost her husband, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: So it was all very difficult for her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1392">And she wasn’t working, of course, so that made it even worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: But what was -- did she bring money into the house?</span> <span id="s1395">She must have brought mo -- some money that she had so she could help out --</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: -- with Tante Toos, yes?</span> <span id="s1398">But you also said that you didn't bring things with you, but she hoarded food.</span> <span id="s1399">So was there food in Tante Toos’s house, that’s -- so the food had been brought there, it was ready.</span> <span id="s1400">And what kind of food could you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Rice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">Q: Ah, staples that didn’t need refrigeration.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">A: Jam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">Q: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Tea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: Tea.</span> <span id="s1409">Ah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: Coffee, flour.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: That’s about all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">A: But there was a lot of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: There was.</span> <span id="s1416">So it lasted a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: You -- you started a kind of a relationship that became very serious with Hans at a certain point, is that right?</span> <span id="s1419">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">Q: Wh-When did that start?</span> <span id="s1421">After you were there six months, a year?</span> <span id="s1422">Cause you were there for three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: At least during the war, and then -- then for another year, or almost a year, yes?</span> <span id="s1425">When you were 15, when you were 16, what do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: Yeah, and we both realized that Hedy was not getting any schooling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">A: And we tried, between him and me, to get Hedy ready for school --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: -- so that she, when she came out wouldn’t have to start at class number one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: -- but she could put right away, and -- and she was ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: So she didn’t lose time because we had tutored her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: That’s fabulous.</span> <span id="s1438">Did you have books?</span> <span id="s1439">Did you have some books, or did you just make it up as you went along?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: I had some French textbooks, but I think Hans had a few grade school textbooks left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: Did you like doing that?</span> <span id="s1442">Wa -- di -- I mean, it gave you something to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">Q: And you enjoyed that and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: Did that bring you and Hans closer together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">A: No.</span> <span id="s1450">The fact is that Tante Toos did like to make a white lie.</span> <span id="s1451">Nothing serious, but if -- if my mother asked her, could you get fish today, and she had just a little bit, she would say no, I don’t have any fish for today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: Little things like that.</span> <span id="s1454">And Hans began to notice it.</span> <span id="s1455">That’s what brought him closer.</span> <span id="s1456">He didn’t like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1458">So you became closer together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: We need to stop the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Okay, Betsy, when -- when we left the last tape, you were talking about Hans realizing that his mother told white lies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: And that this bothered him, and that this brought you closer together.</span> <span id="s1466">Can you explain why that brought you closer together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Well, we also had in common that we were teaching my sister.</span> <span id="s1468">That was all at the same time, and it was shortly after my mother died.</span> <span id="s1469">You know, my mother died while we were hidden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">Q: Yes, I was going to ask you about -- right.</span> <span id="s1471">So this -- this happened afterwards.</span> <span id="s1472">So let’s -- let’s go back then, and talk first about your mother.</span> <span id="s1473">Was your mother ill when you went into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: No, but she -- she wasn't ill, but did th -- before she died, she had these terrible headaches, and they became worse and worse and worse and worse.</span> <span id="s1475">And Tante Toos knew a doctor from the underground, but we were all hoping, well, let’s see how it goes through the night.</span> <span id="s1476">And then, during the night, she expired.</span> <span id="s1477">And this particular doctor, he saw to it that she got a grave at the Jewish cemetery near Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: Well he must have, because there she is.</span> <span id="s1480">And not only is she, but my grandmother and grandfather, they’re there too.</span> <span id="s1481">And I have no idea who -- there must have been several people involved, to get her there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Were your grandparents then -- they died in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: They were not deported?</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: The -- a -- in -- in Amsterdam and there -- it -- it’s not certain whether they got sick or whether the Germans hit them, or -- nobody knows exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1486">But they are now in the [indecipherable] cemetery by Amsterdam, right next to my mom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: And your -- your mother died in 1944, right?</span> <span id="s1488">Is that right?</span> <span id="s1489">You were bef --</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1491">My mother died on the night that the allies invaded Normandy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: That night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: This must have been a big shock to you to lose your mother.</span> <span id="s1495">Now -- now you -- you lost both parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: Yeah, I woke up, my sister and I, we sleeping in one bed.</span> <span id="s1497">I woke up and felt my mother was too quiet and I felt her hand and it was ice cold, of course.</span> <span id="s1498">So I started screaming, oh Hedy, now we are whatyoumacalls, people without parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">Q: An orphan.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1501">Q: So you discovered that your mother was dead?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: She was sleeping in the same room with the two of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: Right next to us, actually.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">Q: Right next to you.</span> <span id="s1506">Hm.</span> <span id="s1507">Now, you didn't have a funeral, you were not -- they did -- they take the body away, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">A: No.</span> <span id="s1509">No.</span> <span id="s1510">And that same doctor, he arranged that her body was carried out and he really did a great deal.</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">A: Because he knew pretty soon -- pretty early that we were there.</span> <span id="s1513">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1514">I don’t know who knew him, but evidently Tante Toos trusted him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: So this was very -- very quick, diz -- whatever this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: -- in your mother, it was -- it went very fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: He si -- he thinks it was a -- a tumor in the brain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1520">Had she had headaches for a long time that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">A: She always had some headache.</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: She always had it, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: But nothing unusual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">Q: But this -- these were really extreme, painful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: Now, in relationship to when she died, prior to her dying, there was a secondary hiding place inside the apartment, right?</span> <span id="s1527">There was a -- some sort of a false wall that was built.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: How long before your mother died?</span> <span id="s1530">Because she was there and hiding in that place with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Right?</span> <span id="s1533">Was that a year before?</span> <span id="s1534">Do you rememb -- do you have any recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: I’d say half a year before, but I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Like I -- I don’t know, Hedy said there was a hiding place underneath the -- the window where they displayed the bottles of gin, and whatever.</span> <span id="s1538">Tho -- she said that was at first designated as our hiding place, but I don’t recognize this at all, I don’t remember seeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1540">Well, do you remember this other hiding place where this false wall was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: You do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: Oh -- oh yes, we were all in there, Hans too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">Q: And why was Hans there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: Hans was in there because the Germans wanted to have boys come to Germany and work in the factories.</span> <span id="s1546">And Hans went to some kind of -- because he wanted to become a telegraph operator at sea, so he went to school for that, and that was one reason why he was still around, but when they did go around, they would pick up these boys and send them to the factories in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">A: So there were -- there was mother and my sister and Hans and I in a very small place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: You would ha -- you would -- where was this inside the a -- the apartment?</span> <span id="s1550">You’ve described that behind the store was the living space.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: So what -- was it on that floor, that same floor as the -- as the store was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1554">Actually, there was a kitchen, and the ceiling was that high.</span> <span id="s1555">Right next to the kitchen was the bathroom, and the ceiling was much, much higher.</span> <span id="s1556">And so they built a false wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1558">A: From the ceiling of bathroom, which was higher.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: So how much space is there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Maybe two and a half feet by four feet.</span> <span id="s1561">I can’t think of it now, I’m getting mixed up with the -- I -- I forgot how to copulate cu -- how many cubic feet those are.</span> <span id="s1562">It’s small, extremely small.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Could you sit, or did you have to stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: We could sit, but we have to pull up our legs and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: And how many hours would you stay there, usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: It differed.</span> <span id="s1567">Sometimes only half an hour, and sometimes two and a half hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">Q: And this was when -- when you would be warned that -- that Germans were coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Yes, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">Q: And once the Germans were gone, then you could come out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">Q: And do you know who would warn Tante Toos that somebody was coming?</span> <span id="s1573">Do you have any idea?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: It might be Uncle Cor, I mean, that was her closest link to the underground.</span> <span id="s1575">But it might also have been word of mouth.</span> <span id="s1576">I -- I couldn’t tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1577">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1578">Was Hans connected with the underground at all as time went on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: He wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">Q: Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: He was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">Q: Did you fall in love with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">A: Yeah, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: I thought I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: And now you think it wasn’t that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Well, we were pretty close together and at that age, what do they call it?</span> <span id="s1592">Puppy love.</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1594">And so that’s what you think it was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">Q: But this must have been good for you in some way?</span> <span id="s1597">No?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: No, it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Oh, it wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Because a-at that time, he didn’t fall in love with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">A: We were close friends, but he didn't fall in love with me until after the war.</span> <span id="s1603">He had the close friend who came, and he paid attention to me, and Hans became jealous.</span> <span id="s1604">And then Hans decided he was in love with me, and we were going to get married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: You were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1607">Hans was going to get the job at sea, and then he’d pick me up, and then get married, and I’d be in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1608">But just the fact that he was at sea, he wrote me pretty soon that he saw a girl in Hamburg, and they were going to get married.</span> <span id="s1609">And that was that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: And that was the end.</span> <span id="s1611">So he wrote -- this is after the war, he wrote to you and said this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1613">For a long time he wrote almost like we are going to get married.</span> <span id="s1614">I mean, that was really the real thing, but then suddenly came that letter that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">A: And he saw this girl in Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">Q: But you remained in love with him for -- you were pretty constant?</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">A: Yeah, I was pretty constant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I was pretty constant, but I was -- but his friend was really the better one, only at the time I didn’t realize it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: His friend was better for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: His friend was better for me than Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">Q: Than Hans, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1624">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: Was he your first boyfriend?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: You could say that.</span> <span id="s1627">When I was still in school, there was a minister living upstairs with his family and he took in borders, medical students a lot.</span> <span id="s1628">And he had a nephew coming in who was my age.</span> <span id="s1629">And nephew and I talked a little bit about things.</span> <span id="s1630">That -- that was the closest I came to a boyfriend --</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: -- at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1634">Now that your mother is no longer alive, is -- does Tante Toos become a -- a mother figure for the two of you, or do you become the mother of Hedy at this point?</span> <span id="s1635">I mean, what -- what -- what happens now that your mother is not there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">A: My father had always said, if something happens to everybody, that I should take care of my little sister.</span> <span id="s1637">Tante Toos felt that she was the mother, and it made her feel good.</span> <span id="s1638">And -- and Hedy responded very -- very well to her, but it was I who had to take her to the doctor, it was I who had to go downtown with her, get her new clothes, and she get her shoes repolished.</span> <span id="s1639">I was really closer so far as care giving is concerned.</span> <span id="s1640">And Tante Toos was -- she gave us a roof over our head and food to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">Q: But now you’re talking about the time when the war is over, when you can leave.</span> <span id="s1642">I’m wondering before the war is over --</span></p> <p><span id="s1643">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: And you’re still in the house --</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: -- and you can’t go out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: No, not yet, and half an -- about four months later, Uncle John died.</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Uh-huh, after your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Yeah, after my mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Was very short, yeah.</span> <span id="s1652">We lost two people.</span> <span id="s1653">But Uncle John was old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Was old.</span> <span id="s1655">How old do you think he was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1656">A: I think he was 82, and was very much paralyzed --</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: -- by strokes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: And he couldn’t speak very well, and he had to be helped to bed, and to the bathroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: And f -- we fed [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: Did -- did you spend time with him as well, or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Well, he was always sitting in his chair.</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: So when we came to the living room to eat, he was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">A: He was always there when we were in the living room, although on a one to one relationship with him, I think none of us had.</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1670">And was he the -- the only husband of Tante Toos?</span> <span id="s1671">This is -- this is the father of Hans?</span> <span id="s1672">So it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: And Hans has -- had two half brothers from that first wife.</span> <span id="s1676">Two half brothers and one half sister, and the half sister -- the brothers were caught in the Dutch East Indies.</span> <span id="s1677">They were caught by the Japanese.</span> <span id="s1678">And the [indecipherable] sister, she lived in the city not too far, and she also came to visit Tante Toos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1680">Okay.</span> <span id="s1681">So when -- when you were in the house, a-again, now that the -- Tante Toos’s husband is dead, and your mother is dead, does she become more of a mother figure inside the house, or she remains the same for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: She remains the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: She remains the same.</span> <span id="s1684">And do you begin to take even more care of Hedy even though you’re -- you’re in the house?</span> <span id="s1685">Is that difficult for you?</span> <span id="s1686">I mean, you’re now -- how old are you?</span> <span id="s1687">You’re 16 in 1944, and she’s eight.</span> <span id="s1688">That’s a big responsibility as a 16 year old, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">Q: Did you resent it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: No.</span> <span id="s1694">Because she -- she was not a brat at the time, and she realized what was going on.</span> <span id="s1695">And on top of that, after the war, when she went to school, she became very ill with whooping cough and pneumonia, and she had to spend several months in the hospital, several months before it all cleared up, because we were all undernourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s1697">That -- was that last year a very difficult year because it was such a bad winter in 1944 and ’45 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: -- in -- in -- in the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: Yes, it was a very bad year because the Germans, as they withdrew, took all the food from the farmers, everything they could.</span> <span id="s1701">And all -- all the art that they could find, and sometimes they burned houses behind them as they withdrew.</span> <span id="s1702">And we were isolated.</span> <span id="s1703">Whatever food there was went to the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: So how did you get food?</span> <span id="s1705">What did you eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">A: We got one little loaf of bread, from whatever that was made we don’t know.</span> <span id="s1707">And maybe two potatoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: This is a week?</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: And that -- but Tante Toos had connections, you see, and she had connections with people who sold eel, smoked eel, which is a delicacy in Holland, and with people who ha -- had the pastry shop.</span> <span id="s1710">And maybe a baker.</span> <span id="s1711">Couple of people that she changed then her little bit of gin or whatever it was, because she got less, too, she exchanged it then for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Was she still getting these ration -- with this fake ration books, so she could use it, or was that not even done any more?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: After the war I don’t think we had them any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: But it still went throughout -- until the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">Q: But it became harder and harder --</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">Q: -- to [indecipherable] food.</span> <span id="s1721">Do you -- do you remember being very hungry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: No.</span> <span id="s1725">Actually, when I came in there, and I had to stay in the house, like [indecipherable] I got very heavy, and when there was not so much food, my weight dropped, and I was not sorry.</span> <span id="s1726">But I didn’t realize that I was undernourished.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: It came out later on in different ways, but no I didn’t really feel -- that the worst feeling was of being isolated, knowing that the other kids were growing up and going through the classes, and seeing the wa -- the professors, and social life, and it was out.</span> <span id="s1729">I didn’t have it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: So you felt deprived?</span> <span id="s1731">A: I felt very much deprived that way.</span> <span id="s1732">Of course I missed my father, too.</span> <span id="s1733">We were very close.</span> <span id="s1734">Yeah, I felt out of it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: You felt out of it?</span> <span id="s1736">But around you, you were seeing a s -- a -- a kind of normalcy of the non-Jews --</span></p> <p><span id="s1737">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1738">Q: -- of those wh-who were not being oppressed.</span> <span id="s1739">Do you think it was so easy for them?</span> <span id="s1740">Or that it was more n -- it was normal, what -- in other words, the people who weren’t hiding like you, were they living a more normal life as far as you were you concerned?</span> <span id="s1741">Do you think?</span></p> <p><span id="s1742">A: Well, not a hundred percent.</span> <span id="s1743">Socially they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1744">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1745">A: That’s what I was thi -- I felt isolated from the other kids --</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">Q: Kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1747">A: -- who were growing up, who were going classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Going out together, had picnics together, and got to know people, and here I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1750">Q: Alone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1751">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Did you -- in ’44, given what you were hearing on the radio, did you think the war would be over soon?</span></p> <p><span id="s1753">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">Q: And then it wo -- then it seemed sure that it would be over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">A: Yeah, people have great hopes.</span> <span id="s1758">That’s why it was so difficult in the wintertime when there was no food, and people had hope.</span> <span id="s1759">Somehow the Red Cross in Sweden could get airplanes over Holland and throw down white bread, a couple of times, during that bad time.</span> <span id="s1760">How they got there, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1761">Was dangerous.</span> <span id="s1762">But -- and even after the war, they helped us out with white, good bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Do you remember the Nazis leaving the Netherlands?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: No, all I knew was that we didn’t hear any more stories about them.</span> <span id="s1767">And toward the end there, there was -- well, Tante Toos says come out on the street, that is very quiet, is nobody here.</span> <span id="s1768">A-And that must have been May the fourth, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1769">So we went out on the street, it was quiet, no tanks, no heavy footsteps, those German marching footsteps.</span> <span id="s1770">And it was just uncanny.</span> <span id="s1771">So that’s when we knew there are something going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">Q: And it -- obviously they seemed not to be there, so something was up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">A: They seemed not to be there any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1775">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: Betsy, could you re-describe the scene when Tante to -- Toos says it’s clear, there’s n -- there’s nobody here, come out.</span> <span id="s1780">What -- what did -- what is it that you see?</span> <span id="s1781">Do other people start coming out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Q: So describe the scene that you -- that you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">A: Well, it’s tra -- it’s a very wide street in a newer -- ne -- at that time, newer part of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1785">And there are s-stores all on the first floor, and apartments on top of the store.</span> <span id="s1786">And people came out of the doors [indecipherable] talking to each other, exchanging news.</span> <span id="s1787">There’s one thing that happened during the war that I think that it made me a whole different person.</span> <span id="s1788">The Germans were going through that town again, looking for Jews, and they were in our street th -- for the first time.</span> <span id="s1789">And we were about two houses -- two stores away from the end of the block.</span> <span id="s1790">So they came from the other side and searched all the houses, and when they reached the end of the block before ours, they stopped, they were finished.</span> <span id="s1791">They went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: They just left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: Well, that was not yet when they withdrew, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1794">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1795">A: -- they were still doing their jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1797">But they didn’t come to your street.</span></p> <p><span id="s1798">A: They didn't come to that block.</span> <span id="s1799">Now, I think that’s a wonder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1800">Q: And what was the street named that you were hiding on.</span> <span id="s1801">What were -- were -- were Tante Toos living?</span></p> <p><span id="s1802">A: Jan Svertsenstraat.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">Q: And that was in this -- in the -- the new --</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">A: Newer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Newer part of Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: Of Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">Q: Is that in the south of Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: Southwest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: Southwest.</span> <span id="s1812">So when are you sure that the Germans are gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">A: I think the ships in the harbor, they started blowing the horns.</span> <span id="s1814">And at -- that -- that was announced over the radio.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: So do you remember feeling relieved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">A: Yes, sure.</span> <span id="s1817">But you know, I thought how wonderful, the war is over.</span> <span id="s1818">It was a terrible war, now we are always going to have peace.</span> <span id="s1819">That’s what I really thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: It’s understandable.</span> <span id="s1821">You’ve been disappointed, I would gather, yes.</span> <span id="s1822">What did you thi -- what was one of the first things that you did?</span> <span id="s1823">Did Tante Toos want to adopt you when the war was over?</span> <span id="s1824">Did you s -- did you speak about staying with her, or -- or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">A: This is a long story.</span> <span id="s1826">Again, we hadn’t talked about it.</span> <span id="s1827">It was -- we were going to stay with her until we went to Uncle Alfred.</span> <span id="s1828">But during this time, I went to see -- me and my friend who wasn’t supposed to walk with me in the star, where she was.</span> <span id="s1829">Well, her parents had this sort of a -- a sewing hand embroidery store.</span> <span id="s1830">And she was not in the country, she was studying to be a pharmacist somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1831">So I talked to the parents.</span> <span id="s1832">And they asked how we were, and they -- they wanted to know how things were set up, and how we slept, and wh-where the -- see where the coal was, you see, because a basement was usually for coal, anthracite.</span> <span id="s1833">And they were just wondering were we right next to the coal, or what.</span> <span id="s1834">Okay, fine, I-I didn’t see them any more, I didn’t hear from them any more.</span> <span id="s1835">One day a social worker comes in.</span> <span id="s1836">Are Betsy and Hedy Cohen living here?</span> <span id="s1837">Yeah, why?</span> <span id="s1838">Can I see them?</span> <span id="s1839">Sure.</span> <span id="s1840">So she came to us in the back and she said, you cannot stay here.</span> <span id="s1841">This is no way of living for you, in the basement.</span> <span id="s1842">Hans slept in the basement, too.</span> <span id="s1843">There was a partition, curtains.</span> <span id="s1844">And with a young man sleeping there, we find that’s not right.</span> <span id="s1845">And we all put up a big stink.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">Q: And what did y -- this was a she, this social worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s1847">A: The social worker was a she.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: She came that once and told us, and I think there was a phone call that we should go and then there was a letter and how did they know where we were?</span> <span id="s1850">Because of the parents of that -- that friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1851">Q: Was Tante Toos there also when she said these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s1852">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1853">Now she -- she had an answer, she -- she was right up there, and then Hans was there, we all di -- and even Uncle Schaap, and he said no, th-they should stay and -- but that was really something.</span> <span id="s1854">I go to these parents in good will, and they send a social worker out after us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: Now what -- was your intention that -- from the very beginning, was Tante Toos told that if something happened to your parents that you would be contacting your Uncle Alfred and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1857">Q: -- and Aunt Anne is -- Anne is her name, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1858">A: Yeah, uncle and aunt, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1859">Q: What’s her name, the aunt’s name?</span> <span id="s1860">A: The aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1861">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Annie.</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">Q: Annie.</span> <span id="s1864">So Tante Toos knew this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">Q: But here she is being with you folks for three years, living every day --</span></p> <p><span id="s1867">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: -- with you two kids.</span> <span id="s1869">Does she want you to stay?</span> <span id="s1870">Does she not want you to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: I think in a way, she wanted us to stay, because she always kept saying, well, I’m your mother, you know.</span> <span id="s1872">On the other hand, I think that she didn't want that Hans and I would become too close.</span> <span id="s1873">And it turned out that she didn’t want that Hans and any girl became too close.</span> <span id="s1874">So Hans fell in love with a girl who came from the -- a social worker, who came from the East Indies.</span> <span id="s1875">Her family came over -- she -- her family was invited over, the government invited them over to come.</span> <span id="s1876">And Tante Toos was prejudiced against this girl.</span> <span id="s1877">But this was the real girl, so they waited until she died, and then they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: And then got married?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: Huh.</span> <span id="s1881">Now you -- you write to your Uncle Alfred?</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">Q: In Roche -- they’re in Rochester --</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">Q: -- did you know that -- you knew that they were in Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">A: No.</span> <span id="s1887">I wrote to New York City, and somehow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: It got to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: -- it got there, and it’s this American Distribution Committee.</span> <span id="s1890">They were closely connected with them.</span> <span id="s1891">It came out after they died, and my sister con -- correspondent that show that they have helped many Jews to -- to get out somehow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: And we didn’t know a thing about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Now, were you expecting when you wrote to your aunt and uncle, that they would somehow arrange for you to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: You s -- you did.</span> <span id="s1897">And did you want to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1898">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1899">Q: So then why did you write?</span></p> <p><span id="s1900">A: Because my father told me to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1901">Q: And is -- is Hedy too young to know what she wants, did she care that she go to the United States, or she stayed?</span> <span id="s1902">Did it matter to her, do you think?</span> <span id="s1903">Or she didn’t care?</span> <span id="s1904">A: I don’t think she wanted to go either.</span> <span id="s1905">She had made some very good friends.</span> <span id="s1906">And I was very much against it because, well I -- I-I could go back to school.</span> <span id="s1907">I -- I had all my friends, except for [indecipherable] and -- and -- another thing, when -- when my uncle stayed with us, he was -- he was already married, but he was alone, so he was -- he didn’t have too many worries on his mind at that time, except for waiting for his visa.</span> <span id="s1908">And I was crazy about him, because he was a photographer, an amateur photographer, and he did beautiful work.</span> <span id="s1909">And he did all his work himself, in our house, and he showed me what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1910">And I was fascinated, I followed him like a little doggie.</span> <span id="s1911">And I was looking forward to seeing him again.</span> <span id="s1912">It wasn’t the same man any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1913">Q: But you, of course, didn’t know this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1914">A: Didn’t know that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1915">Q: -- un-until you -- until --</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">A: -- I didn’t know, and I didn’t understand it either, and I was -- now I realize he was married, he had to keep a job.</span> <span id="s1917">He came home very irritated often from her -- his job.</span> <span id="s1918">He worked for an optical lens company as an engineer, and he was complaining that they would put the young whippersnappers in there who didn’t know anything and didn’t want to listen to what he had to say.</span> <span id="s1919">He was very uptight.</span> <span id="s1920">He was completely different from -- from what he was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: So when you heard -- did you get a letter that you were going to go to the United States?</span> <span id="s1922">Did you know that they were trying to get --</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: You -- you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1926">Q: So when you got the letter saying here are all the papers, you can come to the United States --</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: -- did you want to just write and say, ah, we-we’re not going to come?</span> <span id="s1929">Or not?</span> <span id="s1930">You -- you -- you were just going to do whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s1931">A: Yes, because my father had said -- told me [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: And that was enough for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">A: Mm, Father and I was very -- we were very close how I felt I had to, if --</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1935">That’s a s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: -- that’s what he said, that that’s what I should do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: Was Tante Toos upset and surprised when you came to her and said we’re actually going?</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: She was upset when the social worker came.</span> <span id="s1939">We all were, but she was terribly upset.</span> <span id="s1940">She was somewhat upset.</span> <span id="s1941">She didn’t take us to the train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">Q: She didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">A: No, she didn’t want to come along, she said she was too nervous.</span> <span id="s1944">So Hans and Uncle Schaap took us to the train station early in the morning, one morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: And did you each have a suitcase?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1947">We also had the trunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: A trunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1950">Now, I don’t know where the pieces of this trunk [indecipherable] any more, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">Q: Did you take anything that your mother had brought?</span> <span id="s1952">Did she bring anything from the house into Tante Toos’s house?</span> <span id="s1953">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">A: No chance.</span> <span id="s1955">They -- evidently they -- they did the basic, most important things.</span> <span id="s1956">Linen, blankets, the beds.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">Q: Your actual beds were in Tante Toos’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">Q: Do you remember them leaving your apartment and getting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1960">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: I don’t know how they got there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: It’s so odd, because you were living in the apartment --</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: -- yes, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: So there was a certain familiarity in Tante Toos’s house because you actually had some of your own things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">Q: So in the trunk are clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">A: And some linen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">Q: And some linen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: And did Tante Toos give you something when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: What did she give you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: She had a little lamp standing on a sewing machine.</span> <span id="s1977">It was a little Arab sitting on the leaves -- some leaves which are gone by now, and some kind of shelter over his head.</span> <span id="s1978">And he was smoking a very long pipe.</span> <span id="s1979">I fell in love with -- I li -- I still do, I like little lamps like that.</span> <span id="s1980">And she knew that, and she gave me the lamp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: And she also gave me yi -- what Jack mentioned, that little windmill.</span> <span id="s1983">Was a little windmill about this big, made out of little sticks of wood.</span> <span id="s1984">But it didn’t withstand the times.</span> <span id="s1985">The boys put the fingers in the window, and pushed it a little bit, and it started falling apart.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: It was old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Well, by now, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: But that was already then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: Even then it was old?</span></p> <p><span id="s1991">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1993">So who took you to the train station if Tante Toos didn’t?</span> <span id="s1994">Did Hans take you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Hans and Uncle Schaap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1997">And did your uncle want to leave as well, or did he not?</span> <span id="s1998">Your Uncle Schaap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1999">A: Did -- did he want to do what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2000">Q: Leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2001">A: Yeah, he thought it was better for us to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s2002">Q: And did he want to leave as well, or he didn’t want to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2003">A: No.</span> <span id="s2004">No, he was an older man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">Q: And was he in hiding in --</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">A: Yes, he was in hiding --</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">Q: -- in the Netherlands also?</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">A: -- somewhere in the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">Q: And he’s your father’s brother.</span> <span id="s2012">His eldest brother, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: He is my father’s cousin’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: -- husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s2016">Q: Father’s cousin’s husband, okay, so he’s not a blood relative.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">A: Not really --</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">A: -- but he behaved like one, that’s for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2020">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: And -- and -- and the wife was the blood relative, and she did not.</span> <span id="s2022">But she is a very, very warm [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2024">But they both survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: Was this one of the few people in the family that survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2028">Uncle Schaap, and Tante Schaap and Betsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2029">Q: And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2030">A: You know, my cousin Betsy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2031">Q: Yes, and that was it.</span> <span id="s2032">And this is a pretty big family that you had.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: It was actually, you call fi -- four brothers and their families.</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: And they all had something in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2036">One brother was a tailor, and he made my father’s suits, because my father had the hunchback.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">A: So that he was actually the only one who could really make a suit for my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: Was it a very severe hunchback?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: It was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2043">Yeah, the story goes that his mother dropped him when he was still very small.</span> <span id="s2044">That’s the story, but there is no -- that’s all we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: That’s it.</span> <span id="s2046">And how did affe -- how did it affect him, do you know?</span> <span id="s2047">Or was it not a very big deal for him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Well, he took it pretty well, he wasn’t complaining.</span> <span id="s2049">No, he was -- I knew [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2051">Did you get sick after the war, or only Hedy got sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: Hedy got si --</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Hedy, Hedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Hedy got sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Sick.</span> <span id="s2056">You didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s2057">A: Well, I got something else.</span> <span id="s2058">I walked in the rain to school, and the top of my shoes were wet, and they were rubbing against the skin of my foot, and they were rubbing it open.</span> <span id="s2059">And it just didn’t heal.</span> <span id="s2060">And I had to stay home, I had to keep my feet up.</span> <span id="s2061">The doctor tried everything under the sun.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">Q: And it didn't heal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">A: It didn’t heal for five months or something like that.</span> <span id="s2064">And the last treatment I remember is that he put silver on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">Q: Silver?</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2067">I read that sometimes it’s used, silver for healing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2069">And did that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2071">Now, I don’t know it -- if that worked, or ba -- but that seemed to ma -- close it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Did you have to stop going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: [indecipherable] so th --</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: There I was again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2077">So you take a train to Marseille, is that where you take the train to?</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2079">Where we took the trains through Brussels and went to Paris, where we stayed a few days.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: Alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: No, we had a -- a -- a -- we call it a -- somebody who oversees a couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: A chaperone?</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: Chap.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: We had the chaperone from the American Distribution Committee.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: And we were about seven of us from Holland and she in charge of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2089">So you stay in par -- did you see Paris at all, at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">A: Paris?</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2092">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: You did.</span> <span id="s2094">Was that nice?</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2096">It was nice because there were from all the fellows who c -- who took us out, and we went to this part of Paris where they have -- I don’t know what you call that again.</span> <span id="s2097">It’s a wheel that goes up and you go in there and sit and you go up and around.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: A Ferris wheel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2101">And you were taken to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: Yeah, I was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2103">Q: That was nice.</span> <span id="s2104">And then from Paris you went where?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: Marseille.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2107">A: And when we came to Marseille, we slept in a wheelhouse.</span> <span id="s2108">Our orphans, the whole group of infan -- orphans, with the different chaperones.</span> <span id="s2109">This was a great big warehouse, and we all slept on the floor that night before we went on the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: And then you get on the ship the next day?</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2112">Q: You didn’t get sick on the ship, did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">A: And how.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Oh, you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I got seasick, but Hedy got sick.</span> <span id="s2116">Yeah, she got bronchitis and pneumonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2118">And you just got seasick, which is pretty awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">A: Yeah, yeah, I was just seasick, but -- I mean, she had to go to the infirmary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2121">And what was wrong with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: She had pneumonia and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2123">Q: And bronchitis.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">A: -- and bronchitis, and they put cups on her back [indecipherable] cups of kind of thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: Did you see this?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2127">And at -- that was still -- is still done in some places, I think.</span> <span id="s2128">But [indecipherable] she got better.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2130">So she was 10 and you were 18 when you left?</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: So you’re already a young woman at 18?</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2136">We --</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2138">And she’s still a kid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: She’s still a kid.</span> <span id="s2140">That’s why it was so easy for her to call Uncle and Aunt Mom and Dad right away.</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">Q: But you couldn’t?</span> <span id="s2142">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2144">Cause you already had a mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2146">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2147">Oh, we have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">Q: What kind of a ship was it that you were on?</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">A: A French -- a converted French freighter.</span> <span id="s2153">And the conversion was done in the place where all the luggage goes.</span> <span id="s2154">What they did was they put beds in there.</span> <span id="s2155">And i-in the middle was a -- a sort of -- it’s almost look like a little podium.</span> <span id="s2156">And on the one side we had the girls, on the other side we had the boys, and there were no curtains or anything, so that -- and the beds were two ba -- on top of each other.</span> <span id="s2157">And -- and it was not -- we had no hot water, we had to wash with s-sea water.</span> <span id="s2158">Well, you can’t wash with sea water.</span> <span id="s2159">It doesn’t -- it just doesn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: It doesn’t work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: -- work.</span> <span id="s2162">And it was crowded, and we were not the only people.</span> <span id="s2163">We -- we orphans were not the only refugees, there were more adult refugees from Poland, and even a professor from Holland who was not a refugee.</span> <span id="s2164">He was going to teach at -- at Boston.</span> <span id="s2165">And we had long discussions because downstairs it was no -- there was no ventilation.</span> <span id="s2166">And so we stayed on that as long as we could, and -- that freighter, when they came to New York there was a big scandal and got into the papers that this ship was converted, but it certainly didn’t have the standards that they were supposed to have.</span> <span id="s2167">And the food was terrible, besides I was seasick, yeah, I didn’t eat much.</span> <span id="s2168">And -- and he was jailed, the captain was jailed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: That was in the New York papers, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: And why was he jailed, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: Because he -- he had this ship, and he took all these people, and he knew -- he was paid for, but he knew that he was way below the standard of a passenger ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: How long were you on the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: Three weeks.</span> <span id="s2175">After one week, one engine died.</span> <span id="s2176">After two weeks, the second engine died.</span> <span id="s2177">And we went on one engine this last part, and that’s why it took so long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: So this wasn’t a great introduction for you, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2180">Q: Did you s -- did you see the Statue of Liberty when you came in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2182">Q: Was that nice to see?</span> <span id="s2183">Was that important in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">A: Yeah, that is exciting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2185">Q: It is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">A: Because that is -- that seemed to us a symbol of the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">A: The United States, the freedom, justice.</span> <span id="s2189">Now, we were standing there, crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Crying, yes?</span> <span id="s2191">And was Hedy okay?</span> <span id="s2192">Was she well by then, by the time you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: She was okay.</span> <span id="s2195">And did she see the Statue of Liberty, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2197">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2198">A: But I don’t think she was impressed by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2199">Q: But you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2200">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2202">And were a lot of people standing outside --</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">A: Oh yes, almost everyone.</span> <span id="s2204">That was the end of the trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s2205">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2206">And who was there to greet you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2207">A: My aunt.</span> <span id="s2208">My uncle was there, but he couldn’t wait for three weeks.</span> <span id="s2209">He -- they couldn’t take three weeks off from work, so he had to go back to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2210">Q: So she waited for three weeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s2211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2212">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2213">A: Because that ship was supposed to come at a certain date, and it didn’t, and she stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2214">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2215">A: We stayed in a hotel after that, but she had friends in -- in New York, and I suppose she stayed with them before we came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2216">Q: But when you came she went to a hotel with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2218">Q: Did you then take a bath?</span></p> <p><span id="s2219">A: Yes, and we learned a lot of things that are different.</span></p> <p><span id="s2220">Q: Like what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">A: Like in -- i-i-in the Netherlands, in the wintertime it gets m -- humid and cold, and people wear woolen underwear and longjohns.</span> <span id="s2222">And [indecipherable] will wear woolen panties.</span> <span id="s2223">And she told us to forget about all that, because we were going to be living in centrally heated houses or buildings, and we would be -- we would not be needing that kind of underwear any more.</span> <span id="s2224">And she told us about deodorant.</span> <span id="s2225">We didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s2226">I guess it wasn’t necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">Q: But now you were supposed to use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2229">And she told us about putting hand lotion on after you -- after you wash your hands, so your skin doesn’t get rough.</span> <span id="s2230">And I think she told us, never go barefoot on the floor, because you get athlete’s foot.</span> <span id="s2231">We never heard of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2232">Q: So is this all before you get to Rochester?</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2234">Q: She’s giving you all these little lessons.</span> <span id="s2235">But you remember her from when she was at your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s2236">A: She was just -- yeah, she was just one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2237">Q: Just one night in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s2238">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2240">But did you recognize her when you saw her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2243">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2244">Q: She looked the same?</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">A: Pretty much.</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">Q: Did you like her, were you comfortable with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">A: N-N-No, not at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: Because -- it’s a story again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2250">Q: That’s fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">A: Tante Annie had sent me from Vienna, a scarf and a very nice little automatic pencil.</span> <span id="s2252">Little, dainty, very nice.</span> <span id="s2253">And she came when she saw me, and she said, you never wrote me a thank you letter.</span> <span id="s2254">I felt so bad.</span> <span id="s2255">This was the greeting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2256">Q: That was the first thing she said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2257">A: And I thought she was awful.</span> <span id="s2258">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: And that’s what you remembered about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: That’s what -- that’s the only thing I remembered from [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2261">And then -- yeah, that’s all I remembered, and I didn’t really know her at all.</span> <span id="s2262">And she didn’t know us, and she had a difficult job.</span> <span id="s2263">And, you know, in retrospect, they never had any kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: So here comes a 10 year old and an 18 year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: And an 18 year old Dutch.</span> <span id="s2266">And I was always called the stubborn Dutch girl, always.</span> <span id="s2267">Hedy is stubborn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">Q: But you were called stubborn?</span> <span id="s2269">A: But I -- I was called the stubborn Dutch girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s2270">Q: Were you stubborn?</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">A: A little bit, but not to -- not of -- much more than anybody else.</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2273">How -- how old -- do you know how old they were when you came?</span> <span id="s2274">Were they much older?</span> <span id="s2275">Were they in their 50’s or 60’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">A: No.</span> <span id="s2279">I think they were -- there was six years between them.</span> <span id="s2280">She must have been maybe 39, and he was in his middle 40’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2281">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: -- I would guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Was she warm to you at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: She was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2286">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2287">And she had written letters to us in Holland --</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">A: -- before we came.</span> <span id="s2290">And in the letters she was very, very warm, yeah.</span> <span id="s2291">And she -- she -- she was warm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2293">So did you come to like her very much?</span> <span id="s2294">Or was that difficult?</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: That was difficult.</span> <span id="s2296">One thing is that I already had most of my manners, and some -- my personality was pretty well formed.</span> <span id="s2297">I mean, it was not that you couldn’t change anything, but it was mo -- more difficult to work with an 18 year old than with a 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: And I -- they always had something to say, everything was wrong.</span> <span id="s2300">They wanted me to be a perfect American girl, the all American girl, one, two, three.</span> <span id="s2301">Hair different, dress different, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: So this was difficult for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Mm.</span> <span id="s2304">It was not difficult for Hedy.</span> <span id="s2305">She fit right in.</span> <span id="s2306">I didn't want to have them harp on me all the time, and they were.</span> <span id="s2307">They wanted to turn me into a very attractive American girl, which I wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">Q: Did you say anything to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">A: No, I did not.</span> <span id="s2310">And that I had left over from the war.</span> <span id="s2311">I felt if I would start saying something, they would throw us out.</span> <span id="s2312">And they wouldn’t have, but that was in my mind.</span> <span id="s2313">One time, when I said -- contradicted Tante Anne, Uncle Alfred came flying down the stairs.</span> <span id="s2314">How did you dare to contradict your Aunt Annie?</span> <span id="s2315">That was the first time that I had said something, I forgot what.</span> <span id="s2316">Yeah, they became quite desperate with me, and I was put in the senior year of the high school, so I could have the American diploma, things would be easier for me.</span> <span id="s2317">And they wanted me to tell them what I wanted to become, what life work I had chosen.</span> <span id="s2318">I had no idea.</span> <span id="s2319">And they had me go to different technical schools, and they told them they -- they told the school principal they didn’t know what to do with me any more, and the counselor.</span> <span id="s2320">And there was a school psychologist who gave me a couple of tests.</span> <span id="s2321">And they told me -- they told them to send me to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">Q: Wait a minute, say this again, they what?</span> <span id="s2323">The -- they -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: This -- they told me to send them -- to send --</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: Send you to college?</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: -- me to college.</span> <span id="s2327">The college was right behind the high school that I went to.</span> <span id="s2328">There was -- and -- and not to worry, and send her to college.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">Q: Did that make you feel good?</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2332">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2333">Of course, I didn’t know exactly what college would be like, because in the Netherlands, when you graduate from the secondary school, you go to the university.</span> <span id="s2334">You are a student already, you are almost a grown up.</span> <span id="s2335">And a college here is not yet for grown ups.</span> <span id="s2336">But I liked it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">Q: What sort of culture shock was there for you in coming to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s2338">A: All the food you could eat, all the bananas everywhere.</span> <span id="s2339">All these pastries all over the place.</span> <span id="s2340">The automatic [indecipherable] we had a little bit of that in Amsterdam, one little spot which [indecipherable] was a great big automatic thing, and oh, I had never seen that before.</span> <span id="s2341">You’ve got -- you know.</span> <span id="s2342">And so many people in the streets, and so -- s-so humid and so hot.</span> <span id="s2343">That was terrible, I ca -- I’m still not used to it.</span> <span id="s2344">It was -- that was New York in September, and it was hot.</span> <span id="s2345">And di -- the department stores, the size of the department stores, there ha -- there are department stores in Holland, but the gigantic sizes here of everything.</span> <span id="s2346">And I still think so when I come in from winter, the distances are bigger, everything is so big and wide.</span> <span id="s2347">And the other culture shock part of it was that I was -- I couldn’t speak too well yet, but I heard what all the other girls were saying [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2348">They were saying, oh I’m so tired, oh I’m so tired.</span> <span id="s2349">I got to say that later too, but at that time -- and then they were talking about, did you see him?</span> <span id="s2350">He asked me out for Saturday, and did you see her clothes?</span> <span id="s2351">They didn’t fit at all.</span> <span id="s2352">Well, I -- I couldn’t understand how 16 - 17 year old girls could talk like that.</span> <span id="s2353">They are more mature in Holland.</span> <span id="s2354">They were.</span> <span id="s2355">Things have changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: But at that time, when you were 16 - 17, you were pretty serious student, no matter where you were.</span> <span id="s2358">And you -- and you don’t talk about somebody else’s clothes, or -- or guys, or -- yeah, guys of course, once in awhile, but not all the time.</span> <span id="s2359">And they never talked about a book they had read, or more serious things.</span> <span id="s2360">And I could not -- I could not understand it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Do you understand it now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2363">Well, I see where they’re coming from.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: And I think some of them have become more serious, some of the teenagers, because of the conditions we find ourselves in now.</span> <span id="s2366">They realize it.</span> <span id="s2367">But, of course, that was a pretty golden time for the States, 1950 -- 1946 - 1947.</span> <span id="s2368">They had everything they wanted.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Were you very unhappy when you came here, and stayed in wa -- Rochester?</span> <span id="s2370">Did that make you unhappy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2371">A: I had no say over it.</span> <span id="s2372">It was the only thing we could do.</span> <span id="s2373">No, it didn’t make me happy, but I -- but what were we going to do?</span> <span id="s2374">We had to do what Uncle and Aunt told us to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2376">A: I know they had a difficult job, but they really left me with the feeling that I am not smart enough, I don’t work fast enough, I -- if I don’t have a date calling back it’s my fault.</span> <span id="s2377">And after I left the house and went to private school, what did they say to my sister?</span> <span id="s2378">Why don’t you study?</span> <span id="s2379">Betsy always studied.</span> <span id="s2380">Why don’t you do this well?</span> <span id="s2381">Betsy always did that well.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: That’s what they said --</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: To Hedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: -- to Hedy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: After I left the house, and I was in Cleveland then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2386">Q: And did Hedy tell you that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2387">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2388">Q: -- this was what they were saying?</span> <span id="s2389">You must have been shocked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2390">A: Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s2391">It -- it even worked in -- in college.</span> <span id="s2392">It just so happened the French professor liked me, and -- and Hedy didn’t s -- ma -- she didn’t work as seriously, maybe.</span> <span id="s2393">I don’t know how she worked, I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2394">But Hedy told me that my French professor told her, what’s the matter of you?</span> <span id="s2395">You’re Betsy’s sister, why -- why can’t you learn that?</span> <span id="s2396">All that happened afterward, but it’s already done damage.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: Did -- did you ever tell them, later on, when you were no longer in the house, what it felt like?</span> <span id="s2398">Or you never did?</span></p> <p><span id="s2399">A: I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2400">Q: They also told you not to speak about your experiences, am I correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">A: True.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">Q: What did they tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">A: Oh, don’t tell anybody, because nobody will understand.</span> <span id="s2404">Nobody who didn’t go through these things personally, they don’t have any idea what you’re talking about.</span> <span id="s2405">They won’t understand it.</span> <span id="s2406">You may as well not talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2407">Q: Did they ask you?</span> <span id="s2408">So you told them what happened?</span> <span id="s2409">Di -- I mean, did they ask you to explain what had happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s2410">To them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">A: Uncle and Aunt?</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2413">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: So they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Not an awful lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: They wanted me to forget about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2419">It was said to a lot of people who came, wasn’t it?</span> <span id="s2420">Don’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2421">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: I don’t know anybody else to whom it was said.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2425">Did that make you feel bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2427">Well, I wasn't going to shout it around.</span> <span id="s2428">I wasn’t going to make that a subject of a discussion.</span> <span id="s2429">Didn’t have to tell me that, but the fact that I really wasn’t supposed to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">A: -- yeah, it bothered me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Did -- did people at school as you what happened during the war, or was it as if -- I don’t know, the war happened to other people, it was never the people that you were me -- do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s2433">It was if it was a blank time.</span> <span id="s2434">So did any of the students say to you, you were in the Netherlands, what happened?</span> <span id="s2435">No.</span> <span id="s2436">Not the teachers?</span> <span id="s2437">Nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: Nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: So di -- did you keep thinking about it, or did you also try to get rid of it in some -- in some way?</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: No, I didn't try to get rid of it, but I didn’t wa -- I wasn't preoccupied with it any more at all.</span> <span id="s2441">I was -- I became preoccupied with the school work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">A: And no, I wasn’t.</span> <span id="s2444">My father -- I missed my father all along.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: More than your mother, it was your father that you kept thinking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2446">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2447">I missed him awfully much.</span> <span id="s2448">It wasn’t until I got married that -- that that stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: It stopped.</span> <span id="s2450">And you met your husband in Cleveland when you were going to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">Q: And did he ask you about it?</span> <span id="s2453">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: He did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: But that was not so good, because now I don’t like going over the border, being asked where I’m going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">Q: You don’t like to a -- you don’t like to be to -- asked where you’re going.</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">A: Where I’m going, wh-where -- who am I visiting.</span> <span id="s2458">That’s what we are asked at the border.</span> <span id="s2459">And on the way back, what did you bring, who gave you something, what was it, what was the value?</span> <span id="s2460">I don’t like that.</span> <span id="s2461">And that is from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: It reminds you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2465">Hm.</span> <span id="s2466">We have to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Betsy, when -- when did you actually start talking about your experiences during the war?</span> <span id="s2470">Only in the f-family, or did you talk in di -- in other places?</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: I did a little bit in college, because people would ask, where were you during the war -- the Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: So I told them I was hidden during the war.</span> <span id="s2474">Just Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2475">And my doctor in Windsor somehow knew about it through Roseanne because he’s ro -- my daughter --</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2477">A: -- he’s her doctor, too, and he -- he went down and sat with me and wanted to know everything, before, you know, he became [indecipherable] and wanted to know how it was and how I felt.</span> <span id="s2478">Yes, in college I didn’t do much about.</span> <span id="s2479">I told you I spoke at the PTA meeting once, but I -- yes, I was asked to speak at the PTA meeting when I was in high school, but I was asked to speak about Holland.</span> <span id="s2480">So I had to do research because things had changed already.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: So I spoke about Holland, but not about my experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">Q: Did you -- when you -- when your kids were born -- you have three children, did you -- when they reached a certain age, did you tell them about your experiences?</span> <span id="s2484">Or only when they were older?</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">A: Well, they all knew about it, but gee, I don’t remember if I told them, or my husband.</span> <span id="s2486">They all had different reactions, though.</span> <span id="s2487">No, I don’t think I went down and sa -- and told them, like you know, like we are talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: No.</span> <span id="s2490">No.</span> <span id="s2491">But then the boys got older and they started asking more questions and then I gave them more answers.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2493">But you say that they all have different reactions.</span> <span id="s2494">What are the -- what are the different reactions that they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s2495">A: Jack is very interested in the experiences.</span> <span id="s2496">He also wants to see where I went to grade school.</span> <span id="s2497">He wants to see the house we were in, and the Germans next door.</span> <span id="s2498">And by the way, in that house, in the front room under the floor are still several jars of jam that my mother put there, but she never had the chance to get them out.</span> <span id="s2499">And if nobody changed that floor, they are still there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: They are still there.</span> <span id="s2501">This is the original, the -- the house that you grew up in?</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">A: No, that was the house where we lived before the hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2503">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2505">The offices were downstairs, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: -- I don’t -- I don’t think she had any help, I think she did that all by herself.</span> <span id="s2508">Cut -- cut the piece out of the floor and put the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: Put the jam in.</span> <span id="s2510">Why did she put it there?</span></p> <p><span id="s2511">A: Well, you were not supposed to horde any more, so that was one reason.</span> <span id="s2512">And she wanted to have it, though.</span> <span id="s2513">She thought it was important to have.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2515">Hm.</span> <span id="s2516">And Roseanne, what’s her response?</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: I don’t want to be Jewish any more, because I don’t want to go to a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2518">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2519">A: Now that was all the way through, all the way through until maybe just a year ago.</span> <span id="s2520">She has a 10 year old daughter who sings in a choir, and the choir is the Windsor [indecipherable] opera choir, so everybody’s in there.</span> <span id="s2521">And Roseanne thought around Christmastime there were too many songs about Jesus.</span> <span id="s2522">And she told them so.</span> <span id="s2523">She said, I don’t do Christmas, I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s2524">You shouldn’t just think -- but Roseanne has a way of saying things [indecipherable] make angry.</span> <span id="s2525">So now she’s got to come to a meeting, there are going to be board members there of that opera situation.</span> <span id="s2526">Now, that’s the first time that she has come forward to say that she’s Jewish.</span> <span id="s2527">Before that, she didn’t want to have anything to do with it.</span> <span id="s2528">She didn’t even look for Jewish guys ever, ever.</span> <span id="s2529">She had two bad marriages.</span> <span id="s2530">Mark, that’s the middle one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">Q: That’s your son, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2532">A: He was very interested.</span> <span id="s2533">He was very interested.</span> <span id="s2534">He went to Israel when he graduated from college and he stopped in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2535">My cousin was still alive, my cousin Betsy.</span> <span id="s2536">And he wanted her to take him to the old [indecipherable] synagogue there that I-I even haven’t seen.</span> <span id="s2537">And he wanted to know a lot about the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2538">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: But he has become ultra-Orthodox, and so now he’s more interested in making me Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2540">But he has the empathy.</span> <span id="s2541">He definitely has the empathy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">Q: Mm-hm, for your experience, uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2544">He is a very sensitive person, he ought to be a social worker or a psychologist, but he cleans the shule.</span></p> <p><span id="s2545">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2546">And he lives in Israel?</span> <span id="s2547">He lives in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2548">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2549">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2550">A: With eight children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2551">Q: Eight?</span></p> <p><span id="s2552">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2553">He lives in -- on the West Bank, the disputed territory.</span> <span id="s2554">And I’m the mother, so excuse me, but I think Mark is very smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: He’s very smart?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: So is Jack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2557">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2558">A: But Mark is in a different way.</span> <span id="s2559">He seems to pick it up out of the air.</span> <span id="s2560">He was good student, and he’s just that smart.</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">Q: So let me ask you, you -- you were not feeling very much Jewish identity during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2562">A: No.</span> <span id="s2563">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2564">Q: What about after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2565">A: Passover?</span></p> <p><span id="s2566">Q: No, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2567">A: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s2568">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2569">A: Well, e-everything changed.</span> <span id="s2570">All I knew was matzoh at Passover, no bread.</span> <span id="s2571">And not going to school during the high holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s2572">And that’s all I knew.</span> <span id="s2573">Oh, I also knew that Jews sometimes ate different foods, but I didn’t know how different until we came to the States and Uncle and Aunt -- Uncle being Mother’s brother, being family of Schwartz’s [indecipherable] was pretty religious.</span> <span id="s2574">And they belonged to the Conservative synagogue.</span> <span id="s2575">And we had to stay home from school and go to all the services.</span></p> <p><span id="s2576">Q: So was this part of your culture shock?</span></p> <p><span id="s2577">A: No.</span> <span id="s2578">What disappointed me was that the women had to sit on the balcony, and there was no air conditioning, and it was September in Rochester and it was hot.</span> <span id="s2579">I thought I’d die.</span> <span id="s2580">And so there was so much Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2581">I hadn’t learned any Hebrew.</span> <span id="s2582">Now I’m beginning to feel I should know more, but at that time, they talk Hebrew, well, I was daydreaming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2583">Q: Did they send you to Hebrew school?</span></p> <p><span id="s2584">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2585">Q: They didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2586">A: You mean in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2587">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2588">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2589">Q: In Rochester, when you moved there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2590">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2591">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2592">Did they send ha --</span></p> <p><span id="s2593">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2594">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2595">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2596">Q: Neither of you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2597">A: But Hedy became a Sunday school teacher in the Reform synagogue because she got to know some guy.</span> <span id="s2598">And so he got -- she became a Sunday school teacher, so she learned very much more about Judaism quickly, where she start keeping to everything.</span> <span id="s2599">And like I said, with Uncle and Aunt, I learned -- bagels were new, bagels I had never heard of.</span> <span id="s2600">And -- and -- and smoked he -- smoked salmon, I didn’t know anything about.</span> <span id="s2601">And such thing as [indecipherable], which my husband’s sister make very good [indecipherable] and I -- I had never, never seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: Did you like it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2604">And the only way you could eat matzohs in Holland was with butter and sugar over it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">Q: Butter and sugar?</span></p> <p><span id="s2606">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2607">Very fine sugar.</span> <span id="s2608">Not powdered sugar, a sugar in between.</span> <span id="s2609">And that does taste good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2610">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s2611">I’ll try it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2613">Q: So do you think that in s -- that because of being in this household where it was more religious than you grew up, that you became more identified with je -- with Judaism, or it’s just that you were -- it was clear you were Jewish and that was it?</span> <span id="s2614">Were -- did you -- did you go to synagogue more once you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: Yes, I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: And the reason why I did, and especially [indecipherable] they had Rabbi Phil Bernstein, and Philip Bernstein wrote a book which is called, “What do Jews Believe?”</span> <span id="s2618">It wa -- it was a long time ago, but it was a bestseller.</span> <span id="s2619">And his sermons were just out of this world.</span> <span id="s2620">So I went out of my own will, I went every Friday in my last year of college, cause he was inspiring.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: Well, that’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: And when you got married, did you go to synagogue?</span> <span id="s2624">Or did you send your kids to synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">A: We always landed in a neighborhood that was far from the Jewish community, because we moved around a lot.</span> <span id="s2626">And even in Windsor, I lived in Windsor east, the Jews lived in Windsor south, but we couldn’t afford the homes there.</span> <span id="s2627">So the children were really not exposed much, except that we sent Jack and Mark to Sunday school in Mansfield at the time, which was about 12 miles away from us, Mansfield, Ohio.</span> <span id="s2628">And Jack was ready to be Bar-Mitzvahed, but he didn’t want to be Bar-Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s2629">And when Mark was in college, he became almost a born again Christian.</span> <span id="s2630">He happened to have a friend who was, and his friend’s mother and I met through unusual circumstances and became close friends.</span> <span id="s2631">But she got Mark.</span> <span id="s2632">She got them to go with her to Washington to the Peace March and all the things that they do.</span> <span id="s2633">And my husband said, I don’t like that.</span> <span id="s2634">And then my husband read in the Jewish news that there was going to be some kind of Jewish meeting in New York City, but you didn’t know how Jewish.</span> <span id="s2635">So he went there, and he met Rabbi Hecht.</span> <span id="s2636">Rabbi Hecht was very ultra-Orthodox, and he was -- his work was to reach out to the students.</span> <span id="s2637">And he got Mark.</span> <span id="s2638">And now Mark is Orthodox.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: And it’s really unusual because we -- we didn’t have mu-much contact with Jewish people when we -- in Cleveland, yeah.</span> <span id="s2641">But then, when we had to move to those small communities, there were hardly any Jews.</span> <span id="s2642">And it was a hardship to take him every Sunday to Sunday school, especially if one of them didn't want to.</span> <span id="s2643">So Roseanne was not very much -- we couldn’t show her very mu -- didn’t show her very much.</span> <span id="s2644">But she had her own reasons for not wanting to be Jewish, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2645">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2646">A: So that’s how it worked with the kids.</span> <span id="s2647">I think Jack identifies with us as being Jewish, but he wanted to show his daughter what the high holidays were like, and he brought her to a synagogue in L.A., and they told him you can’t come in unless you pay 500 dollars.</span> <span id="s2648">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2649">Q: And that was the end.</span> <span id="s2650">Have you ever talked about your experiences to schoolchildren, have you ever been invited to do that, or wanted to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2651">A: No.</span> <span id="s2652">But the Jewish center got to know about me through Mark, who was a -- a member there, active member.</span> <span id="s2653">A-An -- and -- and -- and about my -- he talked about my background, and they have a Yom HaShoah -- they have a few days ago in the Conservative synagogue, the Reform, and there’s little one, ultra-Orthodox.</span> <span id="s2654">And some [indecipherable] in town, and they have some kind of ceremony where we have to -- the -- the survivors have to go up on the stage, and they have to turn on a candle.</span> <span id="s2655">And they don’t say who they are -- we are, but we are the survivors, and so I was called by the Jewish Center to take part.</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: Are you pleased that there is so much publicity about the Holocaust now that -- that there are more programs on television, that there’s more written about it than when you first came?</span> <span id="s2657">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2658">Q: You are.</span></p> <p><span id="s2659">A: What upsets me now is that there are people who still don’t believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2660">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2661">How do you think this experience has affected you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">A: It’s going to affect me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">Q: No.</span> <span id="s2664">How has it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: That I was very angry, cause it was the -- the minister of one of the western provinces who said -- he was Dutch -- it never happened.</span> <span id="s2666">An-And -- and he s -- he was -- made anti-Semitic speeches, but when he said it never happened, I was thinking, what can I do about that?</span> <span id="s2667">Yeah, I didn't like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2668">Q: When -- when you think about your life now, and you think about what it was like for you in the Netherlands because of the war, and because you were in hiding, do you think that changed you very much?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Do you think it affected you a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2672">Q: And -- and how -- how would you explain what it did to you?</span> <span id="s2673">Do -- do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2674">A: Well, I knew that Tante Toos’s brother-in-law said, get rid of them.</span> <span id="s2675">And I just figured if -- if we would make trouble, and -- and make things difficult for Tante Toos in some way, like my mom did at times, we would be thrown out on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2676">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2677">A: And that feeling has been with me all the time.</span> <span id="s2678">I don’t want to antagonize people because I’m afraid they’ll throw me out on the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s2679">Q: So you don’t want to fight, you don’t want to argue.</span></p> <p><span id="s2680">A: No.</span> <span id="s2681">And -- and -- and my kids are the opposite, all three.</span> <span id="s2682">They say what -- what they think.</span> <span id="s2683">I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Still you -- you still don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: Actu -- I say what I think, but if it’s going to make friction, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: You don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2687">A: No.</span> <span id="s2688">And like I said, I don’t like border inspection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2689">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2690">A: Stuff like that.</span> <span id="s2691">And I also horde.</span> <span id="s2692">Once in awhile Windsor cannot sell a product and slowly it will go off the shelves.</span> <span id="s2693">And when I notice that, and it is something that I’m using, I horde.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: So what are you hoarding now?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: I -- I have a couple of pieces of Caress soap.</span> <span id="s2696">They took that off the Windsor market, but I understand it’s still [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: Right, it’s here.</span> <span id="s2698">Shall we send you some?</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">A: Oh no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">A: I still have about five big pieces.</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2703">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">A: That should go me awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: Do you think that the -- do you think that the war harmed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2706">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2707">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2708">A: You know how isolated I felt, and now, afterward, I’m -- I’m just very shy.</span> <span id="s2709">I’m not aggressive, I’m not self assertive at all because for one, I -- I don’t bump and rock the boat.</span> <span id="s2710">And for another, I
