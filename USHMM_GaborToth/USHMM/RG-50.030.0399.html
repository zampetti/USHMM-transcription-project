was educated in Russian school, and the Russian university.</span> <span id="s36">So family was not religious.</span> <span id="s37">I would say assimilated Jews.</span> <span id="s38">We spoke -- at home we spoke Russian and on the streets we spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s39">My father was born in Wilna to aristocratic family.</span> <span id="s40">When he was young he belonged to a sor -- not a communist, but a social revolution -- revolutionist party, and he was even expelled from the last grade of gymnasium.</span> <span id="s41">But because he was a brilliant student, they allowed him to pass the last exams -- exam, by himself at special ec -- exams.</span> <span id="s42">He passed it brilliantly, and he was accepted to the University of San Petra -- Petrabuk -- Saint Peterburg, I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s43">And then he finished there -- he -- he didn’t finish the Petraburg University, he studied there two year -- for two years, and then I don’t know on which family reasons, they -- they left Russia for Poland -- but Poland was also Russia then, Poland was occupied by Russians.</span> <span id="s44">And he finished at Technical University in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s45">He finished it and I saw the diploma in ghetto, actually.</span> <span id="s46">Was a diploma with a gold medal.</span> <span id="s47">But he couldn’t find a -- a job as an engineer, but it

have a picture of him, I don’t know where it is [indecipherable] actually, with the university sign, you know.</span> <span id="s50">And then after war he came with his family to Wilna, back to Wilna, because they run from the Germans, even on the first World War, to Russia, and they came back after war and Wilna became Poland again.</span> <span id="s51">And he couldn’t find a job as engineer, he started to teach mathematics and physics.</span> <span id="s52">Course this is -- was his -- his field.</span> <span id="s53">He finished mathematics and physics in technical school.</span> <span id="s54">He was a teacher of high school gymnasium, and then he went to stu -- to teach at the sch -- technical school, and the techni -- then he was a principal of the technical school.</span> <span id="s55">It was -- I think it was only one technical school in Poland which were especially for Jewish students because all the subjects were taught in -- in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s56">And my father didn’t know Yiddish before, yeah.</span> <span id="s57">So he -- he learned, he learned Yiddish and had a very fine Yiddish, very clear, very good pronounce [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s58">And he was the principal, the director of the school until the World War ІІ broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: What -- what is your father’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: My father’s name is Matthias.</span> <span id="s61">Matthias Shreyber.</span> <span id="s62">My mother was also very high educated lady.</span> <span id="s63">She finished the Russian gymnasium, then she finished a course of -- I think that -- that the women were not allowed to -- to stay in -- at uni -- at the university, so they -- it was a organized in Russia, a course for a -- higher courses for women.</span> <span id="s64">So she finished chemistry, something with -- with chemistry now.</span> <span id="s65">But she haven’t worked.</span> <span id="s66">She was running the house and the children.</span> <span id="s67">She knew seven languages.</span> <span id="s68">Yeah.</span> <span id="s69">English and Italian, and German was her mother tongue.</span> <span id="s70">My grandmother was from Berlin.</span> <span id="s71">She married a Polish Jew, and she came to Wilna with my -- but she spoke only German at home and my mother’s first language was German, but because she was educated in Russian schools, so with my father, at home with us, she spoke Russian.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: What was your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: My mother’s name Valentina.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: Zhouk.</span> <span id="s76">Valentina Zhouk.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: How did your parents meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: My mother was friendly with a owner of a -- this was a private Jewish school, a gymnasium, a very good ha -- very good [indecipherable] gymnasium, private.</span> <span id="s79">My -- my father was a teacher there, so she once came there and they met.</span> <span id="s80">She told me she fell in love with him at once, he was a very handsome man.</span> <span id="s81">And that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: What do you remember about being a young, young girl i-in the house?</span> <span id="s83">What wa -- what was -- what was a day like, or a meal like?</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: My father insisted that me and my brother, we have to attend a Yiddish school, a progressive Yiddish school, and we spoke -- with my brother, I spoke Yiddish, because we -- we -- we -- we thought that my mother doesn’t understand it, but because she knew very well German, and Yiddish is -- if you know Yiddish you understand German, if you know German, you can’t understand not everything, not -- but the meaning of the sentence you can understand in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s85">My brother was five years o-older, a very handsome and very, very good natured boy.</span> <span id="s86">And I was not so good natured, and I used to argue with him and fight with him.</span> <span id="s87">I think he hated me.</span> <span id="s88">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s89">I was not a good one.</span> <span id="s90">I was always --</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: [indecipherable] tell us his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: His name was

id="s99">Nothing.</span> <span id="s100">And at school they were educated also very secular and it’s a pity, I think.</span> <span id="s101">We lost something, because I -- I don’t know any of the Jewish holidays -- I didn’t know -- now I know, coming back to Canada so I know when it’s Rosh Hashanah and Passover, and Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s102">I didn’t know before.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Can you talk a little bit about your neighborhood, what that was like and whether or not there were other Jewish families, or non-Jewish families?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Yeah, it was a mixed neighborhood.</span> <span id="s105">There were Jewish families over there, but not a lot.</span> <span id="s106">And it was a neighbor -- it was not a very good neighborhood because my grandfather had a factory, and he wanted to build his house -- he has a factory, so it was such a -- if you can say industrial neighborhood more or less.</span> <span id="s107">It was not a beautiful neighborhood, but our house was beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: The grandfather was on your mother’s side, or your father’s side?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: On my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s110">On my father’s side, he was a rabbiner.</span> <span id="s111">It’s not a rabbi, but a rabbiner of the city of Wilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What -- what does that mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: You know, exactly I don’t know za -- but I know that he like provided his papers like birth certificates and marriage certificates and he had the -- the

either side?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: The first name, I think it was Abraham Shreyber.</span> <span id="s117">I don’t know my grandmother’s name.</span> <span id="s118">I know that -- oho -- his -- his name was Samuel.</span> <span id="s119">That’s why I was Shulanis, named after his -- my gran --</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Samuel Shreyber.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: -- yeah, it’s Samuel Shreyber, yeah.</span> <span id="s122">And I don’t know my grandmother’s name.</span> <span id="s123">And my grandmother from my mother’s side was Frederica, her name, and I don’t remember her maiden name, it was a German name, something -- something like -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s124">And my -- my grandfather from my mother’s side was Joseph Zhouk.</span> <span id="s125">Yeah,

attack.</span> <span id="s128">The thing is they came fr -- they run from Russia to Wilna when the revolution started.</span> <span id="s129">They came very poor, they didn’t -- they lost everything in Russia and she couldn’t probably bear it.</span> <span id="s130">And after her, in three or four months my grandfather died.</span> <span id="s131">That’s it.</span> <span id="s132">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: What was your position in the Jewish community, your families position?</span> <span id="s134">Your father is a -- a -- a pr -- a principal, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Can you just sort of describe where they fit into the --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: Yeah, he was a very prominent actually, in the community a very famous person.</span> <span id="s138">Everybody knew him from Wilna, everybody -- oh, [indecipherable] Shreyber [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s139">And he was in several committees, very active in several committees, so very honest and real.</span> <span id="s140">He was active in the -- in the -- in Jewish com -- committees, yes.</span> <span id="s141">You know, when the first -- when the second World War broke out, so I was only 11 years old, and [indecipherable] I -- then I di -- was not very interested in such things without my parents and I know only that he adored our father.</span> <span id="s142">[indecipherable] it was everything, and he didn’t dare not to obey him.</span> <span id="s143">But my mother, my mother could tell me thousand times to do something, I wouldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s144">It’s -- it -- yeah.</span> <span id="s145">It’s a pity [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: You say that your -- your father was involved in the community.</span> <span id="s147">Do you ever remember him talking about that, and about wh-why he was involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: You know, the parents were -- it’s -- it’s -- it was an absolute another life before the war, I mean.</span> <span id="s149">I heard my parents talking but always in their bedroom with the doors clo -- with the door closed, so we didn’t know what -- what’s going on there.</span> <span id="s150">I mean, their discussions.</span> <span id="s151">My mother loved very much my father, that I know.</span> <span id="s152">And my father was very polite, never -- you know, never raised his voice.</span> <span id="s153">And but they had discussions but each one political or something else, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s154">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s155">And I don’t think that my brother, who was older, he probably didn’t know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: How -- how did you think of yourselves?</span> <span id="s157">Did you think that you were Polish, Russian, Jewish?</span> <span id="s158">H-How did you think of yourselves as an identity of your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: I was sure that I am Jewish, because I attended a Yiddish school, and I was sure that to be a Jew it doesn’t mean to be a religious Jew.</span> <span id="s160">I was taught Yiddish literature, Yiddish writers, poets, history of the Jews.</span> <span id="s161">That was enough only to -- to be proud of my nation, and to feel that I am Jewish.</span> <span id="s162">I never avoided it, never.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Do you remember as a young girl, eight, nine, 10, ex -- every experiencing any anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: Oh yeah, very much.</span> <span id="s165">I didn’t look -- it’s -- it’s maybe strange to say that here, but the European Jews have a special look, and I was blonde, and you can see not dark eyes.</span> <span id="s166">I looked -- I didn’t look like a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s167">And my -- my brother -- my brother was black hair, black eyes, and -- and th -- because our school didn’t work on Saturday, so we were -- it was open on Sundays.</span> <span id="s168">So we usually went on Sundays with our bags, school bags, to school.</span> <span id="s169">And that was a reason to fight.</span> <span id="s170">So I don’t know, nobody f-fought me, but my brother.</span> <span id="s171">And it was a time when he had in his pocket, a castet, I don’t know how it is in English, it’s like an iron thing what you put your fingers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Brass knuckles.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s174">And that what you can fight back.</span> <span id="s175">And -- and it was a time when he didn’t walk from school to -- to home.</span> <span id="s176">Usually we walked it, it was not so far, but we didn't have a car of course, it was very seldom they were having a car, it was a big luxury.</span> <span id="s177">So, he went by bus from school home, and he -- he didn’t get off on the right stop, but a stop after that, and went home from another side because a group of guys were waiting for him on the corner of our street, and the other streets.</span> <span id="s178">It was -- we were -- our house was located near a corner of two streets, all -- that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Who were the guys?</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: I don’t know, [indecipherable] the neighborhood guys.</span> <span id="s181">It was a bar on the corner and they were drinking there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s182">They amused themself with fighting with Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Were they Polish, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s185">Yeah it was not a big mixture of nationalities there, it was a very big percentage Jews, and -- and that -- probably 25 percent of the population of Wilna are Jewish.</span> <span id="s186">So then it was a little bit of White Russian, and a little bit Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s187">And mostly they are Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Did you and Joseph ever talk about that, about how to protect yourselves in these situations?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No.</span> <span id="s190">I mean, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s191">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s192">There were other things what I remember.</span> <span id="s193">I remember walking through the streets near university and looking at the [indecipherable] house, on -- on the windows, how the students, the Jewish students were standing on the lectures, not sitting.</span> <span id="s194">Yeah.</span> <span id="s195">It was a protest because some of the Polish students decided that Polish students have to sit separately on the one side, and it was left the other side of the whole auditorium was left for the Jews -- Jewish students.</span> <span id="s196">So the Jewish student decided no, they will not sit separately, they will stand.</span> <span id="s197">So they stand, all lectures they were standing behind the benches there, that they [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s198">Then they had an -- a church, and it was to go through the church, it was like a -- a gate, yeah?</span> <span id="s199">And so Jewish people are walking through, if it’s winter they were wearing the hats.</span> <span id="s200">So -- and the Catholics had to remove their hats.</span> <span id="s201">So, if you don’t remove their -- your hats, you are beaten and remove the hat from -- such things.</span> <span id="s202">But I had friends, Polish also.</span> <span id="s203">I played with them in the streets and the -- if I heard something like bad, like they are cursing me or something, so I used to stand, I remember, in our -- the gate of our garden with stones and waited for them.</span> <span id="s204">And they knew it [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s205">I’ll not let them walk through without throwing the stones to them.</span> <span id="s206">So they were a little bit afraid of me.</span> <span id="s207">But they were little also.</span> <span id="s208">I didn’t have to do this big guys, of course.</span> <span id="s209">Little like me, 10 - 11 -12 years old, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: You came down to do this interview with an old friend, with Rachel Lerdis.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: Who you knew -- whom you knew when you were young.</span> <span id="s213">I’m wondering if you could tell us about your first memories of her, how you met her, or just your first memories of being together with her when you were young.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: I met her when we were in the country.</span> <span id="s215">We rented a house in the country, and their family rented a house in the country, the r -- the houses were close.</span> <span id="s216">And -- and then her family came from Warsaw, the sisters with their families.</span> <span id="s217">And that’s how we met with her.</span> <span id="s218">And I s --</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I remember her always smiling [indecipherable] nice looking girl.</span> <span id="s221">And my brother was more involved in it than I, yeah.</span> <span id="s222">Yeah.</span> <span id="s223">I think that the love started from there.</span> <span id="s224">They were 16 probably or so.</span> <span id="s225">And I was 11, so that I -- he was 16, and she --</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: You’re referring to the fact that your -- your brother and Rachel Lerdis when they were young, dated.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: Yes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s229">What did you speak with each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: With whom?</span> <span id="s231">With Rachel?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I don’t think we spoke a lot before the war.</span> <span id="s234">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s235">When I finished my six year school, it was a -- the first -- how it’s called in English, oh my God, elementary school.</span> <span id="s236">When I finished the elementary school, I went to the same gymnasium where Rachel was, and my brother.</span> <span id="s237">So there I saw them more often together.</span> <span id="s238">Otherwise I -- I was not very close to her before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Did your parents know each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Your parents and her parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">Q: But they must have met in the country, but just briefly?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: Maybe, but I don’t -- I don’t know about that.</span> <span id="s245">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: When do you remember beginning to feel the war closing in, or things changing?</span> <span id="s247">Do you have first memories of that, of --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: It was a bombing before we [indecipherable] telling us that the -- the -- the war started, so they bombed Wilna.</span> <span id="s251">The Germans were -- bombed Wilna.</span> <span id="s252">That I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: But even before that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Oh before that, yeah, it’s true --</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Can you talk a bit about that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s257">The war started with Poland.</span> <span id="s258">Yeah, it’s true.</span> <span id="s259">It was in September ’39 when the war started.</span> <span id="s260">And we felt it immediately.</span> <span id="s261">Immediately it was a shortage of food.</span> <span id="s262">In the stores line -- people were lined up to buy food.</span> <span id="s263">I remember that I don’t know how, in the kitchen I saw a whole sack of sugar, salt and something else, kasha or something else, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s264">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s265">Q: What did that mean to see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: It -- it meant that it can be a [indecipherable] and they are ready to eat.</span> <span id="s267">And then I had a friend, a boyfriend.</span> <span id="s268">His parents had a bakery, and we run to the bakery with him.</span> <span id="s269">And I saw a big line, people waiting for the bread, and we went to ano -- for -- from another side inside the bakery.</span> <span id="s270">And he used to take a big loaf of br -- of bread, yeah, and give me -- ha -- hot bread, and it smelled so good, and used to bring it home.</span> <span id="s271">And the lady who lived with us, who helped my mother, her name was Julia.</span> <span id="s272">She used to say, “Oh, my God, if Luda wants to eat, she has an appetite, it means it will be a hunger.”</span> <span id="s273">I was never hungry when I was child.</span> <span id="s274">It was not -- my mother was crazy about me.</span> <span id="s275">Never hungry.</span> <span id="s276">I didn’t want to eat, I -- I -- I don’t remember feeling something that I want something.</span> <span id="s277">It will some --</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: You di -- you -- your mother thought you didn’t eat enough when you were young?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yeah, of course --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: -- because I didn’t eat enough.</span> <span id="s282">That’s -- that -- that was that, yeah.</span> <span id="s283">I was very pale and very thin, and my mother was unhappy with it.</span> <span id="s284">But then the war started, and it was a shot at your foot, so I started to eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Do you remember your brother or your parents talking about the changes?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: I remember my mother.</span> <span id="s287">My mother was very -- can’t say upset, because it’s more than upset.</span> <span id="s288">She was very unhappy with it.</span> <span id="s289">And fer -- we had books at home, books of -- books which described the situation in Germany after Hitler come -- came to power.</span> <span id="s290">It was called, I remem -- I remember it, the book was la -- lying on -- on the table in our room in -- in-in my bedroom.</span> <span id="s291">So it was called Brunatnec Shenga in Polish.</span> <span id="s292">Brunatnec, it means brown, because fascists had brown, you know, shirts.</span> <span id="s293">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s294">There -- there are pictures there about the concentration camps already in Germany.</span> <span id="s295">At first.</span> <span id="s296">political concentration camp.</span> <span id="s297">Communist party in Germany was very popular, and a lot of Germans were communists, so the first victims were the communists of course, you know.</span> <span id="s298">And my mother -- my mother knew the Germans very well.</span> <span id="s299">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s300">I don’t think she was born in -- in -- in Germany.</span> <span id="s301">I th -- her mother was born in Germany, so -- and they used to go to Germany every -- every summer, probably.</span> <span id="s302">And my mother knew the character of the Germans, so she told my father, I remember, we have to leave Wilna.</span> <span id="s303">We have to out of it.</span> <span id="s304">Go out of Europe.</span> <span id="s305">I hate it.</span> <span id="s306">He didn’t want.</span> <span id="s307">He didn’t want.</span> <span id="s308">She wanted to emigrate, to the States, to Canada, to Australia, but not to stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s309">That’s it.</span> <span id="s310">That was it, yeah.</span> <span id="s311">That why I remember it.</span> <span id="s312">And -- but we waited the Germans to come to -- to Wilna in 1939 already, because Polish army couldn’t stand -- couldn’t protect Poland, was too weak.</span> <span id="s313">Poles are very good soldiers actually, but they didn’t have the tanks, they didn’t have the equipment the -- the Germans had, so -- but the Russian came before.</span> <span id="s314">They occupied Wilna, they occupied all the -- the best, Belaru --White Russia, Belarusia, White Russia and Ukraine.</span> <span id="s315">So we found ourselves in -- occupied by Russians.</span> <span id="s316">What was better than by Germans, of course.</span> <span id="s317">It was probably two, three months m -- the Russians were in Wilna, the hosts of Wilna, ba -- but then they gave it to Lithuania.</span> <span id="s318">The day the Lithuanians wanted to take over Wilna was a fight between the Poles and -- the Polish -- the remnants of the Polish army and the Lithuanian army.</span> <span id="s319">But the fight was very, very short.</span> <span id="s320">And suddenly they decided that it has to be a pogrom.</span> <span id="s321">They have to -- to kill Jews.</span> <span id="s322">We don’t know why.</span> <span id="s323">Couldn’t understand why.</span> <span id="s324">What has it to do with -- with pola -- with Poland and Lithuania?</span> <span id="s325">They were always tense.</span> <span id="s326">There were no diplomatic relationships between pola -- Poland and Lithuania before, even.</span> <span id="s327">So the day the Lithuanian occupied -- no, took over Wilna, so it was a pogrom.</span> <span id="s328">I was at home, my mother didn’t allow me to go to school, but my son -- my brother was i-in school, and she was so nervous about it.</span> <span id="s329">And -- and then it was the whole day, broken glasses, and so on and so on.</span> <span id="s330">But then I think that a delegation of Jewish people went to the Russians, who gave the city to Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s331">But they had a place where they just -- they were -- that their armia was standing there, together with their tanks and everything.</span> <span id="s332">So the Jews went there and asked them for helping us.</span> <span id="s333">And they decided -- the Russians decided to go with the tanks through the streets.</span> <span id="s334">And that was enough.</span> <span id="s335">They didn’t do anything, they didn't kill anybody, they didn’t -- the Russians I mean.</span> <span id="s336">They went through the streets with their tanks, and it was quiet, quiet.</span> <span id="s337">It’s a -- quiet down everybody.</span> <span id="s338">Then my brother came back from school, late in the evening.</span> <span id="s339">He -- he told us that they barricaded the windows and the doors with [indecipherable] the tables they had in the classes.</span> <span id="s340">And they were waiting.</span> <span id="s341">Nothing special.</span> <span id="s342">Was no killed people, no, nothing.</span> <span id="s343">Only the -- the windows were broken.</span> <span id="s344">That is -- that what I remember, the beginning of -- of the war.</span> <span id="s345">And then they were almost a year -- yeah, then the Lithuanian were -- they started learning Lithuanian -- the Lithuanian language at school, and -- another language.</span> <span id="s346">We had a lot of languages in school.</span> <span id="s347">Had Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, German and then Lithuanian, instead of --</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: How did the atmosphere changed when the Lithuanians were in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: You know, that was for change that stores were -- special stores were open, Lithuanian stores, Lithuanian companies came over.</span> <span id="s350">Interesting that the Polish president, the portrait of the Polish president was gone from the wall in our classroom, and the Lithuanian sign is -- their official sign is a -- a horse, and -- don’t remember [indecipherable] there.</span> <span id="s351">A horseman, who has a horse with a sword, I think, something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: A man on a horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Yeah, a man on a horse, yeah.</span> <span id="s354">Oh, and that was on the wall.</span> <span id="s355">So I remember such a thing, that we decided to open the windows, that was in winter, we decided to open the windows in the classroom, and it was before the language of -- oh, oh -- the lesson of the Lithuanian language, the teacher came in, said, “It’s so cold, why didn’t you open the li -- why did you open the li -- the windows?”</span> <span id="s356">So we said, “The horse is stinking.”</span> <span id="s357">Suddenly, we became Polish patriots.</span> <span id="s358">We -- we played with the Polish children in the street, and we used to -- to throw on the sidewalks a -- a -- the Lithuanian money, with the sign of their horse, and to beat it.</span> <span id="s359">And to -- and to say, go to Kovno, go back to Kovno, go back to Kovno.</span> <span id="s360">Kovno was their capital.</span> <span id="s361">They made Wilna the capital after that.</span> <span id="s362">Capital of Lithuania.</span> <span id="s363">Well, that was -- we became one block with the Poles against the Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s364">Why?</span> <span id="s365">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s366">Don’t ask me, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What were your parents saying to Joseph about continuing to go to school, or were there any safeguards being made?</span> <span id="s368">You know, if this happens, don’t come home, or was there any talk like that?</span> <span id="s369">Sort of beginning to prepare to -- for -- for trouble?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: For --</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: In any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: At what time you’re asking it?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: A-At this time, when the Lithuanians -- after the day long pogrom with the Lithuanians and when your brother had to be barricaded inside the school.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: After that was quiet and -- it was quiet until the -- the World War ІІ came to us.</span> <span id="s375">It was quiet, yeah.</span> <span id="s376">Then, after -- how long was a -- a reign of the Lithuanian was a half a year, or a year?</span> <span id="s377">A year, almost a year.</span> <span id="s378">Then the Russians decided to occupy the whole Lithuania.</span> <span id="s379">They gave them Wilna, but they occupied the whole, you know.</span> <span id="s380">And then it was Russia already.</span> <span id="s381">In 1940 was Russia, until -- and in ninete -- 1941 when the World War started, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Was there a time when you noticed the Russians took control back and you had to learn Russian in school again during this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I didn’t care about it because I spoke Russian and it was my language [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s384">So, but the year when the Russians were there, this year, was not a bad year for Jewish people.</span> <span id="s385">A lot of Jewish school, Yiddish schools were open, yes, but I -- I -- I have to say that the Hebrew schools were closed, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s386">They were against the Hebrew, everything what was Hebrew was not good.</span> <span id="s387">And of course, religious people suffered.</span> <span id="s388">But Yiddish secular schools were -- a lot of Jewish secular schools were open, and we had a lot -- much more students in our gymnasium than before.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Oh, the students would come from the closed schools and go to yours?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s391">Not only that, but ther -- th -- it was a part of very poor people, who couldn’t afford to pay for school.</span> <span id="s392">That’s why their children were at home, I don’t know, looking for a job, looking for something.</span> <span id="s393">I don’t know what they were doing, but they couldn’t attend schools.</span> <span id="s394">And then, when the Russians came, the schools were for free.</span> <span id="s395">And not only that, but every child had to be at school.</span> <span id="s396">Had to be at school.</span> <span id="s397">So they came, and they were -- we have so many students.</span> <span id="s398">That was -- for the poor people was much better.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: And -- and the stores, were they similar, for instance, your friend’s bakery, was that a Jewish bakery?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: Yeah, it was a Jewish bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did it remain open, was -- wi -- were the -- was the Jewish family still in charge of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: No.</span> <span id="s403">No, everything -- in [indecipherable] were not in charge of our house.</span> <span id="s404">Everything was gone to the government.</span> <span id="s405">The government took over everything.</span> <span id="s406">Yeah, that’s -- yeah.</span> <span id="s407">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: But you were still in your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s410">[indecipherable] we are still in our house, yeah.</span> <span id="s411">Some were -- wanted us to go out of the house and to take over the house, it was a problem there.</span> <span id="s412">But we stayed in the house, and my father had the same position, but the technical -- Yiddish technical -- Jewish technical school was a part of the pole -- Polish technical school.</span> <span id="s413">It means they were like one school, but one was total -- that stu -- Polish students were taught in Polish and the e -- Jews in -- in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s414">But my father was this -- had the -- had the same position still, this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: And do you remember seeing Rachel during this period, was Rachel seeing Joseph, your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Yeah, yeah, because we are at school.</span> <span id="s417">I was already the first grade of gymnasium.</span> <span id="s418">But the school was -- was renamed, it was already not a gymnasium, but a high -- but a high school, and I was not in the first grade of the gymnasium, but I was in the fifth grade of that 10 years school -- high school.</span> <span id="s419">It was a 10 years high school.</span> <span id="s420">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Did your parents -- as things shifted, did your parents ever discuss again, leaving?</span> <span id="s422">Did your mother push that issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I think that yeah.</span> <span id="s424">But i -- I don’t think that it could be done already, it was too late.</span> <span id="s425">It was too late, because I don’t think the Russians would allow us to go out.</span> <span id="s426">Poland didn’t exist already.</span> <span id="s427">Part of the -- of Poland was Germany, and part Russia, that’s it.</span> <span id="s428">So, but she talked about it, yeah.</span> <span id="s429">She talked about it.</span> <span id="s430">But she didn’t know how to do it over there, they said she was -- it’s a -- problem of immigration was closed for us, it’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s431">But a friend of mine, who was the same class, and his mother was a teacher of our school, their -- his father immigrated to the States.</span> <span id="s432">He went to Europe for a conference in 1939, but before the war started, before September.</span> <span id="s433">He went there with [indecipherable] oldest son.</span> <span id="s434">He was in Belgium, I think.</span> <span id="s435">And when the war started, he took a ship and he went to ton -- to the States, America.</span> <span id="s436">Then he send the papers to [indecipherable] his w-wife and the other son to come, and they received the visa.</span> <span id="s437">And they were the -- the only people who -- who’d leave Russia because they had already the visa, then Lithuanian were there.</span> <span id="s438">So they were allowed to go.</span> <span id="s439">And he’s still in the States, my friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: At that point was there ever any thought that the ru -- that the Germans might come into Vilnius?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Of course, yes.</span> <span id="s444">We were sure that it will -- the war stop, it will not remain like that.</span> <span id="s445">It was like everything was -- fe-felt temporary.</span> <span id="s446">That today is like that, tomorrow can be changed everything, yeah.</span> <span id="s447">It was not stable.</span> <span id="s448">Anything was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: It sounds anything but stable.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s451">And then we -- it was -- we finished school, I had -- we planned to go to -- leave for vacation, and the bombs started to fall on Wilna, and my mother told my father immediately, we have to run for Russia.</span> <span id="s452">And he didn’t want because he had a sister there.</span> <span id="s453">A sister who was older than he was and she was like a mother for him.</span> <span id="s454">The mother was sick then, he was the youngest boy -- y-youngest child in his family and she was taking care of him.</span> <span id="s455">So he didn’t -- he didn’t want to leave without her.</span> <span id="s456">So he used to go to her -- to her apartment, to ask her to leave with them, and she didn’t want.</span> <span id="s457">Her husband was in the States already.</span> <span id="s458">He visited his brother in 1938, and the -- the war started and he couldn’t come back.</span> <span id="s459">So he was in the States.</span> <span id="s460">So she was alone with one daughter, and she told [indecipherable] we are not communists, and we are not men, who will touch us?</span> <span id="s461">People were so naïve.</span> <span id="s462">Oh, that’s all the communist propaganda what you know, that is not true.</span> <span id="s463">Hitler is -- we know ge -- we know Germans.</span> <span id="s464">Germans were here in the first World War, and they were not so bad, we can survive with it, and so he didn't want to leave his [indecipherable] until the second day of the war.</span> <span id="s465">My mother packed his -- her bag.</span> <span id="s466">They gave me a bag, a small bag, he gave -- she gave my brother a small bag and she told my father goodbye.</span> <span id="s467">We are running, and you want to stay with your sister, stay.</span> <span id="s468">So he went with us.</span> <span id="s469">But it was too late.</span> <span id="s470">It was too late.</span> <span id="s471">We went to the station, we found [indecipherable] train and we went -- the train started to go, but then it were -- it was bombed.</span> <span id="s472">It -- it was a horrible story with the train.</span> <span id="s473">[indecipherable] with the train was put on hold in the middle of the f -- the forest.</span> <span id="s474">Stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: So, talking about a train that it stopped in -- in the middle of the forest, and I didn’t mention that the train was full, people who were running from the Germans.</span> <span id="s478">A lot of them were soldiers and officers from the Red army, Soviet army, with families.</span> <span id="s479">And the others were Jews, and [indecipherable] communists who wanted to run from the fascists.</span> <span id="s480">But the civilian were mostly Jews, and a small group of Lithuanian, yeah.</span> <span id="s481">So -- and the train was s-stopped before the old border of Soviet Union because we were still on the occupied pass of the -- the Lithuanian territory and the White Russia territory who belonged to Poland and was occupied by the Germans as I told before, after the -- the -- after the war start with Poland.</span> <span id="s482">And so the train stopped before the old Soviet border, and they -- the -- it was the -- the army who was -- the Soviet army that -- not that -- it was the encoverdere army.</span> <span id="s483">It was not KGB, but it was a part of it, like.</span> <span id="s484">They told everybody has to leave the train, but that the women has to leave on the right side of the train, and the military man with the families -- with their families on the left side.</span> <span id="s485">Then they closed all the windows and the doors from the right side where we were standing.</span> <span id="s486">They opened the doors for the left side, they let in the military men together with their families, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s487">And they went.</span> <span id="s488">The train started to roll -- to go, and we started to cry and to ask and to shout and to -- don’t leave us, and the train left.</span> <span id="s489">Then I looked around, the forest was full with luggage.</span> <span id="s490">Nobody to-took the luggage, they throw out and the people didn’t know what to do, they started to walk to the border.</span> <span id="s491">And I remember my father coming to the border, showed his passport and told him that he was a -- a member already of a union, and that wa -- there are my documents.</span> <span id="s492">No, no, you are spies.</span> <span id="s493">Everything na -- we were -- we didn’t have the passports of the Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s494">We were not citizens of the Soviet Union, we were the citizens of the country Lithuania, who was occupied by the Soviets, but they didn’t change the passports yet, the citizenships yet.</span> <span id="s495">They couldn’t -- they didn’t let us in.</span> <span id="s496">Then we -- we made kilometers and kilometers during the day.</span> <span id="s497">We walked -- it was such a hot summer like -- like this summer, 1941 summer was very hot.</span> <span id="s498">And I remember my mother and -- complained that she cannot walk so long in that.</span> <span id="s499">And then at night we came to a place and we found a house open and empty already, no people.</span> <span id="s500">So we -- my father decided we have to rest there.</span> <span id="s501">We came in together with another family, and in the middle of the night came a peasant, a Polish peasant, or a White Russian peasant, I don’t know, and said you have to run, because there are German parachutists already here.</span> <span id="s502">So you have to run.</span> <span id="s503">So the other family took the -- the bag, they -- one bag of -- of -- the light bags because the big bags were left behind.</span> <span id="s504">So, and they run.</span> <span id="s505">And my father, like a mathematician, he told, look, if it’s true that there are Germans all over here, so it’s [indecipherable] to run.</span> <span id="s506">If it’s not true, so we will start in the morning, we have to rest.</span> <span id="s507">And that was too late already.</span> <span id="s508">When -- in a war, every minute counts.</span> <span id="s509">The other family found a -- a bus and they were safe.</span> <span id="s510">And they survived the war.</span> <span id="s511">I met them after the war, that was -- yeah.</span> <span id="s512">And we were caught by the Germans.</span> <span id="s513">And that’s it, and we decided to go back.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: How -- how were you caught by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: In the morning we went farther and we entered a small village.</span> <span id="s516">We found there a Jewish family who let us come in and have a little bit water, a tea, I don’t remember even if it was food.</span> <span id="s517">No, I don’t remember, it was a horrible time.</span> <span id="s518">And -- and suddenly the Germans come -- came in with -- on tanks and motorcycles and they occupied the village, and at once started the pogrom.</span> <span id="s519">Pogrom.</span> <span id="s520">The neighbors came and took over everything from the -- from the people who -- who allowed us to stay, and our things also, our belongings that -- our belongings were three small bags, like.</span> <span id="s521">And that’s it, and it was finished.</span> <span id="s522">Then the Germans took my brother to dig some holes, I don’t know, they took him.</span> <span id="s523">And they told my mother that they will -- he will come back in two hours or something.</span> <span id="s524">We waited for two hours and he didn’t come back so my mother went to them.</span> <span id="s525">It’s interesting that the roles of my father and my mother changed immediately when the war started.</span> <span id="s526">She started to be the head of the family, not my father.</span> <span id="s527">She was -- before the war, he was the head of the family, he was the person who brought that money to -- to the family, yeah, supported the family, and she was a quiet lady, who loved books, to read a lot, and during the night even.</span> <span id="s528">And that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s529">The roles chan -- changed.</span> <span id="s530">She started to be energetic, started -- concentrated and her German.</span> <span id="s531">Her German was her mo -- her mother tongue, of course.</span> <span id="s532">And she went to the Germans and they gave her the -- my -- back the brother -- the hale -- son.</span> <span id="s533">She came back together with him, and she told, we have to go back home.</span> <span id="s534">Here we are strangers from -- nobody knows us and -- and -- and he -- and it was a long walk home.</span> <span id="s535">I don’t remember who told us don’t go through the forest because you will be ar -- killed by the people, or the peasants there.</span> <span id="s536">You will be robbed, you will be killed and so on.</span> <span id="s537">So they decided to go along the highways.</span> <span id="s538">So the German army was approaching, going deep to Russia, and we were going back to Lithuania to Wilna.</span> <span id="s539">Perhaps it’s interesting, it was a false -- f-first front of the Germans.</span> <span id="s540">They were soldiers, it was Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s541">They didn’t do any harm to us.</span> <span id="s542">First of all, they didn’t know who we are.</span> <span id="s543">They know that we are people who are -- run from them, but they didn't know we were Jews or non-Jews, or -- and sometimes they threw us cigarettes, what my father was -- he -- he couldn’t bear not to smoke, he was a smoker, and he -- it was like better than bread for him.</span> <span id="s544">Yeah.</span> <span id="s545">And sometimes we went through a village, so they ask for water, so there were people who didn’t allow us in to take water.</span> <span id="s546">To come over and to take water.</span> <span id="s547">No food, no water.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">Q: How long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s549">A: I think it was there two weeks, probably.</span> <span id="s550">I remember only one old lady, a peasant, asked us to come in, and she gave us bread and milk.</span> <span id="s551">But it was unusual for us.</span> <span id="s552">Very unusual.</span> <span id="s553">She told, “My son is on the front fighting with the Germans, I don’t know where he is, so maybe another family will give him some bread.”</span> <span id="s554">Then we came home.</span> <span id="s555">Of course, Wilna was occupied already for 10 days, or -- or -- I don’t remember the day we came back, don’t remember.</span> <span id="s556">And the lady th -- was -- who lived with us --</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Julia?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Julia was home, and she welcomed us, yeah.</span> <span id="s559">She was happy and pride [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s560">Yeah.</span> <span id="s561">It’s a lot to -- to tell.</span> <span id="s562">The first was my brother, what my brother did, he wrote a letter to Rachel.</span> <span id="s563">And the only person who walked through the st -- streets was me.</span> <span id="s564">So he gave me the letter.</span> <span id="s565">Rachel accused me that I probably read the letter, but I don’t remember if I read it or not.</span> <span id="s566">I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">Q: Why were you the only one that walked through the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: The men didn’t dare to walk the street, because it was very dangerous, they would be caught.</span> <span id="s569">My mother didn’t want it, so it just left me.</span> <span id="s570">I was 13 years old, and I went and pe -- we were in another district, absolutely far from Rachel.</span> <span id="s571">I had to go through all the city, and the -- the most dangerous, I thought, dangerous place was a bridge, to cross a bridge because soldiers were already standing there and guarding the bridge, the Germans soldiers of course, and I -- I remember coming over, saying mm-hm, [indecipherable] ask you for documents or not.</span> <span id="s572">I decided to jump on one foot, like playing.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Skipping.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: I was thir -- yeah -- I was 13 years old, why not?</span> <span id="s575">I jumped -- I jumped through the bridge.</span> <span id="s576">And they looked at me and smiled.</span> <span id="s577">Then I run.</span> <span id="s578">Run again to her house.</span> <span id="s579">Now I have to bring back -- a letter back from her to my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: What was their reaction when you got to the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Don’t remember.</span> <span id="s582">I was so overwhelmed with the danger to cross city, that I don’t re -- I think she was happy and unhappy at the same time.</span> <span id="s583">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: How was the city different?</span> <span id="s585">You described the bridge, but as you walked through it, what -- h-how could you feel the presence of the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s586">A: Well, they were all over the streets, the soldiers and their ve-vehicles, their cars and tanks, and -- o-over the street, so it was not difficult to -- to see it.</span> <span id="s587">And then I think my mother -- yeah, my mother told me to go to her cousin, to visit her cousin.</span> <span id="s588">And -- and I -- I almost [indecipherable] caught in their apartment already mixing something up, maybe it was then the Soviets were in Wilna.</span> <span id="s589">I don’t remember who was -- the police was there, and searching their apartment.</span> <span id="s590">And I was afraid that they will not allow me to go back.</span> <span id="s591">And I don’t remember it was the germa -- Germans or the Russians.</span> <span id="s592">Don’t remember exactly, because they were rich people.</span> <span id="s593">We were not rich, we were middle class [indecipherable] middle class, and you know, but they were rich people, so I don’t remember who searched the apartment, but tha-that was the moment I was scared that I will not be able to go back home.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: So your mother let you out?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: Yeah, all the time.</span> <span id="s596">All the time, I don’t know, all the time.</span> <span id="s597">It was -- we had a Polish lady we were very friendly with.</span> <span id="s598">She was a p-poor lady, she was a relative of the German lady who lived with us.</span> <span id="s599">It means, this German lady was married to her brother.</span> <span id="s600">The brother was a -- a Russian officer in Russia, and was killed in ninet -- in -- in the first World War.</span> <span id="s601">So she was alone and she came back to our family.</span> <span id="s602">And we loved the lady his Veronica, what I gave the name to the Yad Vashem, her name.</span> <span id="s603">And I am talking about it.</span> <span id="s604">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s605">I am.</span> <span id="s606">So she told me after the war why my mother was so sure that I will survive.</span> <span id="s607">Nobody di -- what -- happens to me.</span> <span id="s608">It was -- she had a dream when she gave birth to me.</span> <span id="s609">After she gave -- gave birth, she was tired, of course, and she fell asleep.</span> <span id="s610">And she had a dream that the angel came to her and told her that when your daughter will be 13 years old, it will be a war in which your whole family will be killed, perish, all but not your daughter.</span> <span id="s611">She will survive it.</span> <span id="s612">So she was sure that -- and you know, she was so -- she was thinking about the -- the dream all the time, but I didn’t know it, a-as I told you, I -- I knew it after the war, I learned it from Veronica.</span> <span id="s613">That why she insisted she wanted to emigrate so much, and that why she was so nervous.</span> <span id="s614">And Veronica told me even that she wanted to commit suicide in 1939, but she persuaded her not to leave the children.</span> <span id="s615">And she committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Yeah, in 1943, when the Germans took her.</span> <span id="s618">She told me the Germans will not take me alive.</span> <span id="s619">They can take me only a dead body, and that what she did.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: So wh-what is day to day life like at this point?</span> <span id="s621">I-It sounds like people are staying inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Have the Germans instituted rules, are you wearing a star at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: No, no, it was not like tha -- bef -- before we went to ghetto it was no stars, but it was very dangerous to walk the street, especially the men.</span> <span id="s625">Even the Poles didn’t walk a lot, it was only the military men and Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: What did you do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s628">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s629">Probably we read.</span> <span id="s630">It’s a good question, you know.</span> <span id="s631">It was like a -- a prison, but at home.</span> <span id="s632">Of course my, the -- the Julia used to go out and to buy some food.</span> <span id="s633">It was a shortage o-on food already.</span> <span id="s634">I don’t remember her -- doing something, you know, what my brother did.</span> <span id="s635">And of course we had neighbors.</span> <span id="s636">We rented one apartment.</span> <span id="s637">It was one house with a lot of rooms, but after my grandparents came home, back to Wilna, after the revolution started in Russia.</span> <span id="s638">So when they -- they died, this -- in -- in Wilna, so my mother rented a part of the house.</span> <span id="s639">It was a Polish family there, and my mother was helping them a lot.</span> <span id="s640">When the Lithuanian came, they fired all the Poles from the [indecipherable] positions.</span> <span id="s641">And he was working for the railroad, so he was fired also because he didn’t know Lithuanian, the language, so they fired him.</span> <span id="s642">So they couldn’t pay for rent, and they couldn’t -- and they didn’t have money and my mother told them they can stay as long as they want, she will not ask them for rent.</span> <span id="s643">Ah, so, but when the war started with the Germans so, and suddenly somebody told that the Germans are going from hou -- home to home looking for Jewish men.</span> <span id="s644">So she asks them to hide my father and my brother and they refused.</span> <span id="s645">Yeah, but -- but we -- we were not sure why they refused, maybe they were afraid of theirsel -- themself being o-of the Germans also, yeah.</span> <span id="s646">But the Germans didn’t come to our house, and it was see, then on September, first of September then, they told all the Jewish people to go to get -- to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s647">And they already know the Germans, but the Lithuanian police went from home to home for -- ho -- one Jewish house, another Jewish house, to take the Jewish people out of the houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Before we get to that, I just want to clarify that -- so then was the bombing of Vilnius by the Germans, was that in August of the same year?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: It was a -- an -- the -- it was June.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Oh, it was June.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">A: June, yeah.</span> <span id="s652">The war started the 22nd of June, 1941.</span> <span id="s653">June, I think, not July yet, June.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: And so then that was -- you tried to run and you came back, that took about two weeks --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: And then so from about mid June until --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: No, July, for about --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Okay, July.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- mid July until the first of September, this --</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: You were just sort of in this prison state.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s663">Did you have any idea that something might be happening in the last days of August?</span> <span id="s664">Do -- could you tell that maybe you were going to be -- some sort of form of action was going to be taken?</span> <span id="s665">Did you seek preparations in the ghetto, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: Well, we didn’t know, because it happened, I think, overnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: They decided which part of the streets we -- will belong to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s669">It was a Jewish district, so not a lot of non-Jews lived there, so they asked the non-Jews to -- to find another -- other apartments and the Jews they took to th -- to the prison, and then to Ponary and they killed them.</span> <span id="s670">And so they emptied a whole district, so they could take the -- from the other districts of the city and bring it to -- to the streets who -- which belonged to th -- to the ghetto already.</span> <span id="s671">But maybe rumors ki -- were going, of course around that it will be a ghetto organized, because people knew that they organized the ghetto in other cities probably.</span> <span id="s672">I don’t know, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s673">I know only that we knew that some would -- prominent Jews were arrested and killed.</span> <span id="s674">Some Jewish men were taken from apartments and from the streets.</span> <span id="s675">We knew that the -- the Lithuanian were helping them, and the Lithuanian police, they organized Lithuanian police, and the fascist [indecipherable] of Lithuania of course was [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s676">And th-the Poles were -- behaved very quietly, they were afraid for themself.</span> <span id="s677">And you have to remember that the Germans were enemies of the Polish people, because they conquered their country, they were destroying their country, and they killed a lot of Poles over.</span> <span id="s678">So it was like -- a little bit it’s your enemies and our enemies are the same, so it was like that.</span> <span id="s679">Had to say, oh, like a moral support from the side of the Poles.</span> <span id="s680">Not all of them, was a part of them were very happy to see it, and participated in it, participated in it, but a lot of them were -- hated the Germans and --</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Was your mother making any sort of prep -- preparations, perhaps gathering up jewelry, maybe packing a bag that would definitely go if you had to go anywhere?</span> <span id="s682">What wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: I think so, yeah, because perba -- probably rumors were already around the city that the ghetto will be organized, and when they started to see how they are throwing out the people, the Jewish people from the houses, so my mother started to pack.</span> <span id="s684">But it’s interesting we were in the last one, because Germans didn’t know that our house is Jewish.</span> <span id="s685">We didn’t look like -- the look was like -- I don’t know, something.</span> <span id="s686">And th -- and y -- every house had a -- such a -- a -- how to call it?</span> <span id="s687">A sign, which -- the names of all the tenants.</span> <span id="s688">So our name, last name, is a German name, Shreyber.</span> <span id="s689">A lot of Germans have Shreyber.</span> <span id="s690">It -- in German, this is a writer.</span> <span id="s691">And my father’s name in Polish was not Matthias, but it was Mateush, and my mother names -- my mother’s name is Valentina.</span> <span id="s692">And my was -- and my brother’s is Jusef in Polish, yeah.</span> <span id="s693">And my, Sulamita, the only -- the only Hebrew name, but it’s such an -- it was not a popular name, so they didn’t know what name is it.</span> <span id="s694">And then the go -- went to the tenants, the Polish, Latinsky, Latinska and so on.</span> <span id="s695">So they -- we saw them coming in to our yard and reading the sign and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s696">So I’m coming in again, somebody else, reading, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s697">So we were very nervous, what -- we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s698">And -- but somebody told them, yeah, yeah, go, there are Jews there.</span> <span id="s699">So I remember they knocked at the door, Lithuanian policemen, and my mother opened the door, and they saw my mother and said, oh, I’m sorry, it’s a mistake.</span> <span id="s700">So she told no, it’s not a mistake, we are Jews.</span> <span id="s701">So he came in, and he asked for the pas -- passports, for the documents, and he started to write name.</span> <span id="s702">Then he looked out -- around -- my father looked -- I will show you the picture.</span> <span id="s703">It was an -- a -- a look of a Russian intelligent [indecipherable] you know -- you have to know the Russian intelligent, how they -- they looked, like Chekhov, like, you know.</span> <span id="s704">He looked my -- my mother was absolute not Jewish look, and me.</span> <span id="s705">So he told, look, you can’t change the nationality in the documents.</span> <span id="s706">You don’t have the names, the Jewish names, you don’t have the last name Jewish -- a Jewish one.</span> <span id="s707">What are you thinking how -- and it was such a shock for us.</span> <span id="s708">And I remember my father looking at my mother, and -- and she told no, we will go where -- wer -- where our people go, together with them.</span> <span id="s709">And we went.</span> <span id="s710">Because, you know, even if she allow him, okay, okay, maybe you can help pass -- to change, because it was not so easy to change in passport the name, you change to -- and there’s a nationality, to change like you cannot recognize it, it’s changed, you know?</span> <span id="s711">It’s very difficult, we didn’t know who can read, and then the neighbors would say, look why didn’t you take them, what is it with you?</span> <span id="s712">They are Jews.</span> <span id="s713">So we decided to go with [indecipherable] we went, we took some -- yeah, we took some belongings with me -- with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: After that decision was made, did your father and mother discuss it, or disagree about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: No, absolutely not.</span> <span id="s716">We took our belongings and the only thing my mother told Julia, Julia, this big bedroom where the children were, and the small room and the bathroom will belong to you.</span> <span id="s717">I don’t know if they leave you the other rooms, yeah?</span> <span id="s718">And she wrote on the door her name, Julia -- her maiden name was German, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s719">And she wrote al -- under that, volkesdeutsche.</span> <span id="s720">The Germans who were not in Germany, [indecipherable] but they were all in Poland, in Lithuania -- they lived in Poland or Lithuania, they named them not Germans, but volkesdeutsche.</span> <span id="s721">It’s deutsche is German, but volkes, it’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: People.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: -- people, people -- German people, yeah.</span> <span id="s724">And she brought to the room as much belonging as she could, then she saw that it’s too much, somebody can say what -- what is it.</span> <span id="s725">So she brought to the neighbors a part of the belongings.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: The neighbors that wouldn’t help your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No -- yeah.</span> <span id="s728">She di -- y-you know, they couldn’t recognize already that they are not friendly to us, because to hide a Jew was very -- very, very dangerous.</span> <span id="s729">So how can you accuse a person who di -- doesn’t want to risk their own life?</span> <span id="s730">You cannot make such a big a -- you know, a-a-accusation immediately.</span> <span id="s731">So she didn’t.</span> <span id="s732">She couldn’t understand it, she ment -- she said, oh yeah, she was afraid, but yeah, and that’s it, then we went to ghetto -- to the ghetto, and started a new life.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: You went with that Lithuanian policeman?</span> <span id="s734">Right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: No, no, no, no.</span> <span id="s736">We were -- I don’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s737">The other policemen were guarding the -- the Jewish people, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: But did you go that night after you had that discussion with the Lithuanian police --</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: It was not the night, it was the daytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: No -- it was the day?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: But did it happen --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: And the same day -- yeah, yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: -- very quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: -- yes, at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: At once.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: We went to ou -- we walked out with our belongings and were -- people were gathering already on the road, and we went with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: How much -- how many things did you actually take?</span> <span id="s749">What did you take, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: I don’t remember even what -- how could we remember that?</span> <span id="s751">I don’t know, probably our -- our personal belongings, nothing more.</span> <span id="s752">Not furniture, not nothing.</span> <span id="s753">I don’t know, maybe we took some pillows, or some --</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: Your father took his diploma?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Yeah, the papers we took always, yeah.</span> <span id="s756">The papers we took, yeah.</span> <span id="s757">And I don’t know when was it, but probably a day or two before, Veronica came to our house, and my mother gave her the jewelry.</span> <span id="s758">She didn’t take the jewelry there.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">Q: Does that mean that you were able to get the jewelry back?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: It means that she was selling the jewelry and bringing us food to -- to the ghetto, otherwise -- she was selling.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: What was Veronica’s last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Stenkavich.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: She was Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s765">Catholic, very religious and very human.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: When you got to the ghetto, how did you find a place to live?</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: A relative of my father, which relative was it, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s768">I think it was my father’s sister’s husband’s relative, that he wa -- he had apartment there.</span> <span id="s769">And he escaped when everybody was taken to Ponary, I don’t -- I don’t remember how.</span> <span id="s770">He was living there and he gave us a room.</span> <span id="s771">So we were 13 people, 13, one - three in -- in -- probably 13 like the room was like this room, like it was a small room, this [indecipherable] there was 13 people in this room.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: How did you actually sleep at night?</span> <span id="s773">Just lined up?</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: There were two beds, so I -- I don’t know how my father made some -- a -- a -- a wooden benches, yeah?</span> <span id="s775">They -- we used to sit on them during the day and during the night we put it together close to the bed.</span> <span id="s776">And my mother, my father and my brother slept not how we are sleeping alongs -- in -- in -- along the bed, yeah, but in

you?</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: Probably a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: What -- what were the conditions like in terms of bathing and going to the bathroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: It was one bathroom.</span> <span id="s805">We had one, two, three, four rooms, full with -- with people, and one bathroom in the corridor, and -- and -- and the washroom was separately, yeah, not hot water, but cold water.</span> <span id="s806">My mother had a shower every day, cold water, in summer and in winter.</span> <span id="s807">She was used to it.</span> <span id="s808">I was afraid to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Did you have a family meeting, or di -- do you remember talking to your parents late at night ab-about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: I didn't talk to my parents.</span> <span id="s811">I don’t know, I -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s812">I-I probably more listened than I talked.</span> <span id="s813">And nobody would listen to me.</span> <span id="s814">I was a child, a teenager, yeah.</span> <span id="s815">It was sad, and then people started to disappear, to disappear.</span> <span id="s816">And rumors went around that people are taking to the -- to prison and then from the prison to Ponary and killed.</span> <span id="s817">And then became the big action in Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, [indecipherable] everybody.</span> <span id="s818">They took from the apartment, that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s819">Rachel remembers something a little bit different, but I remember it that our family was taken from our room, and everybody had to go to the gate, to main -- to the main ga -- gate of ghetto, because other gates were -- other streets were closed, yeah.</span> <span id="s820">They build like walls, and that it was a main gate and another gate was for the head of the -- of the ghetto, special gate, a small gate, but he had the keys, and he could open and walk out, but he couldn’t.</span> <span id="s821">So everybody was gathered in front of the main gate.</span> <span id="s822">So the Lithuanian police went through the apartments and together with the Jewish police, and asked everybody to go out to the ghetto, to people in the front of the -- of the gate, and then they went to search every apartment if somebody was left there.</span> <span id="s823">And then I started to scream.</span> <span id="s824">What are we waiting?</span> <span id="s825">Are we waiting so quietly to be shot?</span> <span id="s826">And I screamed and talked to my parents and talked, and a man was standing behind and told my father, “Quiet down your daughter, otherwise I will quiet her down.</span> <span id="s827">What she’s talking about?</span> <span id="s828">Nobody will kill us, they are checking our documents.”</span> <span id="s829">That was the -- they always lied to -- to quiet the people down so the -- we are checking your papers, so you have to line up and we will check your papers.</span> <span id="s830">I didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s831">So my father told me I will give you a -- my watch as a good [indecipherable] watch -- I’ll give you the watch, and give it to the Lithuanian, and -- because they -- they was taking some money, and -- give it to the Lithuanian, he will let you go.</span> <span id="s832">Professor, what are you talking about?</span> <span id="s833">I will give to one Lithuanian, he will let me go, the other one will cu -- catch me, there is four.</span> <span id="s834">And I ha [indecipherable] was how could you stand her quietly and your -- go to -- to the grave?</span> <span id="s835">What are you -- so my mother couldn’t listen to it any more, and she went to the German who was the leader of the whole entertainment, yeah?</span> <span id="s836">Yeah.</span> <span id="s837">We will call like that, the death dance.</span> <span id="s838">And she started to talk to him in German, of course.</span> <span id="s839">He was shocked.</span> <span id="s840">He told her -- he asked her, “What?</span> <span id="s841">Where are you from?</span> <span id="s842">Your German is so perfect.”</span> <span id="s843">I’m from Berlin.</span> <span id="s844">I am also from ber -- from Berlin.</span> <span id="s845">Where is your family.</span> <span id="s846">[indecipherable] here.</span> <span id="s847">So, get out of here.</span> <span id="s848">And he came over with my mother and he told -- told [indecipherable] this is my daughter, my [indecipherable] and he -- he told us to stand on the side, yeah.</span> <span id="s849">So we stand here, and he was standing, father, and then a Lithuanian came over and started to slap us back to there.</span> <span id="s850">So he told no, don’t touch them.</span> <span id="s851">So people saw that we are standing there, so people started to run behind us, so our family was growing and we were standing in the front and behind us some other people, some other people.</span> <span id="s852">And then they opened the gate and all the people went -- left.</span> <span id="s853">We was -- we were already in the ghetto, standing in the ghetto and waiting for the -- for [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s854">And then he told, the action is finished, goodbye, and he left, and he went back.</span> <span id="s855">And then the -- so the Jewish police knew it, where other people are -- are going.</span> <span id="s856">They told, oh, you save your life, you save your life.</span> <span id="s857">And then we heard that everybody was taken to the prison, to Lukeeshki, and from the pris -- prison to Ponary and everybody was killed.</span> <span id="s858">It was thousands and thousands of people.</span> <span id="s859">I don’t know -- I don’t remember the number, but it was a lot.</span> <span id="s860">Maybe eight thousand, maybe 10 thousand.</span> <span id="s861">And then some run away, people wounded from the, you know, graves, came to ghetto, smelling with dead people already.</span> <span id="s862">Well, we knew already.</span> <span id="s863">And I told my mother, that’s it, I am not more going together with you and waiting until they will shot me.</span> <span id="s864">[indecipherable] shoot me, they will kill me.</span> <span id="s865">[indecipherable] to run.</span> <span id="s866">Every time it was a rumor, every time that we heard that it will be an action, it will be something in ghetto.</span> <span id="s867">So every time I heard it in the morning, I was putting my star of -- the David star, yeah in -- on the front only, I didn’t have it on -- on my back, and it was not, you know, I -- it was with a needle --</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: A pin.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: -- with a pin, yeah.</span> <span id="s870">And I went together with these people who went to work, who left the ghetto to work, people were working for the Germans, doing some job.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: You -- you told your mother that --</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: -- from now on you were going to run away --</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: -- when you heard rumors.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: What did your mother say?</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s879">She was happy that -- so -- and then it was a problem.</span> <span id="s880">Her -- we were working -- the Jewish people who worked the brig -- with the brigades, yeah, they were walking through the streets, but not on the sidewalks, but in -- on the road.</span> <span id="s881">So it was one risk to take out the -- my star, yellow star, to go to the sidewalk and to disappear.</span> <span id="s882">Not to take it.</span> <span id="s883">And I run though the -- through the town, to the city, to Veronica.</span> <span id="s884">And I stayed with her a couple of months.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">Q: What did she say when you came to the door?</span></p> <p><span id="s886">A: She was happy.</span> <span id="s887">But she was very poor, and she had only one room.</span> <span id="s888">And they -- her neighbors liked to -- to talk to her, to come in and to have a chat, you know, they saw me.</span> <span id="s889">I couldn’t hide myself, was one room.</span> <span id="s890">So she told everybody, oh my relative from -- from a village came to live.</span> <span id="s891">Okay.</span> <span id="s892">They knew, but they pretend that they don’t know.</span> <span id="s893">And we used to walk with her.</span> <span id="s894">I used to go with her to a priest.</span> <span id="s895">Once we went and she -- she gave him an -- a golden ruble what my -- my mother had when that hor -- the times of [indecipherable] there were golden rubles [indecipherable] like that.</span> <span id="s896">So she gave it to him and he gave us some bread, and a piece of margarine, I think.</span> <span id="s897">And as everybo --</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: A priest, this was a priest?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s900">And he took the money and he gave us bread, and some margarine, and he came back, and tomorrow, for tomorrow she went -- I -- I don’t know, maybe I went together with her, and I -- and we gave it to my brother who worked also outside the ghetto, and he used to bring it in the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: So you and Veronica went and found your brother, and gave him some food?</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: Oh, she knew where he worked --</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: -- yeah, it’s not the first time she went to him to give him food.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: So your brother was able to also tell your parents that you were with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Yeah, that I am alive and I am with her, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: What did you look like?</span> <span id="s910">You had long braids?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Long blonde braids?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s914">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">A: I’ll show you.</span> <span id="s916">I have here a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: She saved us -- she and Julia saved us their old pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: So -- so you could look -- you didn't -- as you’ve said many times actually in this interview, you didn’t necessarily -- you couldn’t look like what people assumed Jews looked like.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: You could pass for a little German girl, or a Polish girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yeah, yeah, a Polish girl, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: A Polish girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Because I -- my Polish was fluently, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: So when you were staying with Veronica, what were the fears?</span> <span id="s926">Were they mostly of the neighbors, or at that point would you be afraid that Germans might come searching house to house?</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: The Lithuanian.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: The Lithuanians?</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: That was -- and the -- the neighbors were friendly, except one, and this one started to talk that Veronica is hiding a Jew.</span> <span id="s932">And then another neighbor came to us and told her, Veronica, you have to do something, because she told, that the rumors are going like that, that you are hiding a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s933">So her mother, she had a -- she has a mo -- had a mother, a old mother, yeah, she was also not very young, but so sh -- her mother started to cry, let me die in my bed, I don’t want to be hanged by Germans -- by Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s934">If they would find me, they would kill both of them.</span> <span id="s935">Was no question about it.</span> <span id="s936">She cried [indecipherable] because didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s937">So I decided to go back.</span> <span id="s938">And I remember our way back, she took me, and we went back.</span> <span id="s939">Was in the evening.</span> <span id="s940">She cried the whole w-way back.</span> <span id="s941">She told me if I can -- if I risk with my own life, it’s okay, but I don’t want to risk with my mother’s life.</span> <span id="s942">And I -- I understood it.</span> <span id="s943">That’s it, it’s too dan -- dangerous.</span> <span id="s944">When I came back my mother was very unhappy that it was all the actions with the [indecipherable] the yellow, with the pink and [indecipherable] were over [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s945">And it was a small period of time that it was qu -- almost quiet, yeah.</span> <span id="s946">Some people were killed because they took some bread to get, or some people were killed because they were caught stealing something and so on, but not such a action how thousands of people were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Can you talk a little bit about how you began to work when you were in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s950">You were, after all -- at that point how old were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: Ah, 15 -- or 15 I was already in fo -- 1943, so -- and I started to work in 1942 probably, when I was 14.</span> <span id="s952">But you know, because I was in and out of the ghetto, I didn’t have like a -- a real serious wor -- job.</span> <span id="s953">But I don’t know who took me to Polish bricks.</span> <span id="s954">I -- they have to be polished, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s955">So it was such a machine.</span> <span id="s956">It was red, not -- they were not very st -- very straight so I had to polish them.</span> <span id="s957">My mother was very upset about it because it were a dust which goes -- went to my lungs, and she was always afraid -- afraid of my lungs, because my aunt, her sister -- my mother’s sister, died of tuberculosis.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: You were working with bricks?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s961">Making the bricks?</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: No, polishing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Polishing the bricks?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: For what?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: I have no idea for what.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: There were a lot of jobs what I didn't ha -- I -- I didn’t know why I -- where I have to do it, but I don’t remember who took me, who asked me to do it, but I went to work for one time.</span> <span id="s969">And then the evening I belonged to -- to a -- a youth club.</span> <span id="s970">You know, we tried to make the life more or less normal, you know?</span> <span id="s971">As normal as could be.</span> <span id="s972">As close to normal as it could be.</span> <span id="s973">So we had a club, and we had poets and writers, who taught us literature, Jewish literature, and we were performing there, and I won even a -- a prize for a poem what I was reciting, yeah.</span> <span id="s974">Yeah -- re --</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: A poem?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yeah, a poem.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: What was the poem about?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: It was a poem of -- an -- an old Yiddish p-poet, Ihoyash, that was his name.</span> <span id="s979">He is a famous Yiddish poet -- Jewish poet, actually, not Yiddish.</span> <span id="s980">But he wrote in Yiddish.</span> <span id="s981">That -- and we were -- it was like a close family, and the -- in the club, so I was so involved in performing something, and -- so it was -- but it was a very short time, a short time what I told you, I don’t know, three, four months that we were -- we had the life without the big, big action, without the killing thousands of people.</span> <span id="s982">People were dying of starvation, of course, and -- and illnesses.</span> <span id="s983">People were taken for that, or for another so-called crime.</span> <span id="s984">If you see as -- you are very hungry and you steal a piece of bread, you were shot, you know.</span> <span id="s985">But like the actions, which were before, like the actions with the yellow shines, with the pink shines, what -- thousands of people were killed.</span> <span id="s986">So it was a short period, I think the end of ’42, or the beginning of the ’43, that it was -- I don’t remember the date exactly, but it was more or less quiet.</span> <span id="s987">And we had even a school for students -- everything was illegal, of course.</span> <span id="s988">The school was like we used to come and the teachers taught us history, and literature, and mathematics.</span> <span id="s989">And I remember my father as a mathematic.</span> <span id="s990">He used to -- he wanted to teach me mathematics, so he explained to me something, and I didn't listen even to him.</span> <span id="s991">He asked me to repeat and I told him, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s992">So he thought, you are not listening to me.</span> <span id="s993">So I told him, do you want me to -- to die a educated person?</span> <span id="s994">I don’t care.</span> <span id="s995">Well, he stopped.</span> <span id="s996">Then the teacher of French language, yeah, I had a private less -- private lessons of French before the war.</span> <span id="s997">So she was a neighbor of ours in the ghetto, so my mother used to ask me, go to Eda Danielovna, go to her, she is so lonely, she already lost her husband and her daughter, she is alone, go and talk to her French.</span> <span id="s998">Well, I thought, what ha -- why -- what do you want from me?</span> <span id="s999">I can be killed without French.</span> <span id="s1000">And I remember that only once I came to her and we talked, and now I don’t know French.</span> <span id="s1001">Now I kne -- I have to know French, but I don’t know now.</span> <span id="s1002">That -- my mother was clever that she wanted me to -- to, you know, not to forget the language, the French language, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: How did your parents react when you spoke like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1004">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1005">They kept quiet.</span> <span id="s1006">What could they tell?</span> <span id="s1007">They never told me, you will survive, because they didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1008">Maybe my mother had, but I told you the dream, so she was hopeful -- she hopes that I will survive, but the life was -- it was so difficult to survive that -- I know that my father closed the book and never came to me again.</span> <span id="s1009">So, and the lessons at school were very -- you know, it was very upsetting because every day we used to see, oh another teacher is gone, yeah.</span> <span id="s1010">Oh, he died.</span> <span id="s1011">Oh, this one was caught carrying a piece of bread and was taken to the prison.</span> <span id="s1012">Oh, this -- you know, every day, so it was so -- you know, upsetting that then we closed the school at all.</span> <span id="s1013">Let’s see, they forgot to tell you about a m -- the last days of the -- the last days of the peace before the 90 -- the ra -- the war started in 1941 -- in 1941.</span> <span id="s1014">So it was days very -- very -- not quiet days, because the KGB were already -- start already to work very energetic in Lithuania.</span> <span id="s1015">Before they were -- they kept a little bit quiet, they let us leave normally, yeah.</span> <span id="s1016">Then, probably they felt already that it will be a war between Russia and Germany, so they started to take people out to Siberia, that -- the people who they thought were enemies of Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s1017">Who were the enemies of the sov -- of Soviet Union?</span> <span id="s1018">Of course, some parties, alexa -- Zionist parties, Zionist parties and BUND, and -- and rich people.</span> <span id="s1019">So but Wilna was a poor city at all, and they didn’t -- in Wilna didn’t -- they didn’t have rich people, very rich people, I mean.</span> <span id="s1020">So, but in -- the Bolsheviks thought that everybody who has a small store was selling some newspapers and some pencils and some salt and sugar, everything in one room, is rich.</span> <span id="s1021">So they used to take the people out of their homes and to take them to the railway station and to take them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1022">Also peasants, Lithuanian peasants who had more than one cow, or one -- was already like a kulak in -- in Russia.</span> <span id="s1023">A rich peasant who is exploiting others, you know, so -- and my mother was dreaming to run away from Wilna.</span> <span id="s1024">So she was standing on the street in front of our house, and asking them when they -- you know, they are -- the kb -- KGB was -- had the list of names and was taking one -- from one house a family, from another one.</span> <span id="s1025">Come to us, please, we will -- we are rich, we are ri -- do you see, we have a house -- the house didn’t belong already to us, but she told like that -- and a house, and na na na, and then come right in.</span> <span id="s1026">We had normal furniture, fi -- nice furniture.</span> <span id="s1027">We -- we are rich, take us, take us to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1028">And people thought that she is crazy, what is it?</span> <span id="s1029">I remember somebody asked me, is your mother crazy?</span> <span id="s1030">And I, no.</span> <span id="s1031">So why she is asking them to take you to Siberia?</span> <span id="s1032">Because it’s better than to take over the ger -- the Germans will take over us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1033">And she was right.</span> <span id="s1034">Mostly.</span> <span id="s1035">Of course, not everybody survived in Siberia also, of course not.</span> <span id="s1036">I s -- it was a very hard time, it was a very hard time to Russia at all, and it was a hard time to people in Siberia.</span> <span id="s1037">But mostly they survived, and they came back.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Your mother tried awfully hard to -- to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: She tried very hard to -- to get out of the country, yeah, of Lithuania and the city of -- couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1040">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1041">Yeah, that’s what I missed these days.</span> <span id="s1042">Then the war started, so you know already that we are on our way too late, and we were caught, and we came back, and we came to the ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: In -- in the ghetto, can you describe the -- the interactions that you did have with the Germans?</span> <span id="s1044">Where would you interact with them once you were in the ghetto?</span> <span id="s1045">Was it just coming in and going out, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: No, it’s a -- it’s -- as I told you, when it was Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday, when they took all the people, that what I survived, this action.</span> <span id="s1047">The others actions I was not there in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: I knew only that then it was a yel -- the action of the yellow -- yellow -- documents of the yellow shine [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1050">So I was with Veronica, and we knew that something is going on in ghetto.</span> <span id="s1051">And now of course I was very upset, and I didn't know what happened with my family.</span> <span id="s1052">So she told me, come, we will go th -- to this -- to the -- in the direction of the ghetto, maybe we will learn something.</span> <span id="s1053">And we went and we met a Jewish family, walking like that in the streets.</span> <span id="s1054">So we stopped them and started to talk to them, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s1055">So they told me -- they told us that it was the action of yellow documents, of yellow shines, and we have the -- the yellow shines, so we were allowed to go and to go to our job where he was working.</span> <span id="s1056">He was working for Germans, I don’t know which organization, so he took his family and he went there.</span> <span id="s1057">So I didn’t know if my father had it, and I was so upset and we went farther, and we stayed -- I don’t know which street we -- we were stopped by a crowd with -- the crowd was looking how they -- the Jews were going through the road to Ponary.</span> <span id="s1058">And I was looking together, and I thought, my God, why is there -- why is they are walking so quietly?</span> <span id="s1059">Why is they not doing something, you know?</span> <span id="s1060">And I looked if my father or my mother -- my family is there.</span> <span id="s1061">Couldn’t see it.</span> <span id="s1062">But suddenly I saw a woman carried a small child, and shud -- suddenly the Lithuanian were not so close, the soldiers who took them, she throw the child to the crowd, and somebody took the child and disappeared immediately.</span> <span id="s1063">Understand?</span> <span id="s1064">She throw to the crowd, to the Aryan crowd who were standing, and probably a -- a -- a woman took the child and run away.</span> <span id="s1065">But of course she was afraid that somebody will stop her for taking, but nobody stopped her.</span> <span id="s1066">She run away, she -- immediately she was gone.</span> <span id="s1067">So the woman saved her child.</span> <span id="s1068">It was horrible.</span> <span id="s1069">I don’t remem -- then, we went with her to that place where my son was working because my father was working in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1070">And my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Or your brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: My father, and my brother worked out of the ghetto, so we -- we went to he -- to see him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: To see who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: My -- my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: Okay, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: And he -- I -- we -- we met him and he told that yeah, the family is okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: The family is okay.</span> <span id="s1079">So, the family -- my father took Rachel as a daughter inste -- you know, instead of me, because I was not there.</span> <span id="s1080">And my brother took my cousin, my -- my father’s sister’s daughter, as a wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Dina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: D-Dina, yes.</span> <span id="s1083">Dina Abramovich, yeah, who wer -- who is 90 now and works for the [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">You know, because it was who had the yellow document, could take with -- with them, a wife, and two children less than 16 years.</span> <span id="s1085">So Rachel was already approaching 20, but she looked so young.</span> <span id="s1086">Everybody looked so thin, that you couldn’t understand she is 20 or 16 or fi -- 16 or 15, you know?</span> <span id="s1087">So it was okay, and he took her, my cousin, she was much older than he, but it went smooth, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: But when you came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: -- then were y -- wh-whose paper were you on?</span> <span id="s1091">If Rachel was on your father’s paper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Nobody checked the paper then.</span> <span id="s1093">They checked the papers when the actions were, you know, but nobody checked the papers.</span> <span id="s1094">Look, people are dying and running away and kill -- people were killed every minute.</span> <span id="s1095">So who knows -- who knew?</span> <span id="s1096">Where is my daughter and where is my brother?</span> <span id="s1097">Where is my father?</span> <span id="s1098">Nobody checked it.</span> <span id="s1099">And my father organized in the ghetto a small school for -- like a technical school.</span> <span id="s1100">And some use -- some young boys were attending the school, and making some, you know -- I don’t -- I don’t know even what they produced.</span> <span id="s1101">But I know one thing, that the -- the underground was working already in ghetto and my -- my brother was among them, who was stealing weapons from the Germans and was bringing to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1102">And I know that the young people who are working in the school, the technical school were repairing guns, making something like grenades, like to -- to -- you know --</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Grenades, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1106">Handmade grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1108">We used to, you know, the bulb -- to take a bulb --</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">Q: A light bulb?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: -- from -- yeah, a lamp, yeah.</span> <span id="s1111">To take everything from inside, to put a liquid, which is -- which can be inflamed immediately when you throw it, the glass will, of course, break, and it will, like a bomb, you know, it will burst.</span> <span id="s1112">So that was our grenades in ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Your -- so they were making these in your father’s technical school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: Yeah, yeah, they were [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">Q: So your father’s technical school wasn’t just a school?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: He -- I -- I don’t know, he pretended it was a school, you know, it was very -- everything was very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1117">There they made fels -- like they made keys to -- to the gate.</span> <span id="s1118">Like, the gate was closed, locked always, yeah.</span> <span id="s1119">Only when people were going out to work or coming in from work.</span> <span id="s1120">So they made keys to -- to ca -- to be able to walk out at night, to the partisan, to the woods, you know?</span> <span id="s1121">And it was not from the gate, from the main gate, but it was another gate, a small one, what I told you for the -- the leader of the ghetto, who would walk out.</span> <span id="s1122">He had a personal gate, a personal key, and he could walk out with a key -- through the small gate.</span> <span id="s1123">His name was Genz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Jacob Genz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Jacob Genz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: He had a -- a Lithuanian wife, and a daughter who wa -- out of ghetto, of course.</span> <span id="s1128">And he was allowed to come to them to visit them sometimes, you know.</span> <span id="s1129">So he had his key, and so then the partisans used it, and probably Genz knew about it, I think.</span> <span id="s1130">So it was very, very difficult to hide, and he knew about the -- that the party -- the underground party existed, yeah, and the [indecipherable] was named.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Were you part of that underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Yeah, you know, I was a part of it, but I was small -- no, y -- I was too young, and we were only like some, you know, listen to some news from Russia, what’s going on in the front, how the Germans are already retreating, and to encourage people that soon, soon, soon, that will be the end of the war, and th -- you know, so we were listening to the news, writing down and then giving it to read for people, and so this was not exactly a big job, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: But you did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Yeah, yeah, we did.</span> <span id="s1135">And -- and we, of course, I hope that they will take me to the partisans, cause I -- I -- I didn’t look like a Jewish girl and I could go to the fr -- from the forest to the city and back.</span> <span id="s1136">I had such -- we had to have a connection, so somebody had to come to the city and go back to -- to the forest, so -- but they decided that I am too young, and they left me behind, me and Rachel, also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Who -- who left you behind?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: The organizers of the -- of the -- of the underground organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Was your brother involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: My brother was involved in the -- of course, yes, he used to steal and bring weapons.</span> <span id="s1141">But he was caught before -- before the liquidation of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1142">He was caught in the action of men, and it was -- they were -- before they liquidated the ghetto, they were catching only men, so he was caught and transferred to the -- the concentration camp in Estonia, in Klooga.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Can you tell us about that, that day that he was caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: It was a day when the organization mobilized all the members, and decided to -- to fight the Germans, decided to resist, it’s enough, you have to resist.</span> <span id="s1145">And we were mobilized on one street in a -- in a big, big yard of the -- of the house where the partisans probably had the weapons, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1146">I don’t know exactly because we -- we were not -- I was not told where and what they have.</span> <span id="s1147">One group of the underground fighters were sent to another house, and they had to start to fight the Germans, who were entering -- the Germans and the Lithuanians who were entering the -- the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1148">And another group of only boys and my -- they include my brother were sent to another street, and -- but they went without weapons and they were told that the weapons were being delivered.</span> <span id="s1149">And they were not delivered and the Germans surrounded them and they took them, all of them, the whole group.</span> <span id="s1150">And the -- the people who were in fron -- in the front house, saw it was foolish, they were told that it will be a parole when they start to shout -- to shoot the Germans, so it was a parole fire.</span> <span id="s1151">But fire is in German also.</span> <span id="s1152">You know what fire?</span> <span id="s1153">Fire is a fire, you know?</span> <span id="s1154">It -- so it’s -- and the Germans walked through the streets and somebody asked for a cigarette probably, give me the fire or something.</span> <span id="s1155">They had fire, they started to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1156">And they did -- and the Germans, they -- around to the -- the base, to the f -- to the house, that the people from the house couldn’t see them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1157">And they put a bomb there and they run away and the whole house was exploded and all the people were -- were -- died, of course.</span> <span id="s1158">Were killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: So ri -- the people in the resistance in the ghetto were waiting for an order to shoot, and they got -- they got a mixed up order and they shot accidentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: And then the Germans bombed the building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Where were you during all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: And I was in another -- well, in the sam -- the same street, but oh, maybe three or four houses from there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: So -- so you saw this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: I didn’t see it, but I heard it, of course.</span> <span id="s1167">And then -- then the organization, the head of the organization decided there is no reason to fight.</span> <span id="s1168">We have to leave ge -- the ghetto to go -- you have to rent to -- to go to the partisans and to fight the -- the Germans from the woods.</span> <span id="s1169">But was it a right decision?</span> <span id="s1170">But the decision has to be done much earlier.</span> <span id="s1171">And to take much more people to the partisans because we were so afraid that the Germans can learn about the organization, that it was very, very -- it was a conspiracy, very, very underground, and nobody knew it except the members of the organization.</span> <span id="s1172">But we could involve more -- more young people.</span> <span id="s1173">And the other tha -- thing is, they took only -- to the woods they took only people who had a pistol, or a -- a gun, or something like that.</span> <span id="s1174">Who had no weapons they didn’t want it.</span> <span id="s1175">So we didn't -- I had -- didn’t have it, and -- and Rachel didn’t have it, so we were la -- left behind, and that what is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: So how did you find out where Joseph was taken to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: Joseph was so capable that he send us a -- a small letter that the man who -- the machinist of the train, the man who was -- how you say?</span> <span id="s1178">You know, somebody has to sit there, and to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: The conductor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: Conductor, yeah, but it’s not like a conduc -- okay, the conductor was a young Polish guy, and my brother wrote a note that I am taking to a concentration camp to Estonia, and please save Rachel.</span> <span id="s1181">He was so thinking about her, that that was his -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1182">And the guy, I don’t know how, I don’t remember how, he brought a letter to the ghetto -- oh he, or somebody else brought it, but we -- we had it, and we knew that they were there.</span> <span id="s1183">And my father told me that you cannot run away without Rachel, because my son asked me to save Rachel.</span> <span id="s1184">Okay.</span> <span id="s1185">So, when it was the liquidation of the ghetto, on the 23rd of September, 1943, so we were -- the ghetto was surrounded already by Lithuanian police, and -- and I think even with po -- no, the -- I think mostly Ukrainian police, because the Lithuanian police, the Lithuanian SS actually knew already that the Russians are coming, and they run to the forest with another group of partisans, what they claim now that they were the patriots.</span> <span id="s1186">Okay, maybe, but I don’t know which patriot they were, but -- so they run to the forest to fight the Russians, of course, because they wanted to help the Germans, but the Germans wanted to mobilize them to go to the army and to fight the Russian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1187">They didn’t want it, so they didn’t obey the Germans, but they wanted to fight Russians, so they run to the forests.</span> <span id="s1188">And of course they were afraid that if some Jews were alive, so they were going to tell that -- what -- what was going on there.</span> <span id="s1189">So I think that the -- the liquidation of the g-ghetto in Wilna was by a Ukrainian SS division, made by Ukrainians, because I remember standing with Rachel in line already, hearing them talking Russian.</span> <span id="s1190">Russian, or Ukrainian, it’s very similar, you know, you can recognize, you can understand.</span> <span id="s1191">And we -- when we understood that we cannot go out together with the organization, underground organization, cannot leave the ghetto, we started to look for a exit, how to run.</span> <span id="s1192">We met some other girls.</span> <span id="s1193">We were sitting a couple of hours in a -- you know, the places where the -- the water is running from the toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">Q: The sewer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q: Tunnel, or sewer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">A: In such a -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1198">So we s-sat there until it was dark, then we went out, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: You were hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">A: Yeah, hiding, but for several hours, we didn’t want to hide it for -- forever, we couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1201">It was like sitting like that, and it was not -- not only comfortable, but was impossible to sit long there.</span> <span id="s1202">And -- and it was in ghetto, at -- you know, and we wanted to go out.</span> <span id="s1203">So we walked out, the ghetto was -- looked terrible.</span> <span id="s1204">There are no people already in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1205">It was dark already, with the -- the windows were open, the doors were open, the belongings were in the streets, you know.</span> <span id="s1206">The pillows were torn apart, all the feathers.</span> <span id="s1207">Like, I see the -- the picture like today, you know, like it was yesterday.</span> <span id="s1208">And n-near us was a library, a big library, a [indecipherable] library.</span> <span id="s1209">So the books were out in the streets, torn and -- you know.</span> <span id="s1210">And we looked for people, you know, so we met three o-other girls, so we were five of us.</span> <span id="s1211">And we decided to go to climb the stairs upstairs in a building.</span> <span id="s1212">And I know -- I don’t know how we knew that the building has a hole in the roof, and we can go out to -- onto the roof, and from the roof we can jump to another building which doesn’t belong already to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1213">So it was dark, and we couldn’t see well, but we saw the hole in the roof, and one of the girls climbed the ladder, and she was the first who looked out, and she was caught.</span> <span id="s1214">So, a soldier was [indecipherable] there and watching.</span> <span id="s1215">She was caught, and she shouted so loudly that we ran back.</span> <span id="s1216">I remember not finding the way out of there.</span> <span id="s1217">You know, the building, it was dark, where are the stairs, where are -- where is [indecipherable] run back.</span> <span id="s1218">And then -- then we s -- we saw no way out.</span> <span id="s1219">And we went to the building of the Judenrat, I mean like the government of the ghetto [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1220">And we found this Jewish police and the government [indecipherable] and some people were there.</span> <span id="s1221">And we -- we came to them.</span> <span id="s1222">So the next day, we were taken together with the poli -- Jewish police and everybody.</span> <span id="s1223">Taken to the same place where the old people were taken already [indecipherable] and old, old cemetery, what Rachel told you, called Rosa, and -- and then I wa -- I met my mother.</span> <span id="s1224">She -- when she saw me she was surprised, and so upset, and I couldn’t describe you the -- you know, I can’t describe you the -- her face.</span> <span id="s1225">She was so sure that I’ll run away.</span> <span id="s1226">She was so sure that I will survive, you know?</span> <span id="s1227">And that was her only hope.</span> <span id="s1228">And then they started to let out the people one by one, and to select them, one to the right, one to the left, one to the right, one to the left.</span> <span id="s1229">And we saw that to the left, they are pushing the old people and children, and handicaps.</span> <span id="s1230">It -- it means they are sending them to death, that we know already.</span> <span id="s1231">To the right, only young people.</span> <span id="s1232">And I remember that when I -- I think Rachel wer -- we walked out the first and she was sent to the right.</span> <span id="s1233">I was the next and my mother was behind me.</span> <span id="s1234">And he ask me -- like I was 15 years old, maybe I w-was tall, and he thought maybe I am older, but he ask me, “Are you alone?”</span> <span id="s1235">I told no, no.</span> <span id="s1236">So he -- he want to push me to the left, and I told, “Yes, I am alone.”</span> <span id="s1237">And he pushed me to the right.</span> <span id="s1238">And my mother, he didn’t push her, she went immediately to the left.</span> <span id="s1239">And I stopped her, cried, “Ma, Ma.”</span> <span id="s1240">She -- she didn't look at me.</span> <span id="s1241">That was the last time I saw her.</span> <span id="s1242">She told us that she went together with -- with my father.</span> <span id="s1243">They walked out of the ghetto together, but they separated the men from the women, so she didn’t know where my father is.</span> <span id="s1244">And Rachel’s sister decided go together as a child and with the family, both sisters.</span> <span id="s1245">They were young, they went together.</span> <span id="s1246">And I didn't go with my mother.</span> <span id="s1247">It was hard fo -- to me, but you know.</span> <span id="s1248">It was a time when I ask myself why I didn’t go with my mother, and then I was protecting myself and saying, oh but my mother was -- would be even more unhappy if she saw me together with her, dying.</span> <span id="s1249">And it was only good for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1250">More Jews are dying, it’s better for them, so why I shouldn’t do it?</span> <span id="s1251">Okay, maybe I’m right, maybe not, but I did it.</span> <span id="s1252">Th-The moment I didn't think about it, I protected my life.</span> <span id="s1253">So they gathered all the people from the left side, and they send to Majdanek immediately to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1254">They were not even in the concentration camp, not one day.</span> <span id="s1255">From the train they took them to the gas chambers immediately.</span> <span id="s1256">And one person from the whole -- I don’t know how many thousand people were there, because so many thousands were already killed, but I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s1257">But one person was run away.</span> <span id="s1258">And she -- she was a -- a wi -- a wife of a engineer who worked with my father.</span> <span id="s1259">When I came back, she came back to Wilna after the work -- after the war, and she learned that I am in hospital right after the war.</span> <span id="s1260">So she came to me to hospital -- to the hospital, and she told me that your mother was not killed, your mother committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1261">So I told her I know, because my mother told me, I have the pills, they will not kill me.</span> <span id="s1262">So she committed suicide in the car already -- in the train, on the train.</span> <span id="s1263">She committed suicide and my husband, who was not a husband yet, but the hu -- the husband’s mother -- my husband’s -- in the future he was my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Your future husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, my future husband’s mother and his aunt.</span> <span id="s1266">The aunt was -- worked for a pharmacy and she gave them the pills.</span> <span id="s1267">Three of them together committed suicide.</span> <span id="s1268">So that was -- that how I learned how my m -- mother died.</span> <span id="s1269">And we were taken to a train, and when we went to the train, I asked Rachel to run.</span> <span id="s1270">Come, come.</span> <span id="s1271">I told her, as soon as we are out of the country, and I’ll not know another language, I’ll not run away.</span> <span id="s1272">I know the language here, I can communicate with the people, I can run.</span> <span id="s1273">She was not used to run.</span> <span id="s1274">It was a -- it was a -- really not so easy to decide it.</span> <span id="s1275">She told me, we will maybe meet my -- my brother in the concentration camp, she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1276">And one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Joseph?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: Yeah, Joseph.</span> <span id="s1279">And one of our girls told wi -- and wa -- that one woman Hiah Shapiro [indecipherable] she is now in Israel, she told us, girls, I’m running.</span> <span id="s1280">And she immediately took from -- from our row to the sidewalk, to a house.</span> <span id="s1281">I didn’t know that it was the house where she lived, and she disappeared, and she survived.</span> <span id="s1282">She found a way to the woods.</span> <span id="s1283">It was not so easy everything, it was not, but she was in the partisans, and then she -- she run to the [indecipherable] Europe.</span> <span id="s1284">In 1945 she went to -- through Poland, through Hungary, through Italy, on -- il -- illegal to Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: So you wanted to run?</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: But I didn’t, because I couldn’t run by myself.</span> <span id="s1287">I had to run with Rachel.</span> <span id="s1288">That was my father’s last words to me.</span> <span id="s1289">Don’t run without Rachel.</span> <span id="s1290">Then many years passed and I thought, how could he tell a child of 15 years such a thing, such a warning?</span> <span id="s1291">It was a matter of life and death, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1292">And we were taken -- we were taken to the train station, to the train and when -- and went to Latvia, to Kaiserwald, then from Kaiserwald to Stutthof.</span> <span id="s1293">Not to Stutthof, to Strassenhof.</span> <span id="s1294">There we stayed for the -- more or less a year, and we were working for the [indecipherable] manufacturer.</span> <span id="s1295">A factory, produced materials for -- for the soldiers, such -- like stuff, I don’t know what they -- what -- they were sewing them, I don’t know from the stuff here -- it’s a web -- web machine, yes, web machine, yes?</span> <span id="s1296">That’s -- it’s in English, no?</span> <span id="s1297">A machine who is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: Weaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: We -- how?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: Weaving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Weedy?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Weave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: Weave, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1305">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: That is, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">Q: C-Can you descri --</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">A: Web is in German.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Can you describe the train ride from Vilnius, I guess you went to Kaiserwald first?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: That was your deportation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Can you describe that train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: First of all, we were, of course, in the wagons, the cars were like for cattles, yeah.</span> <span id="s1315">We were sitting on the floor, close to each other, how many people in one, I don’t know even.</span> <span id="s1316">Hundred, 200, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1317">Locked the doors, no windows, a small like window, like under the roof.</span> <span id="s1318">And they were -- you know, we didn't know the direction.</span> <span id="s1319">We didn’t know where they take -- where they took us.</span> <span id="s1320">And in a half an hour or an hour was a ride, yeah, suddenly the train stopped.</span> <span id="s1321">We were sure that it’s Ponary.</span> <span id="s1322">So they brought us to the place where they shoot the Jews, yeah?</span> <span id="s1323">So we were waiting and waiting when the door will be opened.</span> <span id="s1324">I don’t know if they stopped there, or in another place.</span> <span id="s1325">If they stopped it deliberately to make us, you know, so -- it’s like to -- morally to -- to f -- to destroy us morally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: To weaken you, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1328">Oh, we were weak -- already weakened.</span> <span id="s1329">Already.</span> <span id="s1330">But -- and then the train went on and we suddenly stop -- stopped -- I don’t know how long we went.</span> <span id="s1331">The whole day, I think, until the next night.</span> <span id="s1332">I think we went -- we were on the train the whole day, and until in the middle of the night, opened the doors, and we -- we saw big lamps like a -- like that, how it’s called --</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Lights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: -- reflector more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Lights?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">A: Lights, yeah, but has a name.</span> <span id="s1337">Forgot now.</span> <span id="s1338">You know, it -- big, big lamp pointing the light in one direction and you see everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q: Spotlight.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">A: Oh, it has another -- like -- like you -- somebody is performing on a stage.</span> <span id="s1341">There are lights who are lighting them -- the stage, yeah?</span> <span id="s1342">What is it called, the lights?</span> <span id="s1343">Okay, you understand what I mean, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1344">Q: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">A: And the lights were centered onto the door -- on the doors of the cars, so we were blind absolutely.</span> <span id="s1346">We were in the dark the whole time, and suddenly so much light, yeah.</span> <span id="s1347">And the dogs barking, and we couldn’t see even where we are, and who are around us.</span> <span id="s1348">There were SS men, these big dogs, you know, how they used to do it.</span> <span id="s1349">And they were shouting at us, raus, raus, faster, faster, faster.</span> <span id="s1350">Go, go.</span> <span id="s1351">And then we were putting in a -- in a row everybody and letting into a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1352">We saw there the gates and we understood that it’s a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1353">That’s how we came to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1354">And then for tomorrow, we went out in the morning, we went out to a appelle.</span> <span id="s1355">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">Q: Roll call.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Yeah, we had to -- to show up, everybody has to show up in a -- in -- to stand in a row straight like soldiers, you know?</span> <span id="s1358">And we were told to -- to give every jewelry we have, or money, or watches, everything what’s valuable to give them immediately.</span> <span id="s1359">If they find it, is, you know, there is one sentence, death, death, death, yeah?</span> <span id="s1360">So people gave what they had.</span> <span id="s1361">And they were taking such a -- like a -- like a ba -- big bag, and everybody was putting something in there, gold rings, or something what was left.</span> <span id="s1362">I think Rachel had something from my mother.</span> <span id="s1363">My mother took with her what was left from the jewelry Veronica didn’t sell, something, a brooch, I think, she took with her, and she gave to Rachel something, and Rachel threw it in the toilet.</span> <span id="s1364">So they were not so, you know, excited [indecipherable] the Germans, they took the toilet out, you know, it was not a toilet where you wash the -- with the -- with the water, yeah, the toilet, you flush it.</span> <span id="s1365">No, it was a toilet like a -- a [indecipherable] where you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1368">And so they took it and they checked it.</span> <span id="s1369">They fished from there some what do you send, rings or something, and we were laughing at that.</span> <span id="s1370">It’s a good job for a German soldier.</span> <span id="s1371">That was it.</span> <span id="s1372">Then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Rachel threw it on purpose into the toilet?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yes, of course, of course, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1375">She didn’t tell it, about it?</span> <span id="s1376">It’s interesting.</span> <span id="s1377">Well, maybe she doesn’t remember it, I don’t know, it’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: W-Wasn’t that a dangerous thing to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">A: No.</span> <span id="s1380">Who can -- who can know, who can point her out that she did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: And there were like mountains of sand, so people put it in the sand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Their jewelry?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Their jewelry.</span> <span id="s1385">So they took it from the sand.</span> <span id="s1386">They knew everything.</span> <span id="s1387">But there are -- there were brave people who took it from other people to save it, and saved it, and nobody searched us.</span> <span id="s1388">They were so sure that we are so afraid that we will not hide it.</span> <span id="s1389">So -- but I remember that a acquaintance of mine, when we came already to another concentration camp she had it.</span> <span id="s1390">She thought I took it.</span> <span id="s1391">That’s [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: What did she have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: She had some jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Oh, some jewelry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: Some jewelry, she took it in from other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: She asked.</span> <span id="s1398">The people gave it to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: At that point, how did you feel?</span> <span id="s1400">Did you feel brave?</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: No.</span> <span id="s1402">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1403">I -- I didn't think to do it, I -- I didn’t -- it was not in my mind to do something -- some -- such brave things.</span> <span id="s1404">I son -- I think my bravery I left in Wilna.</span> <span id="s1405">I was not brave any more.</span> <span id="s1406">I think so, but maybe.</span> <span id="s1407">And then we were taken to -- to Strassenhof.</span> <span id="s1408">It was a concentration camp, but it was more a labor camp, I think, because everybody was working.</span> <span id="s1409">So it was not so bad.</span> <span id="s1410">Comparing with ghetto, it was bad.</span> <span id="s1411">Comparing to the other concentration camp, it was not so bad, you know?</span> <span id="s1412">Bad things are like th -- bad things have stages.</span> <span id="s1413">Can be bad, be bad, it can be more bad, and even more bad.</span> <span id="s1414">So there was the stages, so we were there, and at once we worked for a -- we -- they were building some -- something, a building, a factory, so we worked there.</span> <span id="s1415">I don’t remember even what we did.</span> <span id="s1416">Did we dig something, we -- we -- did we take -- use -- used to take breaks and bra -- bricks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: Bricks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: -- and bring it to them?</span> <span id="s1419">Or we -- I don’t remember exactly what job we did.</span> <span id="s1420">We helped the Latvian people to build it.</span> <span id="s1421">We were -- we were doing the dirty job for -- you know, the heavy job, the dirty job for the builders.</span> <span id="s1422">And one man who was working there, started to talk to me in Russian -- because we didn’t know Latvian, it was a strange country for us.</span> <span id="s1423">It was in not -- it was similar to Lithuanian, but we didn't know Lithuanian even very well.</span> <span id="s1424">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1425">So he started to talk Russian and we talked to him also, you know.</span> <span id="s1426">He asked for -- where we are coming from and so on.</span> <span id="s1427">And he -- one day he brought even food, I think.</span> <span id="s1428">And one day he told me, I’ll -- I’ll bring you clothes, and you will run away.</span> <span id="s1429">We were already in the cl -- given the clothes of the concentration camp, like stripes, you know?</span> <span id="s1430">St-Striped clothes, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: Uniforms.</span> <span id="s1433">You can say uniforms, can -- maybe it is uniforms.</span> <span id="s1434">I -- I think a uniform is a uniform, it isn’t -- something isn’t, but here -- okay.</span> <span id="s1435">But prisoner uniforms, okay, we’ll say like that.</span> <span id="s1436">And he told me I’ll bring you one and I’ll show you how to run away, and I will bring you to the partisans.</span> <span id="s1437">And I came and I don’t know if I told Rachel or I told her later, and I thought what to do, what to do?</span> <span id="s1438">Can I trust him, or he will take me immediately to Gestapo, because there were such things.</span> <span id="s1439">But I -- I -- I think now that I could trust him, because there were things that -- in Lithuania some people were asking for money, and then they were -- you -- o-or they will hide you or take you to a good place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Yeah, so -- so we were in Strassenhof, we were for a year, more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Can I get you to finish that story, what made you dis -- what did you decide about the offer from the man?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: The -- the Latvian man.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: Yeah, so I -- I was afraid to believe him, and then I was afraid another thing.</span> <span id="s1447">The thing is that if you run away, they will find it out very easily because they counted us every day in the morning, and every day in the evening.</span> <span id="s1448">They knew exactly the number of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1449">So they will shot their closest.</span> <span id="s1450">It means Rachel would be shor -- shot, that for sure.</span> <span id="s1451">And sh -- not she -- not only she.</span> <span id="s1452">So I thought no, I cannot do it.</span> <span id="s1453">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1454">I don’t remember telling her.</span> <span id="s1455">I-I think in -- in -- I didn’t tell her in concentration camp for -- about it.</span> <span id="s1456">It was out of my mind.</span> <span id="s1457">And then we were taken to a f -- to the [indecipherable] manufacturer -- to a factory, and we worked there together with the Latvian people.</span> <span id="s1458">The Latvian woman taught us how to manage the machines, and she almost left it for us.</span> <span id="s1459">We were already doing it.</span> <span id="s1460">We’re happy that we can do such a job, but it was of course, difficult for us, because everybody would -- had to take care of 10 machines or something like that.</span> <span id="s1461">But then we learned from her, we looked how she was stealing the material, yeah, and we learned from her.</span> <span id="s1462">She was not afraid of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: The Latvian woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: The Latvian woman, so she was stealing, so Rachel told, we can do the same and we can sell it, and we can -- I mean sell to get bread for it.</span> <span id="s1465">And that we were r-risking the life for sure.</span> <span id="s1466">So one of us, me, and other times she, was cutting the roll.</span> <span id="s1467">You have to be very careful how you cut the roll, not to leave the sign.</span> <span id="s1468">But I think that the people who ah -- were checking --</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: -- checked the -- the [indecipherable] material, you know, the rolls.</span> <span id="s1471">You are bringing to a place where it was checked, measured probably, knew about that, that the Latvian are doing it.</span> <span id="s1472">And they were afraid to tell it, because they probably didn't want to -- to threaten the Latvian people who were working with us.</span> <span id="s1473">They didn’t think that the Jewish women can dare to do it.</span> <span id="s1474">I believe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: If you cut it, where would you put it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: I put it like that, behind, and then Rachel run to the toilet, and she was look --</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">Q: Wrapped in a towel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">A: -- wrapping it around her waist.</span> <span id="s1479">We were very thin, that you cannot find it [indecipherable] you didn't look fat after [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1480">Of course it was not a lot, maybe a couple of meters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">Q: But then who would you sell it to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">A: We work -- you know, because we were in touch with Latvian, some of the prisoners were from Riga, and they spoke Latvian.</span> <span id="s1483">So they had a connection with the inner -- ou-out -- the world outside the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1484">See, they used to take it -- in the concentration camp, they used to take it to bring it to the Latvian, and the Latvian gave them a bread, and they used to take some bread for themselves, some bread to us.</span> <span id="s1485">So that makes us more happier.</span> <span id="s1486">I mean, we were hungry, very hungry, because the food was very -- this was very little food there.</span> <span id="s1487">Rations were very small.</span> <span id="s1488">A small piece of bread and a little bit margarine and some soup, like waterish -- watery soup, like water with some beans in it or something like.</span> <span id="s1489">So we were very hungry, so this was a support, a big support.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: Rachel talked about you wanting to eat your bread all up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Ah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1492">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1493">Every time we received the bread, I told give it my -- give my bread to me.</span> <span id="s1494">She told no, I’ll not give it to you.</span> <span id="s1495">Give it to me, I’m hungry, give it to me, I want to eat it.</span> <span id="s1496">No, you will not eat it.</span> <span id="s1497">I’ll give you a piece and that’s it, that’s your breakfast.</span> <span id="s1498">I am hungry.</span> <span id="s1499">You will get the other one in the evening.</span> <span id="s1500">And that save us the life.</span> <span id="s1501">I don’t know how she knew it, or maybe she learned it from somebody, maybe the instinct, you know, told her to -- to -- not to eat it immediately the whole bread and then to be out of food the whole day, what was very bad, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">Q: In the concentration camp, or when you worked, were there ever -- did you ever have an experience where a German seemed sympathetic or helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">A: No, it was a -- you know, we were punished for si -- for some things, you -- we used to come to the concentration camps so they used to -- we used to stand in lines, they used to count us and then we were punished for something.</span> <span id="s1504">Somebody did something wrong and we were standing for hours, very exhausted, and very tired.</span> <span id="s1505">And so another time, they thought, oh we had to jump on one foot around the building, around there.</span> <span id="s1506">But we were young, and I remember jumping and laughing, you know?</span> <span id="s1507">We were pushing each other on, and I jumped over to a SS, he was like in a -- in a -- a SS coat, having a gun.</span> <span id="s1508">He was like guarding us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1509">And he was crying.</span> <span id="s1510">When I saw him crying, I don’t know how I dared, I asked him, what are you crying?</span> <span id="s1511">So he told, I am not a German.</span> <span id="s1512">I am a Romanian.</span> <span id="s1513">And they -- the Germans lied to me.</span> <span id="s1514">They told me, would you wa -- would you like to go to the front?</span> <span id="s1515">He was mobilized, yeah, he -- would you -- take into the army, I mean.</span> <span id="s1516">It’s -- how it’s c-called, not mobilized, draft, yeah, it was a draft.</span> <span id="s1517">So he told, won’t you -- won’t you -- won’t -- would you like to go to the fr-front line, to the eastern front?</span> <span id="s1518">No.</span> <span id="s1519">So you will be an SS.</span> <span id="s1520">He didn't know what is SS.</span> <span id="s1521">Okay, I’ll be an SS.</span> <span id="s1522">He was not ver-very young in my eyes, probably he was 35, so then I was 15, so it was old already for me, you know.</span> <span id="s1523">So he told me -- and I have a daughter like you at home.</span> <span id="s1524">And I looked at you and I -- and I cannot bear it.</span> <span id="s1525">He cried.</span> <span id="s1526">And then I -- in a short time I didn’t see him at all.</span> <span id="s1527">I don’t know, maybe he left the SS and went to the front, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1528">I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s1529">That was one, you know, one person who -- who couldn’t bear the -- who -- looking how we were punished and how we were beaten or -- then a group of girls run away, and from the same place where the Russian Latvian guy was working.</span> <span id="s1530">So they shot every 10th.</span> <span id="s1531">They were counting when the -- when girls are standing on the appelle, they were counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, out and th -- every 10 -- 10th people -- person was shot.</span> <span id="s1532">So we knew we -- we are risking very much.</span> <span id="s1533">And I remember that one lady told, we have to watch each other not to let run away some other -- somebody.</span> <span id="s1534">So I told her, are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1535">Let run away everybody who can.</span> <span id="s1536">We will be shot at, not -- not earlier, so it’s later.</span> <span id="s1537">But let everybody run.</span> <span id="s1538">If I could, I would ru -- run, but -- but I -- that was I refused this time, and I didn’t have another time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: So you -- you -- what did you think was going to happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: You know, we heard already that the army, the Soviet army is coming.</span> <span id="s1541">We -- we didn’t believe that they will let us alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">Q: The Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s1544">We thought they will kill everybody and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1545">It will be the final solution.</span> <span id="s1546">We didn’t hear about the final solution there, but we he -- knew exactly what they want to do with us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1547">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1548">Maybe I -- I remember that s -- the Soviet army started to bomb Riga.</span> <span id="s1549">And the Germans came running to the concentration camp, they’re hiding themself.</span> <span id="s1550">Oh, we were so happy to -- to look at them, how afraid they were of their lives, yeah.</span> <span id="s1551">I remember opening the window, telling them come, come to us.</span> <span id="s1552">We are not -- we are not afraid to die of your bomb, but together with the Germans.</span> <span id="s1553">Here we all were making signs to them for -- through the window and praying, come, come the bomb to -- to throughout yeah -- to throughout the concentration camp [indecipherable] building.</span> <span id="s1554">Didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s1555">I don’t know where they bombed, but they didn’t bomb the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1556">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">Q: So when -- can you describe when you leave the work camp?</span> <span id="s1558">I want to keep going chronologically --</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: -- you worked for a year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: For a year, then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">Q: -- then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">A: Then what happened.</span> <span id="s1564">They shaved our heads, gave something else to wear, I think, other uniform, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: Your heads weren’t shaved the first year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: Rachel cut me the hair in the first -- in -- in Kaiserwald, but then I had my hair until I was -- our concentration camp was evacuated already.</span> <span id="s1569">So it means they were evacuated, we knew that the Soviet army is coming.</span> <span id="s1570">So they took us to the -- to a -- to the s-sea, and they -- we were going aways -- be -- they took us to a -- a ship, and went to -- by the sea, we went to -- to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: This is another concentration camp, which was not a labor camp any more, it was only concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1573">And the death rate was very big, of course, very high.</span> <span id="s1574">And crazy things, crazy things there.</span> <span id="s1575">Even in -- being in Strassenhof, they made a list of everybody who is younger than 16 and older than 30.</span> <span id="s1576">And they took all the people older than 30 years and younger than 16.</span> <span id="s1577">So because of Rachel, I was in -- not in the list, because she asked me to write myself older, not to be a child.</span> <span id="s1578">So I write myself not, so then I was probably 16, so I was two years older, so I was 18, so they didn’t take me.</span> <span id="s1579">So then I went to Stutthof, it was -- it was horrible, it was -- we went -- we were placed in a block, meaning a -- such a shtuba, a house, a wooden house where criminals were in -- the bosses of the -- of -- of the houses, like a Russian criminal was a -- a woman was -- she was the boss of our house, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1581">H-How did you know she was a criminal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1582">A: You can see by her language.</span> <span id="s1583">The curses, by the way of her behavior, I don’t know, or maybe she was a prostitute maybe, not a criminal, and like that.</span> <span id="s1584">And one time they told us to load big stones on wagons to push them down -- down the hill, then to push them up the hill, to unload them, then to load them again, push down the hill.</span> <span id="s1585">It’s not so easy to push them hen -- down on the hill there, have to go very slowly, so you have to hold.</span> <span id="s1586">They were loaded by -- with this -- with brick stones, and to push it up the hill also, like that, the -- a whole day, yeah.</span> <span id="s1587">All that to make you happy.</span> <span id="s1588">Then, of course, the beatings, and the st -- the illnesses, the starving was, you know, it was over -- we were overwhelmed with dirt, with lice, with -- it was awful.</span> <span id="s1589">Then one day somebody told that they are taking some young people to work for the farmers.</span> <span id="s1590">So we went with Rachel.</span> <span id="s1591">There was -- we stayed there probably two or three months.</span> <span id="s1592">We worked very hard, but at least we were more or less free.</span> <span id="s1593">We could wash ourself, we washed our clothes, we were more or less clean, you know, and the food was like, you know, the maid of the ba -- of the f-farmer gave us a key of the basement where the potatoes were, and so we had it.</span> <span id="s1594">But in three months they took us back -- they took us back, so they took us to a shower.</span> <span id="s1595">And you never knew, if you are taken to a shower, it will be water from there, from the ceiling, or it will be death, who -- they’ll kill you.</span> <span id="s1596">Because they used to do it from the same things, you know, the -- where the showers are, they used to -- to send the gas to the area you are closed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: How did you know that though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: I don’t know, but we knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">Q: Just knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1601">We knew -- we saw the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1602">The crematorium had smoke 24 hours a day, it never stopped smoking, the smoke was black and smell it [indecipherable] the smell was horrible.</span> <span id="s1603">So we knew that they are burning people there.</span> <span id="s1604">We knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">Q: Wh-Where was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">A: In Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">Q: Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">A: Yeah, it was not in Strassenhof, it was in Stutthof, yeah.</span> <span id="s1609">And every time, every appelle is selecting people to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1610">Q: Could you tell how they were selecting?</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">A: Oh, they were going like -- you are standing five people in a row, and you -- the SS men used to go and look at you.</span> <span id="s1612">And I don’t know, I -- I learned one thing, don’t show in your eyes that you are afraid, because if you are afraid, oh, they look at you.</span> <span id="s1613">Don’t show that you hate the -- hate them so much that you will kill them, otherwise, he will take you.</span> <span id="s1614">Look at -- look -- don’t look at them at all.</span> <span id="s1615">Look through them, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Like he would be a glass, and you look through them to -- to some point, I don’t know, and look very indifferently.</span> <span id="s1618">It’s not very [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1619">Oh, you won’t -- you don’t take me, you’ll take me, maybe it’s even better than -- such a life is better death [indecipherable] no.</span> <span id="s1620">We are never selected, with Rachel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: How did you manage to always stay -- it sounds like you were always physically with her, that you didn’t get separated too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">A: No, not too much at all.</span> <span id="s1623">I don’t know how we managed.</span> <span id="s1624">I don’t know how.</span></p> <p><span id="s1625">Q: What -- what was it like when you were separated for some reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s1626">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: You don’t remember being separated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: No.</span> <span id="s1629">Not in the concentration camps, never.</span> <span id="s1630">We were afraid of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: So if one of you was asked to do something, would the other one say, I’ll go with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: No.</span> <span id="s1633">Ju -- were not asked individual -- individually to do something.</span> <span id="s1634">It’s a group.</span> <span id="s1635">[indecipherable] 10 people [indecipherable] we went together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: What would you talk about at night together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: At night we used to talk how good it was at home.</span> <span id="s1638">How tasty was the food what I hated and didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1639">And I always thought, where is the kasha Mama gave me, and where is the milk I didn’t want to drink?</span> <span id="s1640">And that’s all, and some such things, and then where are our parents, our sisters, and brothers?</span> <span id="s1641">Are they in a concentration camp like we?</span> <span id="s1642">Can they survive?</span> <span id="s1643">And so on.</span> <span id="s1644">Yeah, and then we are -- we were [indecipherable] to a -- to a house after being in -- working for the farmers, we are [indecipherable] a house, which was -- there were only sick people.</span> <span id="s1645">Were no beds, it was -- it were no beds before also, but it were be -- wooden beds, you know, in like --</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">Q: Bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">A: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">Q: Bunks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">A: Bunks, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1650">Q: Wooden beds --</span></p> <p><span id="s1651">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: -- on top of each other, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: So -- and here no bed -- no, no beds at all.</span> <span id="s1654">Everybody was sitting on the floor, and because we were so crowded, so many people were, so we were sitting in a row, like my legs were a little bit spread in me, another person in me, like five.</span> <span id="s1655">And we were sleeping like that, everybody was leaning towards the other.</span> <span id="s1656">And that was the worst.</span> <span id="s1657">People were dying like -- like, you know, flies.</span> <span id="s1658">I remember I woke up, I was lying -- I was leaning -- leaning a li -- leaning up a -- a -- a woman who was dead already.</span> <span id="s1659">So, I mean, my head was on the dead corpse already, corpse.</span> <span id="s1660">And every morning used to come several men who were taking the corpses out of us, of our room, yeah.</span> <span id="s1661">And once I heard that the kapo who was coming and directing the people what to do, from which line to take the corpses, spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1662">So I ask him, look, how is this Red army?</span> <span id="s1663">Is she coming?</span> <span id="s1664">How far are they?</span> <span id="s1665">Because we listen -- we heard already the bombs, the -- you know, the -- the bullets falling, you know.</span> <span id="s1666">So he told me, what are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1667">A language is a such powerful -- powerful thing, you know?</span> <span id="s1668">It’s such a connection between people who are not connected and maybe not even like each other.</span> <span id="s1669">But he her -- he didn’t hear Polish very much, and suddenly he heard Polish.</span> <span id="s1670">So he ask me if [indecipherable] I mean miss.</span> <span id="s1671">Oh, what I didn’t hear wa -- for -- you know, for years.</span> <span id="s1672">What are you doing here?</span> <span id="s1673">I told him, you don’t know what I’m doing here?</span> <span id="s1674">[indecipherable] do you know that you will die here?</span> <span id="s1675">Nobody will be alive here.</span> <span id="s1676">Go out of here.</span> <span id="s1677">How -- how can we go out of here?</span> <span id="s1678">So he told me, and he said, today will come a German and take some people to work with the kitchen, with potatoes, to wash it, to prepare food, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1679">Don’t be afraid, he underline me, it’s not to the crematorium.</span> <span id="s1680">Go for -- and -- and stand up -- stand there in a line and wait until they will take you.</span> <span id="s1681">And then it was -- one German or two came, and we went with Rachel and they took us.</span> <span id="s1682">Took us together again.</span> <span id="s1683">Went to another house where we are having to do these potatoes, you know.</span> <span id="s1684">Bad, frozen potatoes, preparing it for a dinner for the -- for the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1685">And sleeping already in a room which had the wooden beds, yeah.</span> <span id="s1686">And then we heard that they are evacuate -- ready to evacuate the whole concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1687">Who can go, who can work?</span> <span id="s1688">The others?</span> <span id="s1689">They will -- they will take -- they will make a fire and everything will be burned, and that what they did.</span> <span id="s1690">And we were evacuated.</span> <span id="s1691">We went on that -- we went o-on the Death March, with this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: Did -- did you choose to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Oh, I don’t remember if we choose --</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: -- see, I -- I think they didn’t ask us.</span> <span id="s1696">They didn’t ask us anything, they told us to go, so we went.</span> <span id="s1697">It was a horrible, of course, we were -- first of all, it was cold, it was the end of February, the beginning of March, it was cold.</span> <span id="s1698">It was snowing, it was freezing.</span> <span id="s1699">We were -- we were in such uniforms, as they gave us such, you know, things to cover us, is a -- like sheets, you know, some to cover us.</span> <span id="s1700">And the lice were all over us, I remember th -- th -- I [indecipherable] everything was -- is -- is moving.</span> <span id="s1701">They gave us a -- a piece of bread and go.</span> <span id="s1702">And on the way we saw the horses, together with German families, they were running from the Russians already, so they load on the horses everybo -- everything -- on the carts actually, and th-they were running, and sometimes Polish people were -- which were taken from Poland to work for the Germans were shouting to us, ma -- to encourage us.</span> <span id="s1703">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Like what would they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Let -- s-stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s1706">Stay alive, stay alive, the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s1707">It’s not far, it’s not far, but you -- you can hear.</span> <span id="s1708">You can see the red sky from the fire of the front, you know, and the Germans were running.</span> <span id="s1709">And then they took us to a -- one small camp.</span> <span id="s1710">We were -- I don’t know, we were there for a week or so.</span> <span id="s1711">And then they took us from the small camp to -- again, was a march, yeah, and then they marched in -- we -- we came to a barn, yeah.</span> <span id="s1712">They opened the door and they told us to go.</span> <span id="s1713">We didn’t know that people are there, and we started to walk over the people.</span> <span id="s1714">The screaming was so [indecipherable] we couldn’t -- we -- we couldn’t understand what’s -- and the other rows are pushing us, yeah, and we cannot walk because we are walking on the bodies of other people, heads, there were legs.</span> <span id="s1715">But that was the last place.</span> <span id="s1716">They close the door and we didn’t hear from the Germans any more.</span> <span id="s1717">The -- they -- we were -- it was night, in the morning we wanted to go out, and we looked, you know, through the door, and we looked for a -- for a s -- piece of light where -- where -- where we can see what’s going on there.</span> <span id="s1718">And we started to knock on the door.</span> <span id="s1719">And some women were shouting, don’t knock, they will shoot us.</span> <span id="s1720">And we knocked.</span> <span id="s1721">We knocked, we knocked, nobody was there, so we started to push the door.</span> <span id="s1722">And we pushed it open, no Germans.</span> <span id="s1723">And we saw the road, and over there, the army, the -- the Soviet army is standing.</span> <span id="s1724">So a group of young girls, and including me and Rachel, we run to the soldiers, yeah?</span> <span id="s1725">We wanted to embrace them.</span> <span id="s1726">They saw us, they started to run away.</span> <span id="s1727">Because we -- then they told us that we looked so horrible, that they were afraid.</span> <span id="s1728">What -- what are they, shadas of pe -- of some corpses, or some dead people, or -- who is running?</span> <span id="s1729">And we are -- were dirty, of course.</span> <span id="s1730">And th-then they told us that we -- they were not allowed to come over to us because we carried typhus and other illnesses.</span> <span id="s1731">So it would be an epidemic, you know, they were afraid of the army.</span> <span id="s1732">They wanted to protect them.</span> <span id="s1733">So they run, and we run after them.</span> <span id="s1734">And we came to a village, a German village.</span> <span id="s1735">And I was sick, I was alr -- already absolutely sick.</span> <span id="s1736">I felt that I -- I -- I was coughing, and I had the high fever.</span> <span id="s1737">I felt it, I didn’t have a -- a thermometer to -- to measure the fever.</span> <span id="s1738">And we came over to a German village, we open the one house we wanted to enter.</span> <span id="s1739">So a family was sitting around the table and telling us, raus.</span> <span id="s1740">So we wacked out -- we walked out.</span> <span id="s1741">We walked out and I saw a Russian officer going through, and -- and I knew Russian, so I told him, look, you liberated us, but we don’t have where to stay.</span> <span id="s1742">What -- what do you mean where you don’t have where to stay?</span> <span id="s1743">I told, they are not alone.</span> <span id="s1744">Oh yeah?</span> <span id="s1745">He took this, his pistol, opened the door, opened the pistol and told, if you don’t go away from this house, you will be killed.</span> <span id="s1746">So they left and we occupied the house.</span> <span id="s1747">I lied down near a stove, which was [indecipherable] was hot.</span> <span id="s1748">I was so cold, shivering.</span> <span id="s1749">And Rachel was very active.</span> <span id="s1750">She took all my clothes off, and put in the stove, yet it was bong, bong, like the lice and everything what -- and everybody did it, yes, some other girls came in.</span> <span id="s1751">Then they took water, they boiled the water and we washed ourself.</span> <span id="s1752">Then we took some clothes there that was in the house because we couldn’t stay naked, of course, and we couldn’t use the old uniforms [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1753">Then came -- we were already cleaner, a little bit, it came to feeding myself.</span> <span id="s1754">I remember Rachel brought a -- a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s1755">Fresh bread, smelled a -- a -- she gave it to me.</span> <span id="s1756">So I gave one bite and I told, look at, I am full already, I cannot eat any more.</span> <span id="s1757">And she told, you know, I don’t know why, but I am full also.</span> <span id="s1758">So we stopped eating, and other people started to eat a lot.</span> <span id="s1759">Then they were dying, you know, why it was something in the stomach and the emergency had no time, the military emergency, to take them to the hospital, they were dying.</span> <span id="s1760">And we survived only because we couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s1761">We twe -- we -- we didn’t know, we were so young that we didn’t know that you -- when you were starved al-almost to death so many -- for so many years, you can’t eat a lot.</span> <span id="s1762">You have to start from the beginning, a little bit, a little bit.</span> <span id="s1763">Then, to make the story short, because it’s so -- so very shor -- big story, we are -- stayed there for a month, and we are allowed by the Soviet government [indecipherable] the military government to -- to go home.</span> <span id="s1764">So we went to a train, and we went to ho -- Poland.</span> <span id="s1765">Trains were not passenger trains, trains -- also the soldiers were there, and it was a mixture, a mixture.</span> <span id="s1766">And seems that the whole population is moving.</span> <span id="s1767">One is going to Germany, the other is going from Germany, and everybody is moving.</span> <span id="s1768">We met Polish people from Wilna who told me that my house is already bombed, that I don’t have a house, and it was true.</span> <span id="s1769">That I learned in Poland on the train.</span> <span id="s1770">The mid -- in the middle of the -- the woods, the train would stop, and the -- the train -- and -- and the people -- some people came from the woods and robbed.</span> <span id="s1771">Everybody took the b-belongings from everybody, because what the other people did, even from Lithuania, from Poland, went together with the Soviet army to Germany, took belongings of -- the German belongings, you know, jewelry -- what -- what they left behind.</span> <span id="s1772">And li -- and they brought it back to their country and sold it all for theirself, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1773">There were already such people, businessmen, yeah, or businesswomen.</span> <span id="s1774">So the others knew it, and they -- they were taking the belongings of these people.</span> <span id="s1775">And we laughed with Rachel because we didn’t have anything, so nobody took from us anything.</span> <span id="s1776">That’s it, and then we came closer to our border already, Lithuanian border, and we changed the trains, of course, and some Soviet officers told us, come girls to us, sit down there to their [indecipherable] yeah.</span> <span id="s1777">And the train went to Lithuania, yeah.</span> <span id="s1778">So she started to ask us from wa -- from where we are coming now, and what -- and they saw how they look.</span> <span id="s1779">So we told them the truth, what it was and -- so one told us, look, you know that on the border of Lithuania and Poland, you will be stopped.</span> <span id="s1780">And because you don’t have papers, no identification papers, no nothing, no passports, no in -- identification papers.</span> <span id="s1781">So we will be taken in a -- in a camp.</span> <span id="s1782">I told, what?</span> <span id="s1783">I am not going in any camp any more, any camp, if it was German, or Russians, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1784">So he -- so I -- I’m -- I’m going to die in Wilna.</span> <span id="s1785">I was sure that I am dying.</span> <span id="s1786">I was -- felt like dying, yeah.</span> <span id="s1787">So, but I will die in Wilna where I was born.</span> <span id="s1788">I don’t want to die in Germany of course, I don’t want to die in Poland.</span> <span id="s1789">So they told, you know what?</span> <span id="s1790">We will hide you.</span> <span id="s1791">And there were some machines inside, what probably the Soviets were taking from the Germans already, like -- like to make x-rays.</span> <span id="s1792">I saw the [indecipherable] like from some medicine machines or something like that, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1793">I saw it for x-rays.</span> <span id="s1794">And they hide us over there.</span> <span id="s1795">And then the -- the train stopped, and the people came over, also military people with lamps, lights everything looked around, asked them for papers, the officers gave them the papers.</span> <span id="s1796">They ask, is there anybody else here?</span> <span id="s1797">No, nobody is here.</span> <span id="s1798">Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s1799">So the door was closed, and the train came to Kovno to Kaunas, not to Wilna.</span> <span id="s1800">Oh, so that we are free.</span> <span id="s1801">Good, we are almost home.</span> <span id="s1802">Kovno from Wilna is hundred kilometer only.</span> <span id="s1803">So we walked out, and we were arrested immediately because we -- oh, to look at us, you can see what we -- where we came from.</span> <span id="s1804">And they asked us for documents and we don’t have it.</span> <span id="s1805">So give us a passport, give us something, we don’t have.</span> <span id="s1806">So we started to tell them that we were taken fro -- b-by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1807">Uh-huh, come to KGB.</span> <span id="s1808">And then they started, we will arrest you, you’re spies, you’re -- everybody was spies, and you’re prostitutes, you -- you run to the -- together with the -- with the ger -- German army.</span> <span id="s1809">Look at us, I thought [indecipherable] you will look at us, saw how we look, the hair shaved, and -- but what was -- I don’t know what they would do this as, if not a Jewish guy who was in Kovno already saw how the soldiers took us like that, you know, took us to the -- to the KGB.</span> <span id="s1810">So they run there, we didn’t know it, and they -- with money.</span> <span id="s1811">So they gave her money for -- to the officer who took us, yeah, to [indecipherable] us, yeah.</span> <span id="s1812">And he let us go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: But he didn’t know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: Just that
