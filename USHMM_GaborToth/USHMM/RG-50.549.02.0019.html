<p><span id="s17">Answer: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: And the answer to your question about why they want these?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: Epps.</span> <span id="s20">It’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: I -- I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I don’t know exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s24">I -- I think that the idea is just to have -- I -- I don’t know academically, or in the research community, as people are studying the Holocaust and it’s -- it’s effects.</span> <span id="s25">I -- I suspect that there -- that there’s some interest in trying to see what kind of effect the experience had on people as a group.</span> <span id="s26">I know that Simone had a very interesting conversation with me yesterday.</span> <span id="s27">She explained to me that there have been some studies done on the hidden children.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: Yes, there were, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: And that the conclusion was essentially that those children fared just about as well as everybody else in the world, in terms of success or lack of success or divorce, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: -- continuing marriage.</span> <span id="s32">That there was not really any big difference.</span> <span id="s33">I don’t -- I don’t know the answer to the question.</span> <span id="s34">I just got involved -- my -- my personal involvement was that I’ve been doing audio production and interviews, for many years.</span> <span id="s35">And went to the Holocaust Museum about five years ago and was really devastated by the experience.</span> <span id="s36">And called them and started to beg them to allow me to contribute some small way, what could I do?</span> <span id="s37">And they put me on this list of -- of interviewers and said, “Well, maybe you can help us with these.”</span> <span id="s38">And then they just said, “Well, look, this is what we’re doing, we’re doing this project of follow up interviews and trying to talk to people about their -- their experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: Yeah, this -- the hidden child thing is -- is very good.</span> <span id="s40">You know we -- I don’t know if Simone mentioned to you -- what is her name now?</span> <span id="s41">I’m drawing a blank.</span> <span id="s42">Last name is Fink.</span> <span id="s43">She -- she was a hidden child, in Holland, she was four or five when her mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: She -- there’s definitely -- in her story, you can definitely see that her life was influenced by the situation -- by her past, yeah.</span> <span id="s46">I have always thought that my life -- it might have been different, because I would have never left Germany, you know.</span> <span id="s47">I was born in Berlin and I would have lived in Berlin and probably married in Germany or whatever.</span> <span id="s48">And I would have never had this broad experience of life, which I ended up having.</span> <span id="s49">Because Germany was very narrow.</span> <span id="s50">They were very focused upon themselves, they were the greatest, the best, the this and the that.</span> <span id="s51">And you would have never had this wide experience.</span> <span id="s52">But I would have had a very interesting life, wa -- you know, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s53">I don’t know if it would have -- from that point, if you had -- it made a difference, in the sense that I was kicked out -- you know, that I had to leave, that I had to live a broader life than I would have otherwise.</span> <span id="s54">But as far as the history of humanity goes, that you have children -- that you marry and you have chi -- you grow up, marry and have children, I don’t think that would have been very different.</span> <span id="s55">Would have been in a different country, but it wouldn’t have been very different.</span> <span id="s56">I do think that my outlook ended up much broader than it would have been if I’d never left Germany, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: Can you explain that?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: Well, that’s -- that’s what I said, that because you -- I had to leave Europe.</span> <span id="s59">I didn’t really have to leave Europe, but because I left Europe and I s -- I looked at Europe from the outside.</span> <span id="s60">And I still f -- when I’m in Europe now, I still feel very European, very European.</span> <span id="s61">I -- I don’t feel like an American in Europe.</span> <span id="s62">I -- I feel European.</span> <span id="s63">But when I’m here, I also do not feel a stranger at all, here.</span> <span id="s64">And if you want to go a little chronologically, you know, I never really did feel very strange here, you know.</span> <span id="s65">It was when I first came over, I felt extremely lonely, of course.</span> <span id="s66">I was terribly lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Why don’t you tell me the circumstances of your coming?</span> <span id="s68">Wh-Why did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Well, after the war -- you know, I was a dancer in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s70">I lived in Amsterdam, first of all, not in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: And I was there all during the war.</span> <span id="s73">I was with a group of young people, we wer -- we survived the war intact.</span> <span id="s74">Not one of us got taken and it was due to the leader of the pack.</span> <span id="s75">That was Manfred Greenback, who is still alive and who is still in Amsterdam and -- and who is actually getting a pension from the Dutch government for the work he and his sister, both -- she also s -- also has a kind of a small pension from the Dutch government, for the work that they did during the war.</span> <span id="s76">But, as a -- I was in that group with hi -- with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: But this was a -- this was illegal work that he did at the time, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: This was -- during the war, it was underground work.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: In the underground.</span> <span id="s81">But he definitely -- he and his sister both, definitely saved us.</span> <span id="s82">With the -- through their organization, their ability to get the various papers that you needed to survive and to get food stamps and -- and their connections with other groups.</span> <span id="s83">And it was like a large spider web of -- of underground activity.</span> <span id="s84">They were all connected, one way or the other, even though their beliefs might have been and their reasons for doing the work might have been very different from each other.</span> <span id="s85">During the war, they all worked together.</span> <span id="s86">And anyway, I sa -- we survived the war and after the war, I was in the ballet with Sonia Gasco.</span> <span id="s87">It is a -- the ballet that -- that later became Niederlancer Balletta, the big Dutch ballet in -- in the Stutz-Hober, the big theater in -- in amst -- the state ballet.</span> <span id="s88">It was then called the Ballet 1945, when -- when I was in it.</span> <span id="s89">That was the beginning.</span> <span id="s90">And Madame Gasco, who -- who started it, started organizing this last month before the war was ended.</span> <span id="s91">We -- we already knew, you know, that the war was going to end and we started practicing and -- and -- and rehearsing and doing all these things.</span> <span id="s92">And we were ready -- not quite -- by the time the war was -- was actually ended.</span> <span id="s93">And I -- I worked with her and I danced with the ballet and I had various other jobs.</span> <span id="s94">I also did photography.</span> <span id="s95">I studied photography with a friend of my mother’s, who had also survived the war and had actually sort of held her hand over my head, even though I didn’t even know it.</span> <span id="s96">But she had sort of protected me from various things that went on during the war.</span> <span id="s97">So it’s all very complicated, but -- but it -- that’s how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Ca-Can you give me an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Well, during the war, I was -- I was dancing.</span> <span id="s100">I -- I -- I think I tell all that on the -- on the other tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: You tell -- oh, yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: So I don’t really want to --</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: -- go over it all again.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: No, I just meant about the way this woman was -- was protecting you.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Well, that’s right, she was protecting me in the sense that they decided that some of the things I was during -- doing during the war, was endangering myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: And she saw to it that I had to stop doing them.</span> <span id="s109">She never talked to me, but she talked to the people who I’m do -- I was doing it with and they managed to -- without letting me know why -- to dissuade me from continuing what I was doing.</span> <span id="s110">And so in that sense, I didn’t know til after the war that it was her -- she who had done this.</span> <span id="s111">It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s112">So, as I was saying, it was a spider web and -- and it was extended to me, I was part of it and they took care of me.</span> <span id="s113">So, even though I didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s114">But anyway -- so, after the war, I was dancing with ga -- Sonia Gasco and friends of my parents started writing letters to our old address and -- and saying, “Well, what happened to your family?</span> <span id="s115">What happened?”</span> <span id="s116">You know, and these were people all over the world.</span> <span id="s117">I mean Australia and South America and America -- you know, was North America.</span> <span id="s118">Canada, every -- letters came from all over the world.</span> <span id="s119">And I went back to our old apartment, which was the place they all wrote to.</span> <span id="s120">And I told the lady where I was and she -- she forwarded all the mail.</span> <span id="s121">When I saw them all -- all these letters, I ch -- answered only the ones that I could remember, because many of these peop -- they were all friends of my parents, not of mine.</span> <span id="s122">And some of them I didn’t remember and some of them I did.</span> <span id="s123">And the one I remembered best, was Dr. Kalinoffsky’s family, because in Berlin we used to have gymnastics with their two daughters, they had two daughters, Hilda and Lothar Kalinoffsky.</span> <span id="s124">And we had gymnastics with them in Berlin and when we came to Holland, they had gone -- he was a psychiatrist in Berlin and they had gone to Rome.</span> <span id="s125">And he had to study again, he got a degree in Rome.</span> <span id="s126">And he was a psychiatrist in Rome.</span> <span id="s127">And then, when a -- when he felt like things weren’t going so well in Italy, he decided to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s128">He went to the United States with his family and he had to do a third degree -- the third -- you know, he got -- he got his doctorate in psychiatry in New York.</span> <span id="s129">And that’s where he was, in New York.</span> <span id="s130">So when I got their letter, I wrote.</span> <span id="s131">And it turned out that he had been asked to help establish the Department of Psychiatry at the free University of Berlin.</span> <span id="s132">I think it’s in Dallem.</span> <span id="s133">It’s in Dallem or wherever it is.</span> <span id="s134">It’s in -- near Berlin -- in Berlin.</span> <span id="s135">And so h-he decided he was going to go via Amsterdam and -- to Berlin, from -- from the in -- from New York.</span> <span id="s136">So he came by and he said, “Come to the United States.</span> <span id="s137">Come -- we take care of it, come.”</span> <span id="s138">You know?</span> <span id="s139">Well, I was doing very well at that time and I kept saying, “No, I -- I can’t make up my mind.”</span> <span id="s140">He kept saying, “Look, your parents aren’t going to come back and --” as I’m telling on the other tape, I kept thinking, “Yes, maybe they will come back, and my sister.</span> <span id="s141">Somebody will show up, you know, they will be all r -- somebody will come, I can’t come right away.”</span> <span id="s142">So I postponed and postponed.</span> <span id="s143">Finally, in 1947, he ca -- I mean, he kept coming, every three, four months, when he had to go to Berlin, and say, “Come, come, come.”</span> <span id="s144">And he sent me an affidavit.</span> <span id="s145">And I got a call from the American embassy in Rotterdam and they were saying, “Well, do you want to come, or don’t you want to come?</span> <span id="s146">You got plenty of people who want to come, I mean, what’s going on there?”</span> <span id="s147">And so I took a deep breath and I went.</span> <span id="s148">It was terribly hard.</span> <span id="s149">I mean, I had a boyfriend and I had -- you know, I was -- I was in the ballet, I was doing well and I was getting up there and it was just terribly hard to leave.</span> <span id="s150">But on the other hand, I really -- I didn’t see a real future and I -- I thought, well, you know, my parents were killed, my sister was gone, my grandmother was gone, my -- I had family.</span> <span id="s151">I had a lot of family still, my mother’s family there.</span> <span id="s152">And even a cousin of my father’s, Heinz Kemfer was still there and -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s153">And -- but it wasn’t really my own, you know?</span> <span id="s154">It wasn’t close enough and -- so many changes had taken place, and I should make a change.</span> <span id="s155">And it doesn’t have to be forever, I kept taying -- saying to myself.</span> <span id="s156">You know, I mean, after all, I could come back and you know, if I -- if I really didn’t like it, you know, I could come back and --</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: And what was your immediate plan?</span> <span id="s158">What would you be going when you got here?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Well, that -- tha -- I didn’t even think about that because he’s -- well, I thought I was going to dance, actually.</span> <span id="s160">Yes, I thought I was going to dance.</span> <span id="s161">Well, it turned out that they lived on Long Island.</span> <span id="s162">And I -- I’m having trouble remembering the town.</span> <span id="s163">I know that the second house that they had was -- oh yeah, I know, it was Babylon, I think.</span> <span id="s164">I think it was Babylon, but I’m not sure.</span> <span id="s165">The second place they lived was Brightwaters.</span> <span id="s166">They moved pretty soon after I had came, they had -- they moved to Brightwaters and that’s -- you know, it is a ways from New York.</span> <span id="s167">It -- you have to take the Long Island railroad.</span> <span id="s168">And as I found out pretty soon, you know, it was difficult.</span> <span id="s169">I had to be in New York for the dance -- for my classes at the American School of Ballet and it was hard to get to and fro -- get the timing right.</span> <span id="s170">I could never date, because I -- the train came -- you know, the train -- I had to take a certain train back.</span> <span id="s171">And it was just too complicated t-to -- to live out on the island if you wanted to be in New York, which I did.</span> <span id="s172">And so I met a girl, Ellen Crooks, I met her in -- at the balle -- in the ballet class, at the American School of Ballet.</span> <span id="s173">And she was born and raised in Greenwich Village and her mother had a spare apartment.</span> <span id="s174">And so she and I moved in together to -- in Greenwich Village.</span> <span id="s175">And it was wonderful to have her, because I mean, she was -- she knew every little corner of -- of Greenwich Village, having been raised there.</span> <span id="s176">And she was very nice girl -- very good girl and -- and we -- we had -- we lived together.</span> <span id="s177">We finally took another -- a girl -- a woman -- a girl, I guess we were then.</span> <span id="s178">And we lived there together and where we lived was on Third Street, where now is the library of New York University, the law library of the uni -- and at the time, they were already trying to empty the buildings, you know, so there were quite a lot of empty apartments, people whose lease had run out and they weren’t replacing these people, because they wanted to empty the buildings, but they had to go to the end of people’s contract.</span> <span id="s179">And -- and her mother’s contract was very long.</span> <span id="s180">So we were just -- there were a few people left in the building, so it was -- got quite creepy, because there were many, you know, people kem -- kept sleeping up on the stairs, you know, bums and -- and hobos and whatever you have there.</span> <span id="s181">And it was quite an exciting time in Greenwich Village.</span> <span id="s182">It was still a little bit of the old Greenwich Village, you know, that you -- that you hear about.</span> <span id="s183">Many Italians -- downstairs was a li -- a small Italian restaurant, that was where our telephone was.</span> <span id="s184">He -- he would keep message and get messages for us and we could, you know, go and get the messages and we could make calls there.</span> <span id="s185">And many, many a time.</span> <span id="s186">So -- but it was very nice.</span> <span id="s187">I mean, it was exciting, scary and nice.</span> <span id="s188">I had to learn how to ride those subways.</span> <span id="s189">I mean, I came out of Amsterdam, after the war and it was -- I mean, when I got here with the clothes that I thought were very fancy -- I had taken my mother’s -- I had some of my mother’s clothes in Holland and I had them remade for the United States.</span> <span id="s190">Well I got to the United States and I looked like a spook, compared to the other people in the United States.</span> <span id="s191">It was -- there was something going on called the new look.</span> <span id="s192">Remember, they wore these -- these very -- these skirts with many ruffles, sort of wide with -- with underskirts underneath, sticking out a little bit on the -- on the borders and I mean I looked absolutely -- what I thought was high elegance, I looked weird, highly weird.</span> <span id="s193">So the first day that we were there, Mrs. Kalinoffsky took me into New York, went to Macy’s and she got me outfitted.</span> <span id="s194">I got a new coat -- I’ll never forget the coat.</span> <span id="s195">These kind of things, you remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Where did you get money to pay for these things?</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: Where did you get money?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: She -- she -- she did it, she bought it for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: I had a little money.</span> <span id="s202">My father had given my Uncle Bep Person who also lived in New York, who was an announcer with CBS.</span> <span id="s203">Especially during the war, we kept hearing him, because he did the Dutch, the Belgian and I think one of the Nor-Nordic countries.</span> <span id="s204">H-He did the news for -- for those countries.</span> <span id="s205">So I kept hearing my Uncle Bep Person all the time.</span> <span id="s206">He worked, as I said, for CBS, for their foreign department, during the war.</span> <span id="s207">And after the war, he worked for the United Nations.</span> <span id="s208">That’s really what he did, til he died.</span> <span id="s209">He worked at -- you know, he was a journalist at the United Nations.</span> <span id="s210">He wrote all the news from the United Nations and he -- he had been an editor of the Haffsupost in the -- in -- in the Hague and he had worked -- always been a journalist, so -- anyway, he -- in 1939, he took his family to the United States.</span> <span id="s211">He -- he had said to the Haffsupost, he says, “I think it’s time that you have in international correspondent.”</span> <span id="s212">And they said, “Yes, you know, we -- we like to b-broaden ou-our news and ti -- cli -- go.”</span> <span id="s213">So he had job here, in New York.</span> <span id="s214">He was in New York with his family.</span> <span id="s215">Actually, he lived in Great Neck, they lived in Great Neck, Long Island, but he worked in New York.</span> <span id="s216">And my father had given him a Shell stock to take.</span> <span id="s217">And after the war, Uncle Bep wrote me that he had that for me.</span> <span id="s218">And, so when I came, I had a little money.</span> <span id="s219">It wasn’t tremendous amount, but it was enough, because I went to work, you know.</span> <span id="s220">So anyway, the Kalinoffsky’s, they would have helped me a lot more, if I’d asked for it.</span> <span id="s221">You know, I didn’t want to ask for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: [indecipherable] can you -- can you -- I -- I’m sorry, I’m a little unclear.</span> <span id="s223">What was your relationship with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well, they were friends of my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: And they -- he decided to -- they were really good friends of my parents and -- and they brought me over.</span> <span id="s227">They were the ones that gave me the affidavit and they had two daughters, you know, that were my -- who were my age and I never reme -- and I never forget opening up their closet when I first came to their house.</span> <span id="s228">In -- then Babylon, I guess.</span> <span id="s229">There were all these clothes hanging, these gorgeous clothes and -- hanging in the girl’s closets.</span> <span id="s230">And I could not imagine how anybody could have so much clothes.</span> <span id="s231">I mean, now I -- you know, I think it’s all normal and every -- but then, I mean, we had nothing, absolutely nothing, you know, during all those years of s -- of underground, the underground.</span> <span id="s232">I had a skirt and a sweater and a blouse.</span> <span id="s233">You know, and here, closets full, all matched things, you know, the sweater sets and the -- the skirts that went like the triangles and -- and gorgeous things.</span> <span id="s234">So, where was I?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: Tell -- I wanted to ask you what -- you know, it’s hard for me to imagine somebody having gone through the experiences which you did in the underground and then coming and saying that you were intimidated by being in New York, or that you were scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Well, I was not inti -- you see, that was actually one of the funny -- the strange things.</span> <span id="s237">I arrived -- I came on the Queen Mary and I -- I -- sh -- Mrs. Kalinoffsky picked me up and she drove me through New York to get to the Long Island thruway, what -- whatever it’s called [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s238">And she kept saying, “I’ll take you to Broadway the next one -- next day, you know, when we go shopping.</span> <span id="s239">We’ll go to Macy’s and then we’ll go shopping, you know, and I’ll show you New Yo --” I went and I saw New York and I wasn’t impressed.</span> <span id="s240">She was very sad.</span> <span id="s241">And now I know, you know, that -- there are many people who come from Europe and I take them around.</span> <span id="s242">Th-Things change.</span> <span id="s243">And they are often not impressed.</span> <span id="s244">Now, why is that, ac -- I explain it to her, that I had seen so many films -- I had seen so many films of New York, of Broadway and of -- you know, the -- the -- at the time, the man was blowing smoke rings, or the woman, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s245">And I mean, it was pretty wonderful, but at the time, I -- I wasn’t -- I wasn’t impressed.</span> <span id="s246">I had a very hard time leaving -- leaving Europe and what happened was that I flew from Amsterdam -- from [indecipherable] to London and it -- it -- this is very normal now, but there weren’t that many planes in 1947.</span> <span id="s247">I -- I left in November of 1947.</span> <span id="s248">And friends of my parents again, [indecipherable] picked me up and I was going to have a week or so in London with them, but what happened is that I got a kind of a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s249">I was shaking and crying.</span> <span id="s250">I couldn’t control anything I was doing.</span> <span id="s251">I was so upset.</span> <span id="s252">I -- it turned out I -- I had left very bravely, you know, taken to the airport by my boyfriend and my best girlfriend together, they were -- and I got on the plane very bravely, I walked over there.</span> <span id="s253">I had a bunch of tulips for -- for the Ronas with me.</span> <span id="s254">And I remember handing it over to them and then breaking down right there at the airport.</span> <span id="s255">And I cried for four solid days.</span> <span id="s256">I just couldn’t -- and finally the doctor -- I guess I got some Valium or something to calm me down and that was -- friend of my Uncle Heinz was there -- actually the brother of Ava Kempfer, his wife -- my cousin’s wife, was there and he wanted to take me out, you know.</span> <span id="s257">And he took me out and I -- he said, “Ma -- Your eyes -- what -- something wrong with your eyes?”</span> <span id="s258">They were so red -- rot -- red and swollen and he took me out and the funny thing, he took me to his club.</span> <span id="s259">And w-we went to his club and they fed me something.</span> <span id="s260">I -- I will -- I think it was -- I had scrambled eggs with ham or some sort of thing and there was something wrong with the ham and I ended up sick in London from -- from eating that -- that ham and this cousin, he -- he had been just wonderful to me.</span> <span id="s261">He had saved his clothing coupons, there -- in England, and also in Holland, we still, in ‘47, had clothing coupons.</span> <span id="s262">And he had saved his clothing poop -- coupons and he went to a store with me and he let me choose a blouse or whatever I wanted -- it was a blouse -- from his coupons.</span> <span id="s263">It was the sweetest thing, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This was your cousin Heinz?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: This wa -- no, this was actually the brother-in-law of my cousin Heinz.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s267">And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: His name was Gunther Ver-Vernon.</span> <span id="s269">Their real name -- you talk about real name, their real name was Vershenski and his -- his -- they changed their name to Vernon.</span> <span id="s270">Anyway, Gunther Vernon, he saved his coupons -- his clothing coupons for me and bought me a blouse.</span> <span id="s271">But, the poor guy, he fed me something -- he didn’t, I mean the -- the restaurant there in his club.</span> <span id="s272">So, I was sick from that and I was sick of heart, of leaving Europe.</span> <span id="s273">I was scared to death, you know, really to be on my own in a huge country.</span> <span id="s274">I mean, to come from Holland, which is the first thing the Dutch always say to you, “How do you like Holland, isn’t it small?”</span> <span id="s275">You know, this is -- it’s one sentence that they’re saying.</span> <span id="s276">Of course now, you know, it’s going to be Europe and it’s going to be bigger, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Well, be -- k -- k -- k -- can you explain something to me, just so I’m clear about it, because I -- I’m not -- what I’m not clear about is, what was the impetus to leave and to come to the United States, other than it’s sort of the general dream, of going to the Uni-United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Well, I was at a point, you know, where I had to make up my mind what in the world was going to happen to me.</span> <span id="s279">I had a relationship, which really --</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: This was with Otmar?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: With Otmar.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: And -- and I just thought I’m getting on in age and I want children and -- you might have heard, you know, Otmar did not want children.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Yeah, I thought that was a very important [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: It was a very important point and I said, “Oh, my goodness, you know, I’m getting to be 22.”</span> <span id="s286">In those day, people married pretty early.</span> <span id="s287">Not as early in Europe as they married in the United States, but they did marry pretty early.</span> <span id="s288">And I was getting to be 22 and he didn’t want children.</span> <span id="s289">And I was crazy about him.</span> <span id="s290">But -- and I think that’s why I had the nervous breakdown, because I just -- I didn’t want to leave him, but I knew I had to leave him.</span> <span id="s291">I mean -- and that’s how I am.</span> <span id="s292">If -- I mean even -- even if it breaks my heart, if I know I have to do something, I’m my own protector.</span> <span id="s293">I have to take of -- care of myself and that is what I have to do.</span> <span id="s294">And so I decided this was a point where I had to leave.</span> <span id="s295">Another thing was that the Dutch had not given me citizenship.</span> <span id="s296">Now, you have to understand that my mother really was Dutch.</span> <span id="s297">She was Dutch, she was born Dutch.</span> <span id="s298">My grandfather was Dutch.</span> <span id="s299">My grandmother wasn’t, but my grandfather was Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: You mother’s mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: My mother’s mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: I mean, your mother’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: My mother’s father, yes.</span> <span id="s304">Hendrick -- Hendrick Zeetroon.</span> <span id="s305">But he lived in Berlin and he had married a German wife, Ellen Fillipi.</span> <span id="s306">And when he died, in ‘31, my grandfather, when he died, my grandmother, my Dutch grandmother -- she had become Dutch, moved to Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s307">So, when things got tight -- well, we actually went to Holland on vacation.</span> <span id="s308">I sa -- I’m telling that in the other story, we went to Holland on vacation and again this Uncle Bep, my -- the journalist, he’s the one who said, “Don’t go back,” to my mother.</span> <span id="s309">Anyway, I don’t want to go over old ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: No, no.</span> <span id="s311">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: But that’s -- that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: I’m just curious about -- about -- to understand the motivation.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Well, the motoration was -- it -- it was kind of a despera -- cr -- a desperation kind of thing.</span> <span id="s315">If I don’t get out of there, I’m going to stuck with Otmar and I’ll never have children.</span> <span id="s316">And the one thing I want, is children.</span> <span id="s317">I need something that is my own, my own.</span> <span id="s318">After all these losses, after no mother, no father, no sister.</span> <span id="s319">No -- you know, no grandmother.</span> <span id="s320">You see, you have to understand, I’d been extremely lucky, you know, I’d been extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s321">I had fantastic parents, a lovely sister and an everything, you know.</span> <span id="s322">I had a grandmother who adored me.</span> <span id="s323">I had always been loved and taken -- taken care of.</span> <span id="s324">And I think that’s part of my success.</span> <span id="s325">I -- I have to be so grateful to them, so grateful for the strength that they gave me, through their love, real -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview, with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s327">This is tape number one, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: -- something that is my own -- my own.</span> <span id="s329">After all these losses, after no mother, no father, no sister.</span> <span id="s330">No -- you know, no grandmother.</span> <span id="s331">You see, you have to understand, I’d been extremely lucky, you know, I’d been extremely lucky.</span> <span id="s332">I had fantastic parents, a lovely sister and an -- everything, you know.</span> <span id="s333">I had a grandmother who adored me.</span> <span id="s334">I had always been loved and taken -- taken care of.</span> <span id="s335">And I think that’s part of my success.</span> <span id="s336">I -- I have to be so grateful to them, so grateful for the strength that they gave me, through their love, really.</span> <span id="s337">And it has carried me, even past people, you know, who really tried to down me and give -- tell me, you know, “You’re no good and you can’t do anything,” and this and that, you know, I -- I have always thought, “That’s what they say, I know better.”</span> <span id="s338">And that’s due to my parent -- that’s due to whatever they did, you know, in the very beginning.</span> <span id="s339">I always knew that we were the best.</span> <span id="s340">I mean, we were -- you know, and -- and we were just right, you know, my father was -- was an intellectual, he played the violin, he -- my mother played the piano, we always had music.</span> <span id="s341">We had wonderful friends, I adored my parents friends.</span> <span id="s342">They were all fantastic, you know.</span> <span id="s343">That is -- I used to sit around, listen to them talk and they were wonderful, witty, well-based, intellectual kind of talks.</span> <span id="s344">And I adored it.</span> <span id="s345">I -- I just -- I would sit there and listen and listen.</span> <span id="s346">And I -- I would read the books they gave me and the books that I found and I’ve always liked that.</span> <span id="s347">I’ve never been a scholarly person.</span> <span id="s348">I’ve never been as somebody who -- I -- although I like school, you know, history and things like that, but I’ve never been a s -- a real scholarly person.</span> <span id="s349">I’m more toward the arts and toward the touchy-feely kind of things and -- but I love to listen and I -- I enjoy that kind of atmosphere.</span> <span id="s350">And amazingly enough, when I came to the States, the Kalinoffsky’s, as wonderful as they were, you know, they didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s351">There wasn’t a painting in the house.</span> <span id="s352">I gave a painting to Mrs. Kalinoffsky for Christmas.</span> <span id="s353">A painting that was made by somebody in Greenwich Village, whom I liked very much, a -- a German girl who was there.</span> <span id="s354">She never hung it up.</span> <span id="s355">I looked at -- I looked at it.</span> <span id="s356">I couldn’t frame it, you know, I couldn’t afford to frame it, because I had to pay her -- my goodness, I think it was 50 dollars.</span> <span id="s357">And 50 dollars -- for me to make 50 dollars, I think that’s what I made a week, you know?</span> <span id="s358">So I saved the money for -- for this painting and I bought the painting and I gave it to her.</span> <span id="s359">At -- and for -- for Christmas and I -- they never hung it.</span> <span id="s360">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: You were celebrating Christmas, or they were celebrating Christmas?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Oh yeah, they -- everybody I knew was celebrating Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Was that a -- was that a change or was -- or was --</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: I -- we were never very religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I remember Christmas at home in Berlin.</span> <span id="s367">I do remember some Hanukkahs in -- in Amsterdam, but that was, you know, a-after the emergency, you know?</span> <span id="s368">It was because we were thrown into this peculiar situation of being not really at home.</span> <span id="s369">You know, I mean, we -- we were just -- we had moved to Holland and things were different in Holland, you know and we were sort of thrown in a society of people like us.</span> <span id="s370">I found out, when I was there just now, in Amsterdam, with -- with Barbara Addie--</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: When -- when was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: -- that -- well, it was just this year, in the spring I guess it was.</span> <span id="s373">Oh, it was very -- still very cold, so it must be early s -- early spring.</span> <span id="s374">I found out that the neighborhood where we lived in was brand new when we came.</span> <span id="s375">I -- I had no idea about that, you know, I ha -- I -- I saw it as a child.</span> <span id="s376">You moved in somewhere [indecipherable], but now I know that it was a new neighborhood at the time, just been built and that’s why there were so many people like us.</span> <span id="s377">You know, German Jewish refugees, actually, who lived in that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s378">But it made it a very -- it wasn’t strictly like that, but a lot.</span> <span id="s379">And so that’s why the Franks were there.</span> <span id="s380">And -- and the family of the woman he finally married and -- and -- and you know, I mean, just name it.</span> <span id="s381">Maria Austria was there, who became my foot -- photography teacher after the war and who also took many of the very beautiful pictures of our family at the time.</span> <span id="s382">And I worked as a model for her and for her sister, who had been a buwhouse weaver.</span> <span id="s383">And I wore the sweaters and things she designed and Maria photographed them and it got into the various magazines in Holland.</span> <span id="s384">LeBella and some of the other ones.</span> <span id="s385">And, so that neighborhood was very cozy in -- in that way, because -- and you didn’t feel like a stranger, because everybody -- not everybody, but quite a few people were like that.</span> <span id="s386">I never felt -- I cannot remember, I should say, maybe there were moments, but I cannot remember feeling like a stranger.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: In Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: In Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s389">Or an -- or an outsider.</span> <span id="s390">I might have been, because now people say that the Dutch really weren’t very nice to the foreigners, they resented them and this and that.</span> <span id="s391">But I -- I personally can’t remember it.</span> <span id="s392">Now I was just a dumb child and I was busy with myself and probably didn’t pay attention.</span> <span id="s393">But I never felt like an outsider.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Now when -- when you rephr -- I know you say you didn’t feel like an outsider, but -- but are you s -- the -- as an outsider as someone from Berlin, or someone who is Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: Now, this is a very interesting question.</span> <span id="s396">I never thought about Jewish.</span> <span id="s397">And, to tell you the truth, I -- I have never thought -- unless people ask me and I’m sort of -- stand back and look at it, you know.</span> <span id="s398">I really never thought about Jewish.</span> <span id="s399">In Holland, I never realized anything.</span> <span id="s400">People are not -- were not very religious in Holland.</span> <span id="s401">They are not very religious in Holland.</span> <span id="s402">I remember in Sweden, which isn’t quite the same, but still, people were telling me th-they were saying, “Well you know, we were really heathens.</span> <span id="s403">We’re really heathens,” she said.</span> <span id="s404">“We’re -- we’re -- we’re baptized and we die in the church.”</span> <span id="s405">I mean, for the rest -- you know the church.</span> <span id="s406">And in Sweden they actually tax everybody a dollar or [indecipherable] a certain percentage, so that the churches can be kept, because otherwise nobody would take care of them, you know?</span> <span id="s407">And it -- it -- in Holland, it’s not quite like that, but it is like it, quite a bit.</span> <span id="s408">You know, religion really didn’t mean much to me, I mean it’s -- it -- it never has.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Well, tell -- can you tell me a little bit about your -- a-about the atmosphere.</span> <span id="s410">Y-You started to describe the atmosphere in your -- in your home when you were little.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Okay, the atmosphere.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: And just about --</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: In Berlin?</span> <span id="s414">Or in -- we --</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: First -- w-well, how old -- first of all, how old were you when you moved from Berlin to Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Eight -- I was seven.</span> <span id="s417">I had my eighth birthday in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s418">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s419">Well, either one, whatever you can recall.</span> <span id="s420">What I’m interested in is that -- the -- sort of the -- what -- what your family was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: [indecipherable] you described a little bit about your father and your -- of playing the violin and the intellectual atmos -- but also about the -- the code of ethics and the -- and the -- and the religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: I don’t know anything about the code of ethics.</span> <span id="s424">I don’t even know what it means.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: Well, [indecipherable] that’s a weird phrase.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I mean, my father was a lawyer.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: And he never did anything that was not right.</span> <span id="s429">That’s kil -- that’s what killed him.</span> <span id="s430">I mean, he could not go outside of what was at the moment, the law.</span> <span id="s431">He could not see past that, you know?</span> <span id="s432">I mean -- and what saved me was that at the time this all happened, I was 16 years old.</span> <span id="s433">I mean -- I mean in Holland and I was just starting to develop my own little group of people, my -- young people.</span> <span id="s434">And they were different.</span> <span id="s435">I met Manfred and that was my luck, dumb luck.</span> <span id="s436">And he was politically interested.</span> <span id="s437">Now, he was 19 or 20 when I met him and he was political, but I didn’t know anything about political.</span> <span id="s438">One thing I didn’t know anything about was political.</span> <span id="s439">I knew we moved to Holland because of Hitler, but otherwise, it was just a move for me.</span> <span id="s440">And it was a struggle, that first year, to go from German to -- to Dutch in school.</span> <span id="s441">I was very b -- I mean, I had been excellent at school in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Which was in the same street, actually, or the street next to ours, that I could walk there, you know, to the school.</span> <span id="s444">And I came and -- by the way, and this -- this would interest you.</span> <span id="s445">One day -- now, I’m talking about Germany now.</span> <span id="s446">This was in the second grade.</span> <span id="s447">We got to take home a little letter, which said, “From now on, Barbara should be in school at 10:30 on -- on Tuesdays, because the other children will have religious instruction, which was Lutheran.</span> <span id="s448">And in case -- you know, she doesn’t have to come til 10:30, that’s when school starts.</span> <span id="s449">Well, I cried and cried.</span> <span id="s450">My father had to sign this little note, that he had gotten the message and he s -- I -- I said, “Why shouldn’t I go there?”</span> <span id="s451">And he says, “I don’t know why you shouldn’t go there.</span> <span id="s452">You want to go there, you go there.”</span> <span id="s453">So he wrote to the teacher, “Barbara would like to attend.”</span> <span id="s454">Come at nine o’clock, attend to school.</span> <span id="s455">So I had religious instruction, Lutheran -- the Lutheran religion.</span> <span id="s456">And I loved it.</span> <span id="s457">I was one of the best ones telling these stories, my goodness.</span> <span id="s458">Bread into wine -- I mean br -- you know, I mean bread -- I mean how he fed all the hundreds and I mean, it was just fabulous.</span> <span id="s459">I d -- I was a good storyteller and I got my -- the highest grade.</span> <span id="s460">I did very well.</span> <span id="s461">So, coming to Holland was hard for me, because I had to start all over, making my place in the class and -- and trying to -- and who was in my class but Margot Frank.</span> <span id="s462">And that’s why we got to be so friendly, because we started the same year, the same day, the same everything, you know.</span> <span id="s463">And we lived in the same neighborhood, so we walked home together.</span> <span id="s464">And that’s how the families met each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So, but what -- so what was your ed -- what was your parent’s religiousness like?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Did they go -- did they go to synagogue on a regular basis?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: They didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: Never.</span> <span id="s471">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: Not in Berlin.</span> <span id="s474">Now, we’re talking Berlin, now.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: And -- and had -- had you had a brother, would he have been Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s477">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s478">But I -- I might be totally wrong in this.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: I do not want to put words in their mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">Q: Just -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: But your father had been Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: You know, I don’t even know that.</span> <span id="s485">I presume he was, because my grandfather was -- I think he was religious.</span> <span id="s486">My grandfather -- on both sides, my grandfathers, were religious.</span> <span id="s487">My mother’s grandfather, I remember him putting on the Tefillen and davnen in the morning.</span> <span id="s488">But for the rest, you never heard anything about Jewish.</span> <span id="s489">You know, I mean, he -- he did that.</span> <span id="s490">I think they like, lit the candles on s -- on s -- Friday evening.</span> <span id="s491">I think they did.</span> <span id="s492">I’m pretty sure they did.</span> <span id="s493">I think they had Hanukkah and not Christmas, but we had Christmas.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: At home?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: We -- I remember we had a big hall and I remember this gorgeous Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s498">I mean, it was big, you know, all the way to the ceiling, with the real white candles -- live candles on there.</span> <span id="s499">I remember the plates, with the nuts and the marzipan and the -- and the apples, the red, red apples and the -- you know, what you get at Christmas.</span> <span id="s500">And we had a lot of maids and people, you know, and they were Christians and they were mostly Catholics, actually.</span> <span id="s501">And they -- and I remember also, that they all got presents, we got presents.</span> <span id="s502">I remember my father saying that -- not to forget to give him money in an envelope, because when he get -- went to court, there were all the people, you know, at the door of the court and the people who worked for him in the office and he was giving presents out, Christmas.</span> <span id="s503">And we had -- definitely had -- I remember that wonderful smell of the pine an-and I’m probably romanticizing it, but I can see it, how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Well, it’s a --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Memories will make things prettier than they probably were.</span> <span id="s506">But it was very pretty, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">Q: Well, those are powerful memories for children.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">A: And you know, it was also that ma -- where my parents went skiing, or they went on trips, I had a Catholic maid, she was a Red Cross nurse.</span> <span id="s509">Sh-She wasn’t a maid, she was a nurse.</span> <span id="s510">And she took me with her, to her parents.</span> <span id="s511">So, that was in Bavaria and it was completely, you know, Christian and I have still pictures of that and everything.</span> <span id="s512">And I would go -- later, when I had a governess and my sister had the -- the -- her -- Maria, my nurse, I resented my sister because of that, she got my Maria.</span> <span id="s513">And I got a -- an governess.</span> <span id="s514">That governess went to -- she was also Catholic and I remember her -- going to church with her, because on Sundays, when my parents weren’t there and she wanted to go to church, she couldn’t leave me home.</span> <span id="s515">So I would -- I would go to church with her.</span> <span id="s516">And I -- I remember my parents coming home one night and my mother was giving me a hug and there was something crackling on my chest and she looked under the blanket and there was one of these holy cards, you know, the saint cards.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: I don’t know what that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Well, that is -- that’s -- well, you know what these baseball cards were, that boys exchange?</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Well, it was like that, little bit longer, a little narrower and it had the picture of the saint and then it had some of his sayings or poe-poem about him.</span> <span id="s521">And what it was supposed to do, was protect me during the night, from anything bad that could happen to me.</span> <span id="s522">I mean, that was what -- what they did -- what -- what she did.</span> <span id="s523">She meant nothing but good with it.</span> <span id="s524">And my mother was very upset.</span> <span id="s525">I remember her being upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, I presume -- I presume that she said, “Look, it’s all right to take her to -- to church with you, but, I mean, how far can you go?</span> <span id="s528">You know, after all, you know, that’s not her religion.”</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Now I want -- I just want to do something here, I want to -- I want you to just go over the names of the people in your families, to make sure that we have them.</span> <span id="s530">Or -- or who you can remember, but your grandfathers, what did your grandfathers do?</span> <span id="s531">What was their professions?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: My grandfather -- my mother’s father --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: Right, was his name [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Okay, that was just a Dutchman -- he was the Dutchman.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: And his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: And his name was Hendrick Ruloff Zeetroon.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: And my grandmother’s name was Ellen Filipi [indecipherable] Zeetroon.</span> <span id="s539">And my father’s -- oh, he was a furrier.</span> <span id="s540">He had a furrier business and that’s a wonderful story, because -- I don’t know if I told that, probably on the tape also --</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: I don’t -- I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Well, he -- he was, of course, born in Amsterdam and he was born at number one Culverstrat, which is right across from the palace.</span> <span id="s543">It’s a little narrow street, which is now nothing but a big junk heap.</span> <span id="s544">I mean it’s -- it’s -- I can’t give you an example of a street that’s like that.</span> <span id="s545">One store next to the other and not very classy.</span> <span id="s546">But they still owned the house.</span> <span id="s547">The family -- Cargill Zeetroon owns that house and -- and a jewelry store that they all came out of that jewelry store.</span> <span id="s548">My great-grandfather Ruda -- Ruloff owned a jewelry store, which he, I think had already inherited from his grandfather at number one Culverstrat.</span> <span id="s549">And that house still is owned by the Zeetroons.</span> <span id="s550">It now is called Shrapzeetune or Fundumzeetune or something like that, the store itself, but my cousin Carroll has the upper -- is only on the upper -- has an office now only, on the upper floor.</span> <span id="s551">He only does antique -- antique jewelry now.</span> <span id="s552">But there were 15 children or 16 children and it was sort of half and half -- half girls, half boys.</span> <span id="s553">And there was, of course, no possibility of all the boys inheriting this business.</span> <span id="s554">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Well, that’s never done.</span> <span id="s557">The oldest inherits it and the rest has to, you know.</span> <span id="s558">The girls get some help, you know, they get dowries and st -- they got dowries and stuff.</span> <span id="s559">But the boys were on their own and it was typical of the times that boys were walking around Europe, the -- not just Jewish boys, I mean all boys.</span> <span id="s560">Second sons, third sons, fourth sons, you know.</span> <span id="s561">They were not inheriting anything.</span> <span id="s562">They were on their own.</span> <span id="s563">So, my grandfather walked -- he had an uncle in Berlin and he walked.</span> <span id="s564">He walked first -- he was sent to Borna.</span> <span id="s565">In Borna, that’s where the family spunyard came from, and that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Family what?</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: Spunyard -- spanyard -- it was called spanyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, spunyard is -- at a translation is Spaniard.</span> <span id="s570">A person from Spain, Spaniard.</span> <span id="s571">Well, the spunyard family had a business in Borna, which was a mill and they produced cloth material, that’s what they did.</span> <span id="s572">And he was sent there to learn the business.</span> <span id="s573">So there is my grandfather Hendrick in this teeny tiny town in the west -- in the west -- pardon me, in the east of Holland.</span> <span id="s574">He hated it with such a passion.</span> <span id="s575">Now, those people were very religious.</span> <span id="s576">My grandfather was religious, he was raised very Jewish, but he wasn’t like they were, they were narrow about it.</span> <span id="s577">And so he fled, after awhile and he started going east.</span> <span id="s578">And he kept going east and he told these stories about first he got to Dusseldorf, one of those towns.</span> <span id="s579">And he had to have some money.</span> <span id="s580">So he took a job with a furrier, and what did he have to do?</span> <span id="s581">The furriers would get furs from all over Europe, mostly Russia and -- and -- and the Scandinavian countries.</span> <span id="s582">And he had to scrape the flesh off of the furs, so you can imagine the stink in there.</span> <span id="s583">I mean, it was horrendous.</span> <span id="s584">And since he was the littlest, because he was only like -- I don’t know exactly his age, but he was very young.</span> <span id="s585">And he would be -- the bag, because it stank so much, was hung out of the window -- where the scrapes were scraped into.</span> <span id="s586">And because he was the littlest, he was put into the bag to stamp it down.</span> <span id="s587">To -- to -- to compress that stuff, because he -- because -- then they could put more in the bag, these bags were leather and they were then taken somewhere and -- and emptied, I imagine.</span> <span id="s588">And he was telling these ta -- he --we -- used tell these awful stories, how terrible that all was and he didn’t want to do that, so he fled again and he kept walking east -- east -- east -- east.</span> <span id="s589">There was another uncle in -- in Berlin.</span> <span id="s590">And he got to Berlin and that uncle ha -- wa -- had a furrier business and he took furs that were already scraped and ready to go, you know, to be made into coats.</span> <span id="s591">And that’s where my grandfather Hendrick learned his business.</span> <span id="s592">It was very -- it’s a very amusing story, because what happened then -- he was quite handsome -- he was very blonde, very blue eyed -- sort of a reddish blonde hair.</span> <span id="s593">I was called a st -- called a Dutchman.</span> <span id="s594">And he was -- there were Jewish families in Berlin that had been there a long time, were very settled and one of them was the Filipis.</span> <span id="s595">And they were extremely rich and -- and one day the daughter, Ellen, my future grandmother had her 16th or 18th birthday.</span> <span id="s596">And my great-grandfather, Louis -- Louis -- Luis, I think his name was -- who rode horses and did crazy things all -- all his life, gave a huge party for her.</span> <span id="s597">It was a g -- like a coming out party, sort of -- you would call it now.</span> <span id="s598">And he invited every eligible bachelor in Berlin to that party.</span> <span id="s599">And so my grandfather knew he wasn’t eligible at all.</span> <span id="s600">I mean, he was just, you know, a poor boy, really, working in -- in somebody’s business.</span> <span id="s601">But he heard -- a friend of his told him that there was going to be this great party, in this fabulous house and -- and he said, “Well, I want to go.”</span> <span id="s602">And the friend said, “Well you have to have an invitation.”</span> <span id="s603">And he says, “Well, we’ll manage somehow.”</span> <span id="s604">You know, “We’ll -- we’ll manage it.</span> <span id="s605">Just take me with you,” you know.</span> <span id="s606">So they rented a suit for him and they went and somehow he got in and because he was really very handsome.</span> <span id="s607">He was tall and he was nice looking and -- and blonde, she f -- Ellen liked him, of all the boys there, you know, with beautiful names, that had been in Berlin for age -- she chose Hendrick Zeetroon.</span> <span id="s608">And her father, after the party, said, “Well, which one shall it be?”</span> <span id="s609">Because he knew that whoever he chose, with all his money, she was going to get.</span> <span id="s610">So she said, “Hendrick Zeetroon.”</span> <span id="s611">And he’d never heard of him -- anybody like that.</span> <span id="s612">It was a disaster.</span> <span id="s613">He l -- he said, “Never,” you know.</span> <span id="s614">And she said, “Oh, yes.”</span> <span id="s615">And she locked herself in her room and she wouldn’t eat and she wouldn’t drink and she wouldn’t this and she wouldn’t that and she had the key and he couldn’t get -- they couldn’t get into the -- into the room.</span> <span id="s616">There were lots of sisters in her family and brothers also.</span> <span id="s617">But they couldn’t -- he loved Ellen because she was just as strong as he was.</span> <span id="s618">This was my grandfather I’m talking about, Louie.</span> <span id="s619">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: Your great -- great -- great-grandfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: My great-grandfather, yeah.</span> <span id="s622">So she won and she married Hendrick.</span> <span id="s623">It was a total disaster, but nevertheless, you know, it was a -- she got whom she wanted, and he got so much money.</span> <span id="s624">I mean, now it would be a million and a half -- something like that, dowry.</span> <span id="s625">I mean it -- it was just tremendous.</span> <span id="s626">I have a tape that my Uncle Huntz made.</span> <span id="s627">That was -- is my mother’s youngest brother and that’s where he tells this story.</span> <span id="s628">And he’s the one where I get my figures from.</span> <span id="s629">So -- so -- so my grandfather suddenly was rich.</span> <span id="s630">And there are other funny stories about the fact that he wanted my -- my great-grandfather said, “Okay.”</span> <span id="s631">He thought he would win out a little bit by that -- through that.</span> <span id="s632">He said, “Okay, if you want to marry him, he has to be a -- he has to become German.</span> <span id="s633">You can’t marry anybody but a German, the Dutch are terrible all day.</span> <span id="s634">They have no culture, they have no this,” you know, “or that.”</span> <span id="s635">So, he tried to become a German.</span> <span id="s636">And -- and they have the papers, the family of my Uncle Heinz has the papers for that.</span> <span id="s637">He applied to become a German citizen and my Uncle Heinz has the answer of the German government to this and they said, “If you actually marry Ellen Filipi and if you have children and if they get to be 18 years old without any problem with the police or any kind of trouble with business or whatever.</span> <span id="s638">And if you haven’t had any trouble with business, then you will be allowed to reapply for citizenship.”</span> <span id="s639">So they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: That’s funny.</span> <span id="s641">Now was there any -- any question about or issue of their -- of his Jewishness?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">Q: They were all Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">A: He -- they were Jewish, but, you know, the Germans considered German -- Berlinners, they considered these Jews -- I mean the Dutch, the Dutch were peasants to them.</span> <span id="s647">All the Dutch were peasants to them.</span> <span id="s648">You know, nice little grab bag of -- of peasants.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Okay, now tell us -- let’s spend a couple of minutes talking about your father’s parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Okay, my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And just the other ones and then we’ll go on to some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Okay, let’s go to my fam -- par -- now, my father was born in Hirschbeck in Aubershlasian, Upper Salasia, in Hirschbeck.</span> <span id="s653">Now, I have looked at where that is.</span> <span id="s654">I called the German embassy, because when we went -- we’re going to Prague, actually and I knew it wasn’t too far from Prague.</span> <span id="s655">And I thought it was in Germany.</span> <span id="s656">It -- I mean, at the time that he was born, it was Germany.</span> <span id="s657">These are these border areas that kept turning -- changing nationality.</span> <span id="s658">They -- they were -- they were German or they were Polish.</span> <span id="s659">Every time -- now, Hirschbeck actually always was German, but guess what, it’s Polish now.</span> <span id="s660">It is called Yelenagura and it is up in the mountains in the most gorgeous country that you can imagine.</span> <span id="s661">It’s a little mountaintop town.</span> <span id="s662">I guess it’s bigger now, a lot bigger.</span> <span id="s663">But I went there -- the last time that I went there, I was six and a half, seven, sort of like that.</span> <span id="s664">That was when I was allowed to go walking with them.</span> <span id="s665">And I remember how gorgeous it was.</span> <span id="s666">I remember the fields with the weaving wheat and the red poppies and the blue cornflowers around the edges, mostly poppies.</span> <span id="s667">It was so gorgeous, with the mountains up there.</span> <span id="s668">Anyway, that’s where my father was born and where I guess his father was born also.</span> <span id="s669">I had hoped to go there and when I asked the German embassy, they said, “We don’t have -- yes, they said, we have two or three Hirschbecks.</span> <span id="s670">Which one do you want?”</span> <span id="s671">And I said, “Upper Salasia.”</span> <span id="s672">And she said, “We don’t own that any more.”</span> <span id="s673">After the second World War, it was given to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: So, it’s now Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Why would that prevent you from going there?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: No, it wouldn’t prevent me from going, but it does put a little bit of -- I -- I’m not anxious to go to anything Polish.</span> <span id="s678">I -- I don’t know why that is, but I don’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Well, that’s interesting.</span> <span id="s680">You’re -- you’re more comfortable in Germany than in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Because what?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Well, I can’t -- I -- the Germans I can understand, you know.</span> <span id="s684">I can’t speak a word of Polish.</span> <span id="s685">And -- and I don’t know what they’re saying and I’ve heard nothing but bad things about it.</span> <span id="s686">It’s -- it’s -- it’s very strange, because of course, as a European, I didn’t know many bad things about Poland, what they did to the Jews and this and that, but as an American, now, I met a lot of people whose descent is Polish and it’s nothing but rotten.</span> <span id="s687">You know, the things that you he -- that -- that I hear out of it.</span> <span id="s688">It’s of course ridiculous, I’m sure it’s not all true now, or that there are exceptions, you know, you shouldn’t generalize, but -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s689">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s690">This is tape number two, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: -- a lot of people whose descent is Polish and it’s nothing but rotten.</span> <span id="s692">You know, the things that you he -- that -- that I hear out of it.</span> <span id="s693">It’s of course ridiculous, I’m sure it’s not all true now, or that there are exceptions, you know, you shouldn’t generalize, but the history of Poland and the Jews is not very nice, and so I -- I have a prejudice against it, that’s what I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: Well that’s -- you know, I mean -- and these things I think are important to mention and it’s important just to understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">Q: I think it’s just important to understand -- you know, for me, like for instance, one of the things that -- that’s a question that is -- some -- some people who have -- some people refuse to buy German products.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: Particularly cars.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: Like some people say, I just will never buy a Mercedes or a Volkswagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">Q: Some people say, “Well what’s the difference?”</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: No, I -- I have a hard time.</span> <span id="s706">I would like to buy a Mercedes, very much, but I would have to give myself a real shove to do it.</span> <span id="s707">I would -- really would like it.</span> <span id="s708">And no -- now when I was in -- in -- in Germany now, you know, and I met so many nice people.</span> <span id="s709">I mean, I met nothing but nice people.</span> <span id="s710">And I kept saying to myself, “This is the next generation and the next generation.”</span> <span id="s711">There’re two and three generations since I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">A: I hadn’t been in Berlin for 65 years, I’m 72.</span> <span id="s714">So, you know, it -- it really -- I -- I kept saying to myself, “Well, it’s not the same people, it’s not the same people.”</span> <span id="s715">But I know that even then, it wasn’t all bad at all.</span> <span id="s716">Because my father had many, many nice friends.</span> <span id="s717">And there didn’t seem to be, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: At least I didn’t notice anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: Well, I mentioned to Simone yesterday, that when I went to Poland in April -- I’m relatively naive about all of the events that took place and about all of the cu -- the complexities of the relationships, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: -- you know, I mean I have some idea, but -- but relatively unknowledgeable and for me, it was absolutely staggering to be there and to -- to try to comprehend the relationships between the few remaining Jews in Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: -- and the Poles --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: No, you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: -- and then the Germans, next door and the relationship that the Germans have to the non-Jews and the relationship the Germans have to the Jews.</span> <span id="s727">And the abs --</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: The German had with the Poles.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s730">And how all of these people can live together with this kind of shared memory --</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: History.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: -- and history and trying to either preserve it or go on.</span> <span id="s733">It was -- to me, it was completely staggering and I was so confused and so emotionally drained when I got back.</span> <span id="s734">And it was the reason I never went there before, because I figured this was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: Course.</span> <span id="s736">Exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: And it was still -- it was extremely interesting --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: Extremely.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: -- and groundbreaking and it was -- for me it was amazing to go there.</span> <span id="s740">And -- and I took a trip to Auschwitz and went there.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: And that was just --</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: I couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: I -- I -- wu -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: I’m a real coward that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Well --</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: I’m a real coward that way, I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: I don’t thi -- I wouldn’t recommend it for somebody whose been through what you went through.</span> <span id="s749">I think, for people who haven’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: No, I mean to think it’s my pa -- my -- if I think -- I tell you what happened when -- when they opened the Holocaust Museum, we were invited --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: -- you know, to the opening.</span> <span id="s753">And I -- I went through the museum.</span> <span id="s754">Do you know -- I mean, I knew that my parents died in the ovens, I knew it.</span> <span id="s755">And you’d know my father -- it doesn’t really make any difference, but he was a persnickety guy, you know, alway clean every day, everything starched and everything -- you know, he was quite an old-fashioned gentleman.</span> <span id="s756">And, to think of him -- it was the first time that I saw a model of the -- of the path that they had to go to get to the ovens.</span> <span id="s757">And they said they had to go naked, that they had to take their clo -- if I think of my persnickety father, my -- my -- and my m -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s758">I mean I -- I looked at that and I’d known it, after all.</span> <span id="s759">I have imagination enough.</span> <span id="s760">I had known all this and still, it just hit me so hard, that particular thing.</span> <span id="s761">The murder -- you know, the films that they show, the -- the videos that they show of the murdering, you know, where you have to look over the edge -- those things at the museum, so that kids can’t see it right off.</span> <span id="s762">The television shows -- did you look over the edge yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: That -- that murdering and killing, I know that.</span> <span id="s765">But -- but that model of the path to the -- to the -- that -- it’s a white thing, sort of beige-y white thing, yellowish white, the path that they had to go through to get to the ovens.</span> <span id="s766">It’s unbelievable.</span> <span id="s767">It is unbelievable that somebody can go and design that.</span> <span id="s768">I mean, to such an incredible thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: And then I went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s771">I mean, that is just.</span> <span id="s772">Now I went to Berlin and I looked at these people.</span> <span id="s773">These are the children and grandchildren -- [phone ringing] I just --</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: You don’t want to get it?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: -- of -- of these people.</span> <span id="s776">And I just -- I just really -- I just really couldn’t believe it, that -- that that is -- that they can walk around.</span> <span id="s777">But they are troubled by it.</span> <span id="s778">They are -- this -- the new generation is totally troubled by it.</span> <span id="s779">An --</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Hold on one second, let’s just wait for it to stop ringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: It stopped.</span> <span id="s782">That’s the end, four times.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">A: So, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: But that -- that issue of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: The -- the actual seeing of something is different from --</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: But that -- yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: You know.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: But I -- no, but the -- the planning.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: The planning, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: The plan -- because even when -- when you go -- when I went to Auschwitz -- I didn’t realize this, but Auschwitz had existed before the war, as an army barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: It was just my ignorance, but I didn’t know that, so I -- so I went there and I saw it and it’s -- number one, it’s -- i-i-it’s -- it’s serene looking.</span> <span id="s794">Because it’s just these -- you know, it’s weird, because it’s like these -- these small brick buildings with grass and -- and paths in between them.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Well, now --</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: It has barbed wi -- has barbed wire everywhere --</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Now --</span></p> <p><span id="s798">Q: So you know what’s going on.</span> <span id="s799">But the -- the thing was that it wa -- had -- was pre-existed and even the first gas chamber that they put there was previously a storage -- underground storage room for potatoes and food for the soldiers.</span> <span id="s800">And they cleaned it out and they sort of made it a makeshift gas chamber.</span> <span id="s801">What was really upsetting to me, was when you go two miles down the road to Birkenau and you see that they have worked with this small facility at Auschwitz and it wasn’t proper -- it wasn’t designed well, it wasn’t efficient.</span> <span id="s802">So they’re going to build from the ground up, with all of their knowledge about how to slaughter people.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">A: Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Birkenau.</span> <span id="s805">Which is built on a field.</span> <span id="s806">It’s humongous and it’s so big.</span> <span id="s807">And the places that they put people were not these little, tidy brick buildings, but they were these hu-huge barns, for thousands of people.</span> <span id="s808">Which is -- they just pushed them in, like cattles.</span> <span id="s809">And then they -- their -- these are lined up and they were all -- they’re -- most of them are burned, because they -- because they tried to burn them all down as they were running away.</span> <span id="s810">But then you see the plan and the train tracks that come right down and -- and it’s in that part of it, which is the -- exactly what you were saying, which is this conscious planning and very careful -- it’s -- it’s beyond, I mean it -- it was -- I had never seen anything like that in my life.</span> <span id="s811">And it’s so far beyond my comprehension of humanity, that I was just completely --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Human.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: -- silent.</span> <span id="s814">I couldn’t -- I couldn’t stay there.</span> <span id="s815">I couldn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Turn off?</span> <span id="s818">But that -- you know what, why don’t we get -- go in -- we were in the middle of -- you were telling me about your father and your mother, but you didn’t get up to your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: Yeah, I told you about my mother, now I-I’m busy with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Do you remember I told you about Hendrick Filipi?</span> <span id="s822">I -- I mean Hen-Hendrick Zeetroon?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: I mean -- I -- I -- I’m sorry, about your -- your father’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: My father’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: -- father, and your father’s mother you didn’t tell me about.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s827">My father now, I told you he was from Hirschbeck, Aubershlasian, Upper Salasia.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: In this beautiful, little mountain town.</span> <span id="s830">And my grandfather was a lawyer and he was on this town council and he was quite well known and -- and busy in that town and I think they lived very happily.</span> <span id="s831">I also think he was religious -- belonged to the -- whatever congregation they had in Hirschbeck and -- and the -- I don’t know how big the community was there.</span> <span id="s832">But there obviously was one.</span> <span id="s833">The story is that he actually died giving a talk in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, which was supposed to be an honor, to die in such a way.</span> <span id="s834">But I -- this is his story and I don’t know if it’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Then this was your grandfather?</span></p> <p><span id="s836">A: This was my father’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: He’s supposed to have been a lovely man, but I -- I never met him.</span> <span id="s839">So, my father had a brother named Kurt and he died of a liver ailment, rather young.</span> <span id="s840">He also was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s841">There was firm, really, Leiderman, Leiderman and Leiderman in -- in Hirschbeck, I think.</span> <span id="s842">And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Who was the third Leiderman?</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Well, was my grandfather, my father and --</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: -- and his brother Kurt, who was older than -- than my father.</span> <span id="s847">There was also a sister named Kaita and the -- my cousin Heinz that I’ve been talking about, is her son.</span> <span id="s848">So that’s the -- that the -- the combination.</span> <span id="s849">Kaita was 10 years older than my father.</span> <span id="s850">So that’s quite a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s851">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: And so, I’ve been trying to find out, you know, how old, actually, my grandfather was and my great-grandfa -- and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s853">My grandmother I only knew as a black dressed very old lady, with a very high hat, with -- with a black sort of drape coming off of it -- veil, sort of, coming off of it.</span> <span id="s854">She knit a lot of things for me, I remember that, having little dresses that she knit and -- and having scarves and things that she knit.</span> <span id="s855">And -- can you turn it off for a minute?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">A: The -- the sad thing is that I don’t know much about this grandfather.</span> <span id="s858">His -- his name was Benno -- Benjamin Leiderman.</span> <span id="s859">And I understand that his father too -- I think his father -- my great-grandfather -- my great-grandfather had been a teacher in Hirschbeck.</span> <span id="s860">So that’s already, you know, quite a few generations that they lived there.</span> <span id="s861">They ha-had a wonderful house, which I remember, a really old-fashioned German tall house.</span> <span id="s862">And my grandmother -- at the time she was quite old and she had a stiff leg, which has worried me all my life, because I keep thinking, “Oh, I’m going to get the same thing that she had.”</span> <span id="s863">Which I don’t remember quite well what it was, but I know that they s -- made one of her legs stiff, because that was probably easier on her than -- than whatever she had, you know?</span> <span id="s864">They didn’t have so many medical things as they have now.</span> <span id="s865">She always had somebody who lived with her and I know that in 19 -- during the time -- when Germany had it’s -- it’s bank breakdown, you know, which was earlier than the United States.</span> <span id="s866">I guess United States was ‘29 --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">A: When -- we -- yeah, this was earlier -- that she lost the house.</span> <span id="s869">And I know that my father and his sister rented the house, from the person who -- who bought it, for my grandmother, so she never knew that she had lost that house.</span> <span id="s870">Because they didn’t want her to -- you know, I mean those were terrible days.</span> <span id="s871">My father was -- was studying in Breslau, I think he was in Breslau.</span> <span id="s872">Actually, he wasn’t studying, he was interning in Breslau at the time.</span> <span id="s873">And he was telling me these stories about how he would get paid at the end of the week and -- and he would get an -- a paper bag full of money and he would run to the store and buy whatever he could buy, you know, in food and things, because if you waited at all, for a minute, that whole bag might buy you one little wurst, you know.</span> <span id="s874">That’s how the money went down, I mean, the money was just worth nothing in Germany.</span> <span id="s875">And -- and I forget now when that -- when that was, ‘22?</span> <span id="s876">‘20?</span> <span id="s877">So it -- it was earlier than -- than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: It was before he got married, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: And how -- and how --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: And he got -- he got married in ‘24.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">Q: And he -- he -- his mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s883">A: His mother?</span> <span id="s884">Okay.</span> <span id="s885">That grandmother that I’m telling you about --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: -- with the stiff leg --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s889">A: Her name was -- was Lutcia -- Lutcia -- Lutcia Schachtel.</span> <span id="s890">Her name was Schachtel -- a schachtel -- ein schachtel is a box, you know.</span> <span id="s891">You carry a box of groceries.</span> <span id="s892">This is ein schachtel, it’s a bo -- a carton, actually -- a carton.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: How do you -- how do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: S-c-h-a-c-h-t-e-l.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Schachtel.</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: Almost like a satchel.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah, sa -- well --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: Not quite.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: It’s a carton.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">A: A carton of one thing or another.</span> <span id="s903">But that was -- that was her name and I don’t know anything about her family.</span> <span id="s904">I don’t know if she had any siblings or -- or anything at all.</span> <span id="s905">It’s really strange how little I know.</span> <span id="s906">So, from that side of the family, my Aunt Kaita, my -- hers -- my father’s sister married somebody -- they lived in Posen, and Posen -- I used to know the Polish name of it -- but in Posen -- Posen also kept changing from Germany to Poland, from ger -- and it -- they moved each time, they stayed in Germany.</span> <span id="s907">Whatever -- whatever was German, you know, they stayed in.</span> <span id="s908">But -- and she had one son, I think and that’s was my Uncle Heinz -- my cousin Heinz.</span> <span id="s909">I called him uncle because he was so much older than -- his mo -- he was my mother’s age.</span> <span id="s910">And my father was sort of a father to Heinz, because her -- my Aunt Kaita’s husband died very young.</span> <span id="s911">So this Uncle Heinz had two sons and I am in contact with both of those.</span> <span id="s912">So they lived --</span></p> <p><span id="s913">Q: Wh-Where do they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: Ray -- Ray -- doc -- he is -- he is actually the same as my husband, he is a scientist in -- but he lives in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s915">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: And what’s his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Raymond Ca-Camphor.</span> <span id="s918">Raymond Camphor.</span> <span id="s919">He’s a Ph.D. and is doing quite well -- very well.</span> <span id="s920">And he’s married to Miep and Miep is a doctor so they -- they’re -- they’re managing.</span> <span id="s921">And they have three kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: Now how old -- how old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: So I’m in contact with them -- hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: How old is he?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Raymond?</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: He’s -- he’s maybe 10 years younger than I -- well no, more then 10 years.</span> <span id="s928">Maybe 15 years younger than I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s931">So he’s still working hard.</span> <span id="s932">And my Aunt Ava, Heinz’s wife, just died.</span> <span id="s933">She was 82 and she just -- she lived in Holland -- she lived in amst -- in the Hague and I was very fond of her.</span> <span id="s934">She was really the nearest relation in the sense that she had the German as well as the Dutch experience, the same as I had.</span> <span id="s935">And I remember her coming to Holland.</span> <span id="s936">Heinz came earlier and he went back to Berlin and married her and brought her and I remember her coming, the day that she came.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: In 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s940">Now this is --</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: We were th -- we were there in ‘33 and she came in ‘36, but Heinz had already been there since ‘33.</span> <span id="s942">He came -- he was very close to us, because my father was sort of his best friend and his father, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Now, in the previous interview, you mentioned -- I’m -- this is -- I just wanted to double check this, because -- yeah, it says your Uncle Hei -- well, see it’s -- first of all I should just note that it’s -- it’s written wrong in the transcript --</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">Q: -- it’s spelled Hans.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: And it’s Heinz.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Heinz.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: It’s H-e-i-n-z?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Okay, instead of H-a-n-s.</span> <span id="s952">And you said Ha-Heinz and Ava, who had a bagel -- the baby did go underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: My father was just so upset because he said if they ever find him, they will be punished more than the Jews are already punished.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: At the time they thought all Jews would go to the labor camp and just work.</span> <span id="s957">Heinz was his favorite cousin, he was worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: Do you want their story?</span> <span id="s960">And then she said no.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: That’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: So I -- I want --</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: That’s what I told you about this morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: I would like to hear the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: You would like to hear the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Yes, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s968">I hope I don’t make mistakes in them, but -- because I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s969">The story was that -- that Heinz and Ava were still able to bring all their things from Germany, so they had beautiful furniture and lovely silver.</span> <span id="s970">Ava came from a very, very well-to-do family.</span> <span id="s971">And it was her brother with whom I went out in London and who saved his coupons for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Ava’s brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Ava’s brother, Gunther.</span> <span id="s974">His name was Gunther.</span> <span id="s975">She had two brothers, they both were in England.</span> <span id="s976">And okay, so Ava and Heinz lived in the Hague and it was very interesting, because Heinz worked for a German company in Berlin and that German company, when they saw things were getting tight for the Jews, sent him to Holland and he worked in Holland for this same company.</span> <span id="s977">And believe it or not, after the war, he worked for that same company, in Holland.</span> <span id="s978">And he became a vice president and had a wonderful life.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: What kind of company was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: It was -- it had something to do with iron and smelting and metal and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s981">He traveled all over the world and was a great collector of oriental art, mostly Japanese.</span> <span id="s982">And after he retired, he became extremely well known because he -- there’s a small group of collectors all over the world, of these particular things that he was collecting.</span> <span id="s983">And he wrote many articles in the -- their papers and in their -- in their journals and magazines and that was the interesting thing about that side also, of the family, how very artistic -- how very internationally artistic they were.</span> <span id="s984">They all were like that -- I ver -- it was really amazing because Ray -- th-the son, who lives in Israel, he’s also like that, he’s also collecting and he’s also, you know, very interested in history and in -- in -- in that whole oriental art.</span> <span id="s985">And I remember Heinz coming to visit in -- in Washington, when we still lived up there in -- in -- at Chevy Chase and he went to the Freer gallery the director knew him, you know?</span> <span id="s986">The head of the gallery knew him -- his name, anyway and he took him down into the stacks and he saw -- my hus -- Marty went with him -- my husband Martin went with him and so he told me how they saw things that was never -- you know, that was never, or hardly ever displayed, because the Freer never had enough gallery space to display.</span> <span id="s987">No museum really has everything that they have.</span> <span id="s988">So Heinz was qu -- he made quite a second life for himself after he retired.</span> <span id="s989">Okay, what happened to them in the war was that they had friends who helped them go underground and who also took all their things and hid -- with them and kept it for them.</span> <span id="s990">And Heinz and Ava were underground with a farmer, who had a big farm somewhere in -- in Holland.</span> <span id="s991">And they could not keep Ray with them.</span> <span id="s992">Ray was only year and a half, or two -- something like that and they had to hide Ray.</span> <span id="s993">Now Ray was very Jewish looking, different from them, actually.</span> <span id="s994">Heinz looked a bit like you and Ava was -- you couldn’t tell what she was.</span> <span id="s995">So, but -- but Ray had quite, you know, he had a definite kind of darkness, which in Holland you don’t see much.</span> <span id="s996">And he was hard to hide and he was very little.</span> <span id="s997">And so, somehow the underground managed to hide him and just recently -- I thought -- I thought that he’d only been in one place the whole time.</span> <span id="s998">But just recently Ray told me that he was in many places, that he was handed around, you know, in many places.</span> <span id="s999">And that he felt -- was -- really had a terrible time, til the very end, the last people ended up being absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s1000">And he’s still in touch with them and he still ta -- you know, he -- he -- when their children come over here, he takes care of them.</span> <span id="s1001">I’m -- I don’t mean over here, when they ever come to Israel.</span> <span id="s1002">The Dutch like to go to Israel, so they do come.</span> <span id="s1003">And when he goes to Holland, he always visits that family.</span> <span id="s1004">And it was most amazing how close they really had gotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: How long did he live with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: But he was such a little -- I mean, h -- pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: How long did he live with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Well, I don’t know, exactly.</span> <span id="s1009">Must have been the last year -- the -- the last year, but he said that -- that in one place, the people hated him.</span> <span id="s1010">I mean, they were so awful that they burned him with cigarette burns and -- and all sorts of -- you know, he just had a terrible time.</span> <span id="s1011">I have heard that in Holland, people were really wonderful.</span> <span id="s1012">The ones I met were all wonderful, you know.</span> <span id="s1013">But I’ve heard that there were really quite difficult thing -- for instance, the mayor of Amsterdam, he -- he wrote an article and he describe -- he was in 10 different places, he -- he was handed from one place, he couldn’t get along -- you know, he was already a little older, so he had ideas.</span> <span id="s1014">And in this one family, where he was -- I’m talking about the mayor of Amsterdam, the -- the ex-mayor of Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1015">It was his birthday and they didn’t say anything about his birthday, and he knew that they knew it was his birthday.</span> <span id="s1016">And it happened to be that in their religion, you don’t make a fuss about anybody’s birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: What religion is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Well, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1019">But it -- but that was in their -- in their particular brand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: And so he couldn’t -- he was a little boy, you know, and he couldn’t keep his mouth closed, he says, “It’s my birthday.</span> <span id="s1022">You didn’t say anything.”</span> <span id="s1023">And they were so angry at him.</span> <span id="s1024">They were so terribly angry and he was already so lost and so -- you know, he -- this all came out when that hidden child business -- he was one of the hidden children.</span> <span id="s1025">And he really had, also, it -- it was the first time that I realized what happened to some of those children.</span> <span id="s1026">They were much worse off than I. I mean, you know, I was the perfect age, I described that off the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: It -- but the hidden children, oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: So you mentioned that, yeah, yesterday, you know, that in -- basically in her -- her -- I think in the general theories of -- of -- of child upbringing, that many of the children who had gotten beyond a certain age, I’m not sure, maybe five, that they had previously had such warm and nurturing families --</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: -- that it prepared them to put up with this nightmare and also that they -- that those children had -- what was done to them was done to their whole family and not -- was not an internal problem within the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Which made it easier -- you know, so you didn’t have the same kind of emotional effect.</span> <span id="s1034">But what you’re describing are children who are even younger than that, who have to go through that critical period of nurturing in a very roller-coaster kind of experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Well, I -- I -- that’s very interesting, because Ray -- when r -- when the war was finished and Ray got back to his parents, it was extremely hard.</span> <span id="s1036">I mean the --I -- he must have realized that these were really his parents, you know?</span> <span id="s1037">But I think he was afraid.</span> <span id="s1038">He never -- he didn’t have a very nice youth.</span> <span id="s1039">Another thing was, that for Ray’s generation, there were really no Jewish kids, or very, very few Jewish kids his age alive.</span> <span id="s1040">Th-There weren’t any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Where did he spend the rest of his childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Well, in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: In Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: In amste -- in, sorry, no, in the Hague.</span> <span id="s1045">And he was extremely careful and -- and a bit worried always.</span> <span id="s1046">And then he looked so Jewish and -- and there weren’t anybody else around that looked like him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: And you say he has a brother, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: Now, he has a brother.</span> <span id="s1049">Now let’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Who was born when?</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">A: ‘46.</span> <span id="s1052">The year after the war ended.</span> <span id="s1053">The guy has been a meteor.</span> <span id="s1054">I mean, he shot up, you know.</span> <span id="s1055">He was beautiful, he was tall.</span> <span id="s1056">He looks like Prince Charles, exactly.</span> <span id="s1057">Handsomer, I mean.</span> <span id="s1058">He’s younger.</span> <span id="s1059">And he -- he had millions of friends.</span> <span id="s1060">He was easy going.</span> <span id="s1061">He knew, in short, from nothing, you know?</span> <span id="s1062">From -- he knew nothing of what Ray went through and his depth of experience, and -- anyway, Ray has a lot more soul than -- than -- than Steve has.</span> <span id="s1063">You know, it’s built in, one way or the other.</span> <span id="s1064">And he’s doing -- he married somebody who wasn’t Jewish, whereas Ray -- in Holland, as I said, there were so few Jewish people.</span> <span id="s1065">So what they did was, they got the young generation together once or twice or three times a year, in a particular place.</span> <span id="s1066">The Jewish people got together and organized that so the kids could meet each other.</span> <span id="s1067">That’s how he met his wife.</span> <span id="s1068">He met his wife somewhere in Utrect or somewhere where one -- where that meeting was.</span> <span id="s1069">Because, where he lived, there weren’t enough to even choose from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: And Steven?</span> <span id="s1071">Where does he live now and what does he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: Well, Steven lives in London, but he has a house in Connecticut and he has a house outside of -- of London, in the countryside.</span> <span id="s1073">He is a stockbroker.</span> <span id="s1074">He is extremely well off.</span> <span id="s1075">He married a beautiful non-Jewish Dutch girl and they have three gorgeous sons.</span> <span id="s1076">I mean, it seems like the sun is shining, you know, wherever he goes.</span> <span id="s1077">And when Tante Ava died and there was a lot of the art work, that -- the art articles that Uncle Heinz collected, you know -- Steven wouldn’t give up anything, I -- you know?</span> <span id="s1078">I mean, to -- Ray lives in -- lives in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1079">He -- he is the head of a huge -- of a nice department at one of the universities.</span> <span id="s1080">He is very successful in his work, but you know, he makes no money hardly at all.</span> <span id="s1081">I mean, he should have, you know -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s1083">This is tape number two, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">A: He is a stockbroker.</span> <span id="s1085">He is extremely well off.</span> <span id="s1086">He married a beautiful non-Jewish Dutch girl and they have three gorgeous sons.</span> <span id="s1087">I mean, it seems like the sun is shining, you know, wherever he goes.</span> <span id="s1088">And when Tante Ava died and there was a lot of the art work, that -- the art articles that Uncle Heinz collected, you know -- Steven wouldn’t give up anything, I -- you know?</span> <span id="s1089">I mean, t-to -- Ray lives in -- lives in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1090">He -- he is the head of a huge -- of a nice department at one of the universities.</span> <span id="s1091">He is very successful in his work, but you know, he makes no money hardly at all.</span> <span id="s1092">I mean, he should have, you know, I mean, if I had been Steven, I would have said, “Take it -- you know, it’s yours.”</span> <span id="s1093">Uh-uh.</span> <span id="s1094">And so d -- it’s very different kind of -- I love Steven, he’s great, but you know, nothing -- you know, I can understand Ray’s resentment and he has it, he has resentment.</span> <span id="s1095">He thinks, “Look what I go -- wen-went through.</span> <span id="s1096">Look what hap --” you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: And -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1099">It’s -- it’s -- it’s -- that is a typical story.</span> <span id="s1100">Anyway, let me tell you what happened to Heinz and -- Heinz and Ava and -- themselves, so I told you about Ray.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Okay, then we’ll get back to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: Heinz and Ava went underground with this farmer.</span> <span id="s1103">And the underground had a rule that if you took in people to hide them, you weren’t supposed to do anything else under -- you know, under kind of illegal work or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: But this farmer had a son and this son -- and they had a lot of land.</span> <span id="s1106">And the son permitted the British to drop weapons, in big wooden crates, for the underground, on his land.</span> <span id="s1107">And some other things, you know, that -- anyway the son got found out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: I was going to say, that must have been pretty dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Oho, that’s an understatement.</span> <span id="s1110">So -- so one day the Germans appeared.</span> <span id="s1111">They -- they had -- they had been given away or they had -- they weren’t looking for Ava and Heinz, they weren’t looking for underground people, they were looking for weapons that had been, you know, dropped from the sky or hidden there in the barns.</span> <span id="s1112">And when that happened, they -- they were warned and Ava -- they -- o-or if they weren’t warned, Ava was -- they picked up all the men.</span> <span id="s1113">They picked up Heinz, they picked up the farmer and his son and you know, whoever else they picked up there, but not the women, they left the women.</span> <span id="s1114">So, Ava was -- the underground came, took Ava and hid her somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1115">They hid her with a farmer in the south of Holland, in -- in Zout, Holland and Heinz they took to Westerbork, which was the collection camp, before you went to the east.</span> <span id="s1116">And in that collection camp, there was a friend of his named Otto Bierman -- Otto Bierman.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: How -- how do you spell that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: B-i-e-r-m-a-n.</span> <span id="s1119">Otto Bierman and Otto was a very intelligent man and he had convinced the head of the camp of Westerbork that he could produce something that would make him -- this -- this head of the camp -- ingratiate him with -- with Hitler and his upper -- the upper echelons.</span> <span id="s1120">He said -- and -- and the man -- an-and he said, “Well, what would that be?”</span> <span id="s1121">And he said, “You know, what is it that the German weremarkt really needs?</span> <span id="s1122">One of the things it needs is toothpaste.”</span> <span id="s1123">Now Otto Bierman was a chemist and so the -- the commandant said, “That’s a good idea, can you get it together?”</span> <span id="s1124">And you know, and, “What do you need, you know, to do this?”</span> <span id="s1125">And Otto gave him a list and this and that and -- and he said, “Well, I will need so many people to do this, to produce whatever you need, which is quite a bit.”</span> <span id="s1126">So I forget how many people it was, but one of them was Heinz and that saved his life, because he was still there after the commandant was gone, you know, at -- at the -- when -- when the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Making toothpaste?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: Making toothpaste.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: We-Were they making it for the whole army?</span> <span id="s1130">The whole Germany army?</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1132">Well, whatever they could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Or -- yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: You know, they made as many as is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: So that Bierman really -- he, later on, Bierman and his wife, actually, who -- whom he met in the camp, who was the sist -- the reason I know Bierman so well is because he was the sister -- he married the sister of Maria Austria, who was my photography teacher.</span> <span id="s1137">The one who lived the same place Anne Frank lived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: So, it’s all sort of interwoven.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: In that small community.</span> <span id="s1142">And they then raised two children, who belonged to her brother, who had been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: Who -- who raised the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: The Biermans.</span> <span id="s1145">So Otto and -- and Li -- and Liese raised the children of her brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Her brother and sister died of illness in ca -- in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s1148">And but -- and the girls had been with them in Bergen-Belsen, but survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: And where are they now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: In Amsterdam.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: I see them all the ti -- whenever I go, I see them, yeah.</span> <span id="s1153">We’re pretty close, actually.</span> <span id="s1154">One of them just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: So they -- and the relationship was with -- with Bierman was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: Bierman married Lisa -- Elise Ershtrasher -- Liesel Ershtrasher and Liesel Ershtrasher was the sister of Maria Austria.</span> <span id="s1157">Ershtrasher -- Austria, it’s the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: Who was my photography teacher and a friend of my mother’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Really?</span> <span id="s1161">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: And who lived on the Mawaydaplane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Next -- actually the next stoop from Anne Frank -- the next --</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">Q: And they were -- and he -- they were -- they were -- previously they were good friends with Heinz?</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">A: This Bierman saved Heinz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: But did he know Heinz from before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: He must have.</span> <span id="s1169">He must have.</span> <span id="s1170">I don’t know about that, but I think he must have.</span> <span id="s1171">Because he asked for him.</span> <span id="s1172">Because Heinz of course, he was in a Straffbabacker, which means in one of the punishment barracks.</span> <span id="s1173">One of the barracks that had an S on it for punishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: What -- I wanted to ask you a question, when you -- when we -- when the very beginning, when we first started to talk today, you were talking about your friend Manfred.</span> <span id="s1175">Could you tell -- I -- I don’t know if you can, but can you talk a little bit about what it’s like to -- to have someone like that in your life, who had -- who was so responsible for saving your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: I don’t know how to -- to -- I met Manfred -- this is rather interesting.</span> <span id="s1177">I -- I told you I know nothing about politics.</span> <span id="s1178">Here I am 16 years old and I describe in the other tape how when you were 16, you were considered a family on your own and you needed your own stamp of -- of security, so you wouldn’t be taken away.</span> <span id="s1179">Th-The Franks went, for instance, Otto Frank, the Franks went underground when Margot got called up to be sent to so-called work camps, right?</span> <span id="s1180">Well, to avoid that situation, to not be called up, you needed to work in something that the Germans considered essential.</span> <span id="s1181">Up to 16 years, your father or mother, whoever in your family worked for one of those organizations, like the Jewish -- the Yoteserrat, th -- some kind of organizations that the Germans recognized as necessary.</span> <span id="s1182">Do you get that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: Yeah, but what were they -- what were they -- what was this --</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: So -- well, my father, for instance, had one of those stamps, he was a translator for the Yoteserrat, for the Jewish organization that really oversaw the shipping off -- the organized shipping off of the Jews to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: So they were necessary to the German shipping -- help in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">Q: -- the deportations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1189">So -- but that’s not what the Germans told him they were doing, you know, that -- the Germans told them that they were helping their own people and things like that, you know they -- so -- and they would re -- that -- that they would remain after everybody else was gone and this and that, which is all nonsense, because everybody went.</span> <span id="s1190">But this -- this is hindsight.</span> <span id="s1191">You know, it’s very stran -- it’s very different to look at something from the historical point of view --</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: -- than when you’re in it, you don’t know what’s going to -- what the future will hold.</span> <span id="s1194">So -- what were we saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: I -- well, I was asking you about what it’s like to have somebody who saved your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">A: Oh, yeah, but how did I get to the Yoteserrat?</span> <span id="s1197">Oh, there was an organization in ea -- in the east of Amsterdam, which was called -- and I have na -- now I -- totally escape.</span> <span id="s1198">It was called Hershelsander -- Hershelsander.</span> <span id="s1199">And it was supposed to be a culture -- Jewish cultural organization that would train Jews to be ready to go to Israel or some other country so that they could have a craft or a -- a profession that they could use.</span> <span id="s1200">It’s one of those hoax, nonsense, idiotic things that the Germans thought up.</span> <span id="s1201">And that organization, it so happened, there were lots of Communists in it.</span> <span id="s1202">There were lots of people that -- that had -- maybe they weren’t really Communists, but they had a political opinion.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: And they knew about things before they happened, you know?</span> <span id="s1205">And th-they had some kind of a view.</span> <span id="s1206">They had some people that came from Germany, for instance, out of the camps, the early camps, you know, in ‘40 -- in -- in ‘39, ‘40, who told stories about what was really happening in Germany, what -- what wasn’t written in the press.</span> <span id="s1207">And these people were knowledgeable and one of them was Manfred.</span> <span id="s1208">I didn’t know anything about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: I met -- my father managed to get me a place to work in that particular organization.</span> <span id="s1211">He didn’t -- also knew nothing about them.</span> <span id="s1212">He only knew that that was one place where he could get a secure place for me, becoming 16 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: So I went there.</span> <span id="s1215">What did we do?</span> <span id="s1216">We organized courses -- for instance sewing, cooking, garde-gardening, I guess.</span> <span id="s1217">I mean se -- landscape -- land -- lundbow as they called it.</span> <span id="s1218">You know, something to do with the earth, agriculture -- agriculture.</span> <span id="s1219">However, we also had courses on Molière and Shakespeare.</span> <span id="s1220">Well, in the course on Molière, I met Manfred.</span> <span id="s1221">I -- I was working there and he was working there -- or he came there to take a course, I can’t remember, maybe he wasn’t even working there, but he knew the people.</span> <span id="s1222">I didn’t know the people, but he knew the people that were working there.</span> <span id="s1223">This was an organization that really had been there before and was doing the same sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1224">It had to do with the Allia, you know, the -- the s -- the people who were just wanting to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1225">I guess Zionists or something, although these people were no Zionists.</span> <span id="s1226">But -- but they were training -- this organization had been there before and the Germans just took it over and used it as what I described, an organization [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1227">So what I did was draw up the names of the people who wanted to take the courses, make up schedules for courses.</span> <span id="s1228">Get the prou -- help get the professors for the courses and that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s1229">You know, that’s was my job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: Had nothing to do with anything for the German.</span> <span id="s1232">So anyway, I met Manfred in there.</span> <span id="s1233">And I was 16 - 17, I’d never had a boyfriend, never gone out, never anything.</span> <span id="s1234">You couldn’t ride the trolleys, you couldn’t ride the bus, you had to walk.</span> <span id="s1235">So -- being Jewish -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Jews weren’t allowed to ride on the bus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No.</span> <span id="s1238">No -- no trolley, no bus, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1239">So I had -- we had the yellow star and maybe I had a bicycle, I -- I can’t remember.</span> <span id="s1240">We -- we could bike for a long time, but then -- then we couldn’t even bike any more.</span> <span id="s1241">So Manfred and I started -- I mean I started walking home or riding bike home or whatever it was, I can’t remember details.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1243">You tell some of this [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: And we’d started getting together, you know, doing that and I got to meet him and I really liked him and he really liked me and so that was my first boyfriend.</span> <span id="s1245">And that’s how I got involved with this whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: And he knew more than I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q: I understand that, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">A: And he started telling me all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">A: And he’s -- I -- I -- I s-suddenly started seeing beyond my parents.</span> <span id="s1252">My father said, “If you get called up, you have to go, because oth-otherwise we will get punished.”</span> <span id="s1253">It’s different from -- from Margot Frank, you know, where her father said, “If you get called up, we -- we go underground.”</span> <span id="s1254">My father was -- at the time, he was -- he was born in 1889, so in four -- in -- in ‘41, how old was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: 52?</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1257">He was getting on.</span> <span id="s1258">And he -- he had already had to make or that -- that move from Germany to Holland, it was too much for him, he couldn’t do another one.</span> <span id="s1259">And he knew he couldn’t do another one.</span> <span id="s1260">And when my mother, who was so much younger, started to talk about going underground, he couldn’t face it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">A: So that was the -- the situation.</span> <span id="s1263">And so Manfred started talking about all these things and my eyes -- my head, you know.</span> <span id="s1264">And so I -- I started believing him, I started looking at things through his eyes and through -- I saw things I had never seen before.</span> <span id="s1265">You know, I saw people going on trains with singing and Manfred said that they get killed.</span> <span id="s1266">And they said they were going to go to work, and sit around a campfire at night.</span> <span id="s1267">And, as difficult as it was, I started to believe him.</span> <span id="s1268">It didn’t seem likely, you know, what they were telling me.</span> <span id="s1269">And people -- young -- other young people started coming and telling me stories and saying, “I don’t want to die.”</span> <span id="s1270">I remember my -- one girlfriend, Zucker, her name was -- her last name was Zucker, with a Z, you know, like sugar, in German.</span> <span id="s1271">She came to me and she -- she said -- she sat there crying in my room, I can see her, you know, a little woman -- little girl, 16.</span> <span id="s1272">Said, “I don’t want to die, I don’t want to die.”</span> <span id="s1273">I didn’t even think -- I never did think of dying and I didn’t then.</span> <span id="s1274">I don’t know, they were taken away.</span> <span id="s1275">I -- I don’t know if she survived, or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: My question was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: How did you f --</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: -- probably hard -- harder to answer, but I’m just curious what it’s like since the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Oh, since the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: After the war.</span> <span id="s1281">What is it like to have people in your life -- I mean, obviously -- I mean it’s a -- it’s a different experience, okay?</span> <span id="s1282">It’s something that in -- like I -- I -- I don’t think -- I mean other than my parents, I don’t think that there are people in my life who have saved my life, to whom I have this eternal debt, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: Yeah, well.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: I saved somebody’s life, a stranger’s life once in a swimming pool, somebody who was drowning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: And I just remem -- he didn’t even, you know, it’s like I never kept in touch with him or anything, but it was a mom -- but it’s not -- it’s not --</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">A: But we lived together -- I mean we lived together in a group.</span> <span id="s1288">We lived together for years, after all.</span> <span id="s1289">And it is strange, and I’ve seen it in other tight situations.</span> <span id="s1290">When the war was over -- now, from a personal point of view, toward the end of the war, I knew I was not going to marry Manfred and we were talking about marria -- he want -- he wanted to get married and I knew I couldn’t marry him.</span> <span id="s1291">And it had partly to do with the fact that he kept telling me that my father had killed my family.</span> <span id="s1292">And what he meant was that he didn’t want to go underground.</span> <span id="s1293">My father -- Manfred offered -- he -- he offered the papers and my mother said -- got -- got him the money.</span> <span id="s1294">My mother had the papers.</span> <span id="s1295">Manfred said even if she hadn’t paid, he would have gotten the papers, because he could not -- he would have had a bad conscience all his life, he wouldn’t have done for them what he did for me, you know.</span> <span id="s1296">Although I didn’t get my first papers through Manfred.</span> <span id="s1297">I got my first false papers through other people.</span> <span id="s1298">But my mother gave me the money for it.</span> <span id="s1299">And she had to ask my father for the money and my father did not believe in this.</span> <span id="s1300">But my mother put her foot down.</span> <span id="s1301">And she didn’t do that very often.</span> <span id="s1302">She became the strength of the whole family.</span> <span id="s1303">And she loved Manfred.</span> <span id="s1304">And she kept telling me, “Stick with him, he is strong, he is true.</span> <span id="s1305">He -- stick with him, stick with him.”</span> <span id="s1306">And my sister loved him.</span> <span id="s1307">She was younger than I was and she kept saying how wonderful he was.</span> <span id="s1308">And I was worried about him.</span> <span id="s1309">But he -- he was wonderful and he did save my life, but I never really thought about that til way afterwards.</span> <span id="s1310">I mean, when you live your life, you live your life.</span> <span id="s1311">And I did the cooking and I did the cleaning and I worked very hard, so did he -- I mean so did we all, so did his sister, who turned out to be as important -- maybe not more important than he was.</span> <span id="s1312">He -- after the war, as I said, I -- I knew I wasn’t going to marry him and we split up.</span> <span id="s1313">I lived -- went to live somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1314">I had met Otmar through Manfred, really.</span> <span id="s1315">And although I wasn’t sure there was any future in there, I lived by myse -- I went and got an apartment somewhere else, which was great luck that I could even find anything after the war.</span> <span id="s1316">And then of course, my Uncle Paul came back and Heinz came back and they were the two anchors, you know, that I had, even though they were so busy with themselves, you can’t imagine.</span> <span id="s1317">After having all this happening to you, that to try to pick up the normal strand of normal life was not easy for people who had families and for anybody else as well.</span> <span id="s1318">And I went, immediately, I was already in the ballet the month before the war was ended, I immediately went into the ballet, which took all my mind and all my strength.</span> <span id="s1319">We hadn’t had any food.</span> <span id="s1320">And to work as hard physically as I had to work, took all I had and a bit more, you know?</span> <span id="s1321">We started to have a little bit better food.</span> <span id="s1322">It took a long time for the food to come in.</span> <span id="s1323">And although I had not been as hungry as most people had for as long -- because in the end we were very hungry, I still was really underfed.</span> <span id="s1324">And I’ve heard it said that my generation of dancers, did not last physically as long as most generations last.</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">A: I mean that -- yes, that was a phenomenon of -- of the times, yeah.</span> <span id="s1327">So, as I say, I went and lived somewhere else and -- and Manfred, he was unhappy, but he soon, you know, found -- he also felt he had to go on with his life and he had -- and he found somebody else and he had two children.</span> <span id="s1328">And although the marriage didn’t last, you know, very long and Manfred started messing around.</span> <span id="s1329">He’s always told me, he said, “It’s all your fault.”</span> <span id="s1330">He -- every time he sees me, he says this, “It’s all your fault.”</span> <span id="s1331">He’s been married several times, three, four.</span> <span id="s1332">So -- so, but the last 20 years he’s had the same wife, much younger and very nice and I stayed with them last year.</span> <span id="s1333">I h -- I stayed with them and it was funny, you know, the first and the last of his wives -- the so-called wives.</span> <span id="s1334">We had a lot of fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1336">Wh -- and what was his -- what became his profession?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Well he -- even before the war was over, he knew what he w-wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1338">He wanted to start a factory of women’s clothing.</span> <span id="s1339">And he started collecting sewing machines.</span> <span id="s1340">Now I had one and that was the first one.</span> <span id="s1341">Yeah, I had one from my mo-mother and that was the first one.</span> <span id="s1342">It wasn’t electrified and he got a motor and -- but he -- he found -- he bought -- he went around looking for sewing machines, even before the war was quite, quite over.</span> <span id="s1343">And he knew that he was -- wanted to -- wanted to do that.</span> <span id="s1344">And he knew where there was a -- a cache -- I mean a number of -- a cloth that was difficult, you know, to find.</span> <span id="s1345">There wasn’t any material, there was no cloth.</span> <span id="s1346">And this se -- first wife he married, Maurecia, she had been in that business and she knew how to do it.</span> <span id="s1347">And she was a great help to him.</span> <span id="s1348">That was part of their getting together, because she -- she was really knowledgeable in that.</span> <span id="s1349">And she also -- because she had lost a great deal -- I forget what -- what she had lost, but she got at some money and she got some money from the government -- from the amer -- Dutch government as well as the ger -- I -- I can’t remember, but she got a lot of -- she got some money and he needed the money.</span> <span id="s1350">We did strange things, you know.</span> <span id="s1351">After the war, they had money left over, my -- Manfred, I don’t know what he did, but there was money.</span> <span id="s1352">Now, there was no way to explain this money.</span> <span id="s1353">And I -- I don’t know why, I don’t know anything about it.</span> <span id="s1354">But the only one who could have had some money was me, you know, because I -- I could have s -- you know, I could have had some money from my parents, from jewelry that was sold, or this or that.</span> <span id="s1355">And so you had to take in this money and get the new money that -- the current money that they were putting out.</span> <span id="s1356">And so I did that for them, even though we weren’t together any more.</span> <span id="s1357">So I -- I kept in touch and I did -- you know, I went there and I s-signed saying this was my money and you know, stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">Q: Hold on one second, I want to change the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1359">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s1361">This is tape number three, side A.</span> <span id="s1362">This is the beginning of that tape number two, August fifth, 1998 interview with Barbara Rodbell, with Steve Roland.</span> <span id="s1363">[inaudible] the majority households who didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s1364">And he said, and those people you can more or less forgive, because had they done something, they would have been putting themselves or their families at risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: The same in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Same in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: And he said and then you have those few Poles who were extraordinary heroes.</span> <span id="s1369">Who -- Poles who did not have to do anything, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: -- went out of their way and they -- they did things.</span> <span id="s1372">And those people are extraordinary and then you have the other ones, who were evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: The bad -- evil.</span> <span id="s1374">Pure and simple.</span> <span id="s1375">And often have to do, I think, that often has to do with this terrific feeling of inferiority.</span> <span id="s1376">And -- or uselessness, don’t know what the hell to do with themselves, nothing but brawn, no brain, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: And -- and this resentment, this terrible resentment against those who have made it and then they’re very apt to -- to generalize in an enormous way, you know?</span> <span id="s1379">So that -- that is it.</span> <span id="s1380">If it’s not the garbagemen, it’s them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: I think it’s -- want to stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">Q: Yeah…</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Yeah, well.</span> <span id="s1385">What I was saying was about the compartmentalization.</span> <span id="s1386">I -- I sometimes worry about myself, that I -- I am too cool about things.</span> <span id="s1387">Too -- I look ahead, I -- I try to plan and get myself ready for what comes next.</span> <span id="s1388">And what I -- I think I’ve always been like that, but it might be just in my older age, you know, that I’m that way, because I’ve gotten older.</span> <span id="s1389">But I’m so enormously prag -- I don’t know if it’s pragmatic, or -- if that’s what you call pragmatic.</span> <span id="s1390">I’m very practical.</span> <span id="s1391">I can get -- I can get past my moods, past my -- I can get past feelings, by being pragmatic, you know.</span> <span id="s1392">It’s a -- the feelings come afterwards, first you do something and then -- it’s just funny, my father used to say, first your duty and then your pleasure.</span> <span id="s1393">And I think that that stuck with me.</span> <span id="s1394">It’s very German, you know.</span> <span id="s1395">And I definitely, you know, I ha -- do first what I have to do and then I can let myself go, you know, I can also let myself go, but I don’t do that before I do what I have to do.</span> <span id="s1396">It’s very strange.</span> <span id="s1397">It’s very strange, I -- I remember when I came to United States, you know, I had no money at all.</span> <span id="s1398">Once I left New York, once I decided I could not really make a living dancing or in photography or something like that and I thought I had to leave New York, because that’s what I did in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: How long did you -- did you stay in New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Nearly two years, not quite.</span> <span id="s1401">Nearly two years.</span> <span id="s1402">And -- and part of that time, I wasn’t there, I was other places.</span> <span id="s1403">I was in the -- you know, I took jobs out of New York, because I did get into thr -- I did three auditions and I got into each one of the shows that I auditioned for.</span> <span id="s1404">And one of them was the Ballet Rousse, with Danilova -- or Danilova.</span> <span id="s1405">And I couldn’t -- when I went to sign the contract, I couldn’t do it, because they didn’t pay me enough to pay the rent and to buy my shoes and to eat.</span> <span id="s1406">So, I didn’t sign for it.</span> <span id="s1407">So I ended up -- and in the other shows that I tried for and I got chosen for each one I tried, there was either the star dropped out and they couldn’t raise all the money that they needed, or something else happened, some contract fell through or some kind -- some of them I even started rehearsing and we had to stop because something happened with the finances or something like that.</span> <span id="s1408">So in the end, I had no -- very, very little money and I’d worked at Macy’s and I’d worked at -- you know, what actors and dancers do during -- in New York, during the -- while they’re looking for a job.</span> <span id="s1409">I’d done all that and I decided, I’ve got to get out of New York or -- you know, I joined a circus.</span> <span id="s1410">I tried for the circus, after I’d tried all the other things, you know, the real -- the shows, the Broadway shows and -- and the ballets and I got into all that stuff and then every time something terrible happened, each time your heart jumps, you know and -- and bung, doesn’t work out.</span> <span id="s1411">So, I went to an audition at the circus, with Ellen Crooks, the -- the girl I had the apartment with in Greenwich Village and we both got in there and we went down to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: As -- as -- and as what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Ringling Brothers.</span> <span id="s1414">Dancers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: And I -- they asked me if I wanted to do, you know, other things.</span> <span id="s1417">And I said, “Oh, yes.”</span> <span id="s1418">So I did the small aerial, which was 25 dollars extra.</span> <span id="s1419">And I -- in the end, I ended up also doing elephants.</span> <span id="s1420">One of the gals that was riding elephants got hurt and she couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1421">And so the guy who directed the show, choreographed the -- choreographed the whole thing, he knew my name.</span> <span id="s1422">He called -- he called me the tawny Pippit.</span> <span id="s1423">And he -- and his name was Babbette and he shouted, “The tawny pippit, get on that elephant.”</span> <span id="s1424">And -- she fell off, broke her leg, got carried away and I got on there.</span> <span id="s1425">And he said, “Now you know why she got hurt.”</span> <span id="s1426">You know, she didn’t fold her legs behind her when the elephants were standing still, which means -- and the elephants liked to rub up against the walls and she really got whammed.</span> <span id="s1427">So I put my legs behind me.</span> <span id="s1428">Sitting and fold your legs behind you so the elephants can’t hurt them.</span> <span id="s1429">So I did the show.</span> <span id="s1430">I went -- you know, we ended up in Madison Square Garden and all the way up and down, you know, the -- the coast and stuff.</span> <span id="s1431">And then they went inland, to the west.</span> <span id="s1432">And that’s when I got scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Scared of what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: I didn’t want to let go of that east coast.</span> <span id="s1435">I -- I quit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: I was really a coward.</span> <span id="s1438">I had six month -- I was -- well, we had rehear -- you know, we had all the weeks in, in Florida.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: Sarasota, rehearsing and then I guess I stained -- I stayed about half a year or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: And did you enjoy it while you were doing it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Oh yeah, it was terrific.</span> <span id="s1443">But -- but -- and it was very adventurous, I mean, gosh.</span> <span id="s1444">You know, we lived on a train and we ate in the -- and we -- I made enormous money, because I didn’t spend a nickel.</span> <span id="s1445">I wanted to save for when I came back, that I had some money.</span> <span id="s1446">And I had the apartment, so -- so that’s what happened, that, you know, I got back to New York, I had a lot of money.</span> <span id="s1447">And then I took a job at -- was it Macy’s?</span> <span id="s1448">Yeah, I as -- guess I took a job -- Christmas job at Macy’s.</span> <span id="s1449">So -- and there I made a fortune, because they put me -- they gave me a job -- you got a bonus for always being on time.</span> <span id="s1450">You got a bonus for not miss-missing any days.</span> <span id="s1451">And you got a bonus for -- they put me to sell difficult merchandise.</span> <span id="s1452">Merchandise that had some kind of a damage to it.</span> <span id="s1453">For instance, I was selling a paint set for kids that was -- you put -- there -- it had a brush, it had some liquid and it had paper, that’s all that was in the box.</span> <span id="s1454">But when you stuck the brush in the liquid and you went over the paper, all sorts of colors and pictures came up.</span> <span id="s1455">However, should you by any chance drop a drop of this liquid on the floor, it would eat the rug.</span> <span id="s1456">So this was merchandise that was difficult to sell, because they had to put a warning on it and they did put a warning on it.</span> <span id="s1457">So the people who bought it knew that, you know, there was no doubt about it, Macy’s did the right thing, except they should never have bought the stuff, right?</span> <span id="s1458">And I sold that.</span> <span id="s1459">I sold a doll that ha -- was dangerous for kids, because it had some kind of a finger that stuck out or something, that might get into some kid’s eye.</span> <span id="s1460">So there was all sorts of merchandise that was -- that was dangerous to s -- or -- or did something, or didn’t -- and for each piece that you sold, you got credit.</span> <span id="s1461">So, I tell you, I did all those things.</span> <span id="s1462">I ran every morning.</span> <span id="s1463">I had to take two subways or a bus and a subway, or something like that to get there.</span> <span id="s1464">34th Street and I lived on East and this was 34 --</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">Q: [indecipherable] something, when you say you ran every morning, you don’t mean you got up and jogged every morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">A: No, I didn’t mean job.</span> <span id="s1467">People didn’t jog in 1950.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Q: Okay, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">A: In 1950.</span> <span id="s1470">No, I -- or ‘49 it was.</span> <span id="s1471">No, I ran up the elevator, which wasn’t running, you know?</span> <span id="s1472">And just trying to be on time.</span> <span id="s1473">And I did, I was there.</span> <span id="s1474">I made a fortune that Christmas.</span> <span id="s1475">However, it was also a terrible Christmas for me, because the Kalinoffsky’s had a house full of people and couldn’t have me.</span> <span id="s1476">And I was lonely to such a degree, I -- I can’t describe it.</span> <span id="s1477">It was too absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s1478">It was absolutely horrible.</span> <span id="s1479">And -- so I had a lot of mo -- but I had another one of my really going kaput, you know, situations and you had to give an emergency number on your application and a buyer who was very nice, he was very nice to me and he called Kalinoffsky, who had been my emergency number and Kalinoffsky came and said he wanted to talk to me and stuff and -- so we did meet.</span> <span id="s1480">We met for lunch or I went over one -- after Christmas they had a time that I could come to their pla -- and I always felt so beholden.</span> <span id="s1481">Is he all right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: I think he’s asleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: Oh good.</span> <span id="s1484">So -- so I always felt so beholden, I didn’t want to ask them for anything.</span> <span id="s1485">And so, at the -- and he talked to me and he said, “You know, I wonder if you still think you’re going to go back to Holland?”</span> <span id="s1486">And I said, “Well, I am thinking that.”</span> <span id="s1487">He said, “Don’t think it.”</span> <span id="s1488">He -- and he started explaining to me about Otmar.</span> <span id="s1489">He said, “A person like that -- face him with it.</span> <span id="s1490">You have to know that he really doesn’t want to get married.</span> <span id="s1491">You have to know that,” he said.</span> <span id="s1492">He thought that was the case.</span> <span id="s1493">But I should know it and I should hear it from Otmar.</span> <span id="s1494">If I had it in the back of my mind that maybe we could get married, and maybe he would give in to having children, you know, he said, “You’ll never be able to settle down here.</span> <span id="s1495">And you have to make up your mind.”</span> <span id="s1496">I had not gone out with anybody, during this entire period.</span> <span id="s1497">I mean, I kept thinking.</span> <span id="s1498">I -- I don’t know what I thought, but I just didn’t want to, you know, make any kind of commitment or even date, so that I might make a commitment or some -- and he -- so I did.</span> <span id="s1499">I wrote a letter to Otmar and I said, “Otmar, I want you -- want to know, you know -- I -- I really ha -- what is the situation?”</span> <span id="s1500">And I got a letter back and I’m -- again one of these letters, you know, with a lot of prevarications [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1501">Is that the right word?</span> <span id="s1502">You know, with -- with a lot of not saying one thing and not saying yes and not saying no and not -- you know, what he -- what either way he was, you know?</span> <span id="s1503">Not being able to make his mind up about anything, so -- and it was a terrible loss, because he was a psychiatrist and he wouldn’t join any group in Holland.</span> <span id="s1504">I kept thinking, you know, he should join a group and be a part of something, but he’s never done that in all his life.</span> <span id="s1505">He -- he is now 80 some years old.</span> <span id="s1506">He’s never, during all his working life, joined up with anything.</span> <span id="s1507">He always was working alone.</span> <span id="s1508">He always did this and did that.</span> <span id="s1509">He never made up his mind about anything and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1510">And I -- I saw him -- when Marty and I went to Holland, we went for -- on sabbatical.</span> <span id="s1511">We were in Holland for a year, in 1960.</span> <span id="s1512">We already had all the kids.</span> <span id="s1513">The youngest one was seven months.</span> <span id="s1514">And he came for dinner, he -- Otmar did, in -- in the Hague.</span> <span id="s1515">He lives in Amsterdam and we were in the Hague.</span> <span id="s1516">And he came for dinner and he said to me, he said, “I should have left Europe long ago.</span> <span id="s1517">I should have gone with you.</span> <span id="s1518">I should have -- you know, I should have made changes and this and that,” he said he just couldn’t do it.</span> <span id="s1519">He couldn’t do it, [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1520">So, you know, he never really changed.</span> <span id="s1521">And he married somebody who could not have a -- children.</span> <span id="s1522">She had one son and she had some kind of disease, she couldn’t have another.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: You mentioned that in the other [indecipherable] yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1524">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1525">So, and he’s not had an easy life, because she’s been very sick all the time with that disease, you know, that she had right from the beginning.</span> <span id="s1526">And he became something I did not really like very much.</span> <span id="s1527">And I -- I said to myself, you know, “Oh, what luck, what luck.</span> <span id="s1528">Oh, was I lucky.”</span> <span id="s1529">You know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">Q: I don’t think it was luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: I don’t think it was luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: But, I mean, I must have had some kind of insight.</span> <span id="s1536">Well, I don’t know, I was so in love, what kind of insight can you have when you’re so in love?</span> <span id="s1537">But I just knowed it wasn’t good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1539">Ca-Can you -- this may be very difficult, but can you distinguish the attachment that you had to Ot-Otmar?</span> <span id="s1540">And we don’t have to go into this either.</span> <span id="s1541">Can you distinguish the attachment -- you have the personal attachment and how it may have been clouded by the general excitement that you had about the war being over?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: Huh.</span> <span id="s1543">Good question.</span> <span id="s1544">Well.</span> <span id="s1545">Huh.</span> <span id="s1546">No, I think that -- that -- I think there’s a whole other angle to this.</span> <span id="s1547">Otmar was German and my father had always adored everything German and he always spoke about the good Germany, you know, when the things went wrong, he kept saying, the humanistic tradition and how he was raised and everything he knew was from Germany and that all the good things that he was came out of Germany and, you know, that you always have to choose -- my father said, with what you pick up from any kind of civilization.</span> <span id="s1548">And that if you pick the good things, you’re very lucky, you know, if you can have a peaceful life, which he didn’t, of course.</span> <span id="s1549">And Otmar was the good things in Germany.</span> <span id="s1550">And he was German and somewhere in my background, there was this belief that Germany was the best.</span> <span id="s1551">That the good things of Germany were better than anything -- anything or anyone else in the -- any -- anywhere.</span> <span id="s1552">That must have been in my li -- in my head.</span> <span id="s1553">And that must have been this -- that gave me this enormous, you know, attraction.</span> <span id="s1554">Because there were many things about Otmar that were very bad.</span> <span id="s1555">I mean, first of all, I think that basically he was a little anti-Semitic, here and there.</span> <span id="s1556">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1557">And -- and he would never believe that, but I -- I -- it wasn’t that obvious, it came out i-in various things, you know?</span> <span id="s1558">The person he worked for, in the beginning, after the war, who really helped him like crazy, [indecipherable] the boss, who really let him work for -- in his practice, and who gave him a chance to get established in Holland -- in Amsterdam and -- and the remarks about Coon were not nice.</span> <span id="s1559">They might have been partly right, but they weren’t nice, because they were based on being Jewish rather than on being the person that he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: You know?</span> <span id="s1562">And that’s not the way to judge anybody.</span> <span id="s1563">And I -- that sort of worried me.</span> <span id="s1564">I must say that that kind of sort of worried me, because I knew Coon very well and I knew all his good things, especially his wife, with whom I’m still very friendly.</span> <span id="s1565">And -- and very attached to, actually, Magda.</span> <span id="s1566">And it just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: She still lives in Amsterdam?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: She still lives in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s1569">And that worried me, it worried me.</span> <span id="s1570">I thought if -- if -- he also -- I think he had a hard time taking me to see his family.</span> <span id="s1571">Now, at the time, of course, it was right after the war, he couldn’t have gone anyway, to Germany.</span> <span id="s1572">He was a deserter.</span> <span id="s1573">His family, you know, his family was good and would have accept y -- anything and was happy that he was alive and there and all that.</span> <span id="s1574">His family wasn’t like that at all -- was not Fascist or in any way.</span> <span id="s1575">But -- but I don’t know, deserting is another thing.</span> <span id="s1576">And coming with a Jewish wife, to Germany after the war, eh.</span> <span id="s1577">All that worried me.</span> <span id="s1578">I thought, a life, a whole life and a child, maybe that was half Jewish?</span> <span id="s1579">These things have changed.</span> <span id="s1580">I mean, the next generation, it would have been all right.</span> <span id="s1581">As a matter of fact, I think it would have been a star in his -- in his crown.</span> <span id="s1582">But the first generation, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1584">A: And maybe it worried him more than it would have worried his people, you know?</span> <span id="s1585">But he was already insecure from -- from what he -- what he himself had done.</span> <span id="s1586">He couldn’t go back to Germany for many years after the war.</span> <span id="s1587">I don’t know when the first time was that he did go back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1588">Anyway, so as I say, it was -- it was not what you were saying --</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: -- but it was more Otmar himself that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">Q: Okay, so when [indecipherable] say he wrote the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1592">A: -- that worried me --</span></p> <p><span id="s1593">Q: -- he wrote the letter and he sent a vague --</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">A: Who sent --</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">Q: -- a vague response?</span></p> <p><span id="s1596">A: -- th-th -- again the vague response and that’s when I said to myself, “It is no.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">A: I -- I have to go on.</span> <span id="s1599">I mean, now I am 24.</span> <span id="s1600">I’m -- you know, you get, you can’t -- you -- you -- or 24 yeah, was 24.</span> <span id="s1601">So I looked in the paper and I looked for a job that was going to take me out of New York.</span> <span id="s1602">And there was a job, with a cosmetic company, who was demonstrating -- wi -- who needed demonstrators and who was going to train in New York, and then sent you out.</span> <span id="s1603">And that seemed like the perfect solution.</span> <span id="s1604">They were paying during training, enough for me to eat and to pay my rent.</span> <span id="s1605">And they were going to pay a lot then, plus percentage, after you were trained.</span> <span id="s1606">And that’s what I did.</span> <span id="s1607">I -- I went to work for this company -- cosmetic company, who isn’t -- which name I have forgotten.</span> <span id="s1608">And they were selling creams for your hair and -- and lotions and brushes and combs -- with particular circular brushes and combs, which was new then.</span> <span id="s1609">And I had the perfect hair for it.</span> <span id="s1610">And I could speak -- I had an accent, m-more than now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: Did you have long hair?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: No, like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1613">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">A: But it -- my accent was an advantage, because people were going to listen to this accent.</span> <span id="s1615">So, I had to -- di -- di -- you got a lamp, you know the company would get a lamp that was focused on you and you would give a speech about the combs and the brushes and the hair and answer questions and stuff.</span> <span id="s1616">And the first place they sent us, because they sent two women together, always.</span> <span id="s1617">After the training -- I trained all over New York.</span> <span id="s1618">I was at Gimbel’s, I was at Macy’s, I was at something Strauss -- Abraham Strauss, was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: Yeah, Abraham and Strauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: Yeah, and I was at another one and I was in Brooklyn, was the first time I ever made -- set foot in Brooklyn and I was all over New York.</span> <span id="s1621">And then they send us and the first place they sent us was Baltimore, and we were a huge success.</span> <span id="s1622">I mean, I sold enormous amount of comb -- and because we were a success, we stayed and stayed.</span> <span id="s1623">And I got to know the buyer of the department, who was a Jewish fellow and I -- and he was very nice.</span> <span id="s1624">He said, “You know, you were here so long, you really should be doing something with your evening, something useful.</span> <span id="s1625">And aren’t you lonely?”</span> <span id="s1626">And I was, because she was a gal who disappeared after work.</span> <span id="s1627">And she had no interests that I had.</span> <span id="s1628">And so he took me, one time, for lunch.</span> <span id="s1629">He wasn’t allowed to fraternize, you know, anything.</span> <span id="s1630">But he took me to a place that during the day was a small restaurant where they -- very small, they don’t have small places like that, hardly, any more, where they made sandwiches and stuff.</span> <span id="s1631">And at night, the students from the various universities in Baltimore would come and play chess and he had some music and once in awhile he had somebody to talk and stuff.</span> <span id="s1632">And my hotel was not too far from there.</span> <span id="s1633">I could walk it and I could go there.</span> <span id="s1634">And I met some people from the various universities.</span> <span id="s1635">And I met some people who were in the acting sections and stuff and they said, “Gee, it would be nice, you know, why don’t you come and try out?”</span> <span id="s1636">And I said, “I can’t, because I won’t be here long enough.”</span> <span id="s1637">Well, after six weeks, they sent us to Cincinnati.</span> <span id="s1638">And we get to Cincinnati and she of course, is gone at night and I decided maybe I should see something of Cincinnati and stuff and there was a fellow in the department, who said he knew some people.</span> <span id="s1639">Well, it turned out to be German -- ex -- ex-Germans -- immigrants and they took me to a beerholla -- a beer hall and stuff and I -- I hated it, I couldn’t tell you how I hated it.</span> <span id="s1640">You know, they were all locking arms and singing, ah, la la la la, you know, and these beer songs and I thought, “That I need?</span> <span id="s1641">I don’t need that,” you know?</span> <span id="s1642">I mean, I could have gone back to Germany and had that -- the real thing, it wouldn’t be as obnoxious as this.</span> <span id="s1643">So I telegraphed the guy in Baltimore and I said -- he had said, “If you want a job, let me know.”</span> <span id="s1644">This -- the buyer at the company.</span> <span id="s1645">And I said, “Is there still a job?</span> <span id="s1646">Do you still have a job and if so, could you let me know?”</span> <span id="s1647">And he -- telegraphed back, “Job available, arranged for you to come and you can stay with so and so.”</span> <span id="s1648">A woman in the department who was just divorced or something, has lots of room and just come.</span> <span id="s1649">And I came.</span> <span id="s1650">That’s how I got to Baltimore, of all places, you know.</span> <span id="s1651">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: Was that where you met ra -- Martin?</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Well, I did, because these people from the university, of course they saw me again and they said, “Come and try out for a play.”</span> <span id="s1654">And I said, “I’m a real actress, I’m a -- I was a professional, I’m not going to do that.”</span> <span id="s1655">And they started explaining to me about amateur theater in -- in the United States and come on.</span> <span id="s1656">And -- and I said, “And my terrible accent,” and they said, “Oh well, you know, we’ll find parts that are just right.”</span> <span id="s1657">So I went and I tried out for Molière’s “School for Wives.”</span> <span id="s1658">“School for Wives.”</span> <span id="s1659">It had a wonderful director and he didn’t take me, because of my accent.</span> <span id="s1660">He said, “They’re going to listen hard to try to understand you and they won’t hear the play.”</span> <span id="s1661">And it’s like a Broadway thing, had it just been a Broadway thing, because the girl that he did choose did -- got sick, couldn’t make it -- he didn’t want to have -- he was mid -- in the middle of rehearsals, he didn’t want to have another audition.</span> <span id="s1662">He called me and said, “I’ll get somebody, the Hopkins Department of Linguistics has said they would help me, come and do the play with us.”</span> <span id="s1663">And I did.</span> <span id="s1664">And that’s where I met a lot of people I liked, you know.</span> <span id="s1665">And all my age and -- and it was just great.</span> <span id="s1666">I was just a little older than they.</span></p> <p><span id="s1667">Q: Let me ask you one question, just about your frame of mind at that point.</span> <span id="s1668">Was there -- could you -- could you perceive a difference in your state of mind and your ambitions, based on the fact that you had been through the experiences in Europe that you had been through and the Americans that you were with had not?</span></p> <p><span id="s1669">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1670">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1671">The answer is yes.</span> <span id="s1672">And it was the first time there that I had -- when I started meeting me -- boys, you know?</span> <span id="s1673">That’s when I thought, “This is impossible.</span> <span id="s1674">I can never marry an American.</span> <span id="s1675">Never.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">Q: Can you el-elaborate on it?</span> <span id="s1677">What were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">A: Yes, because the people -- it so happened that a couple of the -- the -- the fellows I met, had been just on the cusp, you know, of the -- of the age that did -- didn’t go into the war.</span> <span id="s1679">You know, weren’t old enough to be drafted or to get into the war.</span> <span id="s1680">And those were the -- my first acquaintances.</span> <span id="s1681">Fraternity kind of fellows.</span> <span id="s1682">And I used to laugh.</span> <span id="s1683">They would wait for me outside my apartment, when I came back from work.</span> <span id="s1684">And I would see them standing there and I would laugh, I would laugh.</span> <span id="s1685">This is ridiculous.</span> <span id="s1686">I mean, I’m a woman -- I’m a woman and I am a grown-up, I’ve -- you know, these are so innocent.</span> <span id="s1687">They’re so damn innocent.</span> <span id="s1688">It’s impossible.</span> <span id="s1689">I can never, never, never get together with them.</span> <span id="s1690">I could never find a level on which we could talk together as equals.</span> <span id="s1691">I don’t mean intellectually, but even that -- I mean, you know, they -- they had no idea about anything.</span> <span id="s1692">About arts or anything about theater -- about the war they had completely wrong notions, just completely wrong.</span> <span id="s1693">I had to explain everything.</span> <span id="s1694">You know, it just didn’t work, no, it didn’t work.</span> <span id="s1695">And that was, of course, also Baltimore because in New York it was a little better, although there I didn’t date very much either.</span> <span id="s1696">But it just -- i-it was just so -- they were so childish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: And how would you characterize the general American --</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Th-The males -- the males in Baltimore, the ones that I met -- and I wanted to meet -- I didn’t care whom I met, you know, whether were Jewish or not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">A: They were just too -- too childish, too -- too immature.</span> <span id="s1701">They -- I mean they were just out of rah-rah high school and college, you know?</span> <span id="s1702">Football kind of guys.</span> <span id="s1703">Even though I met some very intellectual.</span> <span id="s1704">I met Russ Baker.</span> <span id="s1705">I met, you know, I met -- you know, the people who were the same age -- actually, he went to school with Marty.</span> <span id="s1706">He was very nice.</span> <span id="s1707">He was certainly an intellectual.</span> <span id="s1708">But he wasn’t -- had never been allowed to really show it.</span> <span id="s1709">Cause the girls wouldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: You know?</span> <span id="s1712">It took him awhile.</span> <span id="s1713">And he actually had a girl.</span> <span id="s1714">He was between, you know, having broken up with her and coming -- going back to her when -- when I dated.</span> <span id="s1715">We didn’t really date many times, a couple times.</span> <span id="s1716">But -- but it really was -- he was very nice, he was the best of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: You’re talking about the writer, Russell Baker, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: It -- it - it’s just -- I just -- I met him, you know, Marty and I, when Marty got his Nobel, we -- we met him several times.</span> <span id="s1721">And I said, “Do you know that you and I had a couple of dates?”</span> <span id="s1722">He couldn’t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I had been following his -- his writing.</span> <span id="s1723">And it -- it ma -- left no special impression, except he was a bit more, you know, when he knew he could re -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s1725">This is tape number three, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1726">A: He couldn’t remember and -- and I could remember, because he was -- you know, I had been following his -- his writing.</span> <span id="s1727">And it -- it ma -- left no special impression, except he was a bit more, you know, when he knew he could relax and actually talk about something.</span> <span id="s1728">Something more than football or baseball, which he had no interest in.</span> <span id="s1729">And the-then -- you know, he -- he relaxed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">Q: And how did -- how did Americans in general, who now felt like they had been -- you know, they had helped win the war and liberate everybody.</span> <span id="s1731">How did they treat people like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1732">A: They -- they were good from that point of view.</span> <span id="s1733">They -- they were -- they were good from that point of view.</span> <span id="s1734">You know, the boys didn’t want to talk about the war.</span> <span id="s1735">That was -- that was -- that was really one of the things.</span> <span id="s1736">Well, I didn’t meet that many, you know, that -- that I could really -- that’s why the circus was interesting, because they were Europeans.</span> <span id="s1737">There were some Arabs, North African.</span> <span id="s1738">There were -- there were various Germans, quite a few Germans.</span> <span id="s1739">There were, you know, people who had really been through things, that it was, in a way, a bit of home, you know?</span> <span id="s1740">I felt more, like belonging and -- and we were all sort of footloose and fancy free in a strange country.</span> <span id="s1741">That gave me a feeling of home and comfort in the circus.</span> <span id="s1742">But American boys, no.</span> <span id="s1743">I mean your average -- your average American boy, it was just impossible.</span> <span id="s1744">Now, what happened was, was that the one fellow that I -- I got to know quite well, after awhile, he had to go to -- to bloom -- to go for his graduate school.</span> <span id="s1745">And he told Marty -- he had taken Marty to see me at “School for Wives.”</span> <span id="s1746">And Marty had a girlfriend then and you know, there was no reason for us to get together.</span> <span id="s1747">And -- but when he left -- when this Danny left, to go to Bloomington for his grad school, he told Marty to come and see me.</span> <span id="s1748">You know, check up on me once in awhile, til he was going to come back Christmas, or he was going to come back Easter.</span> <span id="s1749">But -- but Marty should go and see me.</span> <span id="s1750">So Marty came to see me and I was deathly sick.</span> <span id="s1751">He’s always telling this story and I’ll tell it very fast.</span> <span id="s1752">He -- Marty -- there was a knock on my door and Marty came in and I was so sick I couldn’t get up.</span> <span id="s1753">And he couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1754">I had a nice place, in a brownstone on Charles Street, near Mount Vernon Place in ba -- in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1755">And Marty took one look at me and touched my head, knew I had a fever and he went home to his mom and he said -- there was nothing in my refrigerator, he looked in the refrigerator and there was nothing there.</span> <span id="s1756">So he went home and said to his mom, “I need food.</span> <span id="s1757">I need a pot of --” And ma -- his mom had a pot of chicken soup.</span> <span id="s1758">So he took some of it.</span> <span id="s1759">His -- his parents had a grocery store.</span> <span id="s1760">So he took so-some food from the store and he took some what his mom had and he came back and he fed me.</span> <span id="s1761">And from then on, you know, I was his -- his -- what do you call it?</span> <span id="s1762">His --</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">Q: Patient?</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Patient, yeah, sort of.</span> <span id="s1765">And he kept coming back and -- and making sure, you know, that I have food and that -- that ge -- I mean, I couldn’t move, I was so sick.</span> <span id="s1766">You know, I was -- of course I had something from the war.</span> <span id="s1767">I mean -- for instance, when I had my first child, my gums just erupted, I had -- they -- they ended up painting them purple, because you know, I didn’t have any vitamins, you know, nothing during my last growing spurt.</span> <span id="s1768">You know, between 16 and 18 you cans still grow.</span> <span id="s1769">You know, I had no food.</span> <span id="s1770">So there was something, you know, innately wrong with me.</span> <span id="s1771">So, I wasn’t quite as strong to resist some of the bugs that were going around and Marty had a friend, Helmut Sonenfeld, whose parents had both come from Germany, they were both doctors.</span> <span id="s1772">And when they got to Baltimore, they placed themselves -- they went, bought a big house in a black neighborhood and they treated the poor.</span> <span id="s1773">They said, “We survived, we have to do something back.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And who were these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: Their name was Sonenfeld and they were two doctors from Germany.</span> <span id="s1776">They had two sons.</span> <span id="s1777">One of them was Helmut, who ended up as the sidekick of Kissinger, especially -- well, that’s -- Marty knew him from -- I think from Hopkins, but maybe even before that.</span> <span id="s1778">Helmut, you know, is a rush -- a specialist in Russia, an expert and still very important.</span> <span id="s1779">I think he teaches at the school of international something or other in -- in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1780">And Helmut -- Marty called Helmut and said, “I have this German girl who -- or Dutch girl who doesn’t have a cent and who is deathly ill.</span> <span id="s1781">Would you ask your parents?”</span> <span id="s1782">And they said, “Yes, bring her.”</span> <span id="s1783">And so these parents, I mean they did everything.</span> <span id="s1784">They -- they checked me over, they knew that I nearly had pneumonia, you know.</span> <span id="s1785">They got the medication, they bought it, they -- they really babied me.</span> <span id="s1786">They really took care of me.</span> <span id="s1787">And I didn’t like Helmut.</span> <span id="s1788">Helmut and I didn’t get along.</span> <span id="s1789">I -- I never did get along with anybody from over there.</span> <span id="s1790">When I first came to -- to New York, the friends of my parents, they had heard from the Kalinoffsky’s that I was there, they got all their sons, you know, to come, because the daughter of Dr. Leiderman, you know, I mean, it should be terrific and stuff.</span> <span id="s1791">And so I got invited to these fancy houses, all around New -- New York City and out in the -- out in the country, you know, Larchmont and all those lovely areas.</span> <span id="s1792">Connecticut, upper Conne -- lower Connecticut and stuff and it was awful.</span> <span id="s1793">There were all these fancy things.</span> <span id="s1794">Boys -- young men, who had been in the United States forever, as far as I’m concerned and who spoke with an accent thicker than mine.</span> <span id="s1795">I mean, it was just horrible.</span> <span id="s1796">I mean, I said to myself, if I have to live in the United States, I’m going to marry an Americ -- marry and American.</span> <span id="s1797">And one of the big shocks, when I finally got into this Hopkins group, was the split between the Russian Polish group and the German group.</span> <span id="s1798">Now, I naturally should have belonged to the German group, but I despised what they were standing for.</span> <span id="s1799">It was so horrible.</span> <span id="s1800">After all the things we had gone through as Jews -- of course, they didn’t go through anything, but I -- you know, I was not going to make -- I knew that it didn’t help you to make a difference between Jews.</span> <span id="s1801">I mean, you were a human being, you were a Jew, you were a German Jew and you were a snob?</span> <span id="s1802">I can’t tell you what kind of expression I would like to use, but it’s a bad one.</span> <span id="s1803">I was very angry at those Phi Ebs, which was the Jewish fraternity -- the German Jewish fraternity and the other ones, which Marty belonged to.</span> <span id="s1804">His parents -- you know, I mean it was just awful, I despi -- and I got telephone calls.</span> <span id="s1805">I got calls saying, “What are you doing, going out with those people?”</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: With what people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: With the -- with the Polish Russian group of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Oh, the Germans were calling you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1809">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1810">They were -- they were calling.</span> <span id="s1811">And Marty doesn’t believe me, but that’s what I got.</span> <span id="s1812">And I couldn’t stand it -- and I couldn’t stand it and I went out with one boy who was -- he was an architect and he had left that group for a long time and he was German Jewish and -- and he -- I was very fond of him, but he was highly neurotic and everything.</span> <span id="s1813">And he took me to see his parents.</span> <span id="s1814">And I had dinner there and I could see these parents, they didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1815">I mean, I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1816">And that’s what they were after, even though they were [indecipherable], they were very rich.</span> <span id="s1817">You know, but it was the idea that class came not from you, as a person, but class came out of your pocketbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: You know, and I had to laugh, because all their parents and grandparents had been grocers and -- and whatever they were, you know, which I didn’t give a hoot what they were, I only cared what kind of person they were.</span> <span id="s1820">And here my parents, you know, came fr -- I mean, I felt like I was much better than they were and -- and they were saying, “Well, you haven’t got a --” Well, at the moment I didn’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1821">And s -- it was lucky.</span> <span id="s1822">It was lucky.</span> <span id="s1823">I was just lucky.</span> <span id="s1824">Because I decided I was going to go with something strong and the Polish Russian ones were the strong ones.</span> <span id="s1825">And when -- when Marty came and we started going out and we were very careful, because this was -- this friend of his was his best friend, Danny, who went to Bloomington.</span> <span id="s1826">And hi -- I guess Marty had dated several of ma -- of Danny’s ex-girlfriends and Danny wasn’t happy about it and he was very careful not -- and I was very careful.</span> <span id="s1827">Course, I didn’t want any trouble, you know, in anything.</span> <span id="s1828">So finally Danny called and said he couldn’t come home Easter, because he had to take care of his drizoffulla flies, which is a -- for his research.</span> <span id="s1829">He says, “I can’t let my flies die.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">Q: Fr-Fruit -- fruit flies, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1831">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1832">Marty came over that day and he said he’d had a note from Danny saying he was -- and I had had the same letter.</span> <span id="s1833">And he said, “You know, Barbara, that’s just too bad for Danny.”</span> <span id="s1834">We were going out for three months.</span> <span id="s1835">All we did was ever hold hands, vaguely.</span> <span id="s1836">And I felt like such a child, I thought.</span> <span id="s1837">But Marty, you see, had been in the war.</span> <span id="s1838">Marty had been in the Pacific.</span> <span id="s1839">He’d lived over -- he’d lived in China for eight months.</span> <span id="s1840">He had seen different people, he had been together -- thrown together with all these people, which Danny hadn’t and other people that I went out with, didn’t have.</span> <span id="s1841">And Marty was much more mature.</span> <span id="s1842">Much more mature.</span> <span id="s1843">And he was a couple of years older than -- than most of the others, because he’d been in the war for two and half, three years, you know?</span> <span id="s1844">So he was not so childish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: Was he o-older than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: No.</span> <span id="s1847">I’m o -- three months older than him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: Oh, so you’re the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: We were exactly the same.</span> <span id="s1850">And -- but -- but he was older than these guys I happened to have met, you know?</span> <span id="s1851">And he was -- having been in different surroundings, having seen the suffering -- the Chinese were suffering like crazy when he was there.</span> <span id="s1852">And having seen hunger and having seen all that, you know, he -- he was much more mature -- much more mature.</span> <span id="s1853">And he had interests, and he was interested in a mature way, in what I wanted to do.</span> <span id="s1854">And sport was okay, but it wasn’t anything that interested him very much.</span> <span id="s1855">And so we -- we really -- you know, we had the same political outlook.</span> <span id="s1856">We had, for instance, I lost a boyfriend in New York, when we -- I first was in New York, because he voted for Dewey, you know?</span> <span id="s1857">I mean, I could not see even voting for Dewey, I’d -- oh, let’s say voting not for Roosevelt party.</span> <span id="s1858">So I sent him away, I sa -- and this was a good deal, this guy.</span> <span id="s1859">But the politics were important to me.</span> <span id="s1860">After living in Europe, you know and -- and -- and seeing the things that happened in Europe because people did not care, the intellectuals did not care about politics and did not -- they thought it was below them, you know?</span> <span id="s1861">So -- so I s -- I thought, people have to care about politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">Q: Now, just so I understand, are you -- are you s-saying or suggesting that part of the problem in Europe escalated because people were not involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1863">A: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s1864">Not invo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1865">Q: Part of the -- part of the -- of the Holocaust happening was because -- because the intellectuals were not involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s1866">A: Yes, oh yes.</span> <span id="s1867">I think that in the beginning, even Germans who were good -- really great people, good people, they did not involve themselves.</span> <span id="s1868">Well, you didn’t talk about politics, that was for -- I don’t -- it wasn’t classy.</span> <span id="s1869">It just wasn’t done.</span> <span id="s1870">You know, I mean intellectuals cared about intellectual things and politics was not intellectual.</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">Q: You know, it’s -- it’s funny, I’ve never really had anybody say that to me before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">A: Well, maybe I’m wrong, but -- but this is my impression.</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">Q: No, I think you’re probably right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">A: My father never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1875">My group -- the whole group never talked about it.</span> <span id="s1876">I knew about Hitler because I heard the maids talk.</span> <span id="s1877">I heard my governess talk.</span> <span id="s1878">I heard Maria, my -- the -- the nurse talk.</span> <span id="s1879">I heard the cook, the -- you know, I heard all these different people talk about Hitler in the house, when my parents weren’t around.</span> <span id="s1880">Because I remember taking a walk, I was six years old, we were out in the country.</span> <span id="s1881">We’d had whooping cough and -- and it was terrible, there was nothing to be done about whooping cough.</span> <span id="s1882">And so they took us out of Berlin, into the country, into the clean air and we lived at -- on a farm for about two months, because my sister and I both had -- my sister was very ill, I wasn’t so terribly ill.</span> <span id="s1883">And that’s where I heard everybody talk.</span> <span id="s1884">All these people were with us.</span> <span id="s1885">And I heard them talk.</span> <span id="s1886">And I remember taking a walk with my father and they were talking about elections coming up and I said, “I know,” I was ru -- jumping around.</span> <span id="s1887">“I know who you’re going to vote for.</span> <span id="s1888">You going to vote for Hitler.”</span> <span id="s1889">That was the only name I knew.</span> <span id="s1890">I didn’t know any other name.</span> <span id="s1891">And why I remember that, I think because my father must have shook me or something.</span> <span id="s1892">But it stuck in my head, that I was so stupid.</span> <span id="s1893">That I was -- was saying that.</span> <span id="s1894">I must have gotten punished for it or something.</span> <span id="s1895">Or anyway, told not to -- my parents didn’t tum -- punish.</span> <span id="s1896">But they must have told me very definitely, that is not something -- you know, we talk about around -- you know, not to talk with the s -- help or something about puli -- politics or something.</span> <span id="s1897">There was some reason I remember this occasion.</span> <span id="s1898">This was when I was six.</span> <span id="s1899">Anyway, I -- that’s my -- my view of it.</span> <span id="s1900">Yes, I think that people didn’t want to think about it.</span> <span id="s1901">People who were, in any way, intellectual.</span> <span id="s1902">And -- and didn’t have to be involved in politics, you know, it was a profession -- it was a profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s1903">Q: So this -- so this then affected your involvement with things?</span> <span id="s1904">I -- I mean what was your -- what became your involvement with politics here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Well, th -- be -- I was not involved in anything.</span> <span id="s1906">I never was involved in anything.</span> <span id="s1907">I’m a member of the democratic party now.</span> <span id="s1908">I don’t think I was until we got here, you know?</span> <span id="s1909">But I voted democratic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">Q: [indecipherable] When -- when -- when did you come to North Carolina?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">A: In ‘85, yeah.</span> <span id="s1912">And then -- and here there were some people who -- you know, I didn’t have the kids to -- or anything to -- to think about and so I started to sort of reach out and find a few new things that I was interested in and somebody came to the door, actually and asked, you know, what our -- well, we had to register to vote and I’ve always voted.</span> <span id="s1913">There hasn’t been a time that I didn’t vote.</span> <span id="s1914">When we were in Holland, I used to go to Rotterdam to vote, with the, you know, your absentee ballots and when we were in Switzerland we voted absentee ballots, you know.</span> <span id="s1915">We -- we always -- I always voted.</span> <span id="s1916">And when Marty gets disgusted -- and he does, nowadays -- get disgusted with, you know, always voting against something, rather than for something, I say it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1917">If you don’t vote at all, it’s for it, rather than against it and it’s better to vote again -- you know, it just -- you have to vote -- you have to vote, it’s so in me.</span> <span id="s1918">I can’t -- I -- I -- the kids -- “You’ve got to vote.</span> <span id="s1919">You don’t vote, I don’t vote, I don’t talk to you.”</span> <span id="s1920">I mean all four of them.</span> <span id="s1921">“You -- you vote.</span> <span id="s1922">You’re --”</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">Q: Let’s talk about the children for a little while.</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">Q: Are we fin -- is it okay?</span> <span id="s1926">Can we [indecipherable]?</span></p> <p><span id="s1927">A: Yes, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s1929">So, first tell -- tell me their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1930">A: Well, you know, we had children all over this country because Marty and I got married in Baltimore and we immediately went to Seattle, the next day.</span> <span id="s1931">We -- we took off for Seattle, where he was going to be working on his Ph.D.</span> <span id="s1932">He asked me to marry him -- he came out to Long Island because I was there to do a show.</span> <span id="s1933">I was doing -- dancing and acting in a show that was playing out on Long Island.</span> <span id="s1934">And he came there and he said, “Do you want to marry me?”</span> <span id="s1935">And I had just gotten the first agent interested in me and my partner, who was a girl -- we were -- she had very black hair, she reminded me of my sister, you know?</span> <span id="s1936">Very black hair, white skin.</span> <span id="s1937">And I had blonde hair and blue eyes and we were a good couple and we danced together very well.</span> <span id="s1938">And he wanted us as a couple, you know, to dance.</span> <span id="s1939">And Marty came and asked, “Do you want to get -- marry me?”</span> <span id="s1940">And I said -- I thought to myself, I’m 23, you know -- I’m 24.</span> <span id="s1941">Yeah, I was 24.</span> <span id="s1942">I said, “Yes,” and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: Right away?</span></p> <p><span id="s1944">A: And we married -- three or four marries -- I went -- we went back to Baltimore after the show --</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">Q: Did you say re -- yes, right there on the spot?</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">A: I said yes on the spot.</span> <span id="s1947">I s -- I thought to myself, “You know, you can think about this and you can think about this and --” you know, I wanted -- I was sure of one thing, I wanted somebody that I was starting with.</span> <span id="s1948">I didn’t want anybody who was already -- had a lot of money, that I would have had to say thank you to.</span> <span id="s1949">I didn’t want somebody who was a lot older, because I had a boyfriend there in -- in Baltimore that I was very fond of, but he was a finished person.</span> <span id="s1950">He was already 41 or 40 or something and I was 25.</span> <span id="s1951">So I -- and that was the same as my parents, 15 years different, and I said to myself, that’s not good.</span> <span id="s1952">So here was the perfect thing, I mean he was -- he was starting on his graduate school, so I would have to work, we would start this thing together.</span> <span id="s1953">And I liked him.</span> <span id="s1954">But, you know, it wasn’t what -- this overwhelming feeling that I had had with Otmar or anything.</span> <span id="s1955">But, I thought, he’s the best guy.</span> <span id="s1956">I could -- you know, I liked him very much and he -- so I said yes.</span> <span id="s1957">I said, “Yes, that’s what I’m going to do.”</span> <span id="s1958">So when I got back to Baltimore, I went to a shorthand and typing st -- school, to do shorthand and typing, because I knew I had to go to work.</span> <span id="s1959">I couldn’t count on acting or dancing or -- and it’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s1960">I got a job before he got a job and we went to Seattle and we were -- we were there, he did very well and -- and we -- we were there for about three years.</span> <span id="s1961">It took four years to get your Ph.D. in those days, takes longer now.</span> <span id="s1962">And that was the ideal circumstance and -- and that was four years.</span> <span id="s1963">So I worked for three years or even longer.</span> <span id="s1964">I worked up to the day that Paul was born.</span> <span id="s1965">And we had nothing -- we had very, very little money and we were happy as clams because we lived in a community of students, and -- and who were all pregnant with -- five of us pregnant at the same time.</span> <span id="s1966">And Marty was doing tests to see if he could figure out whether we were g-going to have boys or girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">Q: What kind of tests?</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">A: Well, they thought there was -- he -- at the time they thou -- now, they have, of course, great things, you know, but -- but at the time they thought maybe a saliva -- you know, a urine or something.</span> <span id="s1969">We all did the tests and the only one that was right was mine.</span> <span id="s1970">So the test was not a good, de-definitive test.</span> <span id="s1971">So, anyway, I had Paul in Seattle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">Q: In what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">A: ‘53.</span> <span id="s1974">And I had done a lot of acting in Seattle.</span> <span id="s1975">There was the theater at the university, the -- the -- our own theater, we started a theater of our own.</span> <span id="s1976">And we had -- I mean I did a lot of acting, next to my full time job, which was downtown in a bank.</span> <span id="s1977">And okay, in -- so that was ‘53.</span> <span id="s1978">In ‘54 Marty graduated and we moved to Urbana, Illinois for two years and that’s where I had Susie.</span> <span id="s1979">I did a lot of acting in Urbana.</span> <span id="s1980">Acting and dancing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">Q: She was born in ‘55?</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">A: She was born in ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">Q: ‘54.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">A: Well, December 30th.</span> <span id="s1985">I mean, you know, just about -- hanging on.</span> <span id="s1986">Good tax deduction, she was.</span> <span id="s1987">And then in -- the next one -- Andy was born -- oh yeah, in ‘56 we moved to Bethesda.</span> <span id="s1988">We lived in Silver Spring, actually, but that’s when he went to NIH.</span> <span id="s1989">He was at NIH for -- we went to NIH and that’s where he stayed.</span> <span id="s1990">So Andy was born in ‘57 and Philip was born in ‘59, December ‘59.</span> <span id="s1991">And that was our house, that was it.</span> <span id="s1992">And then in -- in ‘60, we went to Holland for a year, on sabbatical.</span> <span id="s1993">And that’s -- you know, that was terrific, I mean that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">Q: Well -- okay, now what -- well, tell me about that, I have something -- there’s one thing we forgot -- I forgot to ask you, but tell me about going to Holland with the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1995">A: Okay, well, that was most amazing, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: Was that your first time back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: That was my first time back, so that was what -- I -- I left in -- in ‘47, November and I got back in ‘60, I guess July or August it was.</span> <span id="s1998">July, maybe.</span> <span id="s1999">And my Uncle Huntz, my mother’s youngest brother, who had gone to Israel after the war -- he also has a great story.</span> <span id="s2000">Anyway he we -- he ended up as ambassador from Israel to Holland, cause he was Dutch originally, you know?</span> <span id="s2001">So he spoke Dutch, so they sent him to Holland.</span> <span id="s2002">And he was there in 1960, when we came, in -- as ambassador, with my Aunt Ruth and his daughter -- their daughter Alliane and of course, they had other kids, but they stayed in Israel.</span> <span id="s2003">And so it was great.</span> <span id="s2004">They had gotten a house for us and we looked at the house and it was dark and miserable.</span> <span id="s2005">So we looked further and we found a wonderful house on the ocean.</span> <span id="s2006">Many dunes in front of it -- I mean you’re not right on the ocean, you can’t see the water, but it’s the nearest thing you can get to -- to the water.</span> <span id="s2007">And we brought a girl from -- from America to take -- help take care -- a young girl, six -- 16 - 17, who’ll take care of the kids.</span> <span id="s2008">And then we -- we hired somebody to cook and to -- to clean, because I wanted to do photography.</span> <span id="s2009">My Uncle Paul is still alive, he’s a painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2010">Q: What kind of photography were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s2011">A: I was doing portraiture, landscapes, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2012">Q: And what -- were you selling -- were you selling them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2013">A: I was -- I was selling them, but not in Holland -- not while I was in Holland.</span> <span id="s2014">I was just working with people in Holland and I found wonderful people to work with right near us.</span> <span id="s2015">I couldn’t go back to Maria Austria, who -- who had been my teacher, because that was in Amsterdam, but near the Hague, there was a friend, Veekmon was her name and I worked with her.</span> <span id="s2016">And it was -- and I had a dark room in the house.</span> <span id="s2017">It -- it was fantastic.</span> <span id="s2018">I worked very hard.</span> <span id="s2019">I finally got to -- he really -- and my Uncle Pa -- it was a wonderful -- it was a fantastic year.</span> <span id="s2020">What happened was that Marty really was in Brussels that year, for six -- for six months and we -- we were going to be in Brussels and my family then, Heinz and Ava said, “That’s ridiculous, you know, you’re going to be in bru -- in Europe for the first time with all your kids, we want to see your kids, you know.</span> <span id="s2021">Don’t go to Brussels.”</span> <span id="s2022">You know, then -- this too far.</span> <span id="s2023">So, the house that we had was just two blocks from them and that was really nice.</span> <span id="s2024">I mean it was -- it was unbelievable to be back in Holland with my own kids.</span> <span id="s2025">I shopped in the same stores for them.</span> <span id="s2026">I took them to Amsterdam, of course -- we were in the Hague.</span> <span id="s2027">But I had known the Hague very well.</span> <span id="s2028">Uncle Paul was in Vosinar, which is -- which is between the Hague and Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2029">I mean, it was -- for me it was one of the best years I could ever remember.</span> <span id="s2030">I mean, imagine I went to stores in Amsterdam, met some company where we used to shop and -- and there was -- an aunt of mine was sitting there, and -- was an aunt of my mother’s really, was sitting there.</span> <span id="s2031">“Barbara,” she says, “how are you?”</span> <span id="s2032">I mean, this doesn’t’ happen to me in the States.</span> <span id="s2033">I mean, it was just -- it was a wonderful year.</span> <span id="s2034">I -- I ended up -- we -- you know, I had so much family that was still living there and many of them are dead.</span> <span id="s2035">My uncle’s dead, his wife is dead.</span> <span id="s2036">You know, and etcetera.</span> <span id="s2037">My cousins are alive.</span> <span id="s2038">So I do go there and I visit with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">Q: And -- and did you meet th -- at that time, did you meet people that you had worked with in the underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">A: Yes, I met everybody, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">A: Yes, I me -- we went to see Manfred and on -- the funniest thing was Marty, my husband, because I had -- he had -- always wanted to hear stories about Europe and the underground and this and that and I had been telling him these stories.</span> <span id="s2043">And I guess he believed them, but you know, it was so colorful.</span> <span id="s2044">I had -- I mean, my uncle who was a painter and who knew everybody in the art world.</span> <span id="s2045">And the -- and -- and my -- my dancing buddies and my -- and then, when we came to Holland, Marty had never been in Europe.</span> <span id="s2046">He had been in the Pacific in the war, but never in Europe.</span> <span id="s2047">So this was his first time.</span> <span id="s2048">He met all these people and every bit of it was true.</span> <span id="s2049">As a matter of fact, you know, he could flesh it out.</span> <span id="s2050">It was more colorful than he had ever thought, you know.</span> <span id="s2051">He met my uncles and my -- my cousins and my f -- my family and my friends.</span> <span id="s2052">All the underground people were then alive.</span> <span id="s2053">He met Coon and he met Magda and he met Maurecia Austria, the photographer that I used to work with, he met her husband, he was still there, that husband.</span> <span id="s2054">And -- and he -- he met Manfred and his cu -- then wife, Maria.</span> <span id="s2055">And he met their chil -- I mean, it was just -- for him it was like a picture gallery opening up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">Q: Wh-What were Mar -- I forgot to ask you, where were Marty’s family from?</span> <span id="s2057">They were from Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: Well, he -- they weren’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q: Originally.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: -- they were all born here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: Yeah, but before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: But originally they were Polish, yes.</span> <span id="s2063">His grandfather -- his grandfather was the one that, gran -- and grandmother.</span> <span id="s2064">His grandmother was from Lithuania.</span> <span id="s2065">His grandfather was from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2066">And they met in the United States, so already Marty’s father was born in -- in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2067">And his mother actually was born when his family -- when her family moved from Poland to -- to -- I guess it was the United States, but she was born in London, on the way.</span> <span id="s2068">And she was three when she came to the United States.</span> <span id="s2069">It was a funny thing because she never got the American citizenship.</span> <span id="s2070">Because it was past the time that when you married an American, you would get American citizenship.</span> <span id="s2071">And she never -- she said -- she always said -- you know, we asked her to come visit us in Europe.</span> <span id="s2072">That’s when all this came up.</span> <span id="s2073">She wasn’t a citizen, she didn’t have a passport.</span> <span id="s2074">She says, “I’m as American as anybody.”</span> <span id="s2075">I mean, she’d never been anywhere else.</span> <span id="s2076">She was three years when she came.</span> <span id="s2077">So she was very proud of it and she would not take the test.</span> <span id="s2078">She says, “I don’t have to take a test, I’ve never been anywhere.”</span> <span id="s2079">It was funny as heck.</span> <span id="s2080">She -- you know, she’s -- although she’d never been in a -- in Poland, she was -- she had all the sort of behavior, you know, that -- that comes from the east.</span> <span id="s2081">You know, th-the kind of bit of superstition and -- and nothing bad, you know, just -- just the kind of thing.</span> <span id="s2082">She cooked like a whiz.</span> <span id="s2083">You know, and it tasted better than anything I’d ever eaten.</span> <span id="s2084">You know, she -- she -- I don’t know what she did, probably chicken fat we -- we think now.</span> <span id="s2085">But it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2086">And her baking, it was heaven.</span> <span id="s2087">So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three.</span> <span id="s2088">So his parents really, you know, were Americans.</span> <span id="s2089">They had been born and raised here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2090">Q: He says something, let me find it [indecipherable] little -- End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2092">This is tape number four, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: -- tasted better than anything I’d ever eaten.</span> <span id="s2094">You know, she -- she -- I don’t know what she did, probably chicken fat we -- we think now.</span> <span id="s2095">But it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s2096">And her baking, it was heaven.</span> <span id="s2097">So -- so -- so as I say, she came when she was three.</span> <span id="s2098">So his parents really, you know, were Americans.</span> <span id="s2099">They had been born and raised here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">Q: He says something, let me find it [indecipherable] little article that he wrote.</span> <span id="s2101">I just wanted to ask you about it.</span> <span id="s2102">What did I do with it?</span> <span id="s2103">It was just an interesting -- well, one thing that he w -- that he acknowledges -- there’s something about your relationship to -- about his re -- his -- his involvement with European culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">A: Well, you know, he got very friendly with my Uncle Paul.</span> <span id="s2105">And Uncle Paul would take him places, I couldn’t always get away and he would take him places, so he met a lot of Paul’s buddies -- you know, his painting buddies and his co -- his other buddies.</span> <span id="s2106">People were alive then, who were older than my Uncle Paul, you know, and who -- who are real classics, now -- whole groups of Dutch painters.</span> <span id="s2107">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Oh yeah, here it is, he says, “The -- the year in Belgium and Holland, however, proved to be most important because of the cultural impact of European civilization on my life.</span> <span id="s2109">I have been wedded to Europe since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: Well, it was -- it was because of all the -- he finally saw it all and took it in, you know?</span> <span id="s2111">We traveled.</span> <span id="s2112">We -- we -- because we had help with the children, so we could travel and we took a big trip.</span> <span id="s2113">We drove, you know, around and we -- we went south.</span> <span id="s2114">We actually drove to Venice and took a boat to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">A: Yeah, because my Uncle Huntz, you know, he -- he was -- wait a mi -- was that in ‘61?</span> <span id="s2117">I think it was ‘61.</span> <span id="s2118">Huntz was back.</span> <span id="s2119">Why was Huntz back?</span> <span id="s2120">I think it was ‘61?</span> <span id="s2121">Or was that in ‘67?</span> <span id="s2122">We were in Geneva twice and I da -- I can’t keep it quite apart from each other.</span> <span id="s2123">I think it was ‘61.</span> <span id="s2124">Now, why would Huntz be in Israel in ‘61?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: This is Huntz or Heinz?</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: Huntz -- Huntz.</span> <span id="s2127">My mother’s family.</span></p> <p><span id="s2128">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">A: Huntz -- si -- cr -- Hanan Cidor -- he’s in -- in Israel he changed his name from Huntz to Hanan, which is spelled H-a-n-a-n, Hanan.</span> <span id="s2130">And s -- and he -- from Zeetroon, citron, from Zeetroon, he changed it to Cidor, C-i-d-o-r.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: C-i-d-o-r, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2132">A: d-o-r.</span> <span id="s2133">That means nothing.</span> <span id="s2134">That -- that’s just a name, Cidor.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2136">And what -- what was the purpose of the change?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: Well, he worked for the government and you should have an Israeli name.</span> <span id="s2138">It wasn’t just that he worked for the government, he wanted to have an Israeli name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">A: And that’s what he did.</span> <span id="s2141">So he changed it -- of course, again, he was not religious, but I remember when we were in Holland in ‘60 or ‘61, he -- we -- the first boy born after the war in the Jewish community, was Bar Mitzvahed at 13 and this boy was Harry -- Harry Zeetroon.</span> <span id="s2142">So in my family, the Zeetroon family.</span> <span id="s2143">And Huntz -- Hanan Cidor, who was the ambassador from Israel to the Netherlands did the officiating at it.</span> <span id="s2144">He wasn’t the rabbi, but he officiated at it, he was the representative of Israel, he was -- he wa -- he was the official maven there.</span> <span id="s2145">And that was quite an occasion.</span> <span id="s2146">I mean, the first boy Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s2147">And I’m actually surprised, because what happened to my cousin Steven, who was born in ‘46, if I’m right, what is that?</span> <span id="s2148">‘46 and 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">Q: Would be ‘59.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">A: So -- ‘59 -- so he should have been Bar Mitzvahed, he must have been the first.</span> <span id="s2151">This was ‘61.</span> <span id="s2152">So I don’t know what -- what the situation is.</span> <span id="s2153">Maybe he wasn’t Bar Mitzvahed, although I can’t believe --</span></p> <p><span id="s2154">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">A: It’s possible that he wasn’t Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: It was very interesting.</span> <span id="s2158">And we went to it, of course, we were invited.</span> <span id="s2159">And Hanan was not at all religious and so was that whole government in the beginning, wasn’t -- in Israel, wasn’t religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: So, was nothing special, but he knew what to do, you know, he was ri -- I mean they trained him to be representative of Israel.</span> <span id="s2162">And so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2164">So -- so tell -- tell me about your children and about being a mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s2166">Well, when I had Paul, that was my first one, that was in ‘53 and again, I had a breakdown.</span> <span id="s2167">I had Paul -- Paul was born in May.</span> <span id="s2168">May sixth, 1953 and I had no trouble carrying, I was very nauseous at the beginning and I got Vitamin B shots and then I had -- I was member of group health of Pugeot Sound, which is still in existence and one of the oldest of the group -- group health.</span> <span id="s2169">It was a wonderful organization at the time, just terrific.</span> <span id="s2170">And I had my baby in their hospital and it was very difficult, took a long time.</span> <span id="s2171">He had the cord wrapped around his neck and stuff.</span> <span id="s2172">But after I had him, the -- you know, how the first three days, before your milk comes in and all that?</span> <span id="s2173">I had a real breakdown, because I suddenly started missing my mother and started thinking about my -- th-this was like a huge shock to me.</span> <span id="s2174">I mean, there wasn’t anybody who really cared, I thought.</span> <span id="s2175">And there was nobody who cared about my baby, you know and me, that I had this child.</span> <span id="s2176">It meant nothing to anybody, except myself and Marty.</span> <span id="s2177">And I cried for three days and they -- they tried everything at that hospital.</span> <span id="s2178">You know, they finally took me out of the room -- I was with four -- three other people.</span> <span id="s2179">This was very helpful, actually.</span> <span id="s2180">They were all experienced mothers, I was the only first timer and they took me out and -- and they talked to me and said, “What is it?”</span> <span id="s2181">And I remember that I said to them, “Nobody cares.</span> <span id="s2182">I have this child, which is so special and my family --” and my -- in my Dutch German family, this was something fantastic, when you had a child.</span> <span id="s2183">I mean, it was rare, people didn’t have so many children.</span> <span id="s2184">Here, people had a lot of children, in my generation, they didn’t have many children and -- and -- my mother’s generation.</span> <span id="s2185">And I -- you know, and I cried and cried, nobody cares and my mother and that was -- you know, I wanted my mo -- my parents in the worst way.</span> <span id="s2186">And -- and they said, “But you have a wonderful husband, I mean he’s -- you know, very -- he’s everything anybody ever would want and -- and you know, he cares --” and they tried everything, you know?</span> <span id="s2187">But what -- it was a physical change as mu -- now I know, it was a physical thing as much as a mental situation.</span> <span id="s2188">And when the milk came in, I settled down and by the time I went home -- in those days, you stayed five, six days in the hospital and by that time, Marty’s mother and father had come.</span> <span id="s2189">And that was very helpful.</span> <span id="s2190">I wa --</span></p> <p><span id="s2191">Q: How did they get there?</span> <span id="s2192">I’m just curious, did they fly?</span></p> <p><span id="s2193">A: They drew -- they drove.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">Q: They drove?</span> <span id="s2195">From Baltimore to Seattle?</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: Baltimore, yes.</span> <span id="s2197">They had -- they took -- a fa -- his father was retired then and they drove very slowly across country, stayed in various places and then they -- me -- they’ve had it figured out just right.</span> <span id="s2198">And they -- and she -- people said, “We asked, are the Rodbell’s moving?</span> <span id="s2199">Because your mother-in-law emptied out this little house that we had and put everything out in the grass and cleaned the place.”</span> <span id="s2200">She was a fabulous cleaner, I never caught up --</span></p> <p><span id="s2201">Q: Your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2202">A: yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2203">Q: Your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2204">A: Yes, well, when you say house, you know it was -- th-the University of Washington had -- all the universities were packed after the war and they didn’t have housing for their students and -- grad students or anybody, and -- not enough.</span> <span id="s2205">And there was this influx of soldiers, you know, re -- people who came back from the army and they -- we finally got a little house and this was -- the army -- the officers houses from the army.</span> <span id="s2206">So these were shacks, you know, they were shacks and -- and we had a-an entrance that had a stove in it.</span> <span id="s2207">Now, let’s see -- gee, I guess it was already the real stove.</span> <span id="s2208">It wasn’t the barracks, it was a little house by itself.</span> <span id="s2209">And it just had a living room, that had a kitchen along it -- a Pullman type kitchen, you know?</span> <span id="s2210">One bedroom, a small bathroom.</span> <span id="s2211">I guess it had a shower, it surely had no bath and -- and a closet.</span> <span id="s2212">I think -- that was all it was.</span> <span id="s2213">So that was -- and the furniture we bought at the Goodwill, you know?</span> <span id="s2214">But it was -- looked very nice.</span> <span id="s2215">And all put together, you know, different things.</span> <span id="s2216">If I didn’t like something, I put -- I bought a piece of cloth at the materials she -- at the shop and put it over it.</span> <span id="s2217">You know, decorate it over.</span> <span id="s2218">But she cleaned it all, you know, by the time I came home, that was spic and span, whatever there was of it.</span> <span id="s2219">And they stayed in a hotel -- I mean, they couldn’t stay with us.</span> <span id="s2220">So she cooked and she took care, you know, and she saw Paul and they saw it, so -- for -- that was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2221">Q: You -- you got along well?</span></p> <p><span id="s2222">A: Well, yes, we got along, but not we -- not very much.</span> <span id="s2223">They also would have liked Marty to marry somebody with some money and some -- you know -- I think they were disappointed.</span> <span id="s2224">I’m sure they were, yeah.</span> <span id="s2225">She didn’t take care well, of my things.</span> <span id="s2226">You know, I had rug -- I had some -- some Or-Oriental rugs and they got wet in the basement and they just threw it out.</span> <span id="s2227">They didn’t know what was good, really.</span> <span id="s2228">And -- but they -- and what they did was, they went into my -- into my trunk and they got out the pictures to see about my history and stuff.</span> <span id="s2229">They didn’t trust -- they also sent somebody to my -- before we married, they sent s -- a d -- they ha -- they asked somebody to go see my uncle -- my Uncle Bep Person to see what kind of family it was.</span> <span id="s2230">You kn -- if it was true, what I had told.</span> <span id="s2231">I mean, here was this girl, alone, living thi -- and there was no family with it, nothing.</span> <span id="s2232">[doorbell] This I have to answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2233">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2234">[inaudible] At what point did you ever find out the fate of your parents and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2235">A: Ah, never.</span> <span id="s2236">Well, no that’s not true.</span> <span id="s2237">I was trying to get a death certificate, because I couldn’t inherit -- I couldn’t -- I couldn’t lay claim to anything.</span> <span id="s2238">Not that there was much, or anything, actually.</span> <span id="s2239">But I couldn’t -- there was no proof of anything, you know, that I had a right -- why did I need it?</span> <span id="s2240">There was some reason that I needed a death certificate and there wasn’t any and so the Red Cross, at a certain point, in 19 -- I don’t know exactly the date, but they gave a blanket death certificate to all the peop -- because of this, th-the inability to inhe -- you know and the inability go on with your life, practically.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: They gave a blanket death certificate.</span> <span id="s2243">But I had heard -- I knew th-they -- I found out -- somebody told me what transport they had gone on, which was November 19th, 1953.</span> <span id="s2244">That they were sent to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s2245">Q: Say what -- what was the date?</span></p> <p><span id="s2246">A: November 19th, I think, 1943, that they were sent to Auschwitz and that particular --</span></p> <p><span id="s2247">Q: Three -- three of them go?</span> <span id="s2248">Your sister too?</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2250">And that particular transport was immediately sent to the ovens.</span> <span id="s2251">It never -- you know how in other transports, there was right and left, sort of?</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2253">A: This, no.</span> <span id="s2254">This particular transport, they were not tortured first.</span> <span id="s2255">They were killed right away.</span> <span id="s2256">And that the Red Cross knew.</span> <span id="s2257">And they knew that they had been in that parti -- because Westerbork had records.</span> <span id="s2258">You know, the collection place in Holland had records.</span></p> <p><span id="s2259">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2260">A: And they knew that that transport went to Auschwitz at a certain date and Auschwitz had records and -- they knew that that whole transport was killed the day it arrived, which was maybe the 20 -- the 23rd of November, 24th of November.</span> <span id="s2261">And one thing that’s always gotten me is that I keep thinking, what did I do that day?</span> <span id="s2262">I mean, you know?</span> <span id="s2263">That is so -- that is something that got stuck in my mind.</span> <span id="s2264">You know, another reason I know when they left, is because my Uncle Heinz was there in Westerbork.</span> <span id="s2265">He saw them go.</span> <span id="s2266">His mother was on the same transport.</span> <span id="s2267">My Aunt Kait, my father’s oldest sister.</span> <span id="s2268">So -- so she had been underground, but she had been given away by somebody and she was -- she was in that same transport.</span> <span id="s2269">So that they all went together.</span> <span id="s2270">And -- and that’s something, you know, I think, what did I do?</span> <span id="s2271">What did I do?</span> <span id="s2272">As a -- it’s an incredible thing.</span> <span id="s2273">Of course, you don’t know what goes on.</span> <span id="s2274">I mean, you know I can be -- sit here and Marty can -- you know, something happens to him at the hospital two, three blocks away and I don’t know what goes on.</span> <span id="s2275">And in the war, you didn’t know what went on three blocks away, unless somebody told you.</span> <span id="s2276">You know, it just -- I mean that -- the way I escaped, for instance, you know, the people did not know the -- M-Manfred did not know what had happened in our part of Amsterdam, the part where I had been.</span> <span id="s2277">Well, this is all on the other tape, but you never know what went -- what went on.</span> <span id="s2278">No, unless you heard shooting, you didn’t know somebody had been killed.</span> <span id="s2279">You know, it’s just -- it’s -- it’s an in -- absolutely incredible things.</span> <span id="s2280">And -- and -- and guilt, let’s talk about guilt.</span> <span id="s2281">I -- I -- I think I have less guilt feelings than most people and I don’t know why that is.</span> <span id="s2282">I often think that I have not as much sensibility as other people.</span> <span id="s2283">And it worries me.</span> <span id="s2284">But -- but maybe it is because I decided to do what I did, you know?</span> <span id="s2285">I decided to escape.</span> <span id="s2286">And that I don’t think that putting yourself in danger, in any way, makes you a better person.</span> <span id="s2287">I think it makes you a stupid person, if you have a choice.</span> <span id="s2288">If you have a choice -- like people who climb Mount Everest, if they die, hm.</span> <span id="s2289">Whose fault is that?</span> <span id="s2290">If you have a choice and you put yourself in danger -- and I had a choice.</span> <span id="s2291">I didn’t know whether I was going to make it -- you know, whether I was -- do you know what I’m talking about?</span> <span id="s2292">When I escaped from -- that was the day they were taken away, I escaped.</span> <span id="s2293">So, anyway, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: They day that -- that who was taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: My parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: You escaped?</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yeah, I escaped fr-from the situation that they were tak --</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: But you had already escaped, hadn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: Weren’t you already separated from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: I was, but I’d gone back home.</span> <span id="s2302">I was home the day it all happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: So -- so I -- I -- I’m -- I did it, I made -- made up my mind and I tell you, when I went to Holland and we went for the documentary, that your --</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">A: They took me to the bridge that I escaped from.</span> <span id="s2307">We didn’t know exactly which bridge it was, but I remembered that I tried three bridges and it was the last one, I succeeded to get over.</span> <span id="s2308">The first two didn’t succeed.</span> <span id="s2309">And we went to that bridge and I looked at it -- now this is 50 some years ago, you know?</span> <span id="s2310">And I thought -- and things have changed a little bit in the neighborhood, but not too much on that side.</span> <span id="s2311">And it -- it was a shock, you know?</span> <span id="s2312">I’d never been back there, consciously.</span> <span id="s2313">And there was that damn bridge and I just saw this guy standing there, the one who let me out.</span> <span id="s2314">I tell you, I -- and -- and to go to my house.</span> <span id="s2315">To go to my apartment, where we lived, on the Notaramstellat.</span> <span id="s2316">And to -- to ride in the trolley.</span> <span id="s2317">We rode in the trolley that I escaped from and do you know that I miss -- that I thought that the trolley that I escaped on was the trolley that was in front of my house.</span> <span id="s2318">It turns out it was the one across the street.</span> <span id="s2319">The one in front of my house went the other way.</span> <span id="s2320">I had it wrong.</span> <span id="s2321">Either I had it wrong, or they changed.</span> <span id="s2322">I -- I -- I still would like to find that out.</span> <span id="s2323">But they filmed in the trolley.</span> <span id="s2324">I didn’t escape the second time on that trolley, the fir -- I escaped twice.</span> <span id="s2325">And the first time, I was on -- I did it on the trolley.</span> <span id="s2326">The second time, there was no trolley.</span> <span id="s2327">And I had to walk to the bridge.</span> <span id="s2328">But anyway, it -- it -- it -- I often think that this feeling that I don’t feel so guilty that I am alive.</span> <span id="s2329">I feel terrible, terrible, about them not being alive and about my sister.</span> <span id="s2330">That’s the worst thing.</span> <span id="s2331">Because I remember Manfred telling my parents, “If anything happens, please put her in the hideaway.”</span> <span id="s2332">There was a hideaway in the house.</span> <span id="s2333">“Please put her in there, please put her in there” And as I left, I said, “Susan-Susanna, you go in that hiding place.</span> <span id="s2334">They won’t come.</span> <span id="s2335">It’s too big a rattsia, it’s too big a pogrom, it’s too big a pick up situation.</span> <span id="s2336">They cannot go into every house, they won’t go into every house.”</span> <span id="s2337">And they didn’t.</span> <span id="s2338">She could have been there and we could have gotten her out.</span> <span id="s2339">But she was three years younger than I was, so that means I was -- she was 14.</span> <span id="s2340">And in those days, 14 was a very little girl and she didn’t want to leave her parents.</span> <span id="s2341">And they didn’t force her to.</span> <span id="s2342">There were some parents who sent their kids to England.</span> <span id="s2343">There were some paren -- which was horrible.</span> <span id="s2344">There were some parents like -- like this girl Fink, I told you about, who handed their kids over to people.</span> <span id="s2345">But my parents didn’t do this to Susan.</span> <span id="s2346">They didn’t tell her to stay in there.</span> <span id="s2347">I said we would send somebody to get her, you know?</span> <span id="s2348">And they did not do this, they -- we did -- we -- Manfred went in the evening, when all was dark and was quiet, you couldn’t see anything that had happened in that neighborhood.</span> <span id="s2349">And -- which was a very mixed neighborhood and people were on the streets and everything was normal.</span> <span id="s2350">And Manfred went into -- I had the key, after all and he went into the house and he took out a lot of silver and he took out a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s2351">Rugs he took out and everything, that -- which we sold to live during the occupation.</span> <span id="s2352">So he could safely do that un-under cover of darkness and with his false papers, which were quite excellent.</span> <span id="s2353">They said that he was a German and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s2354">And -- but Susanna wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s2355">You know, he went there to get her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: I’m sorry, cause maybe I didn’t quite pick up the whole story from the video tape, but just explain to me -- you had -- you had already left the family and were already working underground?</span></p> <p><span id="s2357">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">Q: Right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2359">A: I was already underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s2360">Q: And I know that there was some tension, because there was a fear that you had that if it was understood that you had gone underground, that your parents might get in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">A: Well, that was their fear.</span> <span id="s2362">We -- we were saying it won’t make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: What -- what the Germans said was, they put in you in a s -- they’re going to put you in a special barrack and you will sent -- be -- be sent away before anybody else.</span> <span id="s2365">That’s what they had said.</span> <span id="s2366">Now the thing was, where would they send you?</span> <span id="s2367">You would die one way or you would die a -- this is what Manfred told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: He said, “Dev -- dead is dead and there won’t be any difference.</span> <span id="s2370">So you come and you go underground.”</span> <span id="s2371">But let me explain to you.</span> <span id="s2372">I had gone underground and I was living somewhere else and it was a holiday, the 20th of June.</span> <span id="s2373">And my f -- my father called, or I called home to see how things were and he said, “Please come.</span> <span id="s2374">Please, please, please.</span> <span id="s2375">We haven’t seen you in eight -- in so many months,” I forget how many months.</span> <span id="s2376">“Please come, you know.</span> <span id="s2377">We’re still here, it does -- seems okay, you know, and it’s not to be too dangerous.”</span> <span id="s2378">So I told Manfred -- I wasn’t living with him then, I was living in a poncion, in a boarding house.</span> <span id="s2379">And -- and he said, “Don’t go.</span> <span id="s2380">I don’t think anything will happen, in particular, but why would you make -- endanger yourself like that?”</span> <span id="s2381">I hadn’t been wearing a star, I had been underground.</span> <span id="s2382">Had good pa -- not good papers, but I had some papers.</span> <span id="s2383">And, “You shouldn’t endanger yourself like that.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Just to travel?</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: Just to go from -- no -- yes, to go from -- and be there.</span> <span id="s2386">Why should you go somewhere where something could happen, you know?</span> <span id="s2387">And of course I did want to see my parents.</span> <span id="s2388">And I went to friends of ours, a Jewish friend and I put on my star, very lightly, just at the points.</span> <span id="s2389">And I went to see my parents.</span> <span id="s2390">And that same night, somebody came to see us and told us what was going to happen in our neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s2391">Q: Which was?</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">A: A big rattsia.</span> <span id="s2393">An enormous pogrom.</span> <span id="s2394">An enormous pick up of Jewish people.</span> <span id="s2395">Very mixed neighborhood, so it wasn’t like it was all going to be emptied out.</span> <span id="s2396">They’re going to -- were going to be people there.</span> <span id="s2397">And for instance, the people called Erstrasher, you know Liesel, Emma and Maria Austria and all of them, they were there when -- when that big rattsia happened and they did what I asked my parents to do with Su-Susie.</span> <span id="s2398">They went in a hiding place that they had, upstairs.</span> <span id="s2399">They did the same thing, we had double walls.</span> <span id="s2400">They sat in the double wall.</span> <span id="s2401">They had a dr -- a drawers that they pulled toward them.</span> <span id="s2402">They had a handle on the back of drawers and they pulled it -- from the hole in the wall, they pulled it toward them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: So if people would come up, it wouldn’t look like enis -- anybody there.</span> <span id="s2405">It was a Sunday.</span> <span id="s2406">On Sunday people go away.</span> <span id="s2407">They -- it was a beautiful day, it was June, you know, people go for walking, they go fo -- to the beach and do -- go whatever.</span> <span id="s2408">And -- so they didn’t have to be there.</span> <span id="s2409">The Germans came, there were loudspeakers, they were saying all Jews have to prepare themselves, nobody else is allowed on the street.</span> <span id="s2410">And so, the Jews just went downstairs and went on there.</span> <span id="s2411">On -- on the wagons, the cars that they had, the trucks.</span> <span id="s2412">But the ones that didn’t come, didn’t come.</span> <span id="s2413">And the Germans did not go and eve -- if they knocked on doors, which I don’t know if they did, if people didn’t answer, they didn’t break the doors down.</span> <span id="s2414">They didn’t come.</span> <span id="s2415">There were too many people involved.</span> <span id="s2416">Crowds of people, crowds of Jews that came down.</span> <span id="s2417">Everybody -- all the others stood at the windows watching, after all.</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: Wh-What -- and -- but wasn’t there a sense that there was great danger?</span> <span id="s2419">To get on the transport?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">A: Of course they knew if was danger, but they si -- that was the rule.</span> <span id="s2421">I mean, most people do what they’re told to do, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">Q: And just that -- so I understand, in -- in relationship, time-wise, wh -- at what point did the Franks go into hiding?</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">A: Oh, way ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">Q: What -- much before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">A: They went -- they went into hiding when Margot, in the beginning, you see, in ‘42, people were called up by name.</span> <span id="s2426">And Margot Frank got a letter -- a note which said she had to be at the train station on that and that date, at that and that time.</span> <span id="s2427">And she had to bring a rucksack, she couldn’t take more than a small -- etcetera.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2429">But you’re -- and your parents knew that they had gone in to hiding, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: No.</span> <span id="s2431">We didn’t know they had gone into hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">Q: Where did you think they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">A: In Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: Some people -- people with money could escape and the Franks had -- you know, they might be -- get caught, but they tried.</span> <span id="s2436">And -- and -- but the Franks had family in -- be -- in Basil, we knew that.</span> <span id="s2437">And that was the rumor that was spread, because they had a person who was renting a room in their house.</span> <span id="s2438">And he was there and I remember going there, asking -- wanting to ask Margot to come out -- to -- to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: And he opened the door and he said, “Oh no, they’re gone.</span> <span id="s2441">They went to Switzerland.”</span> <span id="s2442">That -- they wanted him to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: And that’s -- that’s exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s2445">Of course I spread the rumor.</span> <span id="s2446">People were asking, “Well, where are the Franks?”</span> <span id="s2447">I said, “I guess they went to Switzerland.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2449">So you found out that th-there was going to be this round up and you did what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: And we -- we found out that -- about the round up.</span> <span id="s2451">Amazingly a lot -- enough, through a woman that -- whom we always had called Cassandra.</span> <span id="s2452">She came and she told us.</span> <span id="s2453">And at that point, my father had always said, “No, don’t go -- don’t go underground,” because of what we mentioned before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">A: This time he said, “Go.”</span> <span id="s2456">And -- and my mother, w-we -- I couldn’t take anything, because they thought, if I get picked up with anything, you know what I’m --</span></p> <p><span id="s2457">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">A: So I just took a towel, a bathing suit and my toothbrush, or something.</span> <span id="s2459">I forget what I took.</span> <span id="s2460">A -- a piece of soap maybe, for a --</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">A: As if I was at the pool.</span> <span id="s2463">I don’t want to tell that story.</span> <span id="s2464">But anyway, that was when I tri -- went by the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2466">A: -- bridges, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: And you took your star off?</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Oh yes, the star was off.</span> <span id="s2469">And -- but I was the only one on the street, because Jews had to get ready and they had an hour to get ready and no gentiles were allowed, nobody else was allowed on the street.</span> <span id="s2470">But I was on the street.</span> <span id="s2471">So anyway, that always gives me the shakes.</span> <span id="s2472">And I tell it on the other tapes, I -- Q: No, I -- I know.</span> <span id="s2473">I’m sorry to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">A: So -- but we went to my house -- my apartment and I -- I looked up and I saw that there were lamps and things sort of leaning up against the window and I thought, “There’s something wrong.</span> <span id="s2475">There’s probably nobody there.</span> <span id="s2476">Maybe they’re painting -- they’re painting, or something.</span> <span id="s2477">And the woman underneath us -- th-there was a woman und -- at the window, watching the filming, which they did in front of our house, of me.</span> <span id="s2478">They filmed me walking up to the house and looking up, etcetera, etcetera, as you do.</span> <span id="s2479">And she saw that.</span> <span id="s2480">So they -- Barbara rang the bell at her house and said, “Look, could we -- since this doesn’t seem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?”</span> <span id="s2481">And they said yes.</span> <span id="s2482">Now this apartment was a little different from ours, because ours was two levels.</span> <span id="s2483">We had an downstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -- done a beautiful job redoing her house.</span> <span id="s2484">It was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s2485">And I saw again what a lovely neighborhood that was.</span> <span id="s2486">I mean, it really was and -- but it was just unbelievable.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s2488">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Me-Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2489">This is tape number four, side B.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">A: We -- since this doesn’t seem to be anybody up there, could we come in your house?”</span> <span id="s2491">And they said yes.</span> <span id="s2492">Now this apartment was a little different from ours, because ours was two levels.</span> <span id="s2493">We had an downstairs and an upstairs and hers was just one level, but she had a -- done a beautiful job redoing her house.</span> <span id="s2494">It was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s2495">And I saw again what a lovely neighborhood that was.</span> <span id="s2496">I mean, it really was, and -- but it was just unbelievable to be in there.</span> <span id="s2497">Just -- just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s2498">What had happened upstairs was that these people, who had lived there all the time, since 19 -- I don’t know what -- just after the war, I guess.</span> <span id="s2499">They had just died.</span> <span id="s2500">They had just died and their -- their children were cleaning up the apartment and they didn’t feel that anybody could be in there, which was logical.</span> <span id="s2501">So that’s why we went to the apartment underneath there.</span> <span id="s2502">Yeah, and we looked -- I looked out of the window and I saw this -- what I always used to see.</span> <span id="s2503">Nothing had changed there.</span> <span id="s2504">What had changed is the store -- there was a store on the corner and that had changed.</span> <span id="s2505">Was -- it’s a dentist now, which is not nice, instead of a -- a baker, yes I think, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">Q: So te-tell me a little bit more about this transition to motherhood and having your own children and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">Q: -- and building a family once again.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">A: Well, it -- it -- it felt like old hat.</span> <span id="s2510">I mean -- I -- it felt like I should have done it all the time.</span> <span id="s2511">I mean, I was 25.</span> <span id="s2512">I -- no, really I was older, I was 27 and a half, maybe, when I had my first child.</span> <span id="s2513">We were married when I was 25 and I had my first child in 1953.</span> <span id="s2514">We were married in ‘50.</span> <span id="s2515">Two and a half years.</span> <span id="s2516">And I f -- it felt absolutely wonderful.</span> <span id="s2517">I mean, I had a wonderful mother, I had a caring surroundings as a child myself, and I guess the way you do, you pass it on.</span> <span id="s2518">And that -- we have a wonderful family.</span> <span id="s2519">We all -- we all get along and -- and it’s very loving with all of them and very close.</span> <span id="s2520">I have one daughter and three sons and the boys are wonderful.</span> <span id="s2521">As nice, as wonderful as the daughter and it’s just -- it’s just been very good.</span> <span id="s2522">And, to my great surprise, when I was mentioning that you were coming, and also during discussion of the -- during discussion of the film that was being -- was made, I asked them these questions which I had never asked them.</span> <span id="s2523">“We-Were you influenced at all by my having had this history?”</span> <span id="s2524">Because I never felt that we were in any way different from anybody else.</span> <span id="s2525">And they said, “Well, we didn’t have any family.</span> <span id="s2526">We didn’t have much family.”</span> <span id="s2527">Well, we had Marty’s family, but they’re very small family.</span> <span id="s2528">Marty had one sibling and he’s not close with her.</span> <span id="s2529">Sh-She’s six years younger.</span> <span id="s2530">And his father died early and his mother was a bit s-strange and -- but she came, so we had some connection with his mother.</span> <span id="s2531">We weren’t enemies in any way, we were friendly with his mother, although not close.</span> <span id="s2532">He did -- never cared too much for his mother.</span> <span id="s2533">And so that was something they did care about.</span> <span id="s2534">Now, we had many friends and they had children and we had a close knit group, so I had lot -- they had lots of people around.</span> <span id="s2535">We have lots of pictures of Sunday brunches.</span> <span id="s2536">We always gave Sunday brunches.</span> <span id="s2537">And we had lunch of -- lots of parties and we had people in the neighborhood and people from his work and we always had a very lively surroundings.</span> <span id="s2538">It wasn’t that they felt lonely.</span> <span id="s2539">But they did -- now, they all married people with big families.</span> <span id="s2540">Which was ju -- is -- is maybe not surprising.</span> <span id="s2541">I mean, after the war, people had lots of kids, so they had lots -- we had four kids, after all, you know?</span> <span id="s2542">And these kids have family -- have -- have siblings.</span> <span id="s2543">And they say, “Oh, I come from -- my -- my husband or wife has lots of family,” because they have four -- you know, they have three siblings.</span> <span id="s2544">So they all have huge families on the other side.</span> <span id="s2545">All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2546">Q: Now what -- what -- what do they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2547">A: Paul is a small businessman.</span> <span id="s2548">He has a degree in business and in geology, a small degree in geology and a big degree in business.</span> <span id="s2549">But he is in business and he’s in business for himself.</span> <span id="s2550">Now, one thing, he can’t stand authority, so he can’t really work for anybody.</span> <span id="s2551">But he works for himself, he does very interesting things.</span> <span id="s2552">He goes to South America, that’s one of his things there.</span> <span id="s2553">He -- and -- and he buys goods and he sells them.</span> <span id="s2554">He sells wholesale and he sells on the street, sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2555">Q: And where is he living?</span></p> <p><span id="s2556">A: And he lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, so in the same area that we lived in all the time.</span> <span id="s2557">He’s not married.</span> <span id="s2558">And I keep thinking, is that anything to do with our history?</span> <span id="s2559">He says that he has felt different from other people his age and his group, as long as he can remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s2560">Q: Because?</span></p> <p><span id="s2561">A: And that is very strange to me.</span> <span id="s2562">Because of me.</span> <span id="s2563">Or because of him knowing what he -- his background, you know, his grandparents -- happened to his grandparents and this and that.</span> <span id="s2564">Now, I want to tell you, we never discussed it.</span> <span id="s2565">I mean, we talked about it, if it came up.</span> <span id="s2566">You know, if there was something in the paper about the Holocaust or about the war, we discussed it.</span> <span id="s2567">Dad -- Marty told about the Pacific war and what he -- what happened to him and I would te -- or he told a lot about -- about China, where he was -- eight months he was in China.</span> <span id="s2568">And I -- and they would ask me and I did tell.</span> <span id="s2569">I told a little bit, but never from a gruesome kind of point of view, you know?</span> <span id="s2570">I did not see a dead person, all during the war.</span> <span id="s2571">As impossible as that seemed, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s2572">We weren’t bombed to any degree in Amsterdam.</span> <span id="s2573">And I never worked in the underground where you killed people or did anything like that.</span> <span id="s2574">And you know, there was nothing that I would tell that would scare them in any way.</span> <span id="s2575">But I remember that when it was brought up in school -- and it was, you know, when he had history and -- or something at school, in high school -- that they came back with these tales and that they asked me, you know, “Was it like this?”</span> <span id="s2576">And, “Was it like that?”</span> <span id="s2577">And -- and h -- they hated the Germans.</span> <span id="s2578">I mean they just hated them.</span> <span id="s2579">I didn’t hate them at all.</span> <span id="s2580">I mean, I -- I look at people as people and I don’t expect too much from them.</span> <span id="s2581">I don’t expect from an -- an average person to put himself in danger for anybody else, not even for themselves.</span> <span id="s2582">Most people just go along with what’s going on where they live.</span> <span id="s2583">It takes character to -- or -- it takes character or it takes absolute willpower to -- to be an ideologue of some sort.</span> <span id="s2584">To -- to act differently than your surroundings.</span> <span id="s2585">And there are very few people who would do that, you know?</span> <span id="s2586">Very few people who stand up and -- up and say, “Do me something, but I feel this and that way.”</span> <span id="s2587">You know, bang.</span> <span id="s2588">I mean, what’s the good of it?</span> <span id="s2589">So -- so you don’t expect too much.</span> <span id="s2590">You don’t expect people to be other than normal in trying to stay alive.</span> <span id="s2591">That seems to be the human condition.</span> <span id="s2592">The -- the necessity to stay alive, really overcomes all other concerns that a person might have.</span> <span id="s2593">And people will do nearly anything to -- of ne -- of -- of momentary necessity to achieve that goal, the goal of staying alive.</span> <span id="s2594">They sometimes will kill, because staying alive might say -- might need food and if there is very little food, you have to -- might have to do something to get it.</span> <span id="s2595">I often think of that when we’re stand in line at the grocery store.</span> <span id="s2596">I think we can be -- we can afford to be friendly, because we know there’s plenty more in the store, you know?</span> <span id="s2597">But if there isn’t -- so the human condition is very, very weak and shaky and it’s built on certain assumptions, the assumptions of the moment.</span> <span id="s2598">The assumption of -- that there is enough food and there’s good water and there is good this and that and that is the wrong assumption.</span> <span id="s2599">And you have to do something for it.</span> <span id="s2600">And to do something for it might be difficult.</span> <span id="s2601">Like what you told me about the underground water being polluted in certain --</span></p> <p><span id="s2602">Q: On -- on Cape Cod, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2603">A: On Cape Cod.</span></p> <p><span id="s2604">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2605">A: I mean -- the government would have to be extremely strong.</span> <span id="s2606">It would have to say, “We have to clean it up.”</span> <span id="s2607">And it costs a lot of money and people don’t think, they don’t think that if we don’t clean it up, nobody can drink the water any more, including my own children.</span> <span id="s2608">They forget that if they don’t clean up the air, they themselves and their children will not be able to breathe.</span> <span id="s2609">Not just the poor schnooks who happen to live in that area.</span> <span id="s2610">And -- and there is -- there are all sorts of wrong assumptions.</span></p> <p><span id="s2611">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2612">A: Momentary -- that’s why I say momentary.</span> <span id="s2613">Only think of the moment and not --</span></p> <p><span id="s2614">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2615">A: -- of any future situations that come out of the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2616">Q: So let’s get back to the chil -- the other three children.</span></p> <p><span id="s2617">A: Other three children.</span> <span id="s2618">My daughter’s married, she has a degree from Berkeley.</span></p> <p><span id="s2619">Q: Her name is?</span></p> <p><span id="s2620">A: She’s number two.</span></p> <p><span id="s2621">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2622">A: Suzanne.</span></p> <p><span id="s2623">Q: She named after your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2624">A: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s2625">Q: She named after your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s2626">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2627">Paul is named after my Uncle Paul, who is the painter and Suzanne was named after my sister.</span> <span id="s2628">I just wrote her with a Z rather than an S, which sounds better in English.</span> <span id="s2629">And her second name is my mother’s name, it’s Louise, which ma -- was my mother’s second name, because my mother’s first name is Ilse, I-l-s-e and that’s not good in English.</span></p> <p><span id="s2630">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2631">A: Nobody would know how to say it.</span> <span id="s2632">So -- so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2633">Q: The middle name is Louise.</span></p> <p><span id="s2634">A: Ilse Louisa, it was my mother’s name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2635">Q: Louisa, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2636">A: And so Suzie’s middle name is Louisa, after my mother.</span> <span id="s2637">She was loaded down with -- Suzie’s extremely bright, extremely bright and -- and very active and she married a terribly nice guy, lee -- named Douglas Burton Richardson, from Michigan, a ge -- an geographer, Ph.D. geographer, who had a business having to do with computers and satellites and wonderful, current things.</span> <span id="s2638">And they’re working like dogs, both of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2639">Q: She works with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s2640">A: She did work with him, when -- when it was really necessary.</span> <span id="s2641">She worked very, very hard and -- but now it’s not necessary, so they just bought a second home on Chesapeake Bay and we keep hoping that something good will happen and they don’t have to work so hard any more.</span> <span id="s2642">Such as selling, maybe, their business or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s2643">Q: She have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s2644">A: She has two children, one of which is Sara Richardson, Sara who -- and her name is Sara Simone and she’s, you know, the one who is going to go to Columbia.</span> <span id="s2645">And a wonderful second daughter named Alexa.</span> <span id="s2646">Let’s see, Alexa Rose Richardson, who’s a wonderful girl, 12 years old, plays the cello.</span> <span id="s2647">Hopes to be a musician, but anyway is -- is a great baseball player and very athletic, tennis player.</span> <span id="s2648">And then there is -- after Suzie there is Andrew.</span> <span id="s2649">Andrew is married and has three sons, one of whom came with his wife, so he has actually two sons.</span> <span id="s2650">And he lives also up there in Bethesda.</span> <span id="s2651">And he is a video editor.</span> <span id="s2652">And he has both his own business and he is working for a company.</span> <span id="s2653">He’s a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s2654">He’s extremely loving and caring and a great parent and husband and -- and just a -- very special kind of person.</span> <span id="s2655">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s2656">Q: And the names of his children are, just to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2657">A: Oh, the -- the name of his children?</span> <span id="s2658">There is Eric Martin, who is named after Marty and -- Eric Martin and Max Hendrick and that’s an interesting name, because Max is Marty’s grandfather’s name and Hendrick is my grandfather’s name.</span> <span id="s2659">So Max Hendrick Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2660">So that’s very -- a nice name.</span> <span id="s2661">Eric was a preemie and we hope things will go well with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2662">Q: How old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2663">A: He’s very small.</span> <span id="s2664">Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">Q: How -- how old are they?</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">A: Eric is six and Max Hendrick is three.</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s2668">And the other -- and there’s one more boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s2669">A: Then there is the one that is --</span></p> <p><span id="s2670">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2671">A: -- her child.</span> <span id="s2672">And that’s Jonathan and Jonathan is nine.</span> <span id="s2673">So that’s -- that’s him and then there’s the youngest one, that’s Philip.</span> <span id="s2674">And Philip is the one who was seven months old and spoke Dutch before he spoke English.</span> <span id="s2675">And there’s still a few funny things he says.</span> <span id="s2676">He says “Ohven” instead of oven.</span> <span id="s2677">And he says, “Pannacooker”, pancakes.</span> <span id="s2678">Pannacooker, which was the du -- so Philip is in Boston and he’s married and he has two little girls and let me see, that’s Sophie -- is it Sophie Androse?</span> <span id="s2679">Yes, I think it’s Sophie Androse Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2680">And -- and his second child is Phoebe Hilton Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2681">So -- her family is from up there -- from -- from Maine, her mother’s family is from Maine and her father’s family is from New Hampshire.</span></p> <p><span id="s2682">Q: And Philip does what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2683">A: And Philip is -- well he’s a -- he’s a forester -- an urban f --</span></p> <p><span id="s2684">Q: Oh, that’s right, you told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2685">A: He’s an urban forester.</span></p> <p><span id="s2686">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2687">You told me he goes --</span></p> <p><span id="s2688">A: So he takes care of the trees in all of Massachusetts in the towns and the -- and the parks in between the towns.</span> <span id="s2689">So it’s a very interesting job.</span> <span id="s2690">He’s supposed to get news and information out to the population -- to the general population.</span></p> <p><span id="s2691">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2692">A: And he’s organizing the various towns and he gets -- he tries to gets grants that he can give to the various towns or can divide.</span> <span id="s2693">They can ask his office for money to rebuild and build woods or are -- parks or street trees or areas around town.</span></p> <p><span id="s2694">Q: Were -- were any of the boys or all -- all of the boys Bar Mitzvahed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2695">A: None.</span> <span id="s2696">None of them were.</span></p> <p><span id="s2697">Q: None of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s2698">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2699">Q: And you said -- and you told me before that none of them -- none of the children -- well, the three that were married --</span></p> <p><span id="s2700">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2701">Q: -- have married Jewish people?</span></p> <p><span id="s2702">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2703">Q: And that -- how do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2704">A: I feel fine about it.</span> <span id="s2705">I feel very fine about it.</span> <span id="s2706">And I think it has to do with -- with something very stupid and -- and of course goes back to my background, that I feel that there’s more secure, if they’re not all Jewish -- the children.</span> <span id="s2707">And that -- you know, this is going back to Hitler, I mean.</span> <span id="s2708">Nothing like this might ever happen in the same kind of way as it happened in Europe in the -- in the 40’s, but y-you can only protect yourself against what you know, and this is what I know.</span> <span id="s2709">So -- so -- however limited it is.</span> <span id="s2710">And I do not really -- I would not -- I do not really believe in any religion -- in religion per se, I should say.</span> <span id="s2711">So I would not like any of the in-laws to be religious, and they’re not.</span> <span id="s2712">None of them and their families are in any way religious.</span> <span id="s2713">But the danger exists in my mind, you know, that -- that one of the children will end up religious.</span> <span id="s2714">It’s up to them, they can go a -- whichever way they want and it’s their choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2715">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2716">A: I think the important thing here is choice and I do not choose it.</span> <span id="s2717">I did not cheese -- choose the people they married, either.</span> <span id="s2718">And so I -- you know, that’s their business.</span></p> <p><span id="s2719">Q: Do -- do you think that your -- your experience -- the experience of the -- what -- what happened to your family, your parents, did it affect in any way, your belief in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s2720">A: I cannot say that has.</span> <span id="s2721">I cannot think that I was ever religious in any which way.</span> <span id="s2722">When we were in Holland, the Franks and us, there was -- you know, in the -- not right away, but when times got bad -- w-we got there in ‘33, I don’t know -- I think about ‘38 or nine or something, they set up a -- a Reform kind of temp -- you know, religious group.</span> <span id="s2723">There was no Temple, but there was a religious group.</span> <span id="s2724">And I think that the Franks and us were in there.</span> <span id="s2725">I remember sitting in a class and -- and learning some Hebrew letters and things, which I don’t remember anything about.</span> <span id="s2726">But the Franks hadn’t been in any of that, either.</span> <span id="s2727">Neither one of us had been -- as far as I remember it, in any way involved.</span> <span id="s2728">I remember my money -- my mother lighting a candles on Friday.</span> <span id="s2729">And she knew the browhouse -- the re-- the religious things you say when you light the candles.</span> <span id="s2730">And she must have learned it somewhere.</span> <span id="s2731">Now, whether she learned it at her father’s knee, did her mother do it?</span> <span id="s2732">Yes, it might hav -- be so.</span> <span id="s2733">But I can’t remember it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2734">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2735">A: It’s very likely that she learned that, you know, from her mother.</span> <span id="s2736">But I don’t even know if Huntz was Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s2737">I imagine he was -- of -- or Paul was Bar Mitzvahed.</span> <span id="s2738">My pay -- my -- my Uncle Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s2739">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2740">A: I imagine it -- it was -- they were, but I -- I have no proof of that.</span> <span id="s2741">I really should ask me Israeli cousin.</span> <span id="s2742">I have two real cousins.</span> <span id="s2743">One of them Huntz’s and one from my Uncle Paul.</span> <span id="s2744">One from my Uncle Huntz and one from my Uncle Paul.</span></p> <p><span id="s2745">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2746">A: And one of them lives in Israel and I don’t -- we don’t get alan -- long very well.</span> <span id="s2747">And -- and one [indecipherable] lives in Holland, we are very close.</span> <span id="s2748">I don’t know if she would know if my Uncle Paul was ever Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2749">Q: And Martin’s becoming a scientist --</span></p> <p><span id="s2750">A: Martin -- Martin was Bar Mitzvahed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2751">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2752">But did he becoming a scientist affect his association with religion and God?</span></p> <p><span id="s2753">A: No.</span> <span id="s2754">He was never religious either and neither were his parents.</span> <span id="s2755">He was Bar Mitzvahed, it was understood.</span> <span id="s2756">It was like a ritual, but -- but it was not -- they never -- they did not go to Temple, except on Rosh Hashanah.</span> <span id="s2757">They did go on Rosh Hashanah, because the whole family went.</span></p> <p><span id="s2758">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2759">A: They have the huge family in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2760">One reason Marty said he left Baltimore with me, after we were married, was because he said, “You have nobody on your side, but I have this huge family, you’re going to be drowned and we don’t want that.”</span> <span id="s2761">He was -- he obviously wasn’t that fond, you know?</span> <span id="s2762">He liked his family.</span> <span id="s2763">He liked his family and unc -- cousins and uncles and aunts, was huge.</span> <span id="s2764">150 - 200 people, I mean, you know.</span> <span id="s2765">But I know his grandmother, Sara Rodbell and I don’t know her own na -- Calman -- no, wasn’t Calman.</span> <span id="s2766">She -- I knew her very well.</span> <span id="s2767">She’s the one who came from po -- from Lithuania and then came from -- via -- with her husband, from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s2768">She was anti-religious in the worst way, because her mother was married, of course, they -- her father was one of these itinerant rabbi’s in Poland.</span> <span id="s2769">And he died of pneumonia or something, you know, in Poland, because he had to travel from one place to another and it was very cold.</span> <span id="s2770">And his mother married some family of his here in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2771">That’s why -- her mother rather, married -- so when she -- the mother -- my grandm -- his grand -- start over.</span> <span id="s2772">Marty’s grandmother, named Sara, married -- came to this country, Baltimore, when she was 12.</span> <span id="s2773">And her father had died in Poland and her mother married a relation of the father, here in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s2774">There were five children when -- when she came.</span> <span id="s2775">This woman came here with five children and she had three more with this fellow from -- this family member that -- that she married.</span> <span id="s2776">Calman -- his name was Calman.</span> <span id="s2777">And this Calman was in Shul the whole time.</span> <span id="s2778">And so Marty’s grandmother, Sara, saw her mother work and work and work and work.</span> <span id="s2779">He never contributed anything to that family, except more children.</span> <span id="s2780">So -- so she hated religion with a passion.</span> <span id="s2781">It killed her father and it did nothing for her mother.</span> <span id="s2782">On the contrary, it kept the second husband in Shul the whole time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2783">Q: That’s funny, I have a similar story in mine --</span></p> <p><span id="s2784">A: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2785">Q: It was my mother, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2786">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2787">But anyway, so that grandm -- so -- so Marty’s grandmother was anti-religious, so her f -- his father didn’t get any religion because his -- the father of -- her -- his gran -- Marty’s grandfather, the father of his father, was a wonderful guy and he wasn’t religious in any way, either.</span> <span id="s2788">Very lively fella.</span> <span id="s2789">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2790">Q: So this is anoth-another kind of very broad and very difficult question to answer, but can you tell me at all about how this whole compendium of experiences, both the horrible things that happened in the war and the wonderful things that have happened -- how they have shaped your -- your view of humankind?</span></p> <p><span id="s2791">A: You know, I have to tell you -- aside from getting, I hope wiser and -- y -- with age, after have -- after having assimilated everything that happened to me in my 72 years, I cannot think that I’ve changed very much, you know?</span> <span id="s2792">I think that after all I’ve been through over these 72 years, I think I’m getting easier on people.</span> <span id="s2793">I’m much easier on people.</span> <span id="s2794">I mean, I forgive them nearly everything.</span> <span id="s2795">Because I know how hard it is to live.</span> <span id="s2796">Just to live is difficult.</span> <span id="s2797">I mean, if you think about the irony of what we build up and -- and work at and it’s just so we die in the end.</span> <span id="s2798">I mean, it’s just ridiculous situation.</span> <span id="s2799">We’re put in such an ironical situation by being born or after being born, of having to deal with the fact that we have to take everything that goes on in the world very seriously, because after all, it’s our life and we have to function within it.</span> <span id="s2800">And in the end, just to die.</span> <span id="s2801">You know?</span> <span id="s2802">It is really a very ironical situation.</span> <span id="s2803">I mean, I -- I think of these people on Long Island who recently died, who had this fantastic collection of paintings.</span> <span id="s2804">I mean, they went all over the world, they collected, they collected, they collected.</span> <span id="s2805">They spent billions, millions, you know, collecting, collecting.</span> <span id="s2806">And when they died, people didn’t even know what to do with the stuff.</span> <span id="s2807">They just put in on auction, it went all over the world, it di -- so what, you know?</span> <span id="s2808">I mean, it just is -- it is really ironic, it is so ironic.</span> <span id="s2809">So what can you do?</span> <span id="s2810">What can you do?</span> <span id="s2811">I’m -- I’m trying to figure out what you can do.</span> <span id="s2812">The only thing you can do that is worth something in life, is be good to your fellow man.</span> <span id="s2813">The other travelers who happen to be on this earth, accidentally at the same time that you are.</span> <span id="s2814">You know?</span> <span id="s2815">And trying to help them, if you’re better off than they are, in their trip across the years.</span> <span id="s2816">I mean, it’s just the only thing you can do.</span> <span id="s2817">And also the only thing you can do is -- is take care of the people that you can reach.</span> <span id="s2818">You know, it’s as if your arms have a certain length and they stretch out as wide as they can and they hold whatever they can and they -- they do good to the ends of their fingertips.</span> <span id="s2819">I mean, that’s the only thing you can do.</span> <span id="s2820">And I think that is a Jewish thing.</span> <span id="s2821">Although, I must say, I’ve met many, many Gentiles who have exactly that same feelings.</span> <span id="s2822">And -- and in my basically being Jewish, you know, I think, who knows about their forebears?</span> <span id="s2823">Who knows who they were?</span> <span id="s2824">There must be some Jewish in them.</span> <span id="s2825">Because you know, it is -- it is amazing, at the interfaith council.</span> <span id="s2826">I mean they’re nearly all Jewish -- I mean they’re nearly all Gentiles and they have exactly the same outlook.</span> <span id="s2827">So maybe it’s not Jewish after all.</span> <span id="s2828">Maybe it’s just being a good human being and -- and trying to [indecipherable] the best you can while you are living.</span> <span id="s2829">So I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s2830">Q: I think that’s a good place to stop, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2831">A: -- and some people -- now you’re missing the beginning of the sentence.</span></p> <p><span id="s2832">Q: Yeah [indecipherable] something here, what’s going on?</span> <span id="s2833">Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2834">A: I’m re -- you know, I’m thinking about the very beginning of things when -- when Jews were a tribe in the desert -- everybody was Jewish, right?</span> <span id="s2835">There was nothing else, except maybe the pagans.</span> <span id="s2836">But mostly it was -- anybody who was religious probably was Jewish or something.</span> <span id="s2837">Some kind of offshoot of that.</span> <span id="s2838">The essernine -- the essene sanines and you know, people -- various tribes in the desert and -- and here comes Jesus -- Jesus and he comes along and he has some other ideas.</span> <span id="s2839">And monotruism, where you [indecipherable] monotruism, you know, where you can’t see anything in front of you, you have to do it all in your head, the abstraction of God, it’s very difficult.</span> <span id="s2840">And they weren’t allowed to make false gods, such as the golden calf and etcetera.</span> <span id="s2841">And he comes with something that’s easier.</span> <span id="s2842">He’s there, you can go via him to God.</span> <span id="s2843">You can see something, you can hear something.</span> <span id="s2844">It was easier.</span> <span id="s2845">It was much easier to understand, to get to the same thing.</span> <span id="s2846">So people changed.</span> <span id="s2847">They went with that.</span> <span id="s2848">Some people didn’t and we’re the offshoots of the people who were stubborn as hell.</span> <span id="s2849">Who didn’t change.</span> <span id="s2850">And we’ve had a hard time ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2851">End of Tape Four, Side B Beginning Tape Five, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s2852">Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Mem-Memorial Museum interview with Barbara Rodbell.</span> <span id="s2853">This is tape number five, side A.</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: And they weren’t allowed to make false gods, such as the golden calf and etcetera.</span> <span id="s2855">And he comes with something that’s easier.</span> <span id="s2856">He’s there, you can go via him to God.</span> <span id="s2857">You can see something, you can hear something.</span> <span id="s2858">It was easier.</span> <span id="s2859">It was much easier to understand, to get to the same thing.</span> <span id="s2860">So people changed.</span> <span id="s2861">They went with that.</span> <span id="s2862">Some people didn’t and we’re the offshoots of the people who were stubborn as hell.</span> <span id="s2863">Who didn’t change.</span> <span id="s2864">And we’ve had a hard time ever since, because I think that the ones who did change, maybe were worried about themselves a little bit.</span> <span id="s2865">And they had a kind of a feeling of, “These stubborn people, why -- what’s the matter with them, just sticking -- they’re old fashioned.”</span> <span id="s2866">In a way, it’s old fashioned.</span> <span id="s2867">I mean, it’s a -- it’s something which passed by that’s a new thing now, you know?</span> <span id="s2868">And I can understand it very well.</span> <span id="s2869">It’s much easier, it’s so much easier.</span> <span id="s2870">And then the Catholics came.</span> <span id="s2871">And then somebody explained the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2872">Peter came and he explained the whole thing.</span> <span id="s2873">He explained it his way.</span> <span id="s2874">Jesus had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s2875">Who knows what Jesus said?</span> <span id="s2876">And all the apostles added -- each one added their own way.</span></p> <p><span id="s2877">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2878">A: And explained it their own way.</span> <span id="s2879">And here were these stubborn people who wouldn’t change.</span> <span id="s2880">Darn them.</span> <span id="s2881">And here we are.</span> <span id="s2882">We’re stuck with this heritage of not wanting to change.</span></p> <p><span id="s2883">Q: There’s a -- a couple of really quick factual questions that Arwin asked me to ask you, which I forgot.</span> <span id="s2884">One was -- wa -- Manfred was Jewish, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2885">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2886">Q: Were all of the people who were in the underground Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2887">A: In -- in our group, yes.</span> <span id="s2888">In our group only, yes.</span> <span id="s2889">I mean -- then there were other groups where nobody was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2890">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2891">A: Right?</span> <span id="s2892">During the war, as I say, everybody worked together.</span> <span id="s2893">As soon as the war was over, this all broke up, you know.</span> <span id="s2894">I mean you had -- you had people who went -- stayed in their religious groups and then you had the ideology people.</span> <span id="s2895">You know, people who were just like -- you have to remember that in Holland, there used to be -- not any more, but there used to be 64 political parties.</span> <span id="s2896">Because Dutch are very individualistic, you know.</span> <span id="s2897">And ea -- everybody thinks their own way and they have their own party.</span> <span id="s2898">So it’s not true any more, I think that there are 12.</span> <span id="s2899">But is -- it’s -- it’s still 12, you know, it’s a lot, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2900">Q: All right, I th -- I think we should stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">A: Okay, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">Q: I think that’s -- that’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">End of Tape Five, Side
