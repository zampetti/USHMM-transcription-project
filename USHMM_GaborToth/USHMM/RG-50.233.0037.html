he was an active member and leader in the Zionist movement, Hashomer Hatzair, in Radom.</span> <span id="s23">At the age of 20, he left Radom and went to Kibbutz Hachshara, which was the preparation for kibbutz life in Palestine.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Was your father religious though?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: The parents were religious.</span> <span id="s26">My mother was very religious.</span> <span id="s27">My father was religious in the sense that he prayed every day and went to Sabbath services at his congregation and so on, but that was the extent of his religious practices.</span> <span id="s28">He was observant; the children were not.</span> <span id="s29">We were all secularly inclined.</span> <span id="s30">However, we followed our father to services on high holidays, and I did carry his tallith to the congregation every Saturday until I was about 12 years or 13.</span> <span id="s31">That was about the end of it.</span> <span id="s32">After my Bar Mitzvah, my religious education came to an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Well, you had a kosher home?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s35">You hardly found any Jewish homes that weren’t kosher.</span> <span id="s36">That was part of a way of life.</span> <span id="s37">We never ate out.</span> <span id="s38">Even though our city was fairly sizeable for Poland, having about 100,000 people, and a varied industrial base, nevertheless, the idea of eating out was not a way of life as we knew it in the West.</span> <span id="s39">I left my hometown at the age of 20 when I was taken to Auschwitz, and up to that time I had never eaten out in a restaurant.</span> <span id="s40">We had eaten out at parties, at other people’s homes, but never at a restaurant.</span> <span id="s41">My next brother was employed in a commercial establishment.</span> <span id="s42">He was the only one who, at the end of 1939, escaped to the eastern part of Poland, which was occupied by the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">My mother was the oldest in a family of eight children and my father was the second in line in a family of six children.</span> <span id="s44">All together, our family consisted of, in addition to our own household, of eleven households, with eleven uncles and aunts, their respective spouses and with 25 first cousins.</span> <span id="s45">One of my mother’s brothers lived in the U.S.A. since the 1920’s.</span> <span id="s46">Of the entire family in Europe, only three first cousins survived, and all three came from the same household.</span> <span id="s47">Of the remaining ten households, not a trace was left.</span> <span id="s48">From our own household, in addition to myself, my brother, who spent most of the war years in the gulag, in the Artic, returned after the war.</span> <span id="s49">He lives in Europe now.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: What did you do -- did you have any other interests?</span> <span id="s51">You were involved in the Zionist movement?</span> <span id="s52">Did you have any hobbies?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s54">My brother was one of the leaders in the Zionist youth movement.</span> <span id="s55">I joined this group when I was about ten years old.</span> <span id="s56">My chief hobby, from very early on, was reading.</span> <span id="s57">We had a very extensive library, the second largest in town, which was a part of our organization.</span> <span id="s58">It was called the I.L. Peretz Library and I exchanged books there every time that the library was open, which was three or four times a week.</span> <span id="s59">I stayed up reading to the early hours and used a kerosene lamp or candle instead of the ceiling light so as not to disturb my two brothers who slept in the same room.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: Were these mostly Yiddish books?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: No, mostly Polish, some were Yiddish.</span> <span id="s62">I preferred reading in Polish, but I was articulate in Yiddish as well; however, there weren’t as many Yiddish books to choose from.</span> <span id="s63">We read mostly Polish, but our spoken language was mostly Yiddish.</span> <span id="s64">Yiddish was a living medium then, and not the linguistic curiosity to which it has been reduced in our day.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in translation or what?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Well, you could get everything you wanted.</span> <span id="s67">I read mostly Polish translations of French, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized.</span> <span id="s69">Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he was subject to the general mobilization.</span> <span id="s70">He reported to his regiment and was lucky that he didn’t become a POW.</span> <span id="s71">He was able to escape capture as a POW and return home six weeks after he left.</span> <span id="s72">Of course, we didn’t know what had happened to him throughout this period.</span> <span id="s73">Subsequently, he had become a very active member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in Radom, and our home became the contact place for couriers from Moscow.</span> <span id="s74">Polish ladies, as well as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in Warsaw, came.</span> <span id="s75">Mordecai Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto, who perished in 1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941.</span> <span id="s76">He stayed in a furnished room establishment in our courtyard during a mission to Radom, having traveled on Polish papers from Warsaw via Lodz and Czestochowa.</span> <span id="s77">He didn’t look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish papers.</span> <span id="s78">While in Auschwitz, I didn’t know who was in the leadership of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s79">Even those rounded up from the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, who came to Auschwitz-Birkenau via Majdanek in the early summer of 1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership.</span> <span id="s80">It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page, that I found out about his role.</span> <span id="s81">There were other people from Warsaw who came to our house who were involved in the first armed action in the Warsaw Ghetto in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">My brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28th of April 1942 and executed.</span> <span id="s83">I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s84">My entire family was put under house arrest and I had to surrender.</span> <span id="s85">By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the neck.</span> <span id="s86">I was taken to headquarters of the security service and put into a large shed that was full of Jews from our ghetto who had been there since the early morning hours.</span> <span id="s87">We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in Auschwitz past midnight.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What went on between ’39 and ’42?</span> <span id="s89">What were you doing?</span> <span id="s90">Were you still working or ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s92">I was the youngest.</span> <span id="s93">Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the Jewish community, and later on the ghetto community government, administered.</span> <span id="s94">They had to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had designated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of work -- unloading, loading, digging ditches, you name it.</span> <span id="s95">There was hardly any kind of work that we weren’t assigned to do.</span> <span id="s96">Being the youngest, I took the place of my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost two or three days a week.</span> <span id="s97">I didn’t mind, I’d rather do it than have my father, who was in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor.</span> <span id="s98">My oldest brother had to help my father so I took his place as well.</span> <span id="s99">In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all able-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to forced labor camps on the German-Soviet border in the district of Lublin to dig anti-tank fortifications.</span> <span id="s100">I was the only one in the family who was caught in the net.</span> <span id="s101">It turned out that if you didn’t report, you simply didn’t go; they didn’t come after you.</span> <span id="s102">But if you did report, you were trapped.</span> <span id="s103">Several hundred of us left Radom, perhaps four or five hundred men.</span> <span id="s104">Altogether there were thousands of young Jewish men from various parts of the country congregated in several forced labor camps stretched along a section of frontier land that ran between two rivers, the Bug and the San.</span> <span id="s105">Our camp was in Cieszanow, where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of frontier.</span> <span id="s106">That was my introduction to forced labor under SS rule.</span> <span id="s107">We left dead inmates at the work site every day.</span> <span id="s108">They were simply shot at random and buried in the woods and covered up with moss, so that one couldn’t even find their graves, for there were no markers left.</span> <span id="s109">This went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out of Cieszanow and taken to Belzec, from where, by rail, we were transported to Krasnik, in the District of Lublin.</span> <span id="s110">We spent the whole night in a courtyard where the Jewish community’s council was located.</span> <span id="s111">I will never forget the kindness of the town’s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink.</span> <span id="s112">In the afternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the town of Annapol and handed over to a German private firm to build highways.</span> <span id="s113">We were not under any military supervision, but just worked as civilians.</span> <span id="s114">We discovered soon that if you go away and don’t come back, you’re not missed, Several of us decided to start on our way home the next morning.</span> <span id="s115">We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to get a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip.</span> <span id="s116">We marched 16 kilometers that morning and crossed a guarded bridge that spanned the Vistula River, and within two hours were in the next town.</span> <span id="s117">We spent the rest of that day going from small town to town, riding in horse-drawn carts belonging to Jews engaged in either transporting people or goods.</span> <span id="s118">After darkness, we found ourselves as “passengers” on such a cart, sharing the space with a load of grain that the owner smuggled into the city of Radom, traveling through forests all night.</span> <span id="s119">Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting on “contraband”.</span> <span id="s120">Had we been stopped, it would have meant the end of us all.</span> <span id="s121">We arrived in Radom the next morning after an absence of two and a half months.</span> <span id="s122">That was my introduction to camp life, and in a way it helped me later on.</span> <span id="s123">When I arrived at Auschwitz, unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what awaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in Auschwitz-Birkenau was uniquely evil.</span> <span id="s124">In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can state without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied Europe, there was no place that could match the hell of Birkenau in it’s first year of existence.</span> <span id="s125">We walked the three kilometers from Auschwitz to Birkenau on May 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our transport.</span> <span id="s126">Within one month most of them were dead.</span> <span id="s127">By the end of about two months, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the camp -- there were fifteen of us.</span> <span id="s128">Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for doing so.</span> <span id="s129">In early 1942 I came down with typhus.</span> <span id="s130">There were many typhus cases in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s131">Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even without any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can’t eat anyway in a state of very high fever.</span> <span id="s132">I had developed some complications and hemorrhaged all night.</span> <span id="s133">We lived in the ghetto under strict curfew conditions and had no access to doctors or drugstores.</span> <span id="s134">My brother risked his life to go outside the ghetto to an apothecary in order to get some medication, which turned out to be the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me.</span> <span id="s135">The doctor who attended me was sick and he didn’t know the seriousness of the problem.</span> <span id="s136">My brother, together with one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found one.</span> <span id="s137">He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in town that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the hemorrhaging.</span> <span id="s138">He plainly said, “There’s nothing I can do, if you have some cognac, give it to him.”</span> <span id="s139">He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I remember the stupidity of his suggestion.</span> <span id="s140">This was a ghetto in Poland in 1942 and he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s141">In the morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to find a donor who had my blood type.</span> <span id="s142">I was supposed to be taken to the hospital for the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn’t possibly survive the trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely low.</span> <span id="s143">Instead, the ghetto hospital sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers, including my brother Moshe.</span> <span id="s144">I remember the technician telling the surgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine.</span> <span id="s145">Nevertheless the surgeon decided to use my brother’s blood for there was no time to lose and he told my parents that the risk must be accepted.</span> <span id="s146">Transfusions were given directly from donor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins.</span> <span id="s147">My parents were standing over my bed knowing very well that any moment now, should my body reject the donor’s blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes.</span> <span id="s148">The doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm.</span> <span id="s149">That’s a good sign, he responded.</span> <span id="s150">He finished the transfusion and I was saved.</span> <span id="s151">He came back eight days later to take out the stitches and he couldn’t believe his own eyes that I was alive.</span> <span id="s152">I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm.</span> <span id="s153">He suggested that I come to the hospital after I get well to be examined thoroughly t find out how I managed to survive that ordeal.</span> <span id="s154">It was the same brother whose blood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s155">As it turned out, had I not had typhus at home and developed immunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived Birkenau in 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Can we ask a question, Susan did ----.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">(S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the ghetto, after you had been in the labor camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: When we were in the labor camp, i.e., in the fall of 1940, there were no ghettos yet in most of the General Government of Poland.</span> <span id="s159">The ghettos there were formed in the spring of 1941.</span> <span id="s160">Except, of course, for the city of Lodz, where the ghetto was formed in early 1940, because Lodz was incorporated into the Reich, ( i.e. the city of Lodz and the entire province) and the city of Warsaw, where the ghetto was formed in October or November of 1940.</span> <span id="s161">Yes, it was a good question.</span> <span id="s162">Some people escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the border which consisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn’t electrified.</span> <span id="s163">Of course, if an inmate was caught before he reached the no-man’s land he would be shot.</span> <span id="s164">On the way to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the barbed wire fences.</span> <span id="s165">We saw the Soviet guards patrolling.</span> <span id="s166">Some officers came close to the fence and talked to us.</span> <span id="s167">I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a Soviet Jewish captain.</span> <span id="s168">I wanted to escape, some of my friends did.</span> <span id="s169">They were all caught by the Soviet guards, every single one of them.</span> <span id="s170">Once you escaped across the fence, you had to cross a stretch of no-man’s land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain to reach the Soviet fence.</span> <span id="s171">In most instances, the German guards couldn’t see, when one forced the fence, either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands of wire and going through it.</span> <span id="s172">The guards were too thinly spread out.</span> <span id="s173">However, the escapees were spotted while walking or running through the neutral no-man’s land.</span> <span id="s174">Since the guards couldn’t shoot at them, they fired rounds in the air, thereby alerting the Soviet border guards who apprehended them.</span> <span id="s175">Even though, the Soviets knew that the escapees were Jewish inmates of forced labor camps, running for their lives from the Nazis, they were treated as if they were spies.</span> <span id="s176">Every single one of them was interrogated in the nearest town of Rava Ruska, imprisoned and eventually sent to the northern gulags.</span> <span id="s177">Ironically, through this act of callous and unconscionable mistreatment at the hands of the Soviet police apparatus, most of the escapees were saved; for had they been left in the Soviet-occupied Polish territories, they would have been killed a year later when the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and occupied those territories.</span> <span id="s178">I wanted to escape from the labor camp to join my brother Jechiel, who at the time lived in Lvov, no more than about 100 km south from our camp.</span> <span id="s179">I had no notion under what ghastly conditions he lived in Lvov as a refugee.</span> <span id="s180">However, I received a postcard from home in which my brother Moshe informed me that Jechiel sent a postcard home from some rail station on the old Polish-Soviet border.</span> <span id="s181">In the card he told us that he is in transport, forcibly evacuated from Lvov, and going either to the Far East or to the Caucasus.</span> <span id="s182">Well, he wound up in the far North, hundreds of kilometers north of Archangelsk.</span> <span id="s183">That postcard was dated July 1940.</span> <span id="s184">In the summer of 1940, the Soviet authorities rounded up all Polish-Jewish refugees under their jurisdiction who did not apply for Soviet citizenship, and shipped them to the northern gulags.</span> <span id="s185">That covered the vast majority of refugees.</span> <span id="s186">Once I found out that my brother was no longer in Lvov, I had no great desire to risk an escape attempt to face an unknown fate alone.</span> <span id="s187">I was too young then.</span> <span id="s188">Whether I would have been better off or not is hard to say.</span> <span id="s189">The chances are that I had as good a chance to survive as to perish there.</span> <span id="s190">About half the people perished in the Soviet camps.</span> <span id="s191">However, I didn’t escape and returned home to face the real test of fending for myself only one and a half years later, when I wound up in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s192">The last time I saw my parents and my family was on April 28, 1942.</span> <span id="s193">The liquidation of the ghettos in Poland an the annihilation of the Jewish population there began in the summer of 1942.</span> <span id="s194">In some areas, it started earlier.</span> <span id="s195">So about three or four months after I was shipped to Auschwitz and my brother executed, my family, that is my father, my mother, my sister and the entire extended family were shipped to and annihilated at Treblinka.</span> <span id="s196">Treblinka became the killing field of the Jews from the ghettos of the towns and cities in the districts of Warsaw and Radom.</span> <span id="s197">In addition, of course, to devouring transports of Jews from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s198">My personal saga began with my arrival at Birkenau.</span> <span id="s199">My experience at the main camp in Auschwitz lasted only about thirty-six hours, enough time for the conversion of civilians into prisoners.</span> <span id="s200">But Birkenau was hell.</span> <span id="s201">Time was not conceived in terms of months or years but in terms of days.</span> <span id="s202">If one survived the day, one achieved the unlikely.</span> <span id="s203">If one survived a month, one achieved the impossible.</span> <span id="s204">When new prisoners arrived in the fall of 1942, and I told them that I had been there six months, they found it unbelievable, because most new arrivals, by the time they got oriented and realized where they were, which usually took a day or two, became aware of the fact that they won’t survive too long.</span> <span id="s205">Later on, it became a little easier but in 1942 was an indescribable hell.</span> <span id="s206">We didn’t even know upon arrival that Birkenau had just started to become the crown jewel of the Nazi killing machine of European Jewry.</span> <span id="s207">It took us several months to find out exactly what was going on right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Did you know that they were killing people in those places?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s210">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s211">A couple of weeks after we arrived, some strong people from our transport were selected to work in the Sonderkomando, but we had no idea what was going on.</span> <span id="s212">We thought that they were put to work burning the bodies of prisoners who were killed or died in the camp, since every day there were heaps of dead bodies in front of each barrack.</span> <span id="s213">A barrack that counted twelve hundred prisoners on Sunday would be half empty by the next Sunday.</span> <span id="s214">They would usually combine the contingents of the two half empty barracks into one, and use the empty barrack for a new transport.</span> <span id="s215">We didn’t know that there are transports arriving from the outside world, i.e., from ghettos, and internment camps in Western Europe, bringing families of men, women and children.</span> <span id="s216">It took us months before we realized that.</span> <span id="s217">It was well concealed and there’s no wonder that the surrounding world didn’t know, because we, who were that much closer, didn’t know at first.</span> <span id="s218">But once we found out, we understood where the trucks filled with people, were going to.</span> <span id="s219">For about a year, in fact almost exactly a year, from March ’42 until March ’43, there were no crematoria in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s220">The gassing took place in an abandoned farmer’s cottage, the inside of which I had a chance to see in 1944, while the burial and later on, the burning of the bodies took place in pits adjacent to the cottage and surrounded by woods.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">The trucks were loaded at the Auschwitz railroad camp and traveled the two miles to the gas chamber, passing the road that surrounded the Birkenau camp complex.</span> <span id="s222">We sometimes saw the trucks from inside the camp, and occasionally passed them by on the road on our way to work.</span> <span id="s223">Most of my work, and the work of people around me, was involved in enlarging the camp.</span> <span id="s224">It was an enormous universe of camps which could, by the middle of 1944, accommodate close to a quarter of a million prisoners.</span> <span id="s225">My job throughout the spring and early summer of 1942 was digging the foundations for crematorium one.</span> <span id="s226">By mid-summer of 1942, they had some crazy idea of separating a group of about 800 young Jewish prisoners, from 16 to 25 years of age, and forming a masonry school to teach us how to become bricklayers.</span> <span id="s227">I don’t know what they had in mind for the plan turned into a fiasco.</span> <span id="s228">Not one of us eventually worked as a bricklayer.</span> <span id="s229">Many of the 800 did of typhus during the summer anyway, i.e., they were selected to go to the gas chamber after contracting typhus, but the few who survived were helped by the fact that they didn’t have to work outside in the heat of summer.</span> <span id="s230">With the rations that we received, compounded by the lack of water, hard labor, sleepless nights and beatings, one did not last long.</span> <span id="s231">We were lucky that during a crucial period in the summer, we were indoors in barracks receiving instruction on how to lay bricks.</span> <span id="s232">But it didn’t prevent the SS from performing selections among us.</span> <span id="s233">They took place every week.</span> <span id="s234">Those who looked weak or showed signs of illness or had abscesses or scars were selected to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s235">By the fall, the masonry school (Maurerschule) ceased to exist.</span> <span id="s236">Some of the remaining youngsters were sent to Auschwitz to work, and I was among those assigned to a work commando in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s237">The same kapo for whom I worked earlier returned from the Auschwitz sick bay, where he was confined with typhus, and was given a new work crew to dig foundations and help in the construction of crematoria three and four.</span> <span id="s238">He recognized me and several others, and we became part of a group of 100 workers who worked for him until the spring of 1943.</span> <span id="s239">Only a handful among the original one hundred survived the winter.</span> <span id="s240">Our last job under his command was to dig the foundations for the sauna.</span> <span id="s241">One day in late April, I had near fatal accident.</span> <span id="s242">I was hit by an empty truck.</span> <span id="s243">At the time, German tractor cabs are usually pulled two or three trailers.</span> <span id="s244">After the bricks were unloaded, I closed the side lid of the first trailer but the German truck driver did not see me and he started the engine.</span> <span id="s245">I was caught between the first and second trailers and thrown into the ditch.</span> <span id="s246">Had I fallen under the wheels, I would have been dead or completely maimed.</span> <span id="s247">I was so stunned that I couldn’t get up after regaining consciousness.</span> <span id="s248">They improvised a kind of stretcher from some boards and carried me back to camp.</span> <span id="s249">Now carrying back dead or near-dead bodies from work sites to the camp was a common sight.</span> <span id="s250">Each work detail that returned from work to cam invariably carried one or more dead bodies but they were stretched out.</span> <span id="s251">Here I wasn’t dead or near dead.</span> <span id="s252">I simply couldn’t walk.</span> <span id="s253">I was sitting up on this makeshift stretcher and looked like a Roman proconsul being carried by four people on their shoulders.</span> <span id="s254">There was only one witness who remembered that very unusual sight; he died in Canada a few years ago.</span> <span id="s255">I was lowered down in front of my barrack where the whole contingent was assembled for roll call, and permitted by the barrack elder to sit on the ground while the counting took place.</span> <span id="s256">Afterwards, I was picked up by a strong Belgian fellow who carried me to my third tier bunk.</span> <span id="s257">The next morning, with the support of two men, I made it to the doctor to be examined.</span> <span id="s258">If one didn’t go out to work, or report sick, one’s life was in mortal danger.</span> <span id="s259">There was no third choice -- it was either work or death.</span> <span id="s260">The kapo came with me, because it happened on his watch so he was sympathetic.</span> <span id="s261">By that time he had known me for about a year and in some way acted as my protector.</span> <span id="s262">He helped me to the sick bay and we met the chief camp doctor who was a Polish prisoner and former colonel of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s263">He should have been tried and convicted after the war as a war criminal.</span> <span id="s264">I thought that he was dead but discovered only a couple of years ago that he was tried in Poland sometime after the war and was let go for lack of evidence, He would simply assault patients who came to him to be examined and he also conducted selections on his own, sending Jewish prisoners to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s265">His name was Zenkteler.</span> <span id="s266">He treated me more or less, correctly.</span> <span id="s267">He examined me and said there’s nothing he can do and that there is nothing wrong with me.</span> <span id="s268">But since I came and he knew that I didn’t try to shirk work because the kapo was with me, he gave me a couple of days of what was referred to in German as schonung, meaning rest, at the sick bay, which was barrack no. 7.</span> <span id="s269">That barrack was an assembly point for Jewish prisoners who reported sick throughout the entire week.</span> <span id="s270">On Tuesdays, the trucks would come and take most of them to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s271">From the very beginning, barrack no. 7 served that function, i.e., as a way station from camp to the gas cambers.</span> <span id="s272">The moment I crossed the camp road (I remembered it as a road, but when I visited there this past September, I realized that it was more like a wide path than a road) and passed one of the little earth and brick bridges that connected the main camp road to the respective sides of the camp which were separated from the road by ditches; something happened to me: I suddenly became able to stand on my own feet and asked my two companion, who helped me, to let me walk to no. 7 by myself.</span> <span id="s273">In retrospect, it is obvious to me that my inability to walk was a psychosomatic phenomenon.</span> <span id="s274">It was a result of the shock received during the accident.</span> <span id="s275">My sudden ability to stand on my own feet must have resulted from the realization that I had better not walk in sick to barrack no. 7.</span> <span id="s276">I met people there whom I had known since the beginning, a couple of them came with me in 1942, and they worked there as orderlies.</span> <span id="s277">The next morning, I was discharged, and a few days later was transferred to barrack no. 16 and thereby gained the assignment to work in the “Canada” work detail.</span> <span id="s278">Luckily my work was inside the barracks sorting goods and I didn’t have to go to the rail siding to meet arriving transports.</span> <span id="s279">That work ended after four weeks when I developed an infection on my face and was admitted to the sick bay in barrack no. 8.</span> <span id="s280">The fact that I was admitted to sickbay no. 8 and not to no. 7 was in itself a break for which my cousin was responsible.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Can I stop you?</span> <span id="s282">I need to flick the tape over.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">(End of Side A, Tape 1 in original transcript.)</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: In early 1943, there were two sick bays in the old camp of Birkenau, in addition to the main infirmary to which Jewish prisoners had no access.</span> <span id="s285">Of the former two, one was barrack no. 7, which I described above, and the other was barrack no. 8 which admitted some Jewish prisoners.</span> <span id="s286">To get me there required a little influence in the right place.</span> <span id="s287">Although my cousin was surgeon there, he couldn’t simply admit me.</span> <span id="s288">I had to be assigned there by the camp’s administrative office, and that’s where his connections helped.</span> <span id="s289">Patients there weren’t subject t regular selections to the gas chambers and usually stayed there until pronounced fit to return to the regular barracks.</span> <span id="s290">He succeeded in treating me for my infection, and after three weeks, I got my first shave, but my face was still full of scarred tissue.</span> <span id="s291">It took more than two years before the scar tissue completely disappeared.</span> <span id="s292">A few days after transferring out of the sick bay, the old camp for men in Birkenau was evacuated and it became part of the enlarged female camp.</span> <span id="s293">The men moved to one of the newly finished wooden barracks camps, called “D Lager” or Camp D.</span> <span id="s294">That happened in June of 1943.</span> <span id="s295">For the next nine months or so, I went from work detail to work detail, including work inside the barrack, until in April 1944, I was recruited to work in the “Sauna” -- the more correct designation being disinfection facility, where civilians were transformed into prisoners.</span> <span id="s296">I worked there from April of 1944 until November when the size of the crew operating the facility was drastically reduced and the surplus sent back to Camp D. Birkenau was no longer the destination of incoming transports nor of prisoners transferred from other camps.</span> <span id="s297">The last victims of its killing machine were transports from Slovakia and Theresienstadt Ghetto, in addition to Birkenau inmates whose fate was sealed by the last mass selections that took place in the fall of 1944.</span> <span id="s298">The “sauna” facility abutted the rod leading from the railroad ramp to the crematorium complex no. 3 and 4, and we had the unfortunate and heart rending experience of being witness to daily processions of thousands upon thousands of men, women and children marching past us to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s299">The marching columns were no more than about 200 yards from their destination, but what is still etched in my memory is that the faces of the about-to-be murdered people betrayed only fatigue, perhaps confusion, but no comprehension of their imminent doom.</span> <span id="s300">Between April and the end of summer, several hundred thousand Hungarian Jews plus countless others from various parts of Europe, walked this stretch of road without realizing that it is their last walk.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: Are there any things specific, incidents or episodes that you remember from this period?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: I remember far too many episodes but I cannot think of any specific one which would, or should, take precedence over all others, hence, the choice is difficult, especially in an extemporaneous setting.</span> <span id="s303">We could sit here for days and tape without a stop, and not exhaust the reservoir of my recollections of this period, let alone the well of accumulated experiences of my three year sojourn in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">By way of concession to your inquiry, allow me to add the following: what has burdened my memory foremost, and is forever etched in my consciousness, despite the lapse of nearly half a century, I the daily procession of thousands of people, marching past the “sauna” on their way to the gas chambers, and the sight of smoke coming out of the crematoria chimneys shortly afterwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">However, one occurrence which has since become grist for the mills of Holocaust researchers, namely the uprising of the Birkenau Sonderkomando (crematoria crews) in October of 1944, took place within a stone’s throw of the “sauna” facility and I would like to register my recollection of the event within the framework of this interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Was that Greek, was that run by the Greeks?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: No!</span> <span id="s308">To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very few.</span> <span id="s309">The old guard, i.e., the cadres consisted mainly of Polish Jews, plus some French Jews and others.</span> <span id="s310">During the late spring of 1944, newly arrived Hungarian Jews were conscripted to work in the Sonderkomando because the size of the crematoria work details almost tripled at that time.</span> <span id="s311">From its very inception in the spring of 1942, the Birkenau Sonderkomando crews were subject to periodic liquidations.</span> <span id="s312">The first total liquidation took place in December 1942, when the approximately 500 strong crew was murdered.</span> <span id="s313">The first job of the new crew, selected the evening before when the Birkenau camp was subject to a strict curfew, was to dispose of the bodies of their predecessors.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">The next sizeable liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the Sonderkomando was transported to Majdanek, allegedly for work in the crematorium there, but once in Majdanek, they were put to death.</span> <span id="s315">The events leading to their death in the Majdanek gas chamber were confirmed by members of the Majdanek crematorium crew when they arrived in Birkenau in July 1944, after Majdanek was evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">By early fall of 1944, when Birkenau no longer functioned as a mass killing machine, the SS began the process of thinning out the ranks of the Sonderkomando.</span> <span id="s317">The first victims were several hundred men from the crew of crematorium no. 3.</span> <span id="s318">They were brought to the sauna for disinfection and that was the first time that I came face to face with, and talked to, members of the Sonderkomando.</span> <span id="s319">They were told that they were being transferred to another camp.</span> <span id="s320">The disinfection process was used as a subterfuge to lull them into believing the deception.</span> <span id="s321">They weren’t deceived, and were aware of their situation.</span> <span id="s322">From the sauna they were taken to Auschwitz where they were put to death in the old gas chamber.</span> <span id="s323">When, on October 6, the order to assemble came for the rest of the crematorium no, 3 crew, they refused and barricaded themselves inside the crematorium living quarters.</span> <span id="s324">They put their straw mattresses to the torch and exchanged fire with the SS guards outside, using the few small weapons in their possession.</span> <span id="s325">The guards pretty soon received reinforcements from the SS barracks that were located not far away.</span> <span id="s326">When it was over, crematorium no. 3 remained a gutted shell and the several hundred prisoners inside, all dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">The burning of the facility and the sound of the firefight was construed by the crew of crematorium no. 1 as a signal that the expected uprising has begun.</span> <span id="s328">After throwing their German kapo into the burning furnace, they cut the barbed wire that enclosed the crematorium and dispersed in the direction of the Vistula River.</span> <span id="s329">The SS gave chase and every single one of the several hundred prisoners was hunted down and killed.</span> <span id="s330">Several days later the crew of crematorium no. 2 was gassed and all that remained of the approximately 1,500 strong Birkenau Sonderkomando was the crematorium no. 4 crew of less than 100 men, who at the time were barracked within the main camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Following the events described above, crematoria nos. 1,2 and 3 were blown up and dismembered.</span> <span id="s332">Crematorium no. 4 was left intact until January 18, 1945, the day of the final evacuation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp complex.</span> <span id="s333">An attempt was made to separate the remaining members of the Sonderkomando, but in the haste of the overall and sudden evacuation, they managed to get intermingled with the general camp population and share their fate and survival chances in the ensuing months ahead.</span> <span id="s334">I was told after the war that about 30 or 40 of them survived the ordeal of evacuation and death marches.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Crematorium no. 4 was blown up on January 18, and I subsequently learned that the demolition was only partly successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">I myself was assigned to a work detail in late November – early December, 1944, to break up the concrete floor of the crematorium 3 gas chamber.</span> <span id="s337">We used hammers and pickaxes for the job.</span> <span id="s338">During our work, we found many pliers that were used by the crematoria crews to pull out gold teeth from the mouths of the gassed victims.</span> <span id="s339">The unbelievable circumstances of this assignment did not escape me at the time for I was the only one among the prisoners in that work detail who worked at digging the foundation and at the construction of the very same crematorium two years before, and lived long enough to be present at, and participate in, it’s demolition.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">I recall one incident during the uprising which in retrospect fills me with terror.</span> <span id="s341">While the road outside the sauna building was teeming with SS guards and officers running on foot and on any conveyance they could find including bicycles, in the direction of crematorium 1 where the breakout took place, we in the sauna received the dreaded order, “Alle Juden eintreten”, i.e., all Jews fall-in.</span> <span id="s342">We assembled in the courtyard, separated from the non-Jewish members of the work crew, and watched with horror, and envy, the satisfaction on the faces of the latter that they are lucky enough not to be Jews and not to have to share our foreboding of doom, and doom was exactly what we expected at the time.</span> <span id="s343">We never found out the reason for our being ordered to assemble, but were greatly relieved when we were dismissed later on.</span> <span id="s344">It was the last time in my incarceration that I was subject to that blood-chilling fear produced by an order for Jews to assemble separately.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">I went back to Birkenau this past September, my first visit since I left the camp in January 1945, and I was overwhelmed by the desolateness of the place.</span> <span id="s346">Where crematorium no. 1 stood, there are only a few slabs of concrete sticking out of the ground and a commemorative plaque affixed to a stone telling what took place there.</span> <span id="s347">Only the brick barracks of the original camp remain while the hundreds of wood barracks were allowed to disintegrate or taken apart for firewood.</span> <span id="s348">The brick chimneys of the latte stood out ghostlike and are the only remainder of a past to which they bear witness.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">I was accompanied on my trip by a friend from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s350">It was during the late morning, on a Saturday, and the two of us were the only ones there.</span> <span id="s351">In that huge complex of former camp there wasn’t another human being in sight.</span> <span id="s352">There was an eeriness in the absolute silence that pervaded this greatest of killing fields of all time.</span> <span id="s353">The eeriness became more intense for me when I juxtaposed this silence of the grave against my recollections of the teeming scores of thousands of prisoners, who at any time between 1942 and 1945, occupied these grounds, not to mention the millions who never set foot inside the barbed wire confines but walked, or were trucked, on the nearby road from the railroad ramp to the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">On the way back to Cracow we stopped at the Auschwitz camp which is about two miles from Birkenau.</span> <span id="s355">The parking lot was full; there were bus loads with visitors, and the cafeteria was busy.</span> <span id="s356">The place projected an aura of a busy shrine, while Birkenau has been allowed to go to seed and its physical plant is so disintegrated that it is beyond repair, and certainly beyond recognition.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">There is no comparison between the two camps in the way they are kept and maintained as Polish national museums.</span> <span id="s358">In that connection, it is apropos to reflect on the difference between the two places when they functioned as Nazi concentration camps.</span> <span id="s359">Auschwitz was not unlike many Nazi camps within Germany.</span> <span id="s360">The difference was only in degree, i.e., more cruelty, more harshness, more of everything evil, but in its basic essentials it resembled concentration camps like Dachau, Buchenwald, etc.</span> <span id="s361">However, Birkenau belonged to a different universe of evil.</span> <span id="s362">It its operating mode, and in its basic objectives that unique hell could be justly described as having been a slaughterhouse rather than a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Okay and I missed all that.</span> <span id="s364">You were telling me about the cement bags and all that ________.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: In April, the so-called winter issue of clothing had to be surrendered.</span> <span id="s366">A prisoner risked his life if he wore any such article past the due time.</span> <span id="s367">April was not spring, yet, in this part of the world.</span> <span id="s368">I fact, I was never so cold in my life as I was in May of 1942.</span> <span id="s369">I slept on the upper bunk and the wind came in from the open rafters under the roof, and we had no bedding or blankets and slept in our day clothing, which consisted of a shirt and a cotton blouse of sorts.</span> <span id="s370">If one was lucky enough and worked at a construction site where cement was used, the empty bags were converted into undershirts by cutting out holes at the sides and top and worn under the garment as an added layer against the wind and cold.</span> <span id="s371">Again, you wore it at your peril for, if caught, the retribution was merciless.</span> <span id="s372">The combination of exposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless hours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water; lack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which frequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short life span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Our daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the barrack elder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf into five portions instead of the required four portions.</span> <span id="s374">Of the margarine and occasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted to us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the barrack elder and either sold for other products, or distributed to his cronies and protégés.</span> <span id="s375">The soup was distributed at the worksite at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water.</span> <span id="s376">The fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">The soup consisted of water, some thickener, a few bits of floating potatoes or beets and, very rarely, a morsel of meat, The presence of meat in the soup meant little to us, for we never saw it in our bowls.</span> <span id="s378">The kapo usually allowed the meat to sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before serving.</span> <span id="s379">The booty belonged to him and his helpers.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">At every worksite throughout the camp, when it came time to line up for the soup, there was jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to be the first in line to be served from the top of the container.</span> <span id="s381">Occasionally, the strategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the line was rewarded with failure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the line, or when he decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the first.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">The bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually eaten at once.</span> <span id="s383">That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in the morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some kind of leaves.</span> <span id="s384">It required discipline to forego eating the entire ration of bread at night and have some for the morning.</span> <span id="s385">If one managed that, he could last a little longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">We envied those lucky enough to be chosen for work assignments in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s387">Very few had the luck to be considered for such assignments or had the requisite skills asked for.</span> <span id="s388">That tells a lot about our perception of the relative merits of the two camps.</span> <span id="s389">We knew that Birkenau was the place that we were sent to die, but in our desperation we thought that Auschwitz offers a chance, however slim.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Most people now do not know the difference between Auschwitz and Birkenau.</span> <span id="s391">Some have never heard of Birkenau.</span> <span id="s392">When Auschwitz is referred to as the largest Nazi extermination camp, it is Birkenau that fits this description, for it is there where it took place.</span> <span id="s393">The Auschwitz gas chamber and crematorium was the place where the extermination started in early spring of 1942, but it was eclipsed by the far more extensive scale and scope of the Birkenau death factories.</span> <span id="s394">Birkenau was designed and built for the sole purpose of serving as a giant killing machine to dispose of that part of European Jewry that had not been devoured by the extermination centers in Eastern Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">References in the general American press and electronic media usually equate Buchenwald, Dachau, Majdanek, Treblinka, etc. as was one of those camps where European Jews were martyred.</span> <span id="s396">This is a gross inaccuracy and reflects a failure to understand the difference between concentration camps and extermination camps, as well as a failure to grasp the history of the period as it relates to the destruction of European Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">In the fall of 1942, an attempt was made to make German concentration camps, within the borders of the Old Reich, “Judenfrei”, i.e., free of Jews.</span> <span id="s398">A transport of several hundred Jewish prisoners from various camps in Germany arrived in Birkenau at that time.</span> <span id="s399">Among these were German, Austrian, and some Czech Jews who were imprisoned since 1933, 1938 and 1939, respectively.</span> <span id="s400">Within a short period, only a small remnant of that transport remained alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Birkenau was not designed as a place to concentrate people to prevent them from doing damage to the state, but as a place where people were sent to die in a somewhat slower process than execution.</span> <span id="s402">That was my experience of Birkenau, at least for the first six months to a year.</span> <span id="s403">Those who survived that period had increased chances of making it to the end.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Do you want to discuss some of the further things that happened to you during your time there?</span> <span id="s405">You were liberated at Birkenau, you have Birkenau ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: No!</span> <span id="s407">Birkenau was liberated in January of 1945.</span> <span id="s408">I wasn’t so lucky.</span> <span id="s409">The Soviet offensive started on January 12, in central Poland.</span> <span id="s410">By the 18th, the Nazis had to evacuate the remaining prisoners of the entire Birkenau and Auschwitz camp complex.</span> <span id="s411">We were assembled and marched to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s412">We received our ration for the transport, some bread and something, and we marched all night and then another night, and we left many dead on the way.</span> <span id="s413">The column was guarded by SS whose rearguard members killed any prisoner who couldn’t keep up with the column.</span> <span id="s414">We walked and kept hearing shots all night.</span> <span id="s415">They would leave the dead on the road and the local authorities were required to remove the corpses.</span> <span id="s416">It was snowing and I was barely awake, walking in a trance and becoming fully conscious only when I bumped into the person ahead of me in the column.</span> <span id="s417">We must have walked 25 or 30 kilometers a night.</span> <span id="s418">During the day, we were accommodated in some barn for a couple of hours rest.</span> <span id="s419">Of course, we couldn’t sleep for it was too cold.</span> <span id="s420">The barn belonged to a Polish farmer and I remember a woman came out and brought some hot drinks for us but she couldn’t do much more.</span> <span id="s421">Some people tried to figure out a way to escape at that time.</span> <span id="s422">It was extremely risky.</span> <span id="s423">The first night two of my acquaintances tried to escape, but they were caught and executed on the spot.</span> <span id="s424">The second night was worse because more people were killed for not being able to keep up with the column.</span> <span id="s425">Hundreds of people were killed in those two nights of marching until we were brought to a place which looked like an abandoned railroad station or some kind of facility.</span> <span id="s426">We had no idea what it was or where we were.</span> <span id="s427">We spent the rest of the night there and were loaded into open railroad freight cars for a whole day’s travel to Gross-Rosen, a notorious concentration camp in lower Silesia.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">To describe the existing conditions at Gross-Rosen as pandemonium would be understating the case.</span> <span id="s429">It was a medium size camp, capable of holding perhaps several thousand prisoners, but at the time of my arrival there were between thirty and forty thousand prisoners there, most of them evacuees from camps further east.</span> <span id="s430">My barrack housed about 1,200 men and there was hardly room for them to stand during roll call.</span> <span id="s431">It is not hard to imagine what happened when they all tried to find a place to stretch out for the night.</span> <span id="s432">Those positioned close to the wall were lucky, but those in the middle couldn’t even find a place to sit on the floor.</span> <span id="s433">If one left his place for a visit to the latrine, that place would be pounced upon and fought over by those with no place of their own.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">The food supply and distribution system was in shambles.</span> <span id="s435">The camp kitchens had little left and couldn’t keep up with the demand placed on it.</span> <span id="s436">We never knew when the soup would be delivered, it could be in the afternoon or at 2 a.m.</span> <span id="s437">The same was true with respect to the bread ration.</span> <span id="s438">Neither of the two contained salt.</span> <span id="s439">The soup was nothing but water and some beets, a vile concoction, and hard to swallow because of the lack of salt.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">I wore a halfway decent looking three quarter coat which I acquired while working in the sauna.</span> <span id="s441">One day a German kapo came over to me and requested that I give him my coat.</span> <span id="s442">He was an evacuee just as I was, and didn’t function as a kapo there.</span> <span id="s443">I told him to go and fly a kite.</span> <span id="s444">Under the conditions, he was no better than anyone else and he did not scare me.</span> <span id="s445">He thought that I, being a Jewish prisoner, would defer to his demand by virtue of his superior status.</span> <span id="s446">Someone was observing our exchange and when it was finished, he came over and said, I could not believe that you had the guts to tell him off.</span> <span id="s447">This fellow was from Radom, a friend of my brother and our paths crossed in Birkenau in 1943, and I had no idea that he was still alive.</span> <span id="s448">He survived the war and lives in Haifa now.</span> <span id="s449">I spoke to him during my visit to Israel this past October.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">After three weeks of this life with little food, hardly any sleep and no chance to wash, we got our marching orders, a can of meat as our provision, and off we were, two thousand of us, on another death march.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Was that your worst, or one of your worst experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: If I discount my experiences in Birkenau throughout 1942, I would have to say yes; my sojourn in Gross-Rosen was one of the harshest episodes of my incarceration, except for what was yet to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Armed with our can of meat, which in most instances was eaten in one sitting (there is not much else one can do with an open can of meat except eat it since it is not too portable) we started out on what was to become the deadliest segment of our three and one half months long agony that took us from Birkenau to freedom.</span> <span id="s454">We marched for two days and lost many people until we reached some rail embarkation point.</span> <span id="s455">That was on a Thursday and we didn’t reach Flossenburg (another of those stone quarries camps) until the following Tuesday.</span> <span id="s456">The distance was not far at all, for Bohemia.</span> <span id="s457">It was snowing most of the time and we were in open freight cars without any protection from the element and without blankets.</span> <span id="s458">That can of meat was the last food issued to us until we reached Flossenburg, and then some.</span> <span id="s459">That meant eight days on a pound-sized can of meat.</span> <span id="s460">Some of us were able to lower the empty cans and scoop up some snow from the ground and drink the melted snow.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Upon arrival in Flossenburg, there were close to 500 corpses among us.</span> <span id="s462">They died of hunger and exposure.</span> <span id="s463">That was in addition to the many that we lost on our two daylong march.</span> <span id="s464">The way up to the camp’s entrance led through a very steep road which to us, at that time was like scaling Mt. Everest.</span> <span id="s465">Our arrival at the showers coincided with a blackout due to an air raid alarm which lasted for most of the night.</span> <span id="s466">I remember a wave of naked bodies pushing towards the door and attendants, using high pressure hosed with cold water, forced us back to the wall, while those at the wall pushed us back again, and throughout all this there were dead bodies on the floor and their numbers increasing.</span> <span id="s467">It was a night never to be forgotten.</span> <span id="s468">When released in the morning and assigned to the quarantine barrack, it took almost another day before we received the first morsel of food.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Our sleeping arrangements, due to the crowding, was an ordeal that is hard to convey unless experienced; it cannot be comprehended.</span> <span id="s470">Imagine a bunk narrower than a twin bed, meant for one but sleeping four, packed like sardines, two heads on one end of the bed and two heads on the other end.</span> <span id="s471">If two bunks were placed alongside each other, the barrack elders felt that such an arrangement adds available space, hence, it could accommodate ten bodies.</span> <span id="s472">There were no mattresses or blankets, just bare slats.</span> <span id="s473">After spending a restful night like that, we were driven out of the barrack in the early morning to spend the whole day outside in the bitter cold, and not allowed back in until the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">The camp had several terraced levels carved out of stone and on each level were barracks.</span> <span id="s475">I discovered that on one of the levels below ours there is a barrack led by the former chief kapo of Birkenau, Aloisy.</span> <span id="s476">He was a German political prisoner, but murderous and paranoid to boot.</span> <span id="s477">He allowed the inmates of his barrack, those who didn’t go out to work, to sit on the floor of the barrack all day.</span> <span id="s478">They couldn’t move about -- they just had to sit.</span> <span id="s479">It was still better than freezing outside.</span> <span id="s480">I took a calculated risk and went down to his barrack one morning, and sat down on the floor among the others, without asking his permission.</span> <span id="s481">He remembered me from many encounters in Birkenau and I knew that if he were asked for permission, he would never grant it.</span> <span id="s482">I just made myself as unobtrusive as possible, and he ignored me as if I weren’t there.</span> <span id="s483">Yet, he never asked me to leave.</span> <span id="s484">The only problem was that by sitting there, I had to forfeit the soup in my barrack.</span> <span id="s485">When he dished out the soup to his people, I grabbed a bowl and lined up, although I didn’t belong there.</span> <span id="s486">Some days he ladled out a double ration for me, or called me back to receive a supplementary helping, and on other days, he would hit me and give me no soup, without ever telling me why or speaking to me.</span> <span id="s487">On balance, I thought that the trade-off was in my favor, i.e., it was more important to be warm than to have a guaranteed soup every day.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">After about a month we left Flossenburg and after traveling by train a couple of days we arrived in Leonberg, near Stuttgart, by the third week of March.</span> <span id="s489">It was a small camp located almost in the middle of the small town.</span> <span id="s490">The camp served as a labor reservoir for a Messerschmidt plant nearby.</span> <span id="s491">The plant was situated in an autobahn tunnel which was closed off at both ends and converted to a two-level manufacturing facility producing wings for Messerschmidt military aircraft.</span> <span id="s492">It was the first time since leaving Birkenau that I was put to work.</span> <span id="s493">My friend, Isaac, who left Birkenau in October 1944, was in Leonberg the whole winter and worked as a riveter at the plant.</span> <span id="s494">He trained me to use a riveting gun.</span> <span id="s495">The trouble was that I couldn’t hoist myself up on the assembly platform for I was very weak.</span> <span id="s496">The food was very meager, consisting of spinach soup every day and a small ration of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Usually, completed wings would be rolled out to the autobahn through the tunnel entrance and picked up by trucks.</span> <span id="s498">In the entire two-week period that I was there, not a single wing left the assembly hall, for everything that moved on the highway was fair game for U.S. warplanes.</span> <span id="s499">I remember how amazed I was watching a unit of Wehrmacht sappers that was engaged in chiseling away at the tunnel walls at both ends and packing the cavities with explosives to be detonated at the proper time.</span> <span id="s500">What amazed me was not the fact that they were going to blow up a production facility (I often wondered whether we’ll be on the outside or immolated within the tunnel when it occurs), or deny the Allied forces an autobahn shortcut through that tunnel, but the ease and composure displayed during their work.</span> <span id="s501">They worked regular shifts, took time out for a smoke and coffee breaks, went to lunch and behaved as if they were building a tunnel rather than preparing its destruction.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Well, I never fully mastered the skill of riveting for the camp was evacuated on April 1, and I never found out whether the sappers’ job paid dividends or whether their orders were so construed as to prevent the success of their mission.</span> <span id="s503">We marched the better part of the day until we reached a rail station of some small town near Stuttgart, or a suburb of Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s504">Another two day travel without food, and we arrived at Kaufering, Upper Bavaria, which was a satellite camp of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">The tiny barracks there, huts really, were half underground and half above ground.</span> <span id="s506">The reason for this odd design was a mystery to us.</span> <span id="s507">The place was not too crowded, there was no work for us, and the food was at near starvation level.</span> <span id="s508">When we arrived at this camp late at night, we camped out in the field waiting for the processing to start in the morning.</span> <span id="s509">I fell asleep, and woke up in the morning amidst a pool of rainwater.</span> <span id="s510">I didn’t even know it was raining.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">We vegetated there for about two weeks, followed by yet another march and three- day train trip, without food, of course.</span> <span id="s512">One thing stands out in my memory about this trip, for it restored a bit of my faith in man’s humanity.</span> <span id="s513">The guard in our car was a Wehrmacht soldier in his fifties who came from Dresden or somewhere nearby.</span> <span id="s514">He took out his wallet and showed us pictures of his family, among them a son on the eastern front.</span> <span id="s515">.</span> <span id="s516">He showed us an excerpt from a German newspaper from which we learned of the death of President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s517">When our train stopped at some station, he left the car in order to steal some potatoes for us.</span> <span id="s518">He expressed his regrets that he can’t help in any other way.</span> <span id="s519">We arrived at Muhldorf, another Dachau satellite camp and not that far away from Kaufering, yet it took us three days by train to get there.</span> <span id="s520">It was to be our last camp, however, not our last transport.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">In Muhldord, I met many former inmates from Birkenau, those who left during the mass evacuation in October 1944, as well as those from a transport of non-Polish Jewish inmates who were shipped from Birkenau to Warsaw in the summer of 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed ghetto in that city.</span> <span id="s522">They were evacuated from Warsaw at the beginning of the polish uprising there in August of 1944.</span> <span id="s523">This was the first place in my three months of wandering where I encountered some friendship and encouragement, and it helped a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">After several days of work at different work details, I was assigned one day to a group whose job it was to clear out a machine shop, which was located in a converted or abandoned monastery.</span> <span id="s525">We loaded a truck full of machine tools and grinding stones.</span> <span id="s526">Some of it loose and some of it in heavy metal crates.</span> <span id="s527">The conveyance consisted of a trailer cab that pulled two open trailers.</span> <span id="s528">The first trailer carried the uncrated stuff plus several prisoners sent along to do the unloading.</span> <span id="s529">I was one of them.</span> <span id="s530">The second trailer held the crated material, two German civilians, and two armed guards.</span> <span id="s531">We had no idea of the destination of this shipment.</span> <span id="s532">The driver turned off the main road and took us down a very steep road leading towards a river, at which point, I suppose he was going to make a turn and proceed on the road alongside the river.</span> <span id="s533">Well, luckily for us as it turned out, he never made it to the river, for he soon realized that he did not have enough braking power to prevent the cab and the trailers from jackknifing into the river as soon as they hit the bottom of that road.</span> <span id="s534">He turned the cab into the ditch, jumped out, and hollered in German, “Jump”.</span> <span id="s535">There were three of us in the first trailer, my friend, Isaac, who was standing, another fellow and myself were sitting on the floor of the trailer.</span> <span id="s536">Isaac jumped in time, but the two of us didn’t make it and we were caught in an overturned trailer with heavy debris flying all over, including the stuff from the second trailer which toppled.</span> <span id="s537">I lost consciousness for a moment and when I came to, I saw myself covered with debris, and people clearing it away and carrying me away from the road towards the woods.</span> <span id="s538">I was bleeding from a cut above the eye and from a cut in the back of my head.</span> <span id="s539">It was as great a miracle as any that happened to me during the war.</span> <span id="s540">There were heavy objects flying all around me, some weighing hundreds of kilograms and all I suffered, were two cuts.</span> <span id="s541">Of course, no one knew whether I sustained some internal injuries or some brain injuries.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">The German driver was very upset, for he felt guilty about the accident; he tried to get some assistance but all that he managed to do was to bring a band-aid for me and a promise that someone will come to take me to the camp’s sick bay.</span> <span id="s543">In the meantime, hell broke loose with the sound of exploding bombs and flak that came from a nearby town under air attack by U.S. warplanes.</span> <span id="s544">I remember someone saying that it is the Allies gift to Hitler on his birthday, and that is how I know it happened on April 20.</span> <span id="s545">Because of this air attack, we had to wait for hours until we were transported back to camp, and when I presented myself at the sick bay, the floor was littered with people injured during the bombing of some facilities nearby.</span> <span id="s546">Among them was a fellow from Radom who took a shrapnel in his thigh.</span> <span id="s547">His survival is a saga, for he was operated on in a German military hospital only after liberation, which was about two weeks after he was wounded.</span> <span id="s548">He lives in Miami Beach now.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">I received no help or sympathy from the people in the sick bay; they had more serious injuries to deal with.</span> <span id="s550">I was merely assigned to a rest barrack, where after several days we received orders to assemble for transport.</span> <span id="s551">The Muhldorf camp was being evacuated.</span> <span id="s552">That was to be our last transport but we didn’t know it, of course.</span> <span id="s553">As we assembled, I overheard one of the SS guards tell someone not to worry, “You are being taken to Switzerland”.</span> <span id="s554">That really gave me cause to be worried for if they felt compelled to lie about our destination, that meant we were in real trouble.</span> <span id="s555">Our destination was not Switzerland but straight south towards the Bavarian Alps and Austria.</span> <span id="s556">The rails of that part of Bavaria were clogged with trains full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reich’s last redoubt.</span> <span id="s557">What they had in store for us there, or how they were going to resolve the dilemma of either killing the remaining scores of thousands of Jewish concentration camp prisoners, or letting them be liberated by the Allied armies can only be conjectured.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">We traveled for several days and covered little distance, spending more time on sidings, allowing other trains to pass through.</span> <span id="s559">Our transport was not immune to air attacks by U.S. warplanes, as any moving objects would be in those days.</span> <span id="s560">The pilots had no way of knowing who was inside those rail cars.</span> <span id="s561">When an alarm was sounded the guards locked the car doors from the outside and took cover in the woods nearby, leaving us as sitting ducks.</span> <span id="s562">Luckily, there were no bombs thrown, however, we were machine-gunned and there were casualties.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">On the second or third day of our journey, we found ourselves sidetracked at a small railroad station in Upper Bavaria called Poeing.</span> <span id="s564">There were rumors that the transport commander, a German army officer, ordered that the locomotive, plus one empty car, be detached from the train and return to Dachau in order to obtain provisions for the prisoners in his charge.</span> <span id="s565">There were several thousand of us and hardly any food left.</span> <span id="s566">If that story had any truth to it, it would only reflect the naivete of the officer who was not attuned to the ways the SS camp administration operated.</span> <span id="s567">Once a transport left the camp, no one assumed the responsibility for provisioning the prisoners of that transport, except perhaps for providing the initial rations.</span> <span id="s568">I’m sure that he couldn’t obtain a single loaf if bread in Dachau for the camp was already at the point of disintegration at that time, or about to be overrun by the U.S. Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">I don’t remember how long we had not eaten at that point, but I do recall that I was very hungry and decided to eat a raw potato that I had somehow acquired.</span> <span id="s570">I was aware of the risk, and it would have been the first time for me to ignore the possible consequences.</span> <span id="s571">No sooner had I cut, or peeled the potato when we became aware of a very loud conversation outside.</span> <span id="s572">Someone opened the door of the car (these were closed cattle cars, not open ones) and we were treated to a most grotesque spectacle on the platform, where many prisoners were jumping and shouting, “the war is over”, and in their excitement embraced some guards.</span> <span id="s573">The guard unit of our transport consisted of a motley crew of SS, Wehrmacht soldiers, and black uniformed Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s574">The platform was littered with abandoned knapsacks belonging to the Ukrainians for they were the first to abandon the ship, either out of fear of retribution or using the opportunity to desert.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">The source of the story about the war’s end was no other than the commanding officer of the transport.</span> <span id="s576">He went into the stationmaster’s office to use the telephone and heard a radio announcement to that effect.</span> <span id="s577">He came out and said.</span> <span id="s578">“The war is over, you are free to go”.</span> <span id="s579">Of course, it was a false alarm.</span> <span id="s580">What happened was on that day, or the night before, there was an uprising in Munich, involving some Wehrmacht units and civilian sympathizers.</span> <span id="s581">It really took place.</span> <span id="s582">They declared Munich an open city and wanted it surrendered to the Americans, rather than have it destroyed.</span> <span id="s583">However, the coup was suppressed by an SS division, and so came to a quick end, the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War.</span> <span id="s584">I only recently read the details of that story in a book called The Hundred Days by John Tolen.</span> <span id="s585">He was an American war correspondent following the Allied troops into Germany in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">In the meantime, the car doors were opened and masses of prisoners were milling around on the platform.</span> <span id="s587">Hundreds decided to take off and ran in all directions towards the nearest village or town.</span> <span id="s588">I never did eat that raw potato and, instead, said to my friend, Isaac, if the war is really over, it’s over right here as well as in the nearest village, and there is no need to run into the unknown.</span> <span id="s589">First things first, I said, let’s go and find the car that holds the provisions.</span> <span id="s590">We located it, but it was difficult for me to climb up onto a railcar from the ground.</span> <span id="s591">I managed to hoist myself onto it and emerged with a loaf of bread and some margarine.</span> <span id="s592">So did he, and we both ate ourselves full after three months of near starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Soon enough, we heard the sound of shooting and saw emerging groups of prisoners running for their lives back to the train.</span> <span id="s594">We learned from them that as soon as they approached the village nearby, they were rounded up by Volksturm troops (Home Army) who shot at them and drove them back to the train.</span> <span id="s595">There were casualties.</span> <span id="s596">It turned out that some paid with their lives when they were almost at the threshold of freedom.</span> <span id="s597">The news from Munich about the end of the war turned out to be premature.</span> <span id="s598">The transport reassembled and got on its way again.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A while later our train stopped alongside another train with French speaking civilian workers inside.</span> <span id="s600">I understood a little French.</span> <span id="s601">I didn’t speak it but I used the few words that I knew and asked them whether the war was over.</span> <span id="s602">They said they weren’t aware of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">The next day we stopped at many places and German women came out and brought food and drink but only a few managed to get it.</span> <span id="s604">We noticed that the guards didn’t interfere and we felt that the end was near at hand.</span> <span id="s605">The same night we stopped at a rail siding near the Alpine village of Tutzing.</span> <span id="s606">We were asleep on the floor of the car when in the middle of the night we were awakened by sounds on the outside.</span> <span id="s607">There were some people out there, whether military or civilian, I didn’t know for I was too tired to notice.</span> <span id="s608">They said that they were from the International Red Cross and that for all purposes, we are free men, and that U.S. troops should be in the vicinity pretty soon.</span> <span id="s609">I fell asleep again, and what was said outside didn’t really punctuate my consciousness.</span> <span id="s610">I just didn’t believe it anymore.</span> <span id="s611">I got up in the morning and looked outside, and what I saw was a dream come true.</span> <span id="s612">The SS guards were gone, disappeared through the night, the few Wehrmacht soldiers, without weapons, were mingling with our people and down the road, at the foot of the embankment, we spotted motorized columns of troops that didn’t look German.</span> <span id="s613">They were units of the U.S. Third Army, 100th Division, I believe.</span> <span id="s614">It was April 30, 1945, exactly three years to the day of my arrival at Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">The U.S. troops were merely passing by that road, going somewhere, and encountered masses of emaciated people coming down the embankment to greet them and cheer them on.</span> <span id="s616">From their moving vehicles, they threw at us cigarettes, chocolate, and various rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">The group of Wehrmacht soldiers was waiting in our midst for most of the day until a U.S. army vehicle came to take them away as prisoners.</span> <span id="s618">There was one SS man who either did not manage to escape or came back for some reason.</span> <span id="s619">He was of short stature and I remembered him as a mean S.O.B.</span> <span id="s620">The moment he was spotted by the Greek fellows, they began to pummel him.</span> <span id="s621">He would have been lynched had not the Americans interceded and taken him away.</span> <span id="s622">I was in a mood to explore and began walking on the track for several hundred feet or so.</span> <span id="s623">I remember turning my head to make sure I am not followed.</span> <span id="s624">I simply could not believe that I was free.</span> <span id="s625">After three years of living under a death sentence, the very first moments of freedom seemed unreal and dreamlike.</span> <span id="s626">It is hard to recapture those moments of delight and joy mixed with sadness and sorrow, for there I was, 23 years of age, having just emerged alive after a cataclysmic long war and imprisonment, and alone in the world.</span> <span id="s627">I knew nothing about my brother in the Soviet gulag and I feared for the life of my oldest brother who was evacuated from Birkenau the preceding October.</span> <span id="s628">The rest of my immediate and extended family was destroyed, as were most of my friends and neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">In the meantime, the immediate problems of survival had to be given some attention.</span> <span id="s630">A lieutenant of the U.S. Army’s 100th Division, named Smith, appeared on the scene.</span> <span id="s631">He apparently was placed in charge to organize the setting up of a Displaced Persons’ Center in Feldafing, a few kilometers from the village of Tutzing, where our train was still used as our home.</span> <span id="s632">We spent two days and two nights on that train, having the satisfaction of seeing German POW army officers and army doctors of a nearby military hospital bringing containers of soup and ladling it out to us.</span> <span id="s633">At the same time.</span> <span id="s634">Lt. Smith and his staff got the townspeople busy in the conversion of a former Hitler Youth School complex of buildings into an UNRRA DP Center.</span> <span id="s635">They cleaned the place, set up beds with mattresses and linens, and got the kitchen and mess hall running.</span> <span id="s636">The train brought us to Feldafing once it was ready to receive us.</span> <span id="s637">Before we entered the new quarters, we had to leave all of our clothes to be burned at a bonfire outside the building.</span> <span id="s638">By way of new clothing, we received a pair of heavy striped hospital pajamas.</span> <span id="s639">The Greek fellows of our transport broke into the clothing stores of the Hitler Youth School and emerged with brown Hitler Youth uniforms.</span> <span id="s640">It was a grotesque sight to see former inmates wearing those uniforms, but no one seemed to care.</span> <span id="s641">We were on our own and had to obtain clothes one way or another.</span> <span id="s642">I found a pair of shorts, which were several sized too small, even though I weighed no more than 85 or 90 lbs.</span> <span id="s643">at most.</span> <span id="s644">Next, I located one moccasin and as luck would have it, a few days later, I found the matching one on another floor of the building.</span> <span id="s645">That was the sum total of my clothes for the next six weeks or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">There wasn’t too much food at the mess hall and we were still hungry.</span> <span id="s647">However, it turned out to be our advantage.</span> <span id="s648">We slowly gained weight and strength.</span> <span id="s649">At other centers, where the food was more abundant, i.e., more fat and high protein, which wasn’t too well digested by people who starved for too long, there were cases of serious diarrhea and death.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">In time I discovered that in Garmisch, south of us and at the very foothills of the Bavarian Alps, there was a larger concentration of survivors from Radom who lived in the UNRRA camp there.</span> <span id="s651">I traveled in my pajamas, hitching a ride on a milk train.</span> <span id="s652">It was there that I acquired my first suit of clothes.</span> <span id="s653">After about a month, we were all transferred to the DP camp in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s654">It was there that I learned that my oldest brother had been sighted in Flossenburg, the last week of April.</span> <span id="s655">One day, while playing ping-pong in the recreation hall, I was greeted by a young man whom I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s656">In response to my question, where we had met, he said, in the Flossenburg camp.</span> <span id="s657">I left Flossenburg in the middle of March, but he said no, I saw you there about the 23rd or 24th of March, before the evacuation.</span> <span id="s658">He meant my brother, for we resembled each other, even though he was ten years older.</span> <span id="s659">This was in the middle of summer, if he had been alive I would have heard about it, for people traveled between DP camps and news spread.</span> <span id="s660">It was a heartbreaking disappointment to me that having gone through so much, he perished within days of liberation.</span> <span id="s661">I don’t know where it happened; whether he was killed during the last death march, or died of starvation.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">In the early fall of 1945, I left for Stuttgart whose DP Center became Radom in exile, attracting Radom survivors from all over Germany, as well as some who came out of Poland.</span> <span id="s663">It was there that I received news that my brother in the Soviet Union survived and that he is in Central Asia.</span> <span id="s664">The news came via a letter from my brother to Radom, which was read by my cousin at the office of the Jewish shelter there, and transmitted by a former neighbor of mine who had left Radom and had just arrived in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s665">It was the first heartening news for me after the war, yet I doubted whether the Soviets would ever permit the refugees to get repatriated to Poland.</span> <span id="s666">I remembered the story of my father’s younger brother who was caught in a similar bind after the First World War and could never return home to Poland.</span> <span id="s667">He and his family perished in the Ukraine during the Holocaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">I spent six months in Stuttgart, and on April 28, 1946 (the fourth anniversary of my leaving home) I was on a freight train with hundreds of others going to Bremerhaven, where on May 10th, we boarded a U.S. troopship for New York.</span> <span id="s669">We were the first displaced persons to arrive in the United States after World War II.</span> <span id="s670">We got a festive send-off by the U.S. Army in Bremerhaven and when we arrived in New York on May 20t, the pier was full of newspaper people and photographers.</span> <span id="s671">It must have been the first and last time that arriving DP immigrants met with such a reception.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">I was sponsored by my uncle, my mother’s younger brother and only living uncle.</span> <span id="s673">He was never married and my brother and I were the only survivors of his very large family.</span> <span id="s674">He treated me with great kindness.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Not long after my arrival in the United States, I received mail from Stuttgart in which my neighbor informed me that someone arrived from Stettin (the former German Baltic port, now a part of Poland) to Stuttgart and told her that my brother and his wife have come to Stettin with one of the transports of the repatriated Polish citizens from the soviet Union.</span> <span id="s676">They came back to Poland shortly after my emigration to the United States, and as it turned out, luckily my fears that he won’t be repatriated were unfounded.</span> <span id="s677">I had his address and sent him a food parcel immediately.</span> <span id="s678">By the time the parcel reached Stettin, he and his pregnant wife were already in a West Berlin DP Center.</span> <span id="s679">The reason for their leaving and for the exodus of most of the thousands of repatriates from the Soviet Union and others, was the bloody pogrom in the Polish town of Kielce, not far from Radom, on July 4, 1946, in which over forty Jewish survivors from the concentration camps were hacked to death as a result of some blood libel.</span> <span id="s680">The police and the military did not intervene, while some policemen participated in the bloodbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: What compelled him to settle in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Nothing compelled him, except some circumstances.</span> <span id="s683">His son was born soon after he and his wife came to Berlin.</span> <span id="s684">They occupied a bunk in a common room in the DP camp without privacy and conveniences.</span> <span id="s685">He managed to find an apartment in the city; he began to work and soon opened a clothing retail business.</span> <span id="s686">His children were born and raised there.</span> <span id="s687">While he didn’t become rich there, he made a decent living.</span> <span id="s688">I have been there many times in the course of these past forty years.</span> <span id="s689">His son graduated from the University of Jerusalem and did graduate work in Amsterdam and Brussels.</span> <span id="s690">He has a responsible position with the Common Market Commission in Brussels, and leads a good life in Belgium.</span> <span id="s691">My niece studied law at the University of Berlin and became an attorney.</span> <span id="s692">She works in Luxembourg where her husband, also an attorney, works for the European Parliament in Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s693">Berlin has a viable Jewish community and it is an interesting city to live in.</span> <span id="s694">My sister-in-law died three years ago and my brother has been deeply affected by her death; they were married for forty-three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Let me return, if I may, to my experiences as a new immigrant in New York City.</span> <span id="s696">My uncle was working in the apparel industry and his boss gave him a chance to train me a as a sewing machine operator of ladies’ dresses.</span> <span id="s697">It was a skilled trade, for we made the entire dress, however, I never accepted dressmaking as my career objective.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">I didn’t speak a word of English when I arrived from Europe.</span> <span id="s699">I was schooled in Polish and Yiddish and acquired a reasonable knowledge of German during the war.</span> <span id="s700">I started by going to evening school several times a week to learn English.</span> <span id="s701">At the end of the school year, the teacher asked me to go to the principal’s office and take a test, the passing of which entitled me to an elementary school diploma.</span> <span id="s702">In the fall of that year, I registered as a student in one of Manhattan’s two evening high schools.</span> <span id="s703">New York City operated evening high schools enabling adults to acquire a high school education.</span> <span id="s704">The school I went to in lower Manhattan had excellent teachers.</span> <span id="s705">I started by going two nights a week and taking English and history classes.</span> <span id="s706">After a year or so, I realized that if I contemplate entering college, I had better buckle down and take my high school work more seriously.</span> <span id="s707">I began to attend five nights a week, four hours each night.</span> <span id="s708">It was hard, going directly from work to school every evening from 6:15 to 10:15, followed by a long trip home by bus and subway.</span> <span id="s709">Homework consumed the rest of the evening and most of the weekend, and I still had to get up early to go to work.</span> <span id="s710">Just before graduation, I took the New York City College Entrance Examination and was accepted as a matriculated full-time student at the uptown campus of CCNY.</span> <span id="s711">My uncle’s assistance permitted me the luxury of being a full-time student without having to work.</span> <span id="s712">If I had to do both, I don’t believe that I would have mustered the courage and the energy to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">I graduated from CCNY after three and one-half years with a B.A. in Economics and applied to graduate schools at Columbia University and the London School of Economics.</span> <span id="s714">That was in 1954.</span> <span id="s715">I was accepted at both schools and settled on Columbia University.</span> <span id="s716">After one and a half years at Columbia, I took the U.S. Civil Service entrance examination.</span> <span id="s717">Several weeks later, I was called by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for an interview and was offered a position as a labor economist.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">That was my start with the U.S. Department of Labor.</span> <span id="s719">The job was interesting and there was a lot of travel in the first years.</span> <span id="s720">After two years on the job, I got married.</span> <span id="s721">I met my wife at my friend’s house.</span> <span id="s722">She was an excellent student, graduating from Hunter College at the age of twenty and completing her Ph.D. in economics at twenty-three.</span> <span id="s723">She died of kidney failure at twenty-five after three and a half years of marriage.</span> <span id="s724">At the time, there was not much that could be done about nephritis.</span> <span id="s725">Kidney dialysis was still a thing of the future.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: So you married her though, after you started working for the government?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: Yes!</span> <span id="s728">I began working for the government in 1956, and we married in 1958.</span> <span id="s729">She died at the end of 1961.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">In early 1962, I took a leave of absence from my job for six months and went to Berlin.</span> <span id="s731">The Department was very decent to me.</span> <span id="s732">They realized that I needed time off and didn’t mind giving me half a year’s leave without pay.</span> <span id="s733">From Berlin I traveled to Israel and later on to Scandinavia.</span> <span id="s734">Several months after my return, I was assigned to Cleveland, Ohio, to assist at the setting up of a new regional office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in that city.</span> <span id="s735">A former colleague of mine from New York who had transferred to the Chicago office at the beginning of the year, was the one delegated to Cleveland to set up the program which I assisted.</span> <span id="s736">For the next holiday weekend, he invited me to come home with him to Chicago and visit with his family.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">During my stay in Chicago, I got in touch with Jeanne, my present wife, who at the time was completing her PhD dissertation in psychology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but resided and worked as a psychologist at a hospital in Chicago.</span> <span id="s738">We attended City College at the same time, and had known each other for many years.</span> <span id="s739">We met and continued to meet on subsequent trips.</span> <span id="s740">We married one and a half years later, after she completed her Ph.D. and returned to New York.</span> <span id="s741">That was in 1964.</span> <span id="s742">Our son, Marc, was born in 1965.</span> <span id="s743">In 1967 I decided to transfer to Washington, for I had enough of travel assignments which are a consequence of work in regional offices.</span> <span id="s744">Our son, David was born here in 1969.</span> <span id="s745">We have lived here for 25 years now.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">After nearly 35 years of service with the Department of Labor, I retired two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">In a nutshell, you have my life’s story on tape, i.e., up to now.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: It’s a very involved story.</span> <span id="s749">Would you like to talk a little bit about your parents now or would you like to stop?</span> <span id="s750">That would be up to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: I would like to stop at this point.</span> <span id="s752">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s755">PAGE 1</span></p></body></html>
