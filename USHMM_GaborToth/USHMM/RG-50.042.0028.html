id="s12">Can you describe for me the difference in everyday life from before the war, and then after the Germans came.</span> <span id="s13">Tell me how things changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Well, to begin with, life was disrupted immediately.</span> <span id="s15">We, uh, I didn't go to school.</span> <span id="s16">I was glad that I didn't have to go to school, I didn't like the school I was going to, that's how stupid I was when the war broke out.</span> <span id="s17">But, I grew up very quickly.</span> <span id="s18">Uh, my...it's difficult to really say that because the disruption was...gradual, and some things were very drastically different when the war broke out, and then gradually life became more normal, but very different than it was before the war, so that for instance we came back from the country shortly before the war broke out, and our cupboards were bare, and my mom tried to buy food because she had survived the first world war, and she knew that it will be difficult to buy food in the beginning, but she couldn't get any staples, she couldn’t get any bread, she couldn't get any flour, she couldn't get any potatoes.</span> <span id="s19">So, she bought whatever she could, so we ended up having uh, chocolates, and halva, and caviar, and, and, and pickled uh herring, but no, fun food, but not real food.</span> <span id="s20">Uh, the Germans came into our city 3 days after the war broke out.</span> <span id="s21">So, then immediately, the 1st thing that happened, there was shooting, you'd hear, we didn't, the first thing that happened is that no one walked out, we didn't leave our apartment.</span> <span id="s22">We were afraid to leave.</span> <span id="s23">And then, of course, as soon as the Germans came in, they passed all kinds of decrees, and there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s24">Uh, later on, some maybe, I don't remember exactly, maybe a week later, people started walking out into the street.</span> <span id="s25">People had to go out.</span> <span id="s26">We, bakeries were apparently given permission to start baking bread so that people were going and buying bread.</span> <span id="s27">I remembers the first time I left the house with my mother very early in the morning.</span> <span id="s28">My mother didn't want my father to leave the house.</span> <span id="s29">You kept men in the house if you could help it.</span> <span id="s30">That was true not just for the Jewish population, it was true for, for all of us.</span> <span id="s31">Uh, so I remember getting up very early in the morning and, because there was a curfew, but, perhaps even before the curfew.</span> <span id="s32">In other words, it may have been earlier than, than the time when we were permitted to leave because my mom was anxious to get into the bread line.</span> <span id="s33">And I remember standing in the bread line, and I remember bringing a bread home, which was a wonderful thing, because we didn't have any real food as I told you for, probably about a week.</span> <span id="s34">Uh, well, then I also remember, I remember that about perhaps 10 days after the war broke out, that the Germans and that was a treatment that was apparently meant for the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s35">Because I remember that soldiers came into the apartment house in which we lived.</span> <span id="s36">Most people in Poland, If they lived in cities or big towns, did not live in private homes, they lived in apartment houses, and the apartment houses had courtyards, and I remembered soldiers came into the courtyard and started to shout that all the Jewish people have to come down to the courtyard, and I do remember coming down with my mom and my father, and I was the oldest, there were 4 of us.</span> <span id="s37">And I think that our cook, who was Jewish, was still with us at that point, and she came down.</span> <span id="s38">And we came down, and they took all the men away.</span> <span id="s39">They took my father.</span> <span id="s40">And I don't remember how long my father was gone.</span> <span id="s41">That was , that was a very difficult time for us, but I do remember that my father came back.</span> <span id="s42">He may not have been gone more than a week.</span> <span id="s43">But I remember that my father was, had auburn hair, and I I remember that when he came back he was almost all grey.</span> <span id="s44">And I was shocking.</span> <span id="s45">And my father, now that I think about it, he was 39 years old.</span> <span id="s46">He was born in 1900, and this was 1939.</span> <span id="s47">So he was 39 years old, and he turned grey.</span> <span id="s48">And they, I also know that some men didn't come back, because apparently the Germans killed some of the Jewish men, whether it was at random, or whatever the reason, my father never talked about it.</span> <span id="s49">So that was, I don't know if I'm describing the difference, but uh, before the war, I, we had a very normal household, we had, I went to school, I was the oldest, we had my, my parents were we were not rich but we were very comfortable.</span> <span id="s50">My father owned a children's infant wear factory.</span> <span id="s51">We had help in the house.</span> <span id="s52">We, we went to school, we went to parks, we, we, I had friends, I read books, I did continue reading during the war.</span> <span id="s53">That was the one thing that in the beginning was good.</span> <span id="s54">There were lending libraries and we had curfews and I did get an education at the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s55">I was a, I was always a bookworm, and at, in the beginning there wasn't that much to do, so I did a lot of reading.</span> <span id="s56">That was perhaps the one nice thing that happened, uh Can you talk a little bit about how you continued an education after the schools were closed, and how you taught your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">My okay my let me just tell you a few things.</span> <span id="s58">uh, there was no school.</span> <span id="s59">First thing of course, that the Germans did is that Jewish children were not permitted to go to school.</span> <span id="s60">All schools were closed to us.</span> <span id="s61">But my parents, my parents didn't know what was in store for us.</span> <span id="s62">No one did at that point.</span> <span id="s63">In fact, my parents felt that things may get better.</span> <span id="s64">They felt that some of the horror stories, the, the, the shooting, and that this was just what happens when a country is occupied, and the occupiers want to put the fear of God into the population, so there is harsh treatment.</span> <span id="s65">But my parents thought that after a while, uh, and that was their memory of the first world war, that uh life will become a little more normal.</span> <span id="s66">Of course, given the fact that there was a war out there and then of course my parents hoped that the war will end, and it will end the right way.</span> <span id="s67">So, we so my parents, I don't remember exactly when, but probably maybe a month or two after the war started, we started uh private tutoring.</span> <span id="s68">Now, I don't mean that it was a on a one to one basis, but the teachers who taught in these schools, organized classes and we would meet in different people’s houses, and I remember in my group, there were maybe 12 or 13 of us, and we studied, we really had classes.</span> <span id="s69">Uh of sorts.</span> <span id="s70">We certainly studied Polish and polish literature and history and geography and it was more difficult with sciences because we had no labs, uh we did mathematics, and my parents were very, very concerned that we continue because they felt that once the war will com to an end, that there is going to be a world, and they wanted us to continue with our education.</span> <span id="s71">Uh, so I was in such a group, and so were my sisters.</span> <span id="s72">My youngest brother was only 6 when the war broke out so I started to tutor him.</span> <span id="s73">I taught him to read and write and he was a very good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s74">.</span> <span id="s75">I think that had he lived he may have been really extraordinary.</span> <span id="s76">I have a very bright, very, very good, very bright son who's extremely good in mathematics, as a matter of fact, and I think that it may have been, I don't know, in the genes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">If you could start just where you tutored your little brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">My brother was 6 years old, and instead of sending him to some kind of a organized school, not school (cough), but organized tutorial, I eh, I was the one who tutored him, and I taught him how to read and write, and I taught him arithmetic, and he was very bright, he was very good in mathematics.</span> <span id="s80">He was a bit of a whiz kid.</span> <span id="s81">I remember that, after a while, I used to take him around because uh, particularly in the evening when there was a curfew, uh, in the courtyard, people were sitting in the courtyard, it wa- still before it got very cold, and I remember that my brother, his name was Lulek, uh, would, people would say to him uh, how much is 5 x 75, and he would come back right away, or more than that, he would say, they would say to him how much is 20 x 183, and it wouldn't take him but a second to give the answer.</span> <span id="s82">And as I said, I really think that he was he was uh, uh extraordinary when it came to mathematics.</span> <span id="s83">He had some kind of a gift.</span> <span id="s84">And he didn't live to realize his potential obviously.</span> <span id="s85">So, that was my little brother.</span> <span id="s86">Uh, things were becoming normal, but they weren't.</span> <span id="s87">The one thing I remember is that how very quickly we were hungry for a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s88">There wasn't enough bread in the house.</span> <span id="s89">We were, food was rationed.</span> <span id="s90">And I remember my brother asking my mom for another slice of bread, and my mom say no, that's all you can get.</span> <span id="s91">Sometimes one of us would give him a little piece of our bread because we felt that he was little and he didn't understand, but my didn't encourage it.</span> <span id="s92">My mother felt we should all get our, a certain amount of food.</span> <span id="s93">But then things did improve some.</span> <span id="s94">My father's factory was taken over by the Germans, by German Troihender, that means somebody that the Germans trust.</span> <span id="s95">And uh, my father worked in his factory, what it meant is that he taught the other men probably how to run the factory and how what to do.</span> <span id="s96">But that was good because he then, we, as a family, he was getting paid, and we were getting ration cards.</span> <span id="s97">Uh, everything was rationed by that time in Poland, so it was very important to have the cards, and if you didn't work, you didn't have the ration cards, and my mother probably started to work at this time to, I don't remember where she worked, but I know she was working.</span> <span id="s98">Uh, I also remember, a few things that happened that were traumatic at that point.</span> <span id="s99">One was that shortly after the war broke out, uh, may have been a, shortly after my father started working in his factory, when the factory was taken over, there was a knock on our door, in the apartment in which we lived, and my mom opened the door, and there was a German lady.</span> <span id="s100">She was a Folksdeutschess??</span> <span id="s101">, so she was somebody who became, she was maybe partly Polish, and she had some German uh family in the background, and with 2 SS men or 2 soldiers, I don't remember.</span> <span id="s102">And she walked into the apt and she looked around and she said, I like it, all of it.</span> <span id="s103">And the following day, some, uh they apparently she was able to get some big trucks and they came, people came into our place, and they took everything out of our apartment, all the furniture, everything that was left, all the rugs.</span> <span id="s104">She was a nice lady, she sent us some broken chairs, and a table and beds, and an old wardrobe.</span> <span id="s105">I remember that that was, at that point, it seemed like, not a tragedy anymore, but certainly...something that we're upset about.</span> <span id="s106">Little did we know that there was much, much worse in store for us.</span> <span id="s107">We simply didn't, didn't realize it.</span> <span id="s108">In fact, I do remember, but that was later, that during the time when I was reading so much, I read a book.</span> <span id="s109">It was called 40 Days of Museldag???</span> <span id="s110">by Franz Werfel, I don't know how to pronounce his name w-e-r-f-e-l.</span> <span id="s111">But I think Americans know him because he wrote a book called the Song of Bernadette, I think, which was made into a movie.</span> <span id="s112">But in the book, 40 Days of Museldat, he wrote about the, what the Turks did to the Armenians during the 1st world war, and I remember, not right then, not in the beginning of the war, but maybe a year into the war, I remember coming down to my father with that book.</span> <span id="s113">And I said, "Daddy, Dad, that's what the Germans are going to do to us."</span> <span id="s114">And I was crying.</span> <span id="s115">And I do remember that my father looked at me and he said, "Don't say that, how can you say that?</span> <span id="s116">The Turks were much less civilized than the Germans.</span> <span id="s117">The Germans would never do anything like that.</span> <span id="s118">Not the Germans.</span> <span id="s119">They may do horrible things, but not what the Turks did to the Armenians.</span> <span id="s120">I'm just telling you this because I want you to understand that we really didn't have any idea what was in store for us.</span> <span id="s121">I don't know why.</span> <span id="s122">My father, at that point, I remember, did listen to there was , we were not allowed to have radios, but my father used to meet in the evening with some friends in the house in which we lived during the curfew, and they listened to BBC.</span> <span id="s123">And we knew that friends fell, we knew what was going on at that point.</span> <span id="s124">Of course, later on, we no longer, my father, it was too dangerous to listen to, to and maybe there was no radio anymore, but in the beginning, certainly in the 1st half a year of the war, we did know what was going on in the world.</span> <span id="s125">It was easier to get, to get, uh, uh and idea of what was going on.</span> <span id="s126">We also had, that brings me to a couple of things I was telling you about the furniture that was taken.</span> <span id="s127">Some things um didn't happen right away.</span> <span id="s128">We lived in what was called an open ghetto.</span> <span id="s129">What that meant is that during that period when the Germans took over our city, they did some shifting around.</span> <span id="s130">Some people had to leave their apartments because there were some areas in the city where the Jews were not allowed.</span> <span id="s131">Some areas we were allowed to stay in, so what was happening is that people were doubling up, and that meant that many people had to take in other people into their apts.</span> <span id="s132">And we actually did get another family to live with us, and they happened to have been actually German Jews from Leipzig, who must have been also sent into our city.</span> <span id="s133">And uh, and we could stay in our apt., which meant that our street was part of that open ghetto.</span> <span id="s134">Now, an open ghetto was what that meant is that we were not allowed to leave the area.</span> <span id="s135">We were not allowed into some streets of the city.</span> <span id="s136">We were only allowed in the area which was considered the open ghetto, but the non-Jews, the Poles, could come into our area, and so could maybe, and so certainly did the Germans.</span> <span id="s137">Of course, they did anyway.</span> <span id="s138">Because of it, there was some barter.</span> <span id="s139">There was some, it was easier to, to if, if, if people had something that they can, that they could barter, then they were able to supplement some of their food.</span> <span id="s140">And I'm sure that in the beginning that's what happened in my family.</span> <span id="s141">Even though the Germans took all the gold away, you know, and they came and they took the silver.</span> <span id="s142">People had to give everything away.</span> <span id="s143">I'm sure that my parents may have hidden some, maybe my mother hid some of her rings or something because the 1st year of the war, once things started being a little more normal, there was some food that my parents were able to get, probably on the black market.</span> <span id="s144">And the fact that it was an open ghetto made life in that sense easier.</span> <span id="s145">On the other hand, you couldn't go into many street, and I have many memories of standing uh I do have a memory of for instance at one time and that was also maybe a half a year after the war broke out, uh standing in front of the main street in our city, which was called, became Hitler Strasse, but it was the street of the Third of May, which is when the Poles had a national holiday, and it was a beautiful street with, with many trees.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Beep So let's go back to the beginning of that memory of that street.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">I, I have a memory, I remember my mom, when, when we were, when we started wearing our star of David, and, and when it was, became obvious that we are not allowed into many streets, I had that memory of standing in front of that street, just at the entrance, knowing that I'm not allowed to go there.</span> <span id="s148">And I'll never forget how beautiful that street, that whole street seemed to me, with all of those beautiful Chestnut trees.</span> <span id="s149">And I remember I would have given everything I had.</span> <span id="s150">And I remember that I had such an urge to go into that street, to just disregard the fact that I'm not allowed, and then somebody pulled me back, must have been a friend, and said Don't, no, don't go there.</span> <span id="s151">And I went back.</span> <span id="s152">Uh, it's just a little thing.</span> <span id="s153">My memory of some of the things, I'm, I'm trying to remember how long we were, I was I was tutored.</span> <span id="s154">I think it was till about 1941, perhaps, the winter of 1941 was a cold one.</span> <span id="s155">I do remember that at somewhere around this time, I started to work, but I continued with my schooling.</span> <span id="s156">But at the end of 1941, things were getting bad, they were getting worse, and I remember, we stopped school.</span> <span id="s157">Things were getting worse because it was more difficult to get heat.</span> <span id="s158">People started to disappear.</span> <span id="s159">But, most of them were young men and women who were taken to labor camp, to work camps in Germany, and there was contact, they were allowed to write postcard a month, so we knew where they were.</span> <span id="s160">If some people disappeared, and we didn't hear from them, that was not that well-known, although, that's not true.</span> <span id="s161">In the very beginning, a lot of the intelligentsia did disappear, and that was not just the Jewish intelligentsia, that was true for the Poles too, so that some professor, some doctor, some, and, now we know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s162">That was, again, considered just the beginning.</span> <span id="s163">People always, I remember that my parents felt that in the beginning, the things that happened in the beginning, horrible as they are, are not a, a, a sign of what's going to be, but rather, something that happens when a country is occupied, they kept saying that, and then it's going to be, somehow life will be a little more normal.</span> <span id="s164">They were wrong, obviously.</span> <span id="s165">Uh, and I now know that there was a psychological war against the Jews that many of the things that were happening to us were gradual.</span> <span id="s166">I think that this is very important to remember.</span> <span id="s167">I think that if they had, if things had happened to us in a more sudden way, a more immediate, I think there would have been a much stronger reaction in the Jewish communities.</span> <span id="s168">This is my own feeling.</span> <span id="s169">I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s170">I think that when you strip a human being of his dignity slowly, he is not the same person, and I think that in a certain way, what the Germans were doing, by putting us into an open ghetto, by taking away some of our rights slowly, it was a conditioning that permitted us to, it made us, that made us uh., more willing, if I, maybe, more willing, more able to accept it.</span> <span id="s171">But, of course, I was a child, but I'm thinking about my father because my father was a really, I think, wonderful human being, and, and, and intelligent.</span> <span id="s172">And I and I, and so was my mom.</span> <span id="s173">And I wonder why they were so unaware of some things, and I think they were.</span> <span id="s174">Maybe they had a belief in the goodness of human nature, and maybe that was their undoing.</span> <span id="s175">Because they didn't see, I don't think that they saw what was happening.</span> <span id="s176">They didn't realize where it was going.</span> <span id="s177">Of course, the fact that we were so cut off, that there was no communication, didn't help.</span> <span id="s178">Let me tell you a few things that happened.</span> <span id="s179">Let me go back to my life.</span> <span id="s180">In 1942, in the Spring of 1942, somebody, a, a militiaman, we had in our open ghetto, we were still in the open ghetto.</span> <span id="s181">We had militia people.</span> <span id="s182">These were Jewish people who were, kind of a ghetto police, came to our place, and they had a list, and I was on that list, and they were going to take me to a labor camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s183">This was very early.</span> <span id="s184">This must have been March or February of 1942.</span> <span id="s185">And I was not quite 16, I was born in 1926, so I was about 15-1/2, and they took me from the house, and they took me took me to a place that was called like a, it was like a transit camp.</span> <span id="s186">In other words, I wasn't taken immediately to Germany, but to this transit camp which was still in our ghetto.</span> <span id="s187">Uh and we were, I was not the only one, there were a lot of young girls and women ranging probably in ages from about 15 or 16 to 25 and men, but separately, and we were waiting, now I realize to be bought by some of the German firms to be taken to Germany.</span> <span id="s188">My father was devastated.</span> <span id="s189">I think I was his favorite.</span> <span id="s190">I don't think parents should have favorites, but I was his favorite daughter, and he was devastated, and he tried to get me out.</span> <span id="s191">This is again, ironic, because Auschwitz was already operating, and going to Germany was probably not a bad thing at that point because it meant going to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s192">But my father didn't know about Auschwitz, and he didn't want his 15 year old child to go to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s193">So he turned heaven and earth, and apparently this was possible, and he made an arrangement with a girl, who was about 18, and maybe that's what permitted him to do it, because it was another child actually going for me.</span> <span id="s194">He paid for it.</span> <span id="s195">She probably was poorer than we were--as poor as we were, my parents may still have had something that they could pay these people.</span> <span id="s196">And she agreed to go for me, and maybe the fact, my father thought that since she's 18, she's at least a young adult, and he was paying for it, and she was supposed to be my substitute if you will.</span> <span id="s197">I didn't know anything about it except that when I would come to the window at the transit camp, and my father would be passing by, he motioned to me that he was doing something.</span> <span id="s198">And uh, about I don't know, about 4 or 5 days, a week after I was taken, I was still in that transit camp, my name was called, and I was told to take my belongings, I had with me some clothing that I was permitted to take.</span> <span id="s199">I took it with me, and I was told to go out, and as I was coming out, I noticed my younger sister, my sister was 2-1/2 yrs younger so she was 13 yrs old.</span> <span id="s200">And I noticed her and I was in, I was tired, and, and, and in a state of shock, but as I went, as I walked out, and I saw my parents were waiting not right near the place, but where they were permitted to wait, and I, and I saw them, they were both standing and crying I think, and I started to cry and I said, Why am I, Why am I out, and why is, what is Pina doing there?</span> <span id="s201">What is she doing there?</span> <span id="s202">And they started, they embraced me, and they took me home, and they told me that what happened actually is that that morning when my substitute was supposed to show up and go in for me, she changed her mind, and my parents were desperate.</span> <span id="s203">And my sister, who was always a very, a kind of a tomboy, one of those kids that was never afraid of anything said, "I'll go for Bella", and my parents thought she's nuts, she's crazy, but uh, I don't know, I don't know what happened, they must have been very distraught.</span> <span id="s204">She convinced them that she's going to go in for me, this was her idea, and that once she's in there, she's going to tell them that she doesn't belong there, she's only 13 years old, and they're going to send her home.</span> <span id="s205">I don't know how she could convince my parents, but this is a true story, she convinced them, and she went in for me.</span> <span id="s206">And lo and behold, she was sent to a labor camp, to Sudetenlat, which is in Czechoslovakia, and uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Um.</span> <span id="s208">So my sister went to the camp.</span> <span id="s209">And it was horrible.</span> <span id="s210">I felt so guilty, my parents were very upset, she was a child.</span> <span id="s211">She wrote a postcard about a month after she was taken, and she said that she's fine, not to worry about her, and uh, one of the most amazing things that happened, I still to this day, I don't know how it happened, she came back to our ghetto three months after she was taken.</span> <span id="s212">And when she came home, she told us that as soon as she got to the camp, she told everybody that she didn't belong there, she was 13 years old.</span> <span id="s213">I don't know how she convinced them to send her back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s214">Auschwitz was operating.</span> <span id="s215">I know because I was later in camps myself.</span> <span id="s216">If you got sick in a camp, you were sent to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s217">It would have been the logical to for the Germans to send her to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s218">Maybe that's the German bureaucracy, I don't know.</span> <span id="s219">She came back to our ghetto.</span> <span id="s220">We had a, a, a Jewish uh community council if you will, or whatever you call it, a Jewish govt.</span> <span id="s221">The head of the government, I was notified that she was coming back, and lo and behold, she came back.</span> <span id="s222">this must have been may or June, I remember the summer of 42 because it was a difficult summer because, but it was such a joy, of course, to have her home, and all the people in the ghetto, she became a bit of a, she was so well known, because it was an amazing thing.</span> <span id="s223">And, in August of that year, in the meantime, things were getting really, things were getting bad.</span> <span id="s224">Uh, people were again being taken to camps, but what happened in August, and now I understand that, uh, we were, there was, there were orders post, orders posted all over the ghetto that on a given day, and it was in August, I don't remember when, I remember it was a very hot day.</span> <span id="s225">We were all told, all the Jewish people in the ghetto were supposed to come to a big stadium.</span> <span id="s226">There was a big, must have been like a field where sports would be, oh they would have some sport activities, but it was a big place, and we were all told to come.</span> <span id="s227">And of course, the signs were very specific.</span> <span id="s228">Anybody not showing up would be killed instantly.</span> <span id="s229">I don't know whether some people didn’t go, whether some people went into hiding.</span> <span id="s230">I know that my parents talked about it, and decided that we have to go.</span> <span id="s231">And I remember that we were told to dress well.</span> <span id="s232">And I remember we were walking in the street, through the city towards the stadium.</span> <span id="s233">All the people, all the Jewish people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s234">And I do remember (coughing), I remember Poles, Poles were standing on the sidewalks, and uh, I don't hate all the Poles, I always, I make sure that I say that, because there were some decent people among them.</span> <span id="s235">But, unfortunately the majority were not decent.</span> <span id="s236">They were very antisemitic.</span> <span id="s237">And there we were, walking in the middle of the street, like cattle.</span> <span id="s238">And they were standing on the sidewalks, and they were jeering, and they were calling us dirty names.</span> <span id="s239">There were some that were standing and they were crying.</span> <span id="s240">I remember that too.</span> <span id="s241">It makes me feel good always.</span> <span id="s242">And we went to this big place, and I remember it was hot, and it was a long day, there was no water and no food.</span> <span id="s243">Not that you can't stand it for a day, but, I remember my brother was still a child, he was crying.</span> <span id="s244">Uh, and I don't remember how long, it was such a long day, and it was about 2 o clock or 3 o clock in the morning when we finally came to what must have been some kind of a table with some people, officials standing, where they were looking at our IDs.</span> <span id="s245">And, uh, my father was working, so was my mother, so was I.</span> <span id="s246">We were all, at this point, I was working, and my mother was working and my father was working.</span> <span id="s247">But, apparently, his work was considered important enough, but he was told to go to one side, and the five of us were told to go to another side.</span> <span id="s248">And after that, we didn't see our father.</span> <span id="s249">And, towards the morning, we were again, those of us who were sent to the other side, were marched down again the street towards two big, apparently, in the meantime, they had emptied 2 big apartment houses, and that became apparently a transit camp, and we were all shoved into this camp, this apartment house.</span> <span id="s250">I now know that this was the 1st big evacuation--a euphemism, of course, for a transport to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s251">I didn't know it then, we didn't know.</span> <span id="s252">But, we sensed that it was something terrible because the treatment of the people was ugly.</span> <span id="s253">The soldiers were pushing us and beating and I remember one thing that I'll never forget--there was a woman holding a little baby, child, I don't know, maybe it was year old, I don't remember, and the child was crying, and the soldier took the child and, and, took the child out of the mother's hands, and hit the child against the wall, and I still the, the, the, the blood, the, the, probably the brain, I don't know, it it just, it did, the whole skull kind of exploded.</span> <span id="s254">And the woman was shrieking, and he, and he was beating her.</span> <span id="s255">And my mother pulled us away, she didn't want us to look at it.</span> <span id="s256">And I was crying.</span> <span id="s257">And we were all very, very upset.</span> <span id="s258">We knew that something, something horrible was happening.</span> <span id="s259">That, during that, that was during the day because we had come in early in the morning from, from that stadium.</span> <span id="s260">So during the day, I don't know how my mother was able to do it.</span> <span id="s261">How she, how her, how, how her mind was working, but she was probably trying to do something (cough), and she convinced my brother, who was a cute looking kid, he had dark blond hair, and big green eyes, and I suppose the Germans would say that he didn't look very Jewish.</span> <span id="s262">And so she told him, and he spoke a good German, and a good Polish.</span> <span id="s263">So she told him to go over to the guard, who was standing at the gate, at the entrance to the apt house, and pretend that he's all alone here, and that his father, that he wants to go to his father.</span> <span id="s264">And I remember that she kind of told him what to say.</span> <span id="s265">And I, he went, and I kind of followed him, but I was standing away.</span> <span id="s266">I didn't hear him, but I could see him.</span> <span id="s267">And then I, so he must have told him that he wants to go home, that his father is home, and I remember that that German soldier looked at him, looked down at him, maybe he was nice human being, maybe he believed him, maybe he took pity on the kid, but he opened the gate, and he said, "Run!</span> <span id="s268">Run home!"</span> <span id="s269">and my brother ran, ran out.</span> <span id="s270">And that evening, at night, must have been late at night, a militiaman came, and took my sister, he just came in, found us, and he said, uh, he just came in and he said that , he said to my mom, that she's such a brave kid.</span> <span id="s271">Let me take her home to your husband.</span> <span id="s272">And he just took her.</span> <span id="s273">In the meantime, my father must have been doing something, trying to get us out, and he managed.</span> <span id="s274">This was the one time he managed to do it.</span> <span id="s275">And, uh, we were, it wasn't that night, it must have been a night later, a day later, because I remember being there another day.</span> <span id="s276">It was, it was a difficult time, but at night, somebody came, somebody must have risked his life for, for money or for whatever, for whatever my father must have given him whatever he had.</span> <span id="s277">And , they took us, and it was very, it was nothing heroic for us, it was just tricky.</span> <span id="s278">We went upstairs to the roof, and through the attic, no we went up through the chimney on the roof, and then, that house was connected to another house where there was a bakery.</span> <span id="s279">And the houses were connected, so you didn't have to be an acrobat and or jump.</span> <span id="s280">All you had to do was just quietly get up, the chimney on the roof, into the other chimney, and then down to the bakery.</span> <span id="s281">I do remember coming down, and we were all covered with flour from the dust.</span> <span id="s282">And I, I think it was at night, and they kept us, because there was a curfew, they kept us till the next morning, and that morning, they dusted us up.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">We've got to-----</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Beep Uh, I do remember that my mom sent my younger sister first, and then I went...home.</span> <span id="s285">You had to make sure that you are not conspicuous.</span> <span id="s286">We probably looked a little bit ragged.</span> <span id="s287">And then my mom came home, and, funny, we were already covered with lice.</span> <span id="s288">The place was already dirty.</span> <span id="s289">We washed.</span> <span id="s290">But it was so good, because we were still together, a family, six of us.</span> <span id="s291">But, by that time there were rumors in the ghetto, and things were getting really bad.</span> <span id="s292">Uh, something happened--I want to tell you about my father because I, I always remember that my father, I loved my father very much.</span> <span id="s293">My father was really a, a decent human being.</span> <span id="s294">The man who was the head of the ghetto had worked for my father before the war for a short time, and he was very fond of my father.</span> <span id="s295">My father didn't have any dealings with him during the whole time, very little.</span> <span id="s296">And if he did, I didn't know about it.</span> <span id="s297">But, this particular time, apparently, the head of the ghetto, his name was Monyet(ph), would be Moshet(ph) maybe today.</span> <span id="s298">Or Moses, Merin.</span> <span id="s299">M-E-R-I-N.</span> <span id="s300">I'm sure there's some...there's, there's some, some uh documents on him.</span> <span id="s301">He was, he was the head of our ghetto, and then I think he was killed by the SS men in Catovitza in '43.</span> <span id="s302">Anyway, he did , he, he, he had a lot of contact with the SS men.</span> <span id="s303">He probably knew about many things that were happening.</span> <span id="s304">And he, he either met my father or called him in, and offered him a job of a militiaman.</span> <span id="s305">And uh, my father was a traditional Jew, a believing man, and, my father looked at him and he said to him, he said to him, he said to him, how can ask me to take that kind of a, that kind of a job.</span> <span id="s306">And Monyet said to him, Look Erin, you have a family.</span> <span id="s307">If you work as a militiaman, you can keep your family a little longer in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s308">And there is a war going on.</span> <span id="s309">And the war may end in a month, in three months, and the longer you can keep your family together, the better your chances for staying together as a family for surviving.</span> <span id="s310">I don't know what Monyet knew, what this Merin, knew, but he knew probably more than many people, and as I said, there were already by that time many rumors.</span> <span id="s311">So, my, my and my father said to him, But I, I, I couldn't do that.</span> <span id="s312">I could not, I would not do that, I wouldn't go to other people's houses, and take people for a transport to work or whatever, and uh, he, the guy got very impatient with my father, and he said Look, he said, I'm trying to help you!</span> <span id="s313">I'm, I'm trying to help you.</span> <span id="s314">And, anyway, look, it's your God.</span> <span id="s315">My father said to him, Look, I'm, I'm, I'm a believing man.</span> <span id="s316">It's against my principles, against everything I believe in.</span> <span id="s317">And he said, but it's your God who is doing it.</span> <span id="s318">Who is looking down at all our misery, and he's not lifting a finger.</span> <span id="s319">And my father said to him, I don't know who's doing it, but even if it's God, I'm not going to be his, he used the Hebrew word, malahamavet.</span> <span id="s320">I'm not going to be his angel of death.</span> <span id="s321">And I know about it because my father came home and he told us.</span> <span id="s322">He felt he wanted us to know that he had this chance, and he didn't take it, and he wanted us to understand why.</span> <span id="s323">And, uh, he didn't do it.</span> <span id="s324">And, uh, and I, I think he was right, of course.</span> <span id="s325">And uh, and uh, things got bad.</span> <span id="s326">After that, we were sent to a closed ghetto.</span> <span id="s327">That was in the end of 1942, we were told to move--people had to leave their place of wherever they were living, there was a special area assigned for the ghetto.</span> <span id="s328">It was called Shrodoula, it was a little village next to our city.</span> <span id="s329">And I remember that we were able to take all our belongings on one cart, I don't remember how we got there, whether it was a horse and a buggy, or a, but we took all of our things, by that time there wasn't much to take, and we were put into this ghetto, and we were given a hut that had one room.</span> <span id="s330">I don't think my sister was there already.</span> <span id="s331">I think my sister was taken just shortly before that, again to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s332">Today I'm grateful because I think that that's why she's alive.</span> <span id="s333">I lost my other sister and my brother, but my sister, Pina, was taken at the end of 42, and to a, to another labor camp in Germany.</span> <span id="s334">And in 1943, very early, must have been January or February, January probably, I too was taken to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s335">And of course by that time, nobody was trying to stop it.</span> <span id="s336">We knew that my father must have understood that it's not a, not, that it's okay, it's better this way.</span> <span id="s337">And I was sent to this labor camp in Greben near Striegal in Germany, which was in lower or middle Silesia--I come from upper Silesia--that's how the Germans called it.</span> <span id="s338">We, by the way, became part of the German Reich immediately.</span> <span id="s339">Meaning, the area where I lived.</span> <span id="s340">And, I, I remember one thing as we were going to the camp, which I thought was interesting because we were still dressed in our clothing, and we still looked pretty okay, and we were picked for looks and, and, and healthy teeth.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">So, as we, and, among us there were some really very pretty girls, really, and as we were walking down the street in that little town of Striegel towards the camp.</span> <span id="s342">I remember the Germans were standing on the sidewalks, and they were, I don't whether they never saw any, this was a small town, they, maybe they didn't know any Jewish people, but they kept saying.</span> <span id="s343">These are Jewish girls?</span> <span id="s344">These are Jewish women?</span> <span id="s345">They're so pretty.</span> <span id="s346">They look so nice.</span> <span id="s347">I don't know what they expected.</span> <span id="s348">Maybe they thought we had horns.</span> <span id="s349">But they were so sureprised to see us look like normal people.</span> <span id="s350">Uh, Greben was a labor camp, so it wasn't terrible.</span> <span id="s351">It wasn't terrific, but it wasn't terrible.</span> <span id="s352">I worked in a flax factory 12 hours a day, one week on a night shift, one week on a day shift.</span> <span id="s353">The work was hard because we did the work that men, German men did, and, before they were taken to the front.</span> <span id="s354">We didn't get much food.</span> <span id="s355">For those who don't know what a labor camp is, I'd like to describe a little bit how how we lived.</span> <span id="s356">We lived in a barrack.</span> <span id="s357">Uh, there were bunks in the barracks.</span> <span id="s358">I, uh, the bunks were small narrow beds.</span> <span id="s359">There was a straw mattress, a blanket.</span> <span id="s360">We had showers.</span> <span id="s361">Not always was the water warm, often it was cold, but we washed because we knew that we need to keep clean.</span> <span id="s362">We were given a loaf of bread, a pound of bread probably, a week.</span> <span id="s363">Which, those of us who had a lot of self-discipline cut into seven pieces, and had a slice a day.</span> <span id="s364">Uh, most of us, actually, didn't last for seven days.</span> <span id="s365">The more disciplined ones ate it up in five days.</span> <span id="s366">Those who didn't have any discipline ate it, probably in two days.</span> <span id="s367">I usually lasted about 5 days.</span> <span id="s368">I wasn't so big, maybe it was easier.</span> <span id="s369">We were given a soup a day.</span> <span id="s370">In the beginning, the soups were not too watery.</span> <span id="s371">There were some colorabi, some vegetables, sometimes piece of potato in it.</span> <span id="s372">Once a week we were given a little jam, a little, uh, a little margarine.</span> <span id="s373">Once in a while in the beginning, we even got a small piece of horsemeat, or some, some, some beef or something.</span> <span id="s374">Later on, of course, we didn't.</span> <span id="s375">And black, uh, ersatz coffee, which is like a substitute coffee.</span> <span id="s376">We were always hungry, of course.</span> <span id="s377">I remember some girls literally crying themselves to sleep.</span> <span id="s378">Uh,...</span></p> <p><span id="s379">We have to reload.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">CR-Six</span></p> <p><span id="s381">beep I was working in a flax factory, as I started to tell you before, and, uh, I worked in the, the first, it's hard--I don't know what they call them, it was a fully automated factory where the flax came in on big... by train, they, uh, in other words by uh, uh, what is it, like wagons, uh, uh, what do you call the train, it's not a train where people, not passenger trains but...</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Freight.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">What?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Freight trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">Crate trains!</span> <span id="s386">And we would have to unload the flax from the, into the first department if you will that had big cones like, they had machines that looked like cones because the flax had little um, mmmm...there were seeds in little balls in, in on, on the flax, and they were trying to save the seeds, because the seed was what they used to make oil, uh, for cooking or whatever.</span> <span id="s387">So, it was very important to unload the, our job, our task was to unload the, the flax, and then, send it through these big machines that were combing off the, the, the seed, and then it would go to a next dept where it was cooked.</span> <span id="s388">The final, the, the, the last, eh, eh, department in that factory already produced uh, uh thread that was put on spools.</span> <span id="s389">This is how it was done, and it was a fully automated factory, and what that meant is that they only needed to work us, to work the people who worked in that first dept which was called riefenlage(ph), I don't know what that means, in, in English, uh, enlage must be department and rief must have been the, the, the name of that first place, and as long as they rushed us, the whole factory was working, so the SS men were forever standing over our heads making us work, so, because if we worked fast, they did.</span> <span id="s390">And, uh, we, this is, this is, and did both, sometimes I unloaded trains, sometimes I was at the machine.</span> <span id="s391">Uh, in the, in the evening, at night, the night shifts were the hardest because it was very cold.</span> <span id="s392">The place was open, it was winter, we were not well dressed, and it was really a, a, uh, uh, it was a, it was a miserable place, it was, it was hard.</span> <span id="s393">But, there were some things; we had a Kapo, we had a girl who was in charge of us, and she was not like some of the Kapos that you read about, she was really a very nice person.</span> <span id="s394">She was older than we were, she was about 23 at that point--very beautiful girl, and she was always walking around trying to help everybody.</span> <span id="s395">Uh, in the evening around 12 o clock, we used to get a break, when they would bring the soup from the barracks, because that's when we got our soup when we worked.</span> <span id="s396">And she would ladle out the soup to everybody, and we would huddle around her, would sit around her, and sometimes we would sit around and talk, and sometimes we would be quiet, and sometimes, when it moved her, Salka, her name was Salka Abramchik(ph), would sing.</span> <span id="s397">She had studied voice in Italy, in Milano, I think, and she had a very beautiful soprano, and I remember that night, that particular night that something happened, that she started to sing to us, and she was singing Shubert's serenade, and it was just so beautiful, she had a really beautiful voice, and I remember that it was such a good feeling to be sitting there, it felt so warm.</span> <span id="s398">For the few minutes, I forgot where I am; I felt, I thought I was somewhere where it's beautiful and where the sun is shining, and, uh, suddenly, it, I, I, I noticed that we were not alone.</span> <span id="s399">And I remember I turned my head very slightly because I was afraid, scared, and I saw this SS man standing, and he was looking at her, at, at Salka, and she, she wasn't aware of it at that point, and I could see that he was really enchanted, he was looking at her with really, with rapture, almost.</span> <span id="s400">And suddenly, she must have noticed that he's looking at her, and she stopped singing, and it got very quiet, and he, suddenly started walking towards her, and he pushed, we were sitting down on the ground, so he was kind of pushing us aside, and he walked over to her and he, she was sitting too, and he picked her up, and he started beating her, he started hitting her on the face, he was hitting her, and screaming at her, and he was beating on her really, and screaming so loudly, saying, You have no right!</span> <span id="s401">You have no right to sing like this!</span> <span id="s402">You have no right to look like this, you dirty Jew!</span> <span id="s403">...and then he walked away.</span> <span id="s404">Uh, with all of that, I was , I was just thinking that I was, there was still a child in me.</span> <span id="s405">I was 16.</span> <span id="s406">We were allowed a postcard a month, so I wrote to my parents once a month, and I think I received a postcard a month, and we were allowed to get a little package from home.</span> <span id="s407">I don't remember what my parent’s sent me, maybe they send me something, some food or something, whatever they could.</span> <span id="s408">I remember getting one or two packages, but I do remember that, because I was working with this flax, and I was wearing my coat, at that point we were not given any of the prisoners uniforms, we were wearing our own clothing.</span> <span id="s409">And it was tearing at my coat, and tearing at my clothing, so I wrote to my mother, and I'm thinking today, How could I do it?</span> <span id="s410">But, I wrote to my mother, and I asked her to send me, if she could, a pair of overalls.</span> <span id="s411">And, I suppose only a mother does that, I don't know how she did it, but I received, the last package that came from home, I received a blue pair of overalls, and it was obvious, because, I, she may have written me, but it was obvious that she, she, no I know now, I have a cousin who was with, with them, and she survived Auschwitz, and she told me how my mom did it.</span> <span id="s412">She took a sheet, an old sheet, a linen sheet, I don't know where she got a, some dye, in, in a kind of a royal blue.</span> <span id="s413">She dyed the sheet, and she made me a pair of overalls, and she sent it to me.</span> <span id="s414">It was her last gift for me, that she sent me, those overalls....And, after that, there was no mail, and we knew something was happening, we knew that something, something happened.</span> <span id="s415">There was no communication.</span> <span id="s416">Most of the girls in the camp were from the same area, and communication stopped, so we knew that something had happened to the ghetto, and about a couple of months later, must have been around Yom Kippur, a transport of women came to our camp from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s417">I don't know how many, maybe 50, maybe 100, and among them were some, at least there was one or two that I knew, may have lived on our street, and I remember we were so anxious to find out what happened, and I remember walking over to one of them when we could, and I said, What happened, what happened to, to the ghetto?</span> <span id="s418">What happened to my parents?</span> <span id="s419">Do you know what happened?</span> <span id="s420">And they were so hardened, they had gone through Auschwitz, and she, I remember she said to me, "You mean you don't know?!</span> <span id="s421">You mean you don't know what happened?</span> <span id="s422">They were all cremated.</span> <span id="s423">They were all killed.</span> <span id="s424">They went to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s425">You mean you don't know about Auschwitz, you don't know what there doing to us?</span> <span id="s426">It was really Yom Kippur....(cries).</span> <span id="s427">I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Let's stop for a minute-------------------</span></p> <p><span id="s429">beep Okay, sometimes during this time, our camp was changed from what they called a labor camp to a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s430">We became part of the Gross Rosen, which was a big concentration camp, and we were part of that complex, and what that meant is that uh, rules were even stricter.</span> <span id="s431">I do remember, for instance, that when we came home from, home to the barracks, from our, from the factory that they had taken all our possessions, all our pictures, some of us had photographs from home.</span> <span id="s432">Everything was taken away, they had burned it and taken everything away, so it was, things were getting really...rough in the camp.</span> <span id="s433">Uh, it was at that time that something happened that was, I thought, when I think about it today, just remarkable.</span> <span id="s434">Um, the last department of that factory was the one where they were already making the thread, putting it on spools, had big combines, big, big uh, uh, machines, that had uh, belts, uh, the belts were heavy belts, and they were apparently part of that uh, uh, those combines that were, that they were uh using for for making the thread, or putting the thread on the spools, and there were women working around there.</span> <span id="s435">Uh, this was on a night shift, and apparently one of those belts snapped, and hit one of the girls, who was working there.</span> <span id="s436">Her name was Rose, I don't remember her second name now, and she lost her eye immediately.</span> <span id="s437">It, it, apparently it must have hit her on the eye, in the eye, and it swam out, or whatever.</span> <span id="s438">And, uh, we heard about it immediately.</span> <span id="s439">There was some, there was some communication between, between us.</span> <span id="s440">Apparently there was some, some women older than than uh, and a little bit, perhaps, more aware, and uh, they were communicating somehow from one place to the other, in spite of the fact that we were always guarded and watched, and we made a decision.</span> <span id="s441">A decision was made that when we get back to the barrack, that we're going to ask for medical help for this Rose, for this girl.</span> <span id="s442">Uh, we had a, uh, uh, a little, uh, what they call krankenstuper, which was like a little sick room, like a room where, somebody was sick, you could go to the nurse, who wasn't really a nurse, but she knew a little bit about nursing, and maybe she could do something for you.</span> <span id="s443">There wasn't much help.</span> <span id="s444">If anybody got really sick, they were sent out of the camp.</span> <span id="s445">Uh, but we, so we knew that she is not going to be able to help her.</span> <span id="s446">So we decided that we're going to ask for help.</span> <span id="s447">I happened in the factory, and we felt that we're going to ask for it.</span> <span id="s448">I don't know why we decided to do it, but it was, it was a brave act, and maybe stupid, but, we, we decided.</span> <span id="s449">And, when we came back to the barrack, and we were standing on appel, which is when they take, when they count us, and when our commander ------- the women, the woman who is in charge, after she counted all of us, told us to go to the barracks, we didn't move.</span> <span id="s450">She was shocked.</span> <span id="s451">And she repeated her order, and we didn't move.</span> <span id="s452">And then one or two, I don't know who stepped out, and told her that we are not going to go the barracks until Rose is taken--she had been brought into the barrack from the factory, and was in that sick room, but we wanted her to be taken to a doctor.</span> <span id="s453">Somebody has to take a look at her, she was hurt in the factory.</span> <span id="s454">And, she thought it was ridiculous, funny.</span> <span id="s455">Well, anyway, she and her helpers, they started to, to, to beat on us.</span> <span id="s456">They were screaming that we have to go back to the barracks, and we weren't moving, and some of us were beaten up pretty badly.</span> <span id="s457">Uh, uh, it depended where you were and where the, the whips fell.</span> <span id="s458">And, uh, after a while, I must have been one of those who was, who was beaten up, I was, because I don't remember much that happened.</span> <span id="s459">But, when I came to, and when I regained my consciousness, I was told that what happened is that the people from the factory, the foreman, and some of the, when they heard that we are standing in the camp, and we're not going to our barracks, they became concerned that we won't be able to come back for the night shift, or maybe there was some conscience, but they came in, and there was some negotiation with the SS men, who were in charge of our camp, and lo and behold, they made arrangements for Rose to go and see a doctor.</span> <span id="s460">And I know that she went to town, to, to Streigel, about a half a dozen of times with the nurse, and with an, with an SS man, or SS woman, and she was treated, she must have had an infection, and they put in a glass eye.</span> <span id="s461">She survived, I know about that, and she is in Israel.</span> <span id="s462">I don't know if she's still alive, but she was in Israel.</span> <span id="s463">And it was one of those amazing things.</span> <span id="s464">I, again, it's one of those, they could have, they could have killed us, they could have shipped us off to Auschwitz, and brought in other people to work.</span> <span id="s465">Uh, but anyway, we did it.</span> <span id="s466">We saved, there's no question that she would have not been alive if we hadn't done what we did, and uh, I don't know if I want to call it resistance, but it was.</span> <span id="s467">It was a form of resistance that worked at that time, for her, and for us......Do you want me to go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Greben was a labor camp, and as rough as things were, I didn't again, I, now, now I know that it was nowhere nearly as bad as some of the other camps.</span> <span id="s470">I was to find this out later on.</span> <span id="s471">In 1944, around October, apparently the Russians were coming close to the German border, and orders must have gone out to many camps, to evacuate the camps.</span> <span id="s472">And, our camp did get such an order, and sometimes I think early in late October, early November, we were shipped, we were sent on the famous Death March.</span> <span id="s473">Death March got its name from the fact that many people didn't make it through the march.</span> <span id="s474">We started out by walking.</span> <span id="s475">It was already winter in Germany, it was cold.</span> <span id="s476">We were marched, I don't remember how many days, uh, we would stop for the night in different places, in barns, to sleep.</span> <span id="s477">Sometimes they gave us food, sometimes they didn't.</span> <span id="s478">I don't know whether they, they knew themselves where they were marching us.</span> <span id="s479">They marched towards one camp--the camps were too full--then they would turn back.</span> <span id="s480">Then we were put on cattle trains.</span> <span id="s481">As bad as the death march was, the cattle trains were worse.</span> <span id="s482">We were crowded into them like, like animals.</span> <span id="s483">You couldn't, you, you, you could barely stand...they didn't give us any food.</span> <span id="s484">When there was bombing we would be told to run out of the trains.</span> <span id="s485">Many of us didn't bother.</span> <span id="s486">Germany was bombed, then there was a lot of, there were a lot of activity.</span> <span id="s487">And, frankly, for us, we would often look up and, and, and pray that they drop a bomb, maybe, on the Germans, on, didn't matter to us.</span> <span id="s488">Uh, some people jumped the trains, tried to escape (cough).</span> <span id="s489">Some of them were caught and killed, some probably managed to get away.</span> <span id="s490">I tried to jump a few times, but, I didn't manage.</span> <span id="s491">And after a, I don't know how long it took, we came to Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s492">Bergen-Belsen was , was not a, was not like Auschwitz, it didn't have crematoria.</span> <span id="s493">It didn't have, crema--it did have crematoria, I'm sorry, but it didn't have gas chambers.</span> <span id="s494">Uh, they didn't need any.</span> <span id="s495">It was a real death camp.</span> <span id="s496">They had lice and hunger and typhus and typhoid, and people were dying in that camp like flies.</span> <span id="s497">When I think, myself, and I sometimes wonder, and, I came to Bergen-Belsen probably early December of 1944, or maybe middle December, and I was liberated in the middle of April.</span> <span id="s498">When I think that I survived Bergen-Belsen without, with very little help, I, I, I don't understand how I did it.</span> <span id="s499">I just--this, to me, is one of the biggest puzzlements because it was really a horrible camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">We have to------</span></p> <p><span id="s501">okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">beep</span></p> <p><span id="s503">beep We were put into a barrack.</span> <span id="s504">It was a big barn, like a big place, there was nothing on the floor except some straw.</span> <span id="s505">And we were put in there, we were crowded into that place, that we couldn't stretch our legs.</span> <span id="s506">We were sitting with our knees close to our chins.</span> <span id="s507">It was cold, and it was crowded, but it didn't stay crowded very long.</span> <span id="s508">People were dying almost immediately.</span> <span id="s509">I remember (cough) that it didn't take long before we could stretch our legs because the girls, the women were dying all around me, and we would carry them out.</span> <span id="s510">There were big, big piles of dead bodies outside of the barracks, and (cough) I, I carried many too.</span> <span id="s511">I don't know what, how I kept going, but I do remember, was maybe a form of maybe it was some kind of way of protecting myself, that I never, never looked at the faces.</span> <span id="s512">I just never looked at the faces.</span> <span id="s513">And uh, it was, it was rough.</span> <span id="s514">We didn't get food.</span> <span id="s515">We didn't get, we get, we would.</span> <span id="s516">They would come in once in a while and, and bring some food, but you, it wasn't anything that you could count on.</span> <span id="s517">Uh, you couldn't wash yourself--there was no water.</span> <span id="s518">I tried in the beginning.</span> <span id="s519">I was always covered with lice.</span> <span id="s520">I would get up in the morning, and I would shake out my, my uniform, my, funny it had, the uniforms were grey and blue.</span> <span id="s521">In the morning you couldn't see the blue on the, on the uniform because I was so, it, I was so covered with lice.</span> <span id="s522">Shortly after we got there, though, maybe a week after we got to this barrack, a woman came in.</span> <span id="s523">She belonged to the management of the camp.</span> <span id="s524">She was working, she had gone through Auschwitz, she was Jewish, she was dressed, she didn't live in a barrack such as we did.</span> <span id="s525">She probably had a bunk, and was getting food a little more regularly, and she started calling, asking for somebody by the name of Tila Ringler.</span> <span id="s526">My camp sister's name was Freda Ringler.</span> <span id="s527">Freda and I were like sisters.</span> <span id="s528">She was Czech.</span> <span id="s529">We became friendly in Greben--the first camp, and we shared everything.</span> <span id="s530">When Freda got an extra bowl of soup for some extra work, she would save me a half of it, even if I wasn't around.</span> <span id="s531">When she got an extra piece of bread she would leave me some.</span> <span id="s532">When I had an extra soup, I remember I would always make a line on that bowl to mark off which is hers, and I remember eating that soup, and eating it so slowly, and I would eat, and I would come so close to what was Freda's part, for sure, I'm sure, never, never giving her an extra spoon, but never taking a spoon of hers.</span> <span id="s533">I never cheated on Freda, and I don't think she ever cheated on me.</span> <span id="s534">And, this, this woman who came there was calling Freda's sister.</span> <span id="s535">Freda had an older sister whose name was Tila, and she belonged to a Zionist organization before the war, and when the war broke out, she signed up--apparently the Germans were signing people up to go to Palestine--it was a hoa, hoax.</span> <span id="s536">She ended up in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s537">Freda never, Freda knew that Tila disappeared, but she didn't know where she disappeared to.</span> <span id="s538">And when she heard this woman calling Tila Ringler, she stepped out and she said, Tila was my sister.</span> <span id="s539">What do you know about her?</span> <span id="s540">And this, this woman took a look at Freda, and Freda really did look like Tila--they had the same blue eyes, the same face, I know it because I met Tila after the war.</span> <span id="s541">But Tila had dark hair, and Freda had blond hair.</span> <span id="s542">And that was the only difference, so this woman, uh, took a look at Freda, and she said, of course, I believe you, you are, you look like Tila.</span> <span id="s543">And she said, "Tila saved my life in Auschwitz, so I am going to take you out of here because if you stay here, you will die."</span> <span id="s544">And Freda said to her, "But you have to take Bella because we are like sisters, and I won't go without Bella."</span> <span id="s545">And this woman said to her, "I'm not taking Bella.</span> <span id="s546">She's, she's nobody to me, I, I don't care about Bella.</span> <span id="s547">I'm taking you because I owe Tila.</span> <span id="s548">My life, so I'll, I'll do it for you, but uh, if you don't want to go without Bella, then you can stay here too."</span> <span id="s549">And I said, so, I said to Freda, "Freda, that's, that's stupid.</span> <span id="s550">If you stay here with me, we'll both die.</span> <span id="s551">If you can save yourself, go ahead.</span> <span id="s552">And besides," I said, "maybe you could help me."</span> <span id="s553">I think that's what made Freda leave--when I said to here that you could help me.</span> <span id="s554">And she left, and she became a runner in the part of the camp that was a working camp.</span> <span id="s555">There was a hospital there, and she was a runner in that hospital, and that made her life a little easier because she had a bunk, and maybe uh, a little more food.</span> <span id="s556">And, she did try to come, she did come, it wasn't easy because they were not allowed to come into our part of the camp, but she would come and she would bring me a potato, or some bread.</span> <span id="s557">She would help when she could.</span> <span id="s558">I was by that time already what they call in the camps, a musselman, which means that I looked like a walking skeleton.</span> <span id="s559">I was dead.</span> <span id="s560">I was really skin and bones.</span> <span id="s561">And, that was a dangerous way to look, because that meant that you are going.</span> <span id="s562">And uh, but something happened to save me, and that was that Freda managed somehow to get me out of that barrack.</span> <span id="s563">It was already I think, early March, that she got me out of that barrack into a other barrack into another part of the camp where I went to work, which meant that I got a bunk, and I shared the bunk with another person, and I want to tell you a little bit about that because I did something then that I have on my conscience, and I, I told you about my father, and I told you how I didn't cheat on Freda, and I'm proud of it, but there are some things that I did that I'm not so proud of.</span> <span id="s564">Uh, I had a friend in Greben.</span> <span id="s565">Her name was Hella.</span> <span id="s566">She was not as close to me as Freda, but she was a friend.</span> <span id="s567">Hella--Helena in English.</span> <span id="s568">Was a very lovely, lovely, gentle, sweet, sweet girl, really, and I was very fond of her.</span> <span id="s569">And she was with me in that horrible barrack, and then when I came over to this other barrack, and I had my bunk, maybe a week or two weeks later, she came to see me, and to ask, actually I had gone through, in the meantime, I had had typhus.</span> <span id="s570">I don't know how I survived it, and I had typhoid.</span> <span id="s571">Typhus is your stomach illness, I think, and Typhoid was high fever, that attacks, I think, the brain.</span> <span id="s572">And I had had both, and I survived it, but I was scared.</span> <span id="s573">And Helen came, Hella came, and she was feverish, and she looked sick, and I knew she was sick.</span> <span id="s574">And she came over, and she said to me, "Bella, would you let me sleep with you on your bunk tonight?</span> <span id="s575">It must have been an evening, my, the girls I shared the bunk with must have been working the night shift, so that I had room.</span> <span id="s576">So, she came and asked me whether I would let her sleep with me on my bunk.</span> <span id="s577">And I looked at Hella, and I, I saw she was sick, and I was scared, because I had been sick before, and I knew that I could catch it again, I, I, I was afraid.</span> <span id="s578">And I said, I said to Hella, "Hella, I'm sorry, but you are very sick, and I have to go to work tomorrow, and I'm afraid I'm going to get sick.</span> <span id="s579">And I, I can't let you sleep on my bunk."</span> <span id="s580">And she looked at me, she was really lovely.</span> <span id="s581">And she said, "It’s okay Bella.</span> <span id="s582">I understand."</span> <span id="s583">She said, "I, I understand."</span> <span id="s584">and she walked away.</span> <span id="s585">And she died that night.</span> <span id="s586">I know because I found out, and, I don't know, maybe she know, maybe she knew she was dying.</span> <span id="s587">I never forgave myself that I, I didn't let her, maybe she wanted to die with a little dignity on a bunk, and I didn't, I didn't let her, and I feel very bad to this day whenever I think about it.</span> <span id="s588">I don't think I'll ever forgive myself.</span> <span id="s589">I think she forgave me.</span> <span id="s590">She was that kind of a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">We can stop now.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Okay, that's good.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Beep What kind of choices do you think you had in that life that might have helped you survive or helped others survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">I don't know that I had choices.</span> <span id="s595">I'm trying to think.</span> <span id="s596">Uh, I honestly think that I survived by luck--I think I was lucky.</span> <span id="s597">I must have been somewhat optimistic, I think, maybe.</span> <span id="s598">Uh, I think that the fact that I protected myself sometimes, may have been helpful.</span> <span id="s599">But I, I must say that I, my life, at least, as I see it, did not give me any opportunities for choices.</span> <span id="s600">I tried not to hurt anybody while I was there.</span> <span id="s601">I don't remem--I know that there were things going on--not everybody--I had a--we had a Kapo in this Bergen-Belsen, where I worked this last time, who was a real bitch.</span> <span id="s602">Uh, I didn't have an opportunity maybe, to do that, but I don't think I would have.</span> <span id="s603">I never stole anything from anybody, no matter how hungry or, or, or, or, or, or hungry, no matter how desperate I was.</span> <span id="s604">I did not, I did not...do certain things.</span> <span id="s605">I think I had a very, I think I was very, I must have had good upbringing, but I don't know that this necessarily helped me survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">What kind of spiritual resistance did you see or witness?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Well, in the beginning, I probably believed in God, as my father did.</span> <span id="s608">I think that I lost that after the Auschwitz people came in.</span> <span id="s609">But I think that I, as I said I think that I, I remember that my father said to me that last Yom Kippur at home during the holidays, that he said, at one point, "Maybe won't all of us won't survive, but I hope that you will."</span> <span id="s610">I remember he said, and there be somebody left.</span> <span id="s611">I don't know whether that gave me some, some feeling that somebody should be left from our feeling.</span> <span id="s612">I don't know whether that gave me the strength.</span> <span id="s613">Uh, I think that perhaps the fact that I had Freda was very helpful, because we had each other, and she did for me, and I, I did everything I could for her, and she did everything could for me, and maybe that gave us strength.</span> <span id="s614">We, we got along, better than some sisters did in the camp.</span> <span id="s615">That doesn't mean that there weren't sisters who got along, who, who didn't stay close, but we really supported each other.</span> <span id="s616">I think that may have been helpful.</span> <span id="s617">Uh, I can't think of anything else really.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Did people pray, did they.</span> <span id="s619">.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Some did.</span> <span id="s621">I think Freda always did.</span> <span id="s622">Freda was much, Freda was more of a believer than I. I think I, I had a difficult period for a while there, but she, she was more, I think, uh, steadfast in her belief, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Can you tell about the, when you worked sorting the candies...</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Right, right.</span> <span id="s625">Uh, that last job of mine, I worked.</span> <span id="s626">Believe it or not, the Germans were losing the war, and they were still in Bergen-Belsen, we were still sorting clothing.</span> <span id="s627">They had a big, they were taking inventory, and the work that I did, which permitted me to have that bunk, and and some, some, maybe a little more food, was precisely that kind of work.</span> <span id="s628">So, what I, but the way I could help myself, because there wasn't really that much to eat, was that I would, I had a right to wear a pair of panties maybe and a slip, uh, or, or a sweater, and maybe a skirt under my uniform.</span> <span id="s629">And stockings.</span> <span id="s630">Now, if I went to work in the morning, and I didn't put on a pair of panties, or I didn't put on something under my uniform, and then during work, if I could slip it on, and put it on, then I would bring it back to the barrack, and I could barter it, sell it to somebody for something.</span> <span id="s631">But, the Kapo was a real, she really was a very, she was Jewish, but she was a bitch, as I said.</span> <span id="s632">She didn't, she didn't permit it, but she didn't like me much either.</span> <span id="s633">She, I, she was, I think she was dumb, she wasn't very, I don't know that she, I don't think she knew how to read.</span> <span id="s634">She was, she was an illiterate.</span> <span id="s635">Maybe I was too bright for her, my Polish was too good.</span> <span id="s636">I don't know.</span> <span id="s637">But she, she, she really, she picked on me.</span> <span id="s638">I also looked like a musselman.</span> <span id="s639">That may have been against me.</span> <span id="s640">In other words, I was, I was, I looked like a walking, I was a walking skeleton.</span> <span id="s641">And so she would, she would check me, and if she saw that I didn't have a pair of panties on, I couldn't bring a pair of panties home, she would, she would, she'd beat me up.</span> <span id="s642">So, it wasn't a tremendously successful thing for me, and besides which, I didn't work there very long because I got sick again, and I came down with Para-typhoid, and this was the last, these were the last weeks of the camp, and, if anybody ever tells you that you cannot survive without food for a long time, I don't think that we were given any food in that camp towards the end of the, the, the occupation.</span> <span id="s643">The last 10 days, people like I--I'm not saying there were some people who were still able to get around--I didn't get any food for close to 10 days, I rarely had water.</span> <span id="s644">That's why I don't understand how I survived.</span> <span id="s645">But I made it without food for all this time.</span> <span id="s646">Freda did come when she could when she could, when I so sick, and she brought me water, and she was with me that last night before the liberation.</span> <span id="s647">She brought some water, and I think she may have brought me an aspirin or something.</span> <span id="s648">I had a very high fever, and that following day, the British came, and we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Can you talk about, do you remember older people being in the camps, like your parents' age.</span> <span id="s650">Did you know any of them or were there very few of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s651">There were not many older people in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s652">There were certainly not many, there were not, there was one girl who I am still friendly with, who came to Greben to our working, to the labor camp, from Auschwitz, and she was from my husband's city, from Wootsh(ph), and uh, her name is actually, uh, she's alive, the girl is alive.</span> <span id="s653">Her name is Lucia Carroll, and she came with her mother to our camp, and this was a novelty--there was a girl who came to camp with her mother.</span> <span id="s654">Now, she buried her mother in Bergen-Belsen, but her mother was with her in Greben.</span> <span id="s655">This was the only woman that I remember who was my mother's age, and my mother was 43 when she died, when she was killed.</span> <span id="s656">So this may have been, maybe in her early 40s, and that was old.</span> <span id="s657">For, in other words, in our camp, that was, she was the only one that age, and I don't remember many in Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s658">Now there were some Russian women in our camp, and some of them may have been older, but again, not that much older.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">So, in general, who lived, and who didn't live?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Well, that's hard to tell.</span> <span id="s661">There were, you know, after the war, I suppose there are some statistics.</span> <span id="s662">there are some people who survived.</span> <span id="s663">I had, I had one cousin who survived with his 2 sons, and he must have been in his 40s, but that was rare.</span> <span id="s664">I think the, the very young didn't make it, and , not just the very old, but people, often, perhaps, mothers, didn't make it because, now, my mother was a very pretty woman, and she probably looked quite young, but she went, I'm sure that she didn't want to be separated from her two, from my sister and my brother who were children.</span> <span id="s665">So often women who were older, older, meaning who had children--if they were in their late 30s or even if they were in their early 30s, if they had children, they went with their children.</span> <span id="s666">And, and, if they were older, they didn't have a chance.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Beep.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">I just want to go back and finish that thought about who had a chance to live and who didn't from an age standpoint.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Well, then, my feeling is that, only people who are able to, to go to work, and even then, it depended very much on what the demand was.</span> <span id="s670">Uh, in Auschwitz, there were times when they sent the whole transport into the ovens.</span> <span id="s671">Without any, any selections.</span> <span id="s672">In other words, there was no demand for, for, for workers, and they would just be sent in.</span> <span id="s673">Uh, I think, for instance, when I think about the men of our, the head of our ghetto, about many, who many bad things can be said after all these, can say that he collaborated with the Nazis.</span> <span id="s674">In other words, he worked with them.</span> <span id="s675">But I think that I am alive, now, this is not a choice, but he did see to it that a lot of young people from our ghetto, from our area, that they were sent to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s676">And so I didn't go through Auschwitz, I may not have made it through they selection, and I went to a labor camp.</span> <span id="s677">Now, many of us didn't survive the labor camps either because of the Death March, and the concentration camps, and but, but there was that chance given, and I always feel that this, this Merrin, who had such dirty hands, may have saved some, some kids, some, some young people.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Now, I hate to ask you this, and you can tell me you won't do it if you can't, but we ran out before you finished telling about Hella, and I would like you to tell that story again, if you can.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Sure, sure.</span> <span id="s680">I'll try not to cry.</span> <span id="s681">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">I had a bunk.</span> <span id="s683">I told you I started to work, so I had a bunk which I shared with another girl, and I had had typhus and typhoid, and I was, at this point well, I had gotten over both.</span> <span id="s684">And, one evening, my friend, Hella, came to see me.</span> <span id="s685">Hella was her name--Helen in English.</span> <span id="s686">Hella was not as close to me as Freda, but she was a good friend.</span> <span id="s687">(Noise in background) She was a good friend of mine, and she was a very lovely, gentle, girl, really lovely, very sweet, and I was very fond of her.</span> <span id="s688">And she was in this death -------walk through the background.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">beep I, and I was extremely fond of her, and she was really sweet and gentle, and I could see she was sick, she was feverish, and she said to me, "Bella, would you let me sleep on your bunk tonight.</span> <span id="s690">I'm really sick.</span> <span id="s691">I don't feel well.</span> <span id="s692">And I would like to sleep on a bed.</span> <span id="s693">Would you please let me sleep with you?"</span> <span id="s694">And I looked at Hella, and she looked very sick to me, and I was very scared, and I was afraid that I'm going to get sick, and I said to her, "Hella, I am sorry, but I can't let you sleep on my bunk because I get sick."</span> <span id="s695">And I said to her, "Please forgive me, I can't let you do it."</span> <span id="s696">And she said to me, she was very lovely, she really was a nice, decent human being, and she said to me, "That's okay, Bella, I understand."</span> <span id="s697">And she just walked away.</span> <span id="s698">And she just, just walked away.</span> <span id="s699">I, I know that she died that night.</span> <span id="s700">And I know now that, maybe she knew she way dying, I don't know.</span> <span id="s701">I, I, she wanted to die with dignity maybe, and I didn't let her, and I never forgave myself for it.</span> <span id="s702">I never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Can you talk about liberation, uh, with the sugar and socks.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s705">That's right, it's nice to end on a more cheerful note.</span> <span id="s706">Well, I remember a few things about liberation, which was wonderful.</span> <span id="s707">I remember, I was sick, they, they took the sick people first.</span> <span id="s708">They took us to hospitals, they quarantined us because they were afraid that we would, you know, spread the disease, but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s709">First of all, because I was so sick, the British, the, felt sorry for the inmates, we were hungry and walking skeletons, and they gave us their food rations, and I don't know whether this is recorded, but this is the truth, that a very high percentage of inmates in Bergen-Belsen died because they were given food that they had no business eating.</span> <span id="s710">There was dysentery.</span> <span id="s711">They, they, apparently because the food was so rich--Well, I couldn't eat it, so that was lucky.</span> <span id="s712">I was taken out of the camp, and I do remember a few things that were so memorable.</span> <span id="s713">I remember, sick as I was, that as the truck on which I was, I don't know, these were not ambulances, but I was, you know, I was comfortable.</span> <span id="s714">As it was leaving Bergen-Belsen, I could smell the fresh air.</span> <span id="s715">There was such a difference between the horrible stench of, of Bergen-Belsen, that I remember that I, I just took a deep breath.</span> <span id="s716">It was such a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s717">And, I also remember something else, because DDT is not allowed anymore, but they sprayed me with DDT, and it was just great because all the movement, all the itching, all the--stopped.</span> <span id="s718">All the lice that were, that were killing me, that were biting.</span> <span id="s719">All of it stopped.</span> <span id="s720">And it, I was at peace.</span> <span id="s721">It was a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s722">I'm forever grateful to DDT.</span> <span id="s723">And then I remember I was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s724">I don't remember how long I was there, I remember that, I do remember being pretty upset when I took a look at myself because I really was a skeleton, but, uh, one of the soldiers who must have carried me maybe from the barrack or something remembered me, or maybe he, maybe he came to see who survived.</span> <span id="s725">Some of us didn't survive even the hospital, but he came to visit me.</span> <span id="s726">I, and, I think that he may have been a German Jew because I remember speaking to him German.</span> <span id="s727">And, uh, that was possible.</span> <span id="s728">He made have been in England, and volunteered, or was taken to the army and fought in Germany.</span> <span id="s729">So anyway, he brought me, but he was a British soldier.</span> <span id="s730">So he came in the first time, and I think, to see that I'm alive, he was glad to see, and he asked me what I want, and I remember I asked for two things.</span> <span id="s731">I wanted warm socks because it was May, and I was freezing, my feet were always cold, and I wanted sugar.</span> <span id="s732">So he came the following day or two days later, and brought me a pair of knee-length socks and a little bag of sugar, maybe it was a quarter pound, maybe less.</span> <span id="s733">And I do remember two things.</span> <span id="s734">I put on the, the socks, and I was very unhappy, I was crying because I didn't have any calves, and the knee-length socks wouldn't hold, they would, they, there was nothing to hold them up.</span> <span id="s735">And then I took the sugar, and I literally poured it into my mouth.</span> <span id="s736">And he got so upset that he went to see the nurse to ask, you know, whether I didn't do myself some harm, and I, I think the nurse told him that I was just craving sugar, and so, that was the....</span></p> <p><span id="s737">I think I asked you everything.</span> <span id="s738">Thank you very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Um, I did want to add one thing, because you asked about God, and if you want me to, I can tell you that I did have a bit of a dintorah(ph), which means like a 'case' with my God, and for a long time, I really didn't want to have anything to do with religion.</span> <span id="s740">I was Jewish because I had survived as a Jew.</span> <span id="s741">But I, when I went to see my sister in 1959, and I walked the streets of Sahd, and, and went into the kibbutz, and went in, went into a synagogue in Jerusalem, I came back and I started to study.</span> <span id="s742">I started to learn Hebrew again, which I had, I had Hebrew before the war and during the war, and I studied the Torah, and I studied Jewish history, and I really became, I, switched.</span> <span id="s743">I was thinking of maybe becoming an accountant.</span> <span id="s744">I was also good with numbers.</span> <span id="s745">But, I decided to go into Jewish education, and I, I made peace with God because I decided that, that God was not responsible for Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s746">That we are free to make our choices.</span> <span id="s747">That's what a man is.</span> <span id="s748">Man is free to do the right thing and to do the wrong thing.</span> <span id="s749">We were taught what is right and what is wrong.</span> <span id="s750">And Auschwitz was the creation of evil men.</span> <span id="s751">And, and I don't think God is responsible for Auschwitz, men is.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">So, what I just wanted to say is that how I, I made peace with God, I think, in that way that I, I do believe that...God was not in Auschwitz, as I said.</span> <span id="s753">Uh, I, I agree with a professor whose name is Packenheim(ph), who said that God was not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s754">And maybe, I do remember one thing that when I talked to a rabbi years later, (clears throat), and I told him about my (cough) disagreement, my, my dintorah if you will, with God, which is uh kind of like having a court case with him, and he said, "Bella, you never lost your faith because one doesn't have a dintorah with something that one doesn't believe in."</span> <span id="s755">So that's how I have made peace with myself.</span> <span id="s756">In that sense.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Okay.</span> <span id="s758">Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">This is room tone.</span></p> <p><span id="s760">Wentworth Films, Inc., Holocaust, Bella
