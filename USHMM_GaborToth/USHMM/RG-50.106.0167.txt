And they brought it to shul, and then they -- I ma -- I made a [indecipherable] and that’s all. But -- but I studied the tal -- not the Talmud, the Jewish [indecipherable] right away started then, before I came Bar Mitzvahed because you have a lot to know in the Jewish [indecipherable] law. And that’s -- I started ver -- one year almost. The best teachers they ever were there -- and we were very poor, they didn’t try to save money, anything on this.

And Lemberg become a very assimilated state, so my grandfather -- I did not know him -- I guess I know him for a few months -- I -- I was a little boy when he passed away.
Q: What kind of work did your father do?
A: What?
Q: What kind of work did your father do?
A: My father became a butcher. He didn’t wanted to become a butcher, but that’s the va -- only thing he could do, because he -- he selled cattles. And the cattle business was much bad, at one time they broke a leg. And when they broke a leg my father took a goy, you know what a goy is? The -- the goy was selling the meat. And he made a lot of money. So he say t -- able -- be able to do this all my life, and I will make a better living. And that’s all what w-was to it. And he became a butcher.

Q: And then you started working?
A: What to do there? Was not what to do in a small town like mine.
Q: So what did you do?
A: Sometimes you know, I -- I’ll remember when they used to bake matzos, I used to go make th-the matzos because they took only Jewish children. And that’s very little bi -- but my brothers became butchers too, and they used to go to the villages and buy something and sell it, you know how it wa -- but it’s not a big deal.
Q: So when you were fi -- 14 - 15 - 16 and 17, what were you doing?
A: Was hardly anything to do. A small town you didn’t have -- sometimes they used to bring in certain things for you have to clean it out or whatever. So I used to go do it, but not always was this a-ability to do.

Q: -- you went -- the Russians took you to Kiev. How long did you stay there?
A: In Kiev? In Kiev I stayed only two, three days, but then we went more deep because the German came already closer, so I knew there is not for me to wait, because we know we don’t want to see the Germans.

Q: So where did you after Kiev?
A: Ah, after Kiev I went Starobelsk. That was a little bit more -- were some Jewish people a little bit. But all along there was Jewish people, we feeled more comfortable.

Q: And do you -- and -- and what kind of work did you do there?
A: Paper mec -- I was not too long there. I also went into the Polish army. I volunteered. But we had a feeling we will turn out somewhere a little bit more comfortable, to be able to survive.

Q: So where did you join -- you said you joined the Polish army? And where did you do --
A: The Polish army I was only a very short time, til we came to Israel. When I came to Israel I had there families and I knew I will not go back with them.

And then they rented for us a bus, and they took us a little bit far -- further away, so nobody will be able to know where we are, and that’s all.
Q: So after you -- after you deserted the Polish army, you went directly to Palestine?
A: I was already in Palestine, only I transferred to the Jewish army a few months later because they didn’t want me to go around in the street and somebody will g -- recognize me.

A: What?
Q: What do you think about Poland today?
A: Oh, they should have dropped dead before they were born. I’m telling you the truth with the way I feel about them. That’s the way I feel it. First of all, I know they killed all the -- my family, all the Jews there, all my friends. I -- I couldn’t tell you how cruel these people were to the Jewish people, that all their life -- you will ask me why we lived there. You know, 1922, nobody could come to America. So hi -- my parents stayed there because we had misporca here. You know what misporca means? That’s the -- I don’t want disturb you -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A

Q: And where was your daughter born?
A: What? My wife?
Q: Where was your daughter born?
A: Here, in the United States, in New York.
Q: So you lived in New York City?
A: She lived all of them. She was a wanderer. Excuse me. She used to wander a lot. I-I -- the only thing is, when I saw she wants to settle here back, I was in heaven, because I know in Israel she said I -- if I could find a husband there, I would stay there. But you know, you don’t find a husband overnight.
Q: So you lived in New York City?
A: What?
Q: You and your wife lived in New York City?
A: My wife, yes.
Q: And what kind of work did you do in New York? What kind of work did you do?
A: May I keep it like this? I will hear a little bit better.
Q: What kind of work did you do in New York City?
A: New York I was work, anything I [indecipherable]. I was not particular on anything, because you need a really -- a big profession to -- to get settled in is -- in Israel, and this I did not have.
Q: Tell me what you think of Germany today?
A: Germany? [speaks foreign language here]. Do you know what I said? They should burn wherever they are. I don’t have to tell you w-what we know what we -- they did. They’re unbelievable, one human being will do s-such a thing. But they were not [indecipherable] for the Ukraine and th -- all the -- who were not Jews, they did it. And the United States didn’t let in the Jews here, when they needed a home, but they let in the all -- the murderers and all of these things here. You know it, I don’t have to tell you this. I could not tell you this because you know just as much as I do know.
Q: Do you think about the war years a lot now? Do you think about the war years, the time of World War II? Do you think about that a lot now?
A: What war?
Q: D-Do you think about the war time, now?
A: Oh sure I think. They were horrible years, absolutely horrible. Nobody opened a door to us. They all let us die where we were there. If I would tell you what I used to eat sometimes.
Q: You can tell me. What did you used to eat? A: We used to eat the thing what they make [indecipherable], the -- the mark, they called it mark. I don’t know if you know what it is. And I used to -- if I used to have a piece, I used to eat it. But I didn’t got poisoned with it. I used to go walk, bringing water from the g -- from the river there only for a meal, only to get a meal. When I used to take the meal they gave me a -- more, a little bit more to eat. I used to [indecipherable] diarrhea, o-oh, the diarrhea was undescribable what it was. You know, with this kind of food what you eat. They used to give us a -- a -- a -- a bread. This was the whole thing what they used to give us to eat in the Polish army already. Bread only, 70 grams of bread and a little bit kwi -- kwi -- hot water. When I came back here, I was not too well. I’m not too well right now either, maybe because whatever I went through.
Q: What were the sleeping arrangements like?
A: We used to sleep ever -- we used to be about eight, nine people in our -- i-in our -- what you call it?
Q: A -- a barracks?
A: What?
Q: A barracks?
A: It’s not a barrack, was a --
Q: A tent? A tent?
A: A tent. In a tent, and we used to make the heat, we used to go pick up the food in the forest. And when they used to give us a -- a loaf of bread, we used to have i -- have to keep it until the next day, but we were so hungry we didn’t wait til the next day. Was not an easy life.
Q: How was your health? Were you as strong? Did you have a strong body?
A: I was a strong boy all my life, but when I came here I was not too well. Since I came here, I got better medicines and so on, I improved a lot.
Q: When did you learn to speak English? A: I knew a little bit before I came here, but then a few weeks later I already spoke a good English. I don’t speak a good English today, but --
Q: Do y -- do you speak Polish?
A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. That’s was the language, but it -- mostly my mother tongue was Yiddish. I speaked already a good Russian. I spoke Ukrainian, but most of them I forgot.
Q: Are you very religious today?
A: No.
Q: Why not? Cause you were -- you said your family was very religious.
A: I’m very much Jewish minded. I will not lie to you, I’m very much Jewish minded. I -- nobody could take me away from my Jew -- become high holidays I go, but not because I believe. I remember I -- one time when I was home even, I say to my mother [speaks foreign language here]. I felt so guilty all my life what I say to my mother. I already then not believe, and I was 15 - 14 -15. And you know, I grew up in a Jewish organization, they did not believe too much, they influenced me.
Q: What -- what Jewish organization was that?
A: What?
Q: What Jewish organization was that? A: I used to belong to Hashomer Hatzair. But they were leftists, not too [indecipherable] about it. They were leftists. Not because I hated Jewish things, I loved what -- mine Jewish tradition until this day, no less when I was born in my home. But as far as Jewish tradition, I would never give it up, never.
Q: Are there any songs that you remember singing --
A: Songs?
Q: -- singing from Hashomer Hatzair? Any songs? A: I-I don’t have any more a good voice, so I don’t want to show you what [indecipherable]
Q: Why don’t you sing just a little bit?
A: What?
Q: Why don’t you sing just a little bit then?
A: [speaks foreign language]. All my life I love you. Oh my daughter, oh my daughter, I love her so much. She’s the only one what I have left. I cou -- I -- I know I don’t have a -- right now a good voice.
Q: Mm-hm, okay.
A: I used to have a better voice, but not like my father used to have a voice unbelievable. They killed him oh -- for no reason at all. Only reason because they were Jews. No reason at all. And among the goyim even today when I hear, where I am right now, they hate us all, even today. Even today they hate us.
Q: How do you know that?
A: What? Q: How do you know that? How do you know that? How do you know that they hate the Jews to --
A: How I know? I could see it every day. If I will tell you -- I live right now where -- in a place which is mostly they’re not Jewish people, mostly. Hardly any of them -- if you would see how they hate, you wouldn’t believe it in the United States of America. I tried to figure them out a little bit. It’s unbelievable [indecipherable] they hate, no reason at all. To hate Jews you don’t need a reason. They were Jews, that’s all we -- Jews have money, Jews have good business, Jews have this, Jews have this. Like they don’t have anything.
Q: Well, is there anything else you wanted to talk about on the t -- on the tape that you haven’t --
A: If I remember, I don’t remember too well. I told you right away I don’t remember too much. I could re -- tell you a whole book. Oh, I’m sorry. I could tell you a whole book, but I don’t remember.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: My memory is gone, completely. You could see it.
Q: Wa -- how long has your wife been gone? When did your wife pass away? A: My va -- wi -- my first wife?
Q: Yes.
A: My first wife. I would say 25 - 26 years. I never remarried. I didn’t want to remarry. I have it once, I had enough.
Q: And what was your wife’s name?
A: Ruth.
Q: And tell me more about why you changed your name.
A: What?
Q: Tell me why -- again, why you changed your name to Dortort.
A: Because I deserted the Polish army, and I didn’t want them they find me, and then they still have the English army, so I didn’t want to have this name, because I was a deserter at this time. Not only me, the greatest part of the Jews, see, people who were in the Polish army, they deserved it, too. I’m positive you know something about it. A bunch of haters. Could you imagine I was sleeping with them in one -- in one t -- tent, and all the time they were reading how many Jews they killed. Is this a civilized ki -- people? Even today they tell you about hating Jews, and they’re not afraid. In this United States I have the last couple of weeks such experience with American about hating. Hating open, open, not hi -- hi -- they don’t hide it.
Q: Wha-What was that experience?
A: What is the exper -- this is the experience. They hate you. They hate you because Jews. They don’t do it for any other -- do you know, one guy, he came over to me, and he said -- one guy to me he came over and he said, tha-that I -- I could not remember everything, that is my problem right now. If my problem would be what I could remember a little bit more, I could tell you a book. Because I was one time telling this story, and he said, you know, with your vocabulary and your what -- with your stories, you should write a book. I loved it all.
Q: Oh.
A: I loved it. You see, I make an effort to tell you whatever I told you, but I don’t remember everything. My memory is not too good any more. But --
Q: Well, I’m sure your daughter remember -- knows your story.
A: What?
Q: I’m sure your daughter knows your story.
A: No, no, she doesn’t ru -- I told her many stories at the time I remember I used to go over to her for dinner somewhere and I used to tell them the stories. So that they used to wait for me to come and -- all the time for dinner, and I would tell them again the stories, but it’s all gone with the wind.
Q: Well, your daughter knows it, so it’s not gone.
A: What? Q: Your daughter knows your stories, so it’s not gone.
A: I told her a lot of stories, yeah. I told her the truth. And everything what I say, I swear, every word is true what I say. I never told a lie. I’m not a bra -- a -- what you call it, a bre-breaking about it. Bra --
Q: Bragging.
A: Bragging about it. I never -- I never were a bragger. Even when I was something -- my father was the same way. That’s -- I inherited from my father.
Q: Well, some of your stories are on this tape, and that’s good.
A: What?
Q: Some of your stories are on this tape recording, and that is good.
A: Here?
Q: Yes. On this tape that you just made.
A: If I will remember I could tell you, but I don’t remember.
Q: Okay. Is there anything you wanted to say, any more -- did you want to sa -- any message to your grandchildren?
A: Yeah, you are a very lovely lady. You behave very nice. You don’t try to press me too much because you want the story.
Q: Is there any -- any message or advice to give to your grandchildren? You said you have two grandchildren.
A: Th-This -- this is a good message what I have, but I couldn’t remem -- I told them all of them, they already have something from me, these message, when I was clear. You know, all of a sudden, I got old. The memory started to go. I have a son -- a brother-in-law, he was a multi-millionaire. He was a multi-millionaire and he’s a multi-millionaire today, too. But he also lost his memory.
Q: Yeah. Tell me the name of your daughter.
A: Alisa.
Q: And your son-in-law?
A: Hm?
Q: Your daughter’s husband, your son-in-law.
A: Son-in-law, his name -- his name is Jay. Jay -- Jay -- I will give. This I remember.
Q: And your grandchildren’s names?
A: My grandchildren, the first one is Aaron, and the other one is Rebecca. They’re both named after my parents.
Q: That’s beautiful, that’s beautiful. Is there anything you want to say to Aaron and Rebecca before we close?
A: I’m very proud of them. They very smart kids, both of them. And they [indecipherable] but they very shy, they never give me a kiss. But what could I tell you, I’m happy th-that she have two kids. My daughter gives me a kiss already, all the time, with a [indecipherable] not without a [indecipherable]. And that’s what all it is.
Q: Well, that’s a nice note to end the interview on. That’s a ver --
A: I -- I hope you got out something from me.
Q: Very much so. Thank you very, very much.
A: If I would be able to tell you, you wouldn’t be able to finish up by tomorrow morning.
Q: Heh heh heh, okay --
A: I remember I used to go with my daughter to a place for high holidays, and there used to be ladies, and when I still have a clear mind and a clear memory -- mostly I don’t have a clear memory, they used to come only to -- I would tell them the stories. Today it was an interesting story how Jewish people got killed.
Q: Right. Well, that’s an important story too, to tell.
A: Hm?
Q: That was an important story that you told.
A: It is an important story. I had hope and think we will be able to -- but I don’t believe this, we will be able to do because I see it here, I live here already over 50 years. What I see right now in this place, forget it. Anti-Semitic unbelievable. [indecipherable]. And I say to myself, but what reason? I don’t talk too much and I don’t mix too much, but I don’t let the abuse also.
Q: Mm-hm.
A: If you think I will be quiet when somebody will start something against me or my people, I will not quiet, I will be answer with the full thing, but I tried to do it this way. I will not insult them so they will have to [indecipherable] say for us. This I don’t want it to happened. Do you know what I mean? I will not let them do this. They will be able to [indecipherable] something, but this is an insulting thing, degrading and so on and so on. Nobody could do this to me. I’m so nice you listen to me. I couldn’t tell you how much I enjoyed it to talk. But I hope you got out something from it.
Q: It was a very important story that you told, and thank you very, very much for doing it.
A: But I could tell you, you have your people, Polish people, Polish people, what they suffered from Hitler just the [indecipherable] they so anti-Semitic, unbelievable in the United States of America.
Q: Thank you, and this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Eli Dortort.
