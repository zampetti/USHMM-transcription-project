my mother did go to a Gymnasia Russian school.</span> <span id="s34">They were fond of literature and enjoyed what may be better things in life as far as culture is concerned.</span> <span id="s35">Even though the city was quite poor, but things weren't that costly.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">13:03:43 On my mother's side, the family were merchants.</span> <span id="s37">They had stores, weren't rich, they weren't poor.</span> <span id="s38">On my father's side, the family had quite a number of children and they all managed to get university education either in Moscow or in Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">13:04:07 Until 1939 life was interesting, uneventful, but still difficult compared to American standards.</span> <span id="s40">Things weren't so plentiful, we had to study hard, watch our manners, never discuss</span></p> <p><span id="s41">money.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: What did it mean, "never discuss money?"</span> <span id="s43">Well, like with the parents.</span> <span id="s44">This wasn't our business.</span> <span id="s45">The father made all the decisions.</span> <span id="s46">For us, for something, we either could afford it or not.</span> <span id="s47">But normally they wouldn't discuss money in front</span></p> <p><span id="s48">of the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">13:05:00 I had gone to a series of private schools, and so did my sister, and my little brotherone of them, the other was too small.</span> <span id="s50">We also had dancing lessons, piano lessons, whatever.</span> <span id="s51">I studied in Jewish schools, which were not government, but were private.</span> <span id="s52">Because my father believed in that.</span> <span id="s53">He was actually involved in the education of Jewish children.</span> <span id="s54">He was on the Parents' Committee of the Real Gymnasia.</span> <span id="s55">That's the school I attended.</span> <span id="s56">Before that, I went to a private school, that is six grades.</span> <span id="s57">They were all not government.</span> <span id="s58">The same for my sister.</span> <span id="s59">I was a pretty good student.</span> <span id="s60">I wasn't anything spectacular.</span> <span id="s61">But I worked very hard for my grades.</span> <span id="s62">Everybody had to do that, because we were always under the threat: "well if you don't get the grades, then you don't pass, and then you stay for another year."</span> <span id="s63">And that was</span></p> <p><span id="s64">a shame.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">13:06:17 I had thought, or my father would tell me, that perhaps I would go to the University.</span> <span id="s66">But we already knew of the anti Semitism in Poland, that it was very difficult.</span> <span id="s67">My father said that perhaps it would be necessary for me to go to Europe.</span> <span id="s68">But this was very far, perhaps to Paris.</span> <span id="s69">I don't know if it would have been a reality or not, or perhaps I would go to a university or perhaps not.</span> <span id="s70">I excelled in languages and history.</span> <span id="s71">My sister was very good in arts, performing and arts and crafts.</span> <span id="s72">Then I was quite good in sports.</span> <span id="s73">My father taught me how to swim.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">13:07:06 Every summer, we'd go to the country to a little house, where we'd stay most of the time.</span> <span id="s75">We'd rent some places.</span> <span id="s76">Winter we'd also go.</span> <span id="s77">Sometimes I'd go to a little village where my relatives had some land.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">13:07:32 Everything was rolling along more or less normal.</span> <span id="s79">The greatest interruptions being the antiSemitism.</span> <span id="s80">Because my father would always complain that maybe he wouldn't have his job.</span> <span id="s81">Until the Russians came in.</span> <span id="s82">When the Russians came in, there was a major upheaval in my family.</span> <span id="s83">My father and my aunt, that lived with us, were politically involved in the party of the Bund.</span> <span id="s84">They were great enemies of the Russians; and we were on the list to be evacuated.This was going slowly.</span> <span id="s85">First that evacuated the Capitalists, then would take the political people.</span> <span id="s86">Well, we had to take precautions.</span> <span id="s87">We got some summer places to stay, not sleep homenot me, but my father and my aunt.</span> <span id="s88">Well, this didn't happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">We went on to our schools.</span> <span id="s90">They were completely changed to the Russian and Lithuanian languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">13:08:36 In 1941 of June, the 23rd exactly, the night of graduation.</span> <span id="s92">I remember coming home and the parents were there, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">We heard all this canon, and we didn't know what it was.</span> <span id="s94">We didn't pay attention to it.</span> <span id="s95">But we knew the next morning that the Russians had evacuated and the Germans had come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Just as suddenly as that?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Well, it took 24 hours, perhaps.</span> <span id="s98">When the Germans came in, we didn't know what to expect.</span> <span id="s99">In the beginning it was passible, but right away they started coming out with the edicts, that Jews can't do this and that, can't have jobs, go to school, had to maintain curfew.</span> <span id="s100">It was getting very difficult in that respect.</span> <span id="s101">At that time, Warsaw was already occupied by Germans, and a lot of refugees came and stayed with us.</span> <span id="s102">People were making plans to leave Vilna, to go to the U.s. or Japan through Russia.</span> <span id="s103">I didn't understand very much.</span> <span id="s104">I didn't know what was going to happen, and how long this terrible situation was going to last.</span> <span id="s105">However, we didn't make any plans.</span> <span id="s106">This was very bad.</span> <span id="s107">And still today, I think about it.</span> <span id="s108">It could have been much more different.</span> <span id="s109">Especially maybe if the children were sent out, because we could have written to other families who had already gotten papers.</span> <span id="s110">We could have started something, but we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">13:10:38 Q: Were the other families aware enough to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">The families that came from the other cities, that had already experienced stay under Hitler knew more what it was.</span> <span id="s113">We were caught in that very first.</span> <span id="s114">In the U.S. there were some organizations that were helping.</span> <span id="s115">Some of my teachers and friends were already leaving.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">But my father didn't do anything, so that's how it was.</span> <span id="s117">We thought, "this won't last long."</span> <span id="s118">I remember the days quite well from the 23rd of June to the 6th of September, 1941.</span> <span id="s119">We were in our apartments.</span> <span id="s120">We didn't go into the ghetto yet.</span> <span id="s121">But we had to wear a yellow star or and armband with a "J" for Jude.</span> <span id="s122">Our neighbors, the Poles, weren't of help and used to laugh at us, add fuel to the fire.</span> <span id="s123">We were made to walk in the streets, turn in our valuables, and had to stand in lines for long hours under threat of death, that if we don't turn them in (radios,bicycles), they're going to shoot us.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">13:12:15 Curfew.</span> <span id="s125">You could go out into the streets from six in the morning to eight at night.</span> <span id="s126">After eight at night, you couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s127">So next day, if you go out in the street, you would see some people lying dead on the street with a note clipped to their suit,</span></p> <p><span id="s128">saying "8:20."</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: They were shot?</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Right, so we wouldn't think it was joke.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">13:12:55 I had a girlfriend, a very beautiful girl who lived in another part of town.</span> <span id="s132">Very good friends; her name was Buba, my name is Beba.</span> <span id="s133">Her father was a very prominent person in the city; she didn't have a mother, she was brought up by her grandmother.</span> <span id="s134">I went one day to see her.</span> <span id="s135">She lived in what used to be the old ghetto, because Vilnius was started in the 16th century, so there was the old quarter.</span> <span id="s136">She said to me, "something is happening.</span> <span id="s137">The Germans are coming around, and they said we have to be evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">" So I said to her, "Buba, why don't you and your grandmother stay over at our house for a few days, and we'll see?"</span> <span id="s139">And she said, "no.</span> <span id="s140">Maybe I'll do that tomorrow, or I can't, my grandmother is too sick."</span> <span id="s141">And that was the end.</span> <span id="s142">Ww were talking that we'd see ourselves the next day or the day afterwards.</span> <span id="s143">And when I came there two days later, the apt.</span> <span id="s144">was completely empty.</span> <span id="s145">The conciergethey owned the apt.</span> <span id="s146">housethe caretaker, the woman was in tears, because she worked for the people.</span> <span id="s147">She was a Polish woman.</span> <span id="s148">She said, that in the middle of the night, the Germans came and told everybody to pack up their belongings.</span> <span id="s149">And the entire apt.</span> <span id="s150">house, and the next one, and the one after.</span> <span id="s151">When I went back to Vilna, I took pictures of all that.</span> <span id="s152">They were just evacuated.</span> <span id="s153">I didn't know what it meant, in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">13:14:00 I said, "well, they took them to another city."</span> <span id="s155">But they didn't take them to another place.</span> <span id="s156">They took them to the place, that's called Pinari.</span> <span id="s157">A village outside of town, where we used to go skiing.</span> <span id="s158">And they shot them.</span> <span id="s159">Now.</span> <span id="s160">And this is to make place for us, for the people from the other districts to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">13:15:01 The Jewish community didn't function well anymore.</span> <span id="s162">You see, the heads of the community were taken hostage.</span> <span id="s163">My father was taken, and then he came back.</span> <span id="s164">There was complete chaos, like a breakdown.</span> <span id="s165">But we knew that the city jails were full with Jewish people.</span> <span id="s166">And people said, maybe they'll let them out and maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">We didn't know what was going on.</span> <span id="s168">However, they didn't let them out.</span> <span id="s169">Whoever had some special protectia (ph) could pay money and get a relative out.</span> <span id="s170">But by and large, they would fill the jails up, and then empty them out; fill them up and empty them out to Pinari.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">13:15:51 My father was taken hostage.</span> <span id="s172">And everyday the Germans would come into the courtyards and shout, that all the men and boys should come down and take soap and a towel, maybe a change of clothes for work.</span> <span id="s173">Naturally, the Poles would indicate to them where the Jews lived, because the Germans didn't know.</span> <span id="s174">So they would go from house to house.</span> <span id="s175">Well, my father was hiding, because he had already come back.</span> <span id="s176">He had managed to stay with my uncles.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">13:16:34 A few days before September 6th, there was an edict on the walls and everywhere, on the loudspeakers, because we weren't allowed to have radios.</span> <span id="s178">All the Jews will evacuate their houses and will be going to a place specially reserved for them, a ghetto in town, which was very close to where my Gymnasia was.</span> <span id="s179">It was going to be all orderly.</span> <span id="s180">We were all going to go in the way we lived, with the courtyard that we lived.</span> <span id="s181">We were going to be given a marching order, and we were going to walk.</span> <span id="s182">Well, it was pretty bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">We could only carry what we could, either a rucksack or a suitcase.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">People weren't sure whether we were going to go to a ghetto or a</span></p> <p><span id="s185">little further.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: Pinari?</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Pinari.</span> <span id="s188">So we all lined up, and we went.</span> <span id="s189">I remember my little brother, he carried toys.</span> <span id="s190">I forgot what I took.</span> <span id="s191">Some clothes, something.</span> <span id="s192">And we came in there with all the other inhabitants, when our marching orders were given.</span> <span id="s193">Before that, we managed to hide some things, get some things out of town, to some neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Essentially we took very little.</span> <span id="s195">We were herded into that ghetto and were assigned a room with a couple other families.</span> <span id="s196">It was raining.</span> <span id="s197">First we were sitting in the courtyard; rain was coming down.</span> <span id="s198">Then we found ourselves in a room with some other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">13:18:35 O.k. My father managed to make some contact with the outside.</span> <span id="s200">He knew a guy.</span> <span id="s201">Polish officer, and he agreed to take me to Goda (ph).</span> <span id="s202">That was around October.</span> <span id="s203">They came for me.</span> <span id="s204">I could see life was terrible.</span> <span id="s205">We didn't have what to eat one day, one day we had what to eat.</span> <span id="s206">The kids were crying.</span> <span id="s207">The ghetto was being emptied out.</span> <span id="s208">I started to realize, we weren't going to make it there.</span> <span id="s209">It was a holding tank.</span> <span id="s210">Bring in the people from other towns, and then take them out.</span> <span id="s211">There was the Jewish police.</span> <span id="s212">Some of my friends from the high school were going to escape; and some were going to stay.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">13:19:40 Andrei came for me.</span> <span id="s214">I was smuggled...I looked pretty much like a Gentile.</span> <span id="s215">I was blond, blue eyes.</span> <span id="s216">I put on this long coat.</span> <span id="s217">At night I was taken to the farm, where I stayed for three months.</span> <span id="s218">And I went back now to see that place.</span> <span id="s219">It was alright for me to be there.</span> <span id="s220">And I had contact...</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Did you have any Aryan papers?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">No.</span> <span id="s223">They were in the process of making a birth certificate for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">We were going to the church.</span> <span id="s225">They had started to talk to me about conversion.</span> <span id="s226">There was a birth certificate they had for me.</span> <span id="s227">I didn't see it; I didn't know... Most of my time I spent on the second floor.</span> <span id="s228">It was like a little estate.</span> <span id="s229">But people, the neighbors, were far away, and they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">13:20:37 I used to have contact with the family from time to time.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">I used to get, through peasants, a little note.</span> <span id="s232">O.k. after a while, the peasants would come there and say the most terrible things were happening to the Jews.</span> <span id="s233">"They're taking them out and killing them.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">It's just a bloodbath."</span> <span id="s235">And I stopped getting letters.</span> <span id="s236">I wrote one letter and the other, and I didn't get anymore letters.</span> <span id="s237">I decided, that it makes no sense for me to be there.</span> <span id="s238">I don't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s239">And I told them, "I want to go back to the ghetto."</span> <span id="s240">I can't say, if they were heartbroken.</span> <span id="s241">They tried to dissuade me.</span> <span id="s242">But I was taken back to the ghetto, brought in a special working place, put on a yellow star, and marched back.</span> <span id="s243">When I went to the ghetto, I didn't find any of my family.</span> <span id="s244">But there was also a smaller ghetto.</span> <span id="s245">People told me it was a holding place for people who would be sent out to other places on work.</span> <span id="s246">My family was taken there in December.</span> <span id="s247">I wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s248">People said if you go there, you can't come back.</span> <span id="s249">I was young and inexperienced.</span> <span id="s250">I found an uncle, and he said, "you can't do anything."</span> <span id="s251">So I went to a policeman and said, "maybe you can go and find out if my family is there?"</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What policeman?</span> <span id="s253">German, Polish, Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Jewish.</span> <span id="s255">They can go from one ghetto to another.</span> <span id="s256">It wasn't that far, a quarter of a mile.</span> <span id="s257">But it was all locked in.</span> <span id="s258">He said, he thought they were there.</span> <span id="s259">Anyway, I couldn't do anything.</span> <span id="s260">I don't know if they were there, or weren't there.</span> <span id="s261">I never saw them again.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">13:22:38 Then I lived with an aunt of mine.</span> <span id="s263">Her husband was also taken away.</span> <span id="s264">Two children and the brother of her husband.</span> <span id="s265">I had to work.</span> <span id="s266">So I went to the Judenrat, where my father had a lot of friends.</span> <span id="s267">I needed a job, because if you didn't have a job, you'd be deported.</span> <span id="s268">They gave me a job working with ration cards.</span> <span id="s269">It had something to do with pasting coupons.</span> <span id="s270">I worked there during the cold months, like January, February, March.</span> <span id="s271">I don't know how long.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">There were some older people and some girls who worked there.</span> <span id="s273">I knew this wasn't the place, because most of the people that you could get something to eat or anything worked outside the ghetto,</span></p> <p><span id="s274">in the columns...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Columns?</span> <span id="s276">What do you mean by "columns?"</span> <span id="s277">Every morning the work force used to go out to work outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s278">They used to line up with their leaders.</span> <span id="s279">So I was thinking about that.</span> <span id="s280">I tried to make contact with our old maid.</span> <span id="s281">She had some of our things.</span> <span id="s282">And then at night once, I went out with the policeman to a neighbor.</span> <span id="s283">I could recover some things, but the reception wasn't very good.</span> <span id="s284">And she says, "Don't come here.</span> <span id="s285">It's very dangerous."</span> <span id="s286">But she gave me some things I could sell.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">13:24:25 After the three months had passed, I went to my cousin.</span> <span id="s288">He lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s289">He was an engineer, a grandhomme, in charge of the many gardens they took away from the religious orders.</span> <span id="s290">I said, I needed a job.</span> <span id="s291">He said, "o.k., I have a lot of parties that go out to work in the gardens in the Rossa (ph)"which was very close to where I lived.</span> <span id="s292">So I used to go in the morning to work in the gardens, which was very good.</span> <span id="s293">Fresh air, and there weren't many Germans.</span> <span id="s294">And I worked with lettuce, and tomatoes, and beehives, and incubator chickens.</span> <span id="s295">And on the way going, sometimes the maid would come and bring me some things.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">13:25:17 That was for a couple of months.</span> <span id="s297">And in the ghetto, it was relatively quiet.</span> <span id="s298">But in winter the gardens were shut down.</span> <span id="s299">So then, "What am I going to do now?"</span> <span id="s300">And he said, "Well, the work force will revert to the headquarters of the Gestapo, because they gardens belong to the Gestapo."</span> <span id="s301">So I went to work in the headquarters of the Gestapo, which was different scenario.</span> <span id="s302">I worked in the buildings that used to be the Polish Circuit Court.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">It's very interesting.</span> <span id="s304">It's always the same.</span> <span id="s305">It was the now Russia, so it's...that was the Gestapo...Polish, it was the same police</span></p> <p><span id="s306">things.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">13:26:00 Since I didn't have any training.</span> <span id="s308">The Gestapo was set up with a lot of Jewish workshops.</span> <span id="s309">People that were tailors, metalworkers that did the locksmith and bullet thing with rifles, there were cooks, painters.</span> <span id="s310">Since I didn't have any particular skill, I was put with a group of girls who were chambermaids.</span> <span id="s311">We used to clean the empty rooms.</span> <span id="s312">Then we used to make them dirty again, 'cause we were afraid then we wouldn't have any work.</span> <span id="s313">If we didn't have any work, then they'd send us home.</span> <span id="s314">After a while, our work actually changed.</span> <span id="s315">I was sent in the afternoon to the officers' private quarters to clean, which were the nicest Jewish apts., not far from that particular complex.</span> <span id="s316">I wound up quite often in the house of our doctor.</span> <span id="s317">I used to look at the textbooks that were there.</span> <span id="s318">They were friends of mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">13:27:20 We then worked out a little system.</span> <span id="s320">Since in the ghetto we weren't allowed to have radios under threat of death.</span> <span id="s321">And the people from the Underground already knew where we were working.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">They had asked us to listen to some news.</span> <span id="s323">So the way we worked that was, we would come into the courtyard where there were many apts., and we knew that we had to go to 5, 17, 19, etc..</span> <span id="s324">.</span> <span id="s325">A group of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">And in every apt.</span> <span id="s327">there were radios.</span> <span id="s328">So the first thing, in the courtyard were the guys who used to prepare wood for the fireplaces.</span> <span id="s329">They had saws and would make a lot of noise.</span> <span id="s330">So we'd go out there and start listening to the radio.</span> <span id="s331">We'd listen to whatever we could.</span> <span id="s332">And we'd always get somebody with us who understands German better.</span> <span id="s333">We'd listen to what's on the Front.</span> <span id="s334">After a while, we'd break one radio.</span> <span id="s335">We didn't break it; we'd have a guy remove some tubes and put it back together.</span> <span id="s336">The German, sure enough, would come and say he couldn't listen and take it to the radio shop.</span> <span id="s337">We'd always have one radio in the shop that was working.</span> <span id="s338">This one we'd fix, put the tubes back, and bring in another one.</span> <span id="s339">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s340">But it was necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">13:28:43 I worked there for quite a while.</span> <span id="s342">It was terrible in other respects.</span> <span id="s343">After a while, it was shifted to the Lithuanian unit.</span> <span id="s344">The Lithuanian unit was the execution unit, the Einsatzkommando.</span> <span id="s345">I was assigned to them.</span> <span id="s346">This was a group of 20 to 30 barbarians that the Gestapo commanded and kept drunk all the time.</span> <span id="s347">At the dormitory all you could see was vodka, guns, and bullets.</span> <span id="s348">Their faces were always flushed.</span> <span id="s349">Morning they were always drunk; at night, they worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Killed Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: What did you do for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">I cleaned, the rooms of the German officers.</span> <span id="s353">And I was assigned sixteen rooms.</span> <span id="s354">I had to dust them.</span> <span id="s355">They'd tell me to look at their papers and ask me if I knew German.</span> <span id="s356">I used to have to fire the furnaces with wood.</span> <span id="s357">It was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">13:30:09 The most terrible thing was when they would go on this killing of Jews and bring back the clothing.</span> <span id="s359">And people had to sort it.</span> <span id="s360">I didn't have to sort it; but some of the people would recognize the clothes of the people.</span> <span id="s361">I worked on the third floor.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">On the second floor were the rooms for interrogation.</span> <span id="s363">Half the windows were painted, so I wouldn't see in the courtyard.</span> <span id="s364">I recognized some of my friends were brought there.</span> <span id="s365">Never got out</span></p> <p><span id="s366">alive there.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">13:30:48 Then I had a job also in the basement of the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s368">It was a prison.</span> <span id="s369">People who were brought in there, never saw the light of day again.</span> <span id="s370">I had to go in there.</span> <span id="s371">They had little cuts that would come out of wall (wool?)</span> <span id="s372">made of canvas.</span> <span id="s373">Sometimes we'd have to sew it back to the metal frame.</span> <span id="s374">Sometimes, we'd meet prisoners, read things on the walls, people wrote before they were taken.</span> <span id="s375">Terrible things.</span> <span id="s376">I met a few of my friends there, in those rooms.</span> <span id="s377">They would ask me, "what's gonna happen?"</span> <span id="s378">I said, "nothing.</span> <span id="s379">In a few days, you'll be out."</span> <span id="s380">Some people also knew where I was working and would ask me to bring in bread.</span> <span id="s381">Which was another thing threat of death to do it.</span> <span id="s382">There was a group of girls accused of Rassenschande, of sleeping with Germans, which wasn't true.</span> <span id="s383">But they were good looking girls.</span> <span id="s384">And they brought them in.</span> <span id="s385">And Germans maybe spilled...I knew two of them.</span> <span id="s386">That was part of the job.</span> <span id="s387">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s388">But I didn't have anything else to do.</span> <span id="s389">I was there already.</span> <span id="s390">Some of the guys that worked in the Gestapo were in the Partisan, in the Underground.</span> <span id="s391">~nd they stole some ammunition.</span> <span id="s392">They were good with the chauffeurs.</span> <span id="s393">I don't know how they ended up with two revolvers.</span> <span id="s394">I don't know how the Germans found out.</span> <span id="s395">Maybe the chauffeurs said something.</span> <span id="s396">At one time, there was an appel.</span> <span id="s397">We had to come down.</span> <span id="s398">They called out the two guys.</span> <span id="s399">They shot them in front of our eyes.</span> <span id="s400">That's all.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">13:33:06 That much for the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s402">I started to hang out with some of my friends in the Underground, but I wasn't quite that active.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">I was aware that, towards the very end, some groups were departing the ghetto for the forest.</span> <span id="s404">Some were caught in the cross fire, and some were shot, but some managed to get to the forest.</span> <span id="s405">I thought of doing that, too.</span> <span id="s406">However I didn't do it.</span> <span id="s407">The ghetto was getting closed, and we no longer worked in the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s408">We were told, we were going to be evacuated.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">13:33:50 Between the 23rd and the 24th of September the ghetto was</span></p> <p><span id="s410">emptied out.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">1943.</span> <span id="s413">I did not really say anything about the ghetto, which I should.</span> <span id="s414">Because it was a very terrible place to live, but also a very interesting, in as much as we had our hospitals, high school, literary evenings, theater.</span> <span id="s415">Most of the songs that are survived came from the stage of the Vilna ghetto.</span> <span id="s416">There was a small newspaper.</span> <span id="s417">The library was the only place really to escape.</span> <span id="s418">We used to try to cheer each other up.</span> <span id="s419">Teachers would teach in the schools not knowing, if next day they would come, or the children be there, because there were actions.</span> <span id="s420">One day they'd take the sick from the hospital, one day the children from the schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">13:34:45 Parties were also formed.</span> <span id="s422">The Underground, it was a coalition FPO, Forenic Partizanisha Organizatia (ph).</span> <span id="s423">It was a coalition of all the parties which functioned in Vilna.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: What were some of the parties?</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Labor Zionists, Revisionists, the Bund, the Communist...some other splinter groups.</span> <span id="s426">The general staff consisted of, I believe, 7 people.</span> <span id="s427">The Bund had two people on the General Staff.</span> <span id="s428">The General Chairman was Mr. Aberkorbner (ph), who is now in Israel.</span> <span id="s429">Then there was Mr. Wittenburg, who was killed.</span> <span id="s430">It is very interesting how he was killed.</span> <span id="s431">But I can't go into that.</span> <span id="s432">He was more or less let go by the staff.</span> <span id="s433">The Gestapo put a price on his head.</span> <span id="s434">They would bomb the ghetto, if the staff doesn't hand him over to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s435">There were negotiations, and he tried to escape.</span> <span id="s436">But he said if the ghetto has to go, if it was his head or all our heads.</span> <span id="s437">Course some of the people in the ghetto started to scream, that he must go to the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s438">So he took some cyanide with himwound up in that</span></p> <p><span id="s439">same basement.</span></p> <p><span id="s440">13:36:21 I don't really know how to tell you.</span> <span id="s441">The ghetto was in the very beginning 80,000 people.</span> <span id="s442">It was being brought in from all kinds of places, from all surrounding little towns, from the Pelif settlements, and it was being emptied out.</span> <span id="s443">At the very end, I would say that there were about 20,000 people in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s444">And nobody could go anymore and work outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s445">In all the places, where the Germans werein the Schneiderstube, where they were sewing uniforms, or in the Verpflegensamt, where they used to have their food delivered, or in the Panzerkommandoall kinds of places where the Jews used to be the laborers.They said, the Front was coming close; the ghetto was going to be liquidated.</span> <span id="s446">The Underground, the FPO, at that time knew that this was a sign that we are going to be killed off.</span> <span id="s447">They decided to take a stand.</span> <span id="s448">The ones that were in the forest, were in the forest.</span> <span id="s449">But those that remained would take a stand.</span> <span id="s450">And there was a shootout with the Germans.</span> <span id="s451">I saw it through my window.</span> <span id="s452">After that, they lined up some people, some were executed.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">13:37:46 And then, on the 23rd of September, in the morning...</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">1943, I'm sorry (microphone fiddling).</span> <span id="s456">We again had to line up with our packages, whatever they were, and march to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s457">It was a terrible thing.</span> <span id="s458">It was raining.</span> <span id="s459">We were walking in the middle of the street with our bundles, like you see in all the movies.</span> <span id="s460">It wasn't very different.</span> <span id="s461">Most Poles, really, were too ashamed to look; but some of them were standing and cheering on the Germans: "Good for you, Jews."</span> <span id="s462">"Wind up on the bottom."</span> <span id="s463">"Got what you deserved."</span> <span id="s464">...Some maybe weren't like that.</span> <span id="s465">We thought we were going to the trains.</span> <span id="s466">We were going on that road, but we weren't.</span> <span id="s467">We were going to a place near the trains, about a mile away, which was</span></p> <p><span id="s468">a convent.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">They herded us all in through a gate.</span> <span id="s470">What we saw was a big church, but we didn't go into the church.</span> <span id="s471">We went into a side yard.</span> <span id="s472">It was an enormous mountain.</span> <span id="s473">And we were all herded in there.</span> <span id="s474">And we were lying in the rain for two days.</span> <span id="s475">With lights ablaze and machine guns all around.</span> <span id="s476">And we thought, "they will finish us off over there."</span> <span id="s477">Two days it rained.</span> <span id="s478">Lots of people died over there.</span> <span id="s479">On the 24th or 25th in the morning, we all had to pass through a very narrow door, like this, the way we came in.</span> <span id="s480">And one of my immediate men from the Gestapo, Weiss, he was there.</span> <span id="s481">Martin Weiss.</span> <span id="s482">He knew me.</span> <span id="s483">And that was the selection.</span> <span id="s484">To the right.</span> <span id="s485">My aunt was there with her children, some other people.</span> <span id="s486">To the right, it was one way; and to the left was the other way.</span> <span id="s487">I was to the right.</span> <span id="s488">In the beginning, I didn't know.</span> <span id="s489">I thought, "well, who knows what they're doing."</span> <span id="s490">They always intimidated people.</span> <span id="s491">But then I could see quite a difference, that the little children and the older people were over to the left.</span> <span id="s492">I tried to do something for my aunt, and I didn't see her.</span> <span id="s493">Everybody said, "when you go there, you go there.</span> <span id="s494">You want to stay here, don't..." In a little while, we were all in a kettle</span></p> <p><span id="s495">wagon.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">(microphone fiddling) We got in the kettle wagon and they locked us up.</span> <span id="s497">It was with people I knew, young people.</span> <span id="s498">It was like standing room only.</span> <span id="s499">We went and went for a long time, two days.</span> <span id="s500">People were dying; people didn't have anything to eat.</span> <span id="s501">The Germans would make a panic and start slowing down.</span> <span id="s502">We thought, they would chase us out, maybe shoot people.</span> <span id="s503">They would intimidate us.</span> <span id="s504">Terrible.</span> <span id="s505">One of my friends jumped out the train.</span> <span id="s506">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s507">Sister of a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s508">She's in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">13:41:15 Came to Kaiserwald, which is in the outskirts of Riga, Latvia.</span> <span id="s510">In the middle of the night to the usual, what I found out later, "Welcoming Party."</span> <span id="s511">You come in with the searchlights and a big gate which says, "Arbeit macht frei," which was the Meisterplan for all the camps.</span> <span id="s512">The dogs were jumping at us.</span> <span id="s513">"Raus, raus, raus!</span></p> <p><span id="s514">And leave all the packages behind and jump from the train!"</span> <span id="s515">And if not, you got it over the head.</span> <span id="s516">Right away, the group to the right, to the left.</span> <span id="s517">Who knew what it was.</span> <span id="s518">It was the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">And then they said, we're gonna take showers.</span> <span id="s520">"Showers!"</span> <span id="s521">Everybody started to holler and to cry, because that's for sure death.</span> <span id="s522">But the Poles, there were Polish people in the uniforms.</span> <span id="s523">So we'd start to say, "what about the showers?"</span> <span id="s524">"Well, you take a shower.</span> <span id="s525">They take away all your clothes.</span> <span id="s526">And you'll put on this Pasacki (ph)."</span> <span id="s527">It means the striped uniform.</span> <span id="s528">Gotta trust somebody... So they herded us into the showers, and the Germans were standing all around, looking.</span> <span id="s529">I had no more clothes.</span> <span id="s530">But I did manage to leave a briefcase someplace.</span> <span id="s531">And I had some clothes there and some photographs.</span> <span id="s532">I went in the barracks.</span> <span id="s533">In the morning I could see a lot of people walking around with these little hats, men.</span> <span id="s534">They were all wearing this uniform, the stripes, and a white towel or some rag around their neck.</span> <span id="s535">I would ask them, "why you wear this white rag?"</span> <span id="s536">They said, "it's not a rag, it's a towel."</span> <span id="s537">"So why do you have to wear a towel?"</span> <span id="s538">"Because there's no place to leave it.</span> <span id="s539">If you leave it, it gets stolen."</span> <span id="s540">It was kind a crazy.</span> <span id="s541">You land like on the moon.</span> <span id="s542">You don't know what's happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">13:43:13 Finally they gave us a barrack.</span> <span id="s544">I wound up with a lady from our courtyard, from Vilna.</span> <span id="s545">Very beautiful looking girl.</span> <span id="s546">And she was kind a like older sister, took care of me.</span> <span id="s547">She lost her whole family and wanted to be close to somebody.</span> <span id="s548">She had this thing.</span> <span id="s549">I always used to be envious of her.</span> <span id="s550">When she walked home, the Polish guys would always carry her books, and she used lipsticks.</span> <span id="s551">She was 34 years older.</span> <span id="s552">She managed to have her clothes.</span> <span id="s553">The German prisoners and the Polish prisoners spotted her right away.</span> <span id="s554">At night, through the barbed wire, they would talk to her.</span> <span id="s555">All of a sudden, she got a job in Kleiderkammer, which means where you take away all the clothes, in the clothing department.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">All the best clothes.</span> <span id="s557">Every night she'd bring me panties, a blouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">And I'd wear everything, she'd bring me, everything, 'cause there was no place to leave it.</span> <span id="s559">She would go out there at night, the guys would talk to her.</span> <span id="s560">And I'd go work in the Kleiderk.uer.</span> <span id="s561">I didn't know from nothing.</span> <span id="s562">Come home to the straw sack, lie down, eat the soup.</span> <span id="s563">And she would do the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">13:44:43 After a couple of weeks, I come home and she wasn't there.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Her name was Basha.</span> <span id="s566">I asked about her.</span> <span id="s567">And they said, she wasn't here any longer.</span> <span id="s568">They took her to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s569">Riga still had a Ghetto.</span> <span id="s570">They accused her of flirting with the Germans and Poles.</span> <span id="s571">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s572">So I knew, they took her there to shoot, because Kaiserwald didn't have the place for, I don't know.</span> <span id="s573">They said, they took her to the Ghetto.</span> <span id="s574">I was very upset, because she was such a nice person.</span> <span id="s575">I really liked her.</span> <span id="s576">And then I started to think, "They knew that she was with me, and they usually work by association."</span> <span id="s577">So I gotta get out of this place.</span> <span id="s578">So I said, even though I have this little good job, but what am I going to be in the camp?</span> <span id="s579">And every time, here today or tomorrow?</span> <span id="s580">People started saying the Germans come in and they need workers for farms or factories.</span> <span id="s581">I said to myself, what am I going to be choosey?</span> <span id="s582">I don't know farms from factories.</span> <span id="s583">Tomorrow morning I'm going to go and see who's come.</span> <span id="s584">And I talked to some girls and they said, "yea, it's time to get out of this camp."</span> <span id="s585">Because we are just sitting here in the S.S., in the lion's den, you know.</span> <span id="s586">I also worked a little bit in the hospital.</span> <span id="s587">I saw what happened in the hospital.</span> <span id="s588">It was terrible.</span> <span id="s589">The abortions.</span> <span id="s590">Polish doctors, Jewish doctors, no supplies, nothing.</span> <span id="s591">People came to the camps pregnant.</span> <span id="s592">They wanted to get rid of the babies.</span> <span id="s593">Screaming, no anesthetics, dirt.</span> <span id="s594">And I didn't understand all those things.</span> <span id="s595">But I said, get out to a steady</span></p> <p><span id="s596">place.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">13:46:25 So in the morning, I see a lot of people, after the appel, we were all forming a company, and I am standing there with a lot of other.</span> <span id="s598">And an assessment with some workers come, and they started counting, counting, and they took me on a truck.</span> <span id="s599">I didn't know where we were going.</span> <span id="s600">We went to Riga.</span> <span id="s601">We wound up in a factory that's called Vef (ph) by the Latvians.</span> <span id="s602">And Aiga, algemeine electrotechniches Gesellschaft, which is a very big factory now in Germany.</span> <span id="s603">That's where I wound up.</span> <span id="s604">It was a big factory, for not electronics, used to be for radios and telephones.</span> <span id="s605">But this time, equipment for submarines, for airplanes, all kinds of things,</span></p> <p><span id="s606">cables.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">In the mornings, after we'd stand for four hours maybe in the rain, to count us back and forth, we'd go there.</span> <span id="s608">And the whole day we'd work on the machines.</span> <span id="s609">I worked on electric bore machines.</span> <span id="s610">And, I forgot what it's called in English...I worked there for a long</span></p> <p><span id="s611">time...</span></p> <p><span id="s612">13:47:37 Q: Was this where you were able to do some sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Yea, a little bit.</span> <span id="s614">O.k.</span> <span id="s615">We worked there for a while.</span> <span id="s616">The food was very meager.</span> <span id="s617">We were getting skinnier, and work a whole day.</span> <span id="s618">And then I had an accident.</span> <span id="s619">A bore machine went through my hand, in here.</span> <span id="s620">And since we couldn't get into that little hospital, I thought I was going to get poisoning.</span> <span id="s621">They took me to the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">There was a doctor.</span> <span id="s623">And all we had was water and paper bandages.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">And I was afraid.</span> <span id="s625">They wanted to send me to Kaiserwald, but I was afraid to go to.</span> <span id="s626">Because I go to Kaiserwald, I never come back to work, you see, or be sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">13:48:20 Anyhow, after a while, I came back to work.</span> <span id="s628">I managed to get on the swing shift.</span> <span id="s629">The swing shift used to be like from five o'clock 'till two a.m., which was better.</span> <span id="s630">There were fewer people and the pace wasn't so terrible, and there weren't the hoards of people.</span> <span id="s631">But we had a problem.</span> <span id="s632">When we came there, we had this problem with the German Jewish girls.</span> <span id="s633">They were also prisoners like we, but they had a better understanding with the Germans.</span> <span id="s634">They thought, that they had to put in their maximum effort.</span> <span id="s635">Which we, of course, didn't think.</span> <span id="s636">We were not interested in helping the Germans win the war.</span> <span id="s637">And besides, some of the girls had mothers and they couldn't work that fast.</span> <span id="s638">So a Meister, or a foreman, would take a girl, a German Jewish girl and tell her, "this is what has to be done.</span> <span id="s639">And I am going to stand and time you with a stopwatch.</span> <span id="s640">And we'll see how fast you can," and she would work like a bat out of Hell and make sixty parts.</span> <span id="s641">Then he would come to us and say, "you all have to do that, sixty or..." Although we couldn't do it, break the needles, and get the needles through the hands.</span> <span id="s642">So we thought at night, we'll have a friendly talk with the girls.</span> <span id="s643">And we told them, "next time the new parts come in, you don't have to work that hard."</span> <span id="s644">"No," they were afraid, this and that.</span> <span id="s645">Anyhow, it didn't help.</span> <span id="s646">We talked to them several times, and they didn't do it.</span> <span id="s647">So we decided that we have to do something.</span> <span id="s648">To just show them how it is worked where we come from.</span> <span id="s649">Since we were all covered with a lot of metal shavings, because we worked with it.</span> <span id="s650">We only had a air hose to clean ourselves.</span> <span id="s651">So when we come to the barracks, we would have to take a shower.</span> <span id="s652">Because, really, we were aluminum shavings.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">Before we got into the showers, there was a little passageway, a little dark one.</span> <span id="s654">And we thought, we'd just beat them up over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">To teach them a lesson.</span> <span id="s656">So when they came in, we were prepared.</span> <span id="s657">And we threw blankets on them.</span> <span id="s658">We sat them down; we let them have it, three or four of them.</span> <span id="s659">We told them not to cry, and not to yell, and that's for not listening.</span> <span id="s660">And we also told them, that if they're going to say one word to the German authorities or to anybody else, so that means that they won't take us, because they didn't know who exactly it was, but they had an idea.</span> <span id="s661">They kill us.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">But I said the moment they kill us, your people will be killed, too.</span> <span id="s663">Our friends kill.</span> <span id="s664">That helped.</span> <span id="s665">From that time, they started to slow down a bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">13:51:04 We worked there, in that factory, for quite a while, until the Front came closer.</span> <span id="s667">And when the Front came closer, the Germans said they need all this machinery.</span> <span id="s668">The Russians were advancing, going West.</span> <span id="s669">So they said we will evacuate the factory to Torin, which was a Polish fort in the northern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s670">We again went on those trains, I don't know, forever.</span> <span id="s671">And we came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">There was pretty good.</span> <span id="s673">We lived underground in some fort with a moat.</span> <span id="s674">And there were actually prisoners, English prisoners, with their quarters, and they had maids.</span> <span id="s675">They felt sorry for us and would throw us parcels with food.</span> <span id="s676">Meanwhile, the machinery didn't come.</span> <span id="s677">It was the end of the war.</span> <span id="s678">They didn't have good connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">13:51:52 After being there two months, we were shipped to Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Stutthof was the worst of the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: So when, approximately, did you get to Stutthof?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">That was in October of 1944.</span> <span id="s683">I was in stutthof from October '44 until April of 1945.</span> <span id="s684">Stutthof to me is Auschwitz, because it had a crematorium burning.</span> <span id="s685">It had thousands of prisoners.</span> <span id="s686">People were dying of Typhus.</span> <span id="s687">There were no bathrooms.</span> <span id="s688">I was continually hit there.</span> <span id="s689">I was hit by the German Blitzes.</span> <span id="s690">That means the German S.S.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Fraus.</span> <span id="s692">Like once, I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s693">I always was on the third bunk.</span> <span id="s694">So that the people, if I had been on the first step(?)</span> <span id="s695">, they'd throw their lice on me.</span> <span id="s696">So I was on the top, could throw my lice on them.</span> <span id="s697">I was there with some friends.</span> <span id="s698">People were dirty, starving.</span> <span id="s699">Everyday we'd get up, there were more people dead than alive.</span> <span id="s700">But the floor always had to be washed.</span> <span id="s701">When the floors were always wet, and I had to go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s702">They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s703">So I decided, I have to go...</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Who wouldn't let you?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">The doors were closed.</span> <span id="s706">And there were the guards.</span> <span id="s707">The German guards were standing, because they washed the floors.</span> <span id="s708">So you couldn't get through.</span> <span id="s709">So I decided, I went through the window.</span> <span id="s710">I went to the bathroom.</span> <span id="s711">I had, by that time, bloody diarrhea.</span> <span id="s712">It was terrible...</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: That was the Typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">That was Typhus, yea.</span> <span id="s715">I think by that time, I had it already.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">Coming back was another matter.</span> <span id="s717">I had to come through the door.</span> <span id="s718">I couldn't climb back through the window.</span> <span id="s719">They were waiting for me with the Welcoming Committee.</span> <span id="s720">The Blitze knocked out a few of my teeth and kicked me good.</span> <span id="s721">And my friends came down and scooped up some snow.</span> <span id="s722">I thought that was the end at that time, but it wasn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">More and more people were dying.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">13:54:15 And then all of a sudden, towards the very end, they told us we are evacuating the camp.</span> <span id="s725">And they put us on barges, boats and barges, and put us on the sea.</span> <span id="s726">I was on a cement barge.</span> <span id="s727">And we were going on that sea for ten days.</span> <span id="s728">We had nothing to eat, like sea water.</span> <span id="s729">I already knew, that I wasn't going to make it.</span> <span id="s730">I really didn't...It was interesting that there was the battle for the German sea.</span> <span id="s731">We would go and look out.</span> <span id="s732">Planes used to fall in the sea, shooting bombardments.</span> <span id="s733">There were a lot of boats.</span> <span id="s734">I remember a beautiful boat the Capicorna (?)</span> <span id="s735">with a lot of prisoners of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Polish.</span> <span id="s737">They were dressed in their uniforms, the stripes, but very clean.</span> <span id="s738">The weren't emaciated like us.</span> <span id="s739">And they were just waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">It was going to be Liberation.</span> <span id="s741">A day later, we came back and that boat was standing with the bow up here.</span> <span id="s742">And the whole thing was a living grave for them, you know.</span> <span id="s743">They were bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">13:55:25 We were with the S.S. And there were also Norwegian prisoners with us.</span> <span id="s745">All of a sudden, the boat came to the middle, to a halt, and the S.S. put in to a small launch; and they went away.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">We were just left there on that boat.</span> <span id="s747">I didn't understand anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">But the Norwegians, they understood it.</span> <span id="s749">They said, we had an explosive charge tied to that boat.</span> <span id="s750">And they tried to dismantle it and somehow, this was on the third of May, and the boat made for shore.</span> <span id="s751">But it wasn't a port, someplace.</span> <span id="s752">I remember we came into the water.</span> <span id="s753">And we were quite far.</span> <span id="s754">And there was one German.</span> <span id="s755">The Germans saw that we, on the launch, that we stopped and were getting out.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">And they started to shoot at us.</span> <span id="s757">And we started to run.</span> <span id="s758">And they said, "run as fast as you can!"</span> <span id="s759">Our prisoners said, "don't turn around!"</span> <span id="s760">And we were all shot at, and some were falling.</span> <span id="s761">I wound up in a forest.</span> <span id="s762">And the British were there, and I saw Russian prisoners.</span> <span id="s763">It wasn't quite like I tell you, but I realize our time is getting short.</span> <span id="s764">I don't know how I ran, I can tell you that.</span> <span id="s765">I don't know how long I ran, but the shots were all around, and people were screaming and falling.</span> <span id="s766">I wound up in some dense forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">And there were prisoners, and some of my friends were there.</span> <span id="s768">And I was actually delirious by that time.</span> <span id="s769">Now I remember that they said, "you have to go to a hospital."</span> <span id="s770">And I didn't want to go to a hospital, because I was afraid the Germans were going to kill me there.</span> <span id="s771">If they didn't kill me in the camps, they'll do it in the hospital.</span> <span id="s772">So for three days I was in some kind of forest.</span> <span id="s773">And then I had to wind up in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">13:57:26 End of interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">.</span> <span id="s776">END.</span></p></body></html>
