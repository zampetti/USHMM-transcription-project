id="s302">A: And so we – we – we called the base, and so they went out and got the man, and the only way I recognized my buddy was his class ring.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Ohhh.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: He had burned that bad.</span> <span id="s305">And so they were gonna bury him in – bur – in – in a [indecipherable] bag.</span> <span id="s306">And I said no, we all fought, we – we went out, we chipped money in, we had Arabs make caskets for them.</span> <span id="s307">So that was my first experience with death, with my buddy.</span> <span id="s308">A real good buddy at that.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Yeah, had he been shot down?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s311">No, no, they had problems training.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s313">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">A: Plane crashed.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So you were in one plane –</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: – and he was in another.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: In another.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s320">And your job in the plane was to have radio communications with the ground?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">A: So we – after that, we went – we went – we were supposed to go to Naples.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">Q: I’m sorry, I’m going to ask one more thing.</span> <span id="s325">What was the name of your buddy who died?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Phil.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: Phil.</span> <span id="s328">And do you remember his last name?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s331">All right.</span> <span id="s332">So, you went to Naples.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: I can – I can – I’ve got it recorded, but I’ve forgotten it.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: That’s okay.</span> <span id="s335">That’s okay.</span> <span id="s336">So after – after this, you’re sent to Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s339">And tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: We were sent to Italy.</span> <span id="s341">We were supposed to land at – at – at Naples, and Vesuvius erupted.</span> <span id="s342">So we settled to the south, and we settled i-in – they – they had taken a – a – a tomato patch and cleared it and made it a runway.</span> <span id="s343">And right near us was a – was a – was a Roman town called Paestum, with beautiful – prettier than the Parthenon.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Oh really, with an old temple?</span></p> <p><span id="s345">A: Oh yeah, went clear back.</span> <span id="s346">And so my mother used to send me books, she was a book of the month club.</span> <span id="s347">And I would go into this temple at ni – during the daytime, and I would read on the altar.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">A: And there’s little tiny roses – blooms in – through the – through the stone in the temple.</span> <span id="s352">But it’s p-a-e-s-t-u-m, Paestum.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Paestum.</span> <span id="s354">And was this, I take it then was near Naples, down in the south of Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: Was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s356">Q: It was near – it – this Paestum –</span></p> <p><span id="s357">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s359">So, how far down had the Germans been, and yeah, how far –</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Well, that battle – well, the battle was fought nearby.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: At Sa-Salerno.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s364">So when you – when you were transferred there, had already wa – that territory was under allied control, under American contro –</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Yes, but barely.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: But barely.</span> <span id="s367">Okay.</span> <span id="s368">And this was what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: This would be 1940 – ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: ’43, okay.</span> <span id="s371">And what was your job again in – in –</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: I was still the – still the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Radio operator.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Well, radio operator and then now I – I’m giving it – I told you about that –</span></p> <p><span id="s375">Q: Tell me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Well, my – the colonel was a West Pointer, and he – he was all ticked off that we had gotten some new cameras and they were – the results were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: And he said, does anybody know about – anything about photography, and then I said, well, I know a little bit.</span> <span id="s379">Well, they hadn't set the stops on the – on the cameras properly.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You mean the photographers that were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: So, with my two dollar ata – light meter, I was setting the – the – the – the – the cameras, and we were getting beautiful results.</span> <span id="s382">And so he’d call Brugi(ph) – he called me Brugi(ph), and he said Brugi(ph), we’ve gotta fly.</span> <span id="s383">He was always – he was – always wanted to make sure that we wouldn’t bomb our own troops.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: So – but I wasn’t getting cr-credit for our – for our missions, for our reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s386">I had yet to drop a bomb to get credit for – for to go home.</span> <span id="s387">So, first, it was only 25 bombs – runs and you could go home.</span> <span id="s388">And then during the invasion they raised it to 50, and then they asked – asked for volunteers to fly more.</span> <span id="s389">And like a damn fool I volunteered for more, and I – 65th mission we got shot up real bad.</span> <span id="s390">Really bad.</span> <span id="s391">And so I went to see the colonel and he said, what’s the matter?</span> <span id="s392">And I said, well, I – I was a poor crewman.</span> <span id="s393">He said, what’s the matter, and I said, well, I didn’t give a damn whether I lived or died today.</span> <span id="s394">I thought I was gonna get killed.</span> <span id="s395">He said, how would you like to go to Rome?</span> <span id="s396">I said, I been there.</span> <span id="s397">He said, how would you like to go to Cairo?</span> <span id="s398">I said, I don’t care for that.</span> <span id="s399">He says, suppose I give you a Jeep, and for two weeks, just do what the hell you want to.</span> <span id="s400">Just travel – travel Corsica.</span> <span id="s401">And I said no.</span> <span id="s402">And then he said, how would you like to go home?</span> <span id="s403">And so I came home.</span> <span id="s404">And then – now they wanted me to go to the Pacific.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: Re – get – we can get on to that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s408">So, while you were in Italy, then were you – you would – you were on – not only – you were not only a radio operator, still continued doing that, but you were also now photographing.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s411">And how was the ba – how was the takeover, the – the battles against the Nazi forces progressing?</span> <span id="s412">Were they being pushed further north?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Oh, my.</span> <span id="s414">Anzio was slaughter.</span> <span id="s415">And they had – they had the Americans pinned down.</span> <span id="s416">And I was on the – one of the – one of the places that was – they were using for cover was Monte Cassino.</span> <span id="s417">And so I was on this – I was on the raids, and we bombed Monte Cassino.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: Now I heard that there were a lot of Polish forces –</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: – that were fighting in Monte Cassino.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Not only Polish, there was – there was Indian, there was Pakistanis, there was blacks from ed – I mean, French troops.</span> <span id="s424">Now, let me mention one thing here.</span> <span id="s425">My best buddy there was a guy named Sargent Cobb.</span> <span id="s426">He would have been another Billy Graham.</span> <span id="s427">He always had a Bible.</span> <span id="s428">He could quote from the Bible, and he was just a wonderful guy.</span> <span id="s429">So, whenever we would go – before the flight would go on, we’d go for walks together, and I’d take my rosary and he would – he would take his prayer book.</span> <span id="s430">And he just could s – he would – he would – he was such a wonderful man, everywhere around, say – name was Sargent Cook.</span> <span id="s431">And – and he was on a mission, and his plane was hit, and he came right under me, and I photographed it.</span> <span id="s432">And all the propellers were stopped.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: And – and he crashed, and was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: And what a – what a loss we – what a – what a man we lost in Sargent Co-Cobb.</span> <span id="s437">Sargent Cobb, I’m sorry, not Cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Sargent Cobb.</span> <span id="s439">What was his first name?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: All I remember was Sargent Cobb.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s444">Well see, these are the things that we don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: He was from Covington, conne – Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Covington, Kentucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you – did you speak Italian?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: So, when you were in Italy, were you able to converse with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s452">I have to tell you something.</span> <span id="s453">We were in Africa and – and a – we had – Italian troops were doing the mess work, cooking for us.</span> <span id="s454">So I told them – I told –</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Were these prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: Were these prisoners, or American Italians?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: No, they were me – they were prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: They were prisoners, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: So I told one of them, Bartholomew, I – I told him, I said, well, I – I’m – I won’t see you again, so I’m saying goodbye.</span> <span id="s461">And he said, oh, if you ever get to – to this town – he gave me a slip of paper – in Italy, he said, tell them I’m alive.</span> <span id="s462">It so happened it was Easter, and we weren’t flying, and I found out the town was about five miles away.</span> <span id="s463">So I started walking, and I hitched a ride, got into the town, and I – so I went to – into the church, and I said, does anybody know this – this person?</span> <span id="s464">They said, oh yes, he’s – his parents.</span> <span id="s465">So they get the parents, and they – there’s a mass said, and he called it a miracle.</span> <span id="s466">So the priest was saying a miracle had occurred today, that I had told them that their son was alive.</span> <span id="s467">Miracoli(ph), miracoli(ph), you know, miracle, miracle.</span> <span id="s468">Meanwhile, it was just a thing that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s470">I want to go back to your – your work a little bit.</span> <span id="s471">You said you flew seven – 65 missions?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Sixty-six.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Sixty-six missions.</span> <span id="s474">And was this all over Italy, or in different places?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Italy, the Brenner Pass, Yugoslavia and France.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: And what were the things that you were photographing mostly?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Well, the one thing that I photographed that our – our unit – well, let me explain.</span> <span id="s478">The French fleet had been taken over by the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: And there was a fear that if we invaded, that they would come out and fight our – our navy.</span> <span id="s481">So for a full week we would go like – and this is [indecipherable] we’d go like we were going to bomb the – there was a battleship and a cruiser there.</span> <span id="s482">But then we’d just veer away.</span> <span id="s483">So we’d tease them.</span> <span id="s484">And then one day – we didn’t know – realize this, but at – every night we would look at what was being trundled to the air force, whether it was – what kind of bombs.</span> <span id="s485">So when we saw these long, slender bombs, we knew that we were going after either a – the battleship, or – or a – a sub [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: So does that mean that you wouldn’t know what your target was until the morning you’re flying a mission?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: The morning when we got briefed.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: So we got briefed and told that our target was the stra – the battleship Strasbourg, and the cruiser La Galissonnière, and – and so we went in – we went in five waves.</span> <span id="s490">And the first and second got in, but the third and fourth really got s-smattered.</span> <span id="s491">In fact, 26 out of the 52 planes had either wounded, or were – had – were – had been – either had wounded aboard, or the planes had been h-hurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: That’s huge.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: So we got it, and we got a presidential unit citation for that, that I’m proud of.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s495">Tell me then about – you mentioned again, off camera, that – that at one point in Italy you entered a cave, and what had happened in this place?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Well, what happened was, the Germans were – Germans still occupied Rome, and they would meet at a certain spot where the troops would gather for transportation back to their base.</span> <span id="s497">And somebody threw a grenade and killed – I don’t know it was, I think 30 or something like that, and they demanded ransom.</span> <span id="s498">They – but I’ve forgotten that number, whether it was 10 to one or something like that, but I remember it was a high number.</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: That means ransom in what?</span> <span id="s500">In money, or in –</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, in people.</span> <span id="s502">Th-They – the Germans wanted so many people to pay for this crime.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: So they took them in the cave, and they – and they – was at random, but they – they machine-gunned them all, and then just closed the cave.</span> <span id="s505">And – and – and when we – when we occupied Rome, it was opened.</span> <span id="s506">And – and I went – I was one that was allowed to see the – but what I remember was a little girl.</span> <span id="s507">She had a white dress on, but she had been hit, and there were spots on her dress of blood, like it was a floral display.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: And they don’t – they were – they were machine-gunned, and they either fell to the right or left, or – or came over, and – and I never forgot the brutality of – of killing that little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: The – there are many – you know, horrific thoughts, you know, or – or scenes that one could imagine.</span> <span id="s511">But one of them is, is weren’t Italians allies of the Germans?</span> <span id="s512">And they would take Italian civilians –</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No, they – they – they – no, they weren’t.</span> <span id="s514">They just – they – they took them as prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: They took these people as prisoners?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: And then I saw another sight that I’ll never forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Before we go there, how soon after this massacre had the Americans arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s521">It was the summer.</span> <span id="s522">I remember it was the summer of ’44 –</span></p> <p><span id="s523">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">A: – when they opened the caves.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s526">Okay, tell me about the other incident.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, the other one was, as the Germans were leaving – were leaving Rome, we went ar – we went after them.</span> <span id="s528">We were bombing their – their – their convoys, we were – we were really hitting them hard.</span> <span id="s529">And so when the – when the – when the war – when the – when the war was still moving up, we went – we drove past these convoys of dead soldiers.</span> <span id="s530">And I’ll never forget the stench of – of burnt flesh.</span> <span id="s531">I can smell it to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Can you?</span> <span id="s533">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s535">And – and there was just one truck, and one vehicle after another with – with soldiers that were – were burned to death, you know, from our bombing, and – and then, one night, while we were bombing, we were bombing an airfield, and we – we came in at low level, and I remember we always had machine guns we were firing.</span> <span id="s536">And there was a man running.</span> <span id="s537">And I remember I grabbed that – the machine gun just as tight as I could, and I was – I was gonna kill the bastard.</span> <span id="s538">And so he was running, and I don’t know if we hit him, or he dove into a ditch.</span> <span id="s539">But when we pulled off, I – I – I clenching – I was still clenching my fists.</span> <span id="s540">And I said, what the hell are you doing?</span> <span id="s541">You know, I wa – I meant to kill him.</span> <span id="s542">I meant to kill him, and – and that wasn’t my nature.</span> <span id="s543">But I was – I was determined to kill him, and not – not only kill him, but call him a bastard.</span> <span id="s544">And – and I wasn’t – I wasn’t made that way.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">Q: That sound – kind of shocked you about yourself at that moment, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s546">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s547">And then there was another thing that happened along that line.</span> <span id="s548">The German army was bringing supplies down from – from the bavar – I mean, from the pass, and from – there was a little town called Udinay(ph) and there was a bunch of rail lines, and it was a – I remember it was May, and it was a beautiful Sunday.</span> <span id="s549">And so, it was – but we knew that the – the rail lines there merged, and there was a lot of boxcars full of ammunition.</span> <span id="s550">So we went after them.</span> <span id="s551">So, I was photographing that day, and we let go our bombs, and boy there were secondary and tertiary explosions and it wasn’t long there was just smoke was up – almost at our altitude.</span> <span id="s552">So, I called the colonel, I said, let’s go back and get it again.</span> <span id="s553">So we photographed it again, cause we were lead, and we went back and photographed it again and bis – it was still explosions all over the place.</span> <span id="s554">So when we got back to the squadron, I said, boy, we really plastered those bastards today, or we – we got them today, and – and so the next morning we had a briefing how many locomotives we had hit, and how many boxcars we had hit.</span> <span id="s555">And – and so you felt real good, and then they finally said yeah, but 2,000 slave laborers were killed.</span> <span id="s556">They were in the – and that was another thing that stuck with me, that’s – that’s has always stuck with me, that here I thought something was re – oh, that’s really performed a big deed, but somebody had paid for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: I – it’s – it’s – I mean, a reaction that I – I have is – is almost like, in war how could you avoid that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, yeah, I know, but that – that’s what – that’s what comes round, you – like when you’re – when you first go in you’re looking for glory, you’re looking for glamour.</span></p> <p><span id="s559">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">A: And you don’t – sometimes you – you don’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s562">Did you know – let me segue a little bit and ask this, did you know – have any news at that time of what was happening to Europe’s Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: No – no.</span> <span id="s564">But I knew what was happening to the little – little children.</span> <span id="s565">And that wa – that – that is, they would gather at our camp just begging for – they would come out with cans, and whatever scraps of food we had, they would give them.</span> <span id="s566">And so anyway, there was a – my best buddy was a guy named Red.</span> <span id="s567">And so we would go in, and we would get more pancake – well, you either got pancakes, or you got powdered eggs for breakfast.</span> <span id="s568">And so we would get pancakes, more than we eat – could eat, and then put more – a little bit more syrup.</span> <span id="s569">And we’d come out and give them to – to the kids.</span> <span id="s570">And so there was one little boy had his arm – he didn’t have his hand, he just – and was always – always getting beat up by the other kids.</span> <span id="s571">So Red said, well, let’s – let’s go help that little guy.</span> <span id="s572">So we took him down to the machine shop, and we had an artificial arm made for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Oh, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: But it was the clips, you know, basically a bunch of clips.</span> <span id="s575">And then the little boy was using his as – as a weapon with the others.</span> <span id="s576">He was beating the hell out of the weapons.</span> <span id="s577">So Red and I said, here we formed a monster.</span> <span id="s578">But it was something, poor little kids, you know, just begging for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: That stuck with me all the time, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s582">So, did you know then, when – when you heard that there had been slave laborers who had been killed, did you know that the Germans were using slave laborers?</span></p> <p><span id="s583">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s584">Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s585">Oh, we’d seen that.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Had you, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: What had you seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s589">A: Well, we seen – we seen them on the roads a lot, with the – with the chur – with the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So that could have been ger – that could have been Jewish slave laborers.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: Jews – Jews, yeah, they had them working on roads a lot, and just a lot of dirty stuff too, along with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: But the newspaper and American military –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s594">Q: – radio didn’t tell you – didn’t say anything, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: No, not until after the war when we heard about the – the Auschwitzes and the – and the – the death camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s597">So after the 66th mission, your commanding officer allowed you to go home?</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Yes, he – he thought I had enough, I guess –</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">A: – and so I get to – I get to – to Hollywood, and while I was at Santa Monica, and I met Gene Raymond’s friend.</span> <span id="s601">Gene Raymond was Jeanette MacDonald’s husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s602">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: So we go up and we’re given free reign of MGM.</span> <span id="s604">We were – we were watching Judy Garland, and – and Lou Costello, and all the movies, and then there was a little yellow – there was a little guy tossing a grenade, and he – he was a poor actor, but he was the – trying hard, and it was Robert Mitchum.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Oh wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">A: And we got – we got to meet all the – all these stars.</span> <span id="s607">And my date one night was June Allyson.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">Q: What a treat.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: What a treat.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Hell, I didn’t want to – I didn’t want to leave.</span> <span id="s612">We toured that – the – MGM, we toured where the – “Gone With The Wind,” was made, and – and then at the – all the – then we were at – guests of the Masters Club.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: And this was because you had been in the – in the war in Italy?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Well, yeah, what I was doing, I wa – I – I had – I was in a crash.</span> <span id="s615">We – we got shot up real bad and we crashed.</span> <span id="s616">And a can of ammunition hit me in the face and knocked out teeth and broke my nose and bloodied my face.</span> <span id="s617">And so I was having the teeth work done at Santa Monica.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: And so – but Jeanette MacDonald, she was just a fine lady.</span> <span id="s620">Strawberry blonde.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Little wa – little gal.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: And was – did this crash happen during that mission that you told me about just a few minutes ago, where, you know, half of the – the squadron that was sent out was either shot up or shot down?</span> <span id="s624">Is this where you had the accident?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No, no, it w – w-we – we were – we were hitting a place called – it was a naval base.</span> <span id="s626">Got worked over there.</span> <span id="s627">And we couldn’t get our wheels down, and so we had – we had a choice, we could either parachute out or – or crash – crash land.</span> <span id="s628">And so I – we had faith in our pilot and so we said we’d ride him down.</span> <span id="s629">And so, you’re coming at about a hundred miles an hour and all of a sudden you hear the screeching sounds of the metal.</span> <span id="s630">But it was such a jolt that the ammunition can came off and hit me in the face –</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: – because I – I had taken the brace position.</span> <span id="s633">You take a brace position, you put your hands behind your neck and pull your neck down.</span> <span id="s634">And this thing came down and hit me.</span> <span id="s635">It was about 50 pounds of ammunition hit me in the face.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Oh my.</span> <span id="s637">How long did your stay in Hollywood last?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Oh, about – about a month.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: That must have been a nice month.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: But boy it was a month, I – I tell you, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s642">And what happened then?</span> <span id="s643">Where did you go then?</span></p> <p><span id="s644">A: I – well, then I was reclassified.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s646">In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: I was to go to Pacific, and I said now, what can I do to get trained?</span> <span id="s648">They said, well, we need overseas navigators.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: I mean, over water navigators.</span> <span id="s651">So I said, well sign me up.</span> <span id="s652">So I was signed up.</span> <span id="s653">And I’d finished basic and was in advanced when the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Oh, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: So I wa – I was – and I had asked in advance for approval to go to George Washington University.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s657">When you say you were – when the war ended, do you mean the americ – the European war, or the Pacific war?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Pacific war.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: So, August.</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: In August ’45.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s664">And so you had asked to go to George Washington University?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yeah, strange thing.</span> <span id="s666">I had – I had 14 medals by this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I had nine – I had nine air medals, I had a Purple Heart, I had distinguished unit citation.</span> <span id="s669">Anyway, so the war ended in August, and I put in for release, because of the medals and si – the time I’d served.</span> <span id="s670">And so I was approved.</span> <span id="s671">And so one day I was home in September, and the – one day I was on a train, the next day I was in university.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Amazing.</span> <span id="s673">I want to ask something though that I missed earlier on.</span> <span id="s674">I’m sorry I’m doubling back.</span> <span id="s675">But I understood you had also flown over Germany, is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s676">A: Over what?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: Over Germany during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: No, you hadn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Oh, y-yes I – yes, I did.</span> <span id="s681">Br-Bremer Pass, a-and Bremer – Bremer Pass, and up on Bremer Pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s683">But only just that little bit.</span> <span id="s684">You didn’t have any other –</span></p> <p><span id="s685">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: – reconnaissance or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: Against the German – I flew against the Germans in Yugoslavia and other places, but that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s689">All right.</span> <span id="s690">So then you’re in George Washington University, and you’re in class.</span> <span id="s691">And what did you study?</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Well, I wanted to be a diplomat.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: I remember you said, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: So I was taking courses in – in economics in – in – in international economics, and I became a – kind of a – well, a friend – more than a friend, he was my monitor, Ted Acheson, he was Dean Acheson’s brother.</span> <span id="s695">And so I was studying international economics, and I had all kinds of offers of jobs, to go into banking, because the banks were just being redone.</span> <span id="s696">I had Caterpillar tractor, I had banks in New York wanted me and – and so.</span> <span id="s697">But I was going with a lady that later became my wife.</span> <span id="s698">And I had offers to go to FBI, I had offers.</span> <span id="s699">But then there was – Ted Acheson said, go down and see this organization, and it’s being formed, and go down and see my buddies down there.</span> <span id="s700">So I went down there and ha – they was these – forming the CIA.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Oh, so the OSS was being formed into the CIA?</span></p> <p><span id="s702">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: So I was put in charge of – I became an expert on Soviet industries.</span> <span id="s705">And I knew where all the industries were.</span> <span id="s706">And in 1940 – 1954 –</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Can I stop back at – when did you join the CIA?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: 1948, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It was called the CIG at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: And what did the G stand for?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Central Intelligence Group.</span></p> <p><span id="s713">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: And became CIA.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s716">And it – and you so – and you say in 1954, when you knew about all of the Soviet industry –</span></p> <p><span id="s717">A: Yeah, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">A: – I was being watched pretty carefully by the CIA.</span> <span id="s720">I mean, I was a – as an uncoming – upcoming person.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: And I met a guy that was head of the navy photo interpretation unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: And so the CIA said they were going to form a new unit.</span> <span id="s725">And I don’t know why, but I went in a darkened room, and I was told I had a new job.</span> <span id="s726">And I said, well, what am I gonna be doing?</span> <span id="s727">They said, well, we can’t tell you.</span> <span id="s728">Course it was the development of the U-2.</span> <span id="s729">So I was made chief of information.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Because I knew about the rush – where the Russian industries were.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s733">But your – your knowledge in analyzing photographs, did that come later, that expertise?</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Well, I took – I took courses in photo interpretation, I passed them easily because I knew it.</span> <span id="s735">But it – photo interpretation becomes, the more you’re in it, the more you learn.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: Well, tell us – tell me a little bit about that, because a lot of people won’t understand how do you get to be knowledgeable about something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Well, let me mention another thing though.</span> <span id="s738">I had a – the – the executive was a guy named Chick Camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: He was the dean of – had been dean of men at Dartmouth, and he was – been a Marine major, and he could talk to you up here, and down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: So he called me in and he said, we – we’re making you the – you’re going to make all the briefing boards for the director to brief Eisenhower, and he said, if you get his – if you get the bosses ass in a sling, he said, I’ll fire yours.</span> <span id="s743">And so that kind of gets your attention.</span> <span id="s744">So I was put in charge of writing – making the briefing boards, and the notes that would go to Eisenhower.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: And so I – I – I got my – oh yeah, I – he – he said, you’re going to get the same clearances that the boss has.</span> <span id="s747">I had 12 clearances.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Mow – wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: On nuclear – on – on bacteriological, on si – on – on communications intelligence, on just all – you know, covert intelligence, on covert photography, all kinds of thing.</span> <span id="s750">So I became his right hand man, and so from that point on, I was in charge of writing and making briefing boards for all the presidents, up to Reagan.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: So from Eisenhower to Reagan, I mean, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon –</span></p> <p><span id="s752">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">Q: – Carter and Reagan, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">A: If you had a chance to meet them all –</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: Excuse me, did I miss?</span> <span id="s756">Ford, Gerry Ford, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Got a chance to meet them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s758">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s759">If –</span></p> <p><span id="s760">A: Eisenhower was my favorite though.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Tell me why.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Oh, he was – he was just a wonderful guy.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: In what way?</span></p> <p><span id="s764">A: Well, he was so knowledgeable, you – he had no – he knew about photography, and so the briefing boards, I had to look at the briefing boards, and I had to annotate anything that looked suspicious of any kind, whether it be a ground formation, or something that been pretty innocuous.</span> <span id="s765">But he would – he would look at the briefing board, and he’d say, you know, what about this, what about that?</span> <span id="s766">Well, I would try to make sure that my boss had the answers, so I would write the notes that would go with the briefing boards, two copies.</span> <span id="s767">One went to the president, one went to the CIA and the Department of Defense.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: So, when you were in – put in charge of these briefing boards, these were briefing boards of satellite images?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Oh, first U-2.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: First U-2.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Then satellites, and then SR-71, and then combat reconnaissance.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: During Vietnam there was all kinds of photography.</span> <span id="s774">But I was also briefed in – I don’t know if you know it or not, but we had planes that were flying supposedly commercial flights, but hell, they had cameras in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: So, like on commercial carriers?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Like TWA, or Pan Am, or something like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: Oh yeah, anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">A: Fake – fake airplanes.</span> <span id="s781">Lot of dirty work.</span> <span id="s782">But the whole idea was to get pictures.</span> <span id="s783">We had – we had Greeks, we had foreigners with – we equipped them with cameras and they’d bring back photography.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: And this was all kinds of photography then, not just fr –</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: – images from above?</span></p> <p><span id="s787">A: Oh yeah, no, attaches photography, parade photography.</span> <span id="s788">No, they would pay – they’d pay a foreign seaman, they’d give him a camera.</span> <span id="s789">And they would go up – climb up the – the pole, and take pictures of – of Cairo e – ca – not Cairo, Alexandria, Egypt, all the ports and so forth, so we could see what was coming in and come – going out.</span> <span id="s790">Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Was the main purpose though, is – was the Soviet Union, to get in – you know, aerial or photographic information of what Soviet activities were?</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: You can bribe people.</span> <span id="s795">You know – you know what plane we could fly with cameras in it that – that was welcomed?</span> <span id="s796">The PX plane.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: I can imagine.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Well, the thing about it is we allowed foreigners to go into PX.</span> <span id="s799">So hell, they would wait for the plane to come in, not realizing we were photographing the hell out of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: So then Germany in particular that would make a big difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s802">France, especially.</span> <span id="s803">France i –</span></p> <p><span id="s804">Q: Oh, really?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: France had a nuclear program going that they were keeping secret.</span> <span id="s806">South Africa was another one.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q: This is fascinating information –</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: – it was – it’s just incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">A: Now, the first thing that we did –</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: – the big question was the bomber gap.</span> <span id="s813">Did the Soviets have more planes than we did?</span></p> <p><span id="s814">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">A: So we – we flew over – we flew five missions in 1956, and we could go to the president, Eisenhower, we could say, Mr. President, there’s no bomber gap.</span> <span id="s816">The rest of them don’t have that many bombers.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Then the next thing was missiles.</span> <span id="s819">We could te – we could go to the president, say Mr. President, there’s no missile gap.</span> <span id="s820">And then we had the Cuban missile crisis.</span> <span id="s821">Then we had the Suez War.</span> <span id="s822">And then we had all these places – in eight years, Eisenhower kept us out of war, and – because we were watching everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Tell me, because we’re talking – we’re going to be talking about the satellite images that were taken during World War II – excuse me, not satellite images, but aerial photography –</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: – in World War II, when did you first hear about Holocaust events, and – and the atrocities to the degree that they took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: Right after the war.</span> <span id="s827">They –</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Right after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: – I heard about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">A: But I didn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s832">Now, what happened to me was, there was a program on television called “The Holocaust.”</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: And this took place when?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Oh, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s835">It – probably in the 70s sometime.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: Maybe in – maybe in the 60s.</span> <span id="s838">I – I remember it was – it was – it was one of those that went five or six nights.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: And then I wondered if by chance, when we were photographing the Auschwitz, the – or the I.G. Farben, I knew that we were – during World War II we were flying over their synthetic fuel plants.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: So there was one at Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s843">We wondered – I wondered if by chance when we were flying over that, did they see anything at the death camp, did we see the death camp.</span> <span id="s844">The first can of photography I put on the light table – now, keep in mind I’m using micro-stereoscopes now, I’m using fancy optics, and enlargements and everything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: Before we get there, ha – you – when you wondered that, after you saw this program –</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Did you know where such photographs were archived?</span> <span id="s848">Where the repositories were?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Oh yeah, I knew that – I knew that there was World War II, or there was World War II photography.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: At Venn(ph) Hill.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: And where is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: Was in a special repository.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s855">And where is this place, Venn(ph) Hill?</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: In Virginia.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s858">Okay, so it was a CIA place, or was it –</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: No, it was air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: It was air force.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: So I called for the photographs of the I.G. Farben plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s862">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: And so when I put them on, the first can of film I put on, I saw people being marched to their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: So, I – I – and I have the example here.</span> <span id="s866">So anyway, I went to the director, and I said, I’ve got this.</span> <span id="s867">And I-I – I can develop it into a project.</span> <span id="s868">But see, this was the time when we were having all the problems with Iran.</span> <span id="s869">And – and the ri – so I – I had to be careful, because you know, I didn’t want to be accused, what the hell you doing looking at Holocaust pictures when the Iran is going down the tube, intelligence.</span> <span id="s870">So I – I – I told him, I said, I have this photography.</span> <span id="s871">So he said he wanted to brief the president.</span> <span id="s872">So I made briefing boards, and he briefed the president.</span> <span id="s873">And then the president – the per – key person there was Jody Powell.</span> <span id="s874">Now, I met a guy named Michael Berenbaum.</span> <span id="s875">Okay, now Michael, when he heard about I had the photography, he called me and – and he was in a – down on either K, or one of those streets, and he had a bunch of artifacts that he was trying to – but it was Jodie Foster that said, hey look, this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Jody Powell, you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Jody Powell was pre – was Carter’s press agent.</span> <span id="s878">Was Jodie Foster said, this is the kind of stuff that’s around here, we’re not gathering it up.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">Q: You mean Jody Powell.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: Jody Powell, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Jody Powell.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s885">[laughter] I’m – I’m not – I’m not that – that – what’s the name of the guy that was old and transferred Jody Powell – Jodie Foster?</span> <span id="s886">Anyway, so I developed this liking for – for Michael Berenbaum.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: And I said hell, I think there’s more stuff available.</span> <span id="s889">He said, you’re kidding.</span> <span id="s890">I said, no, there isn’t.</span> <span id="s891">And he said, you mean that – you mean you got photography of Auschwitz and – and nobody knows about it?</span> <span id="s892">I said, that’s true.</span> <span id="s893">He said, you’re kidding.</span> <span id="s894">I said no, I’m not kidding.</span> <span id="s895">So the president was briefed, Carter was briefed, and he said he liked the idea.</span> <span id="s896">So – so – so I wrote –</span></p> <p><span id="s897">Q: So you got the green light, basically, to be able to do more analysis?</span></p> <p><span id="s898">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s899">But at the same time I had to be careful because I was in charge of making sure that all the intelligence was flowing, briefing boards.</span> <span id="s900">So sometimes I would go in on weekends and – and do this work.</span> <span id="s901">Or, I’d do this work whenever I was waiting for work to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: So this was – I mean, in all of the sours – I mean, it all had been in Venn(ph) Hill?</span> <span id="s903">All the photographs that you eventually looked at and analyzed were from this one archive?</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: And you know, strangely enough, about half of them had really been destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s908">A: Half of the missions had been destroyed.</span> <span id="s909">So I made sure, I told them, I said, put the – put the stamp on that can and don’t let it out, and so that – a stamp I put on that can is still on it, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s911">Did the Brits have any kind of aerial photography like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s912">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s913">But they didn’t look at it either.</span> <span id="s914">Nobody looked at it.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">Q: So the – if I can understand this, the photography had been taken of camps, but not because they were camps, but because there were plants nearby?</span> <span id="s916">Is that the reason why –</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: No, no, they were – the photography was taken for one purpose and one purpose alone, was to bomb the I.G. Farben plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: And did the flan – plan – did the I.G. barb – Farben plant have a pla – have auxiliaries in different cities and locations, or was this the one place that ended up being near Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: No, no, no, no, nobody had looked at any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s921">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Ebensee, all – all of the ones you saw today, most of them that – nobody had ever looked at the photography.</span> <span id="s923">So I started looking at them on my own time primar – well, let me explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: I was a senior officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A: So I get word that hey, we got a mission over the Middle East.</span> <span id="s928">So wer – all right, now, where is it gonna land?</span> <span id="s929">Says, well, it’s gonna land at Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s930">Okay, now who’s processing it?</span> <span id="s931">Well, they’re gonna process it at Wiesbaden.</span> <span id="s932">All right, now when – where does it go from there?</span> <span id="s933">It’s going to the [indecipherable] the Azores and it’s going to Dover.</span> <span id="s934">Well, at that – meantime, I would be calling people in – to come in, but I had – I had a maybe six hour time that I had on my own, waiting to do work.</span> <span id="s935">So that’s when I would do the work on the – on the – so I was told to – so I was given the go ahead to produce the – the document, and at the same time, there was a guy named Seymour Bolton.</span> <span id="s936">He wanted me to talk to – to Jimmy Carter.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: And – and then Jody Powell, the same thing.</span> <span id="s939">Say, we got to get the boss really going.</span> <span id="s940">So then, I was supposed to meet with Elie Wiesel.</span> <span id="s941">And Elie Wiesel though, would – had – he had kind of – when I talked to him, they asked him to be a leader in the – in the – for a Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s942">And Elie Wiesel said he’d never raised money, he didn’t know how to raise money.</span> <span id="s943">And – but anyway, so I had Elie Wiesel for an hour by myself, and what I’ll never forget, Elie Wiesel hated brutality of any kind.</span> <span id="s944">And at that time the Infantata(ph) was going on and he didn’t like the Israelis for beating up on people.</span> <span id="s945">But he told me about the hardships, the loss of his father, but more often – I mean, more times he’d come back to his – the la – his loss of his sister.</span> <span id="s946">I think she was nine years old, and – and she walking sh – when she and her mother were separated from them, sh-she held onto her mother, but she looked back at him.</span> <span id="s947">That’s all he remembered about this sister’s death.</span> <span id="s948">And he – he always pra – you know, her – her innocence, he proclaimed her innocent.</span> <span id="s949">Well, now – now, getting back to Michael Berenbaum.</span> <span id="s950">He was telling me that the tremendous f – not fight, but opposition, both sides, the liberals and the – and the – and the – and the conservative Jews.</span> <span id="s951">Now, especially the – the conservative Jews wanted another Yad Vashem.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Oh, you mean about the museum, what kind of a museum it should be.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: Museum, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: Well – and then – but he wanted it, and that – he felt that it would be doing more good by being an educational one.</span> <span id="s956">So he was emphasizing the emph – the – the – the – the liberal view really, but the educational view.</span> <span id="s957">But at the same time, about this time, when I found the photographs, my boss, the director of – Stanfield Turner, he was a friend of – of – he was a classmate of Carter.</span> <span id="s958">He told me, he said look, he said, I’d like for you to get – get to brief these people in Skokie.</span> <span id="s959">So I said, well, I have relatives in Highland Park, and he said that yeah, he said, well, I’ll arrange it.</span> <span id="s960">Get in touch with Michael Berenbaum.</span> <span id="s961">So I got in touch with Michael Berenbaum.</span> <span id="s962">And I was afraid to – to gi-give this briefing, and he said there would about 70 - 80 survivors of –</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: Of Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah, the Illinois branch.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: Because I had briefed several temples, and when I showed the pictures of people being marched to their death, invariably somebody would – excuse me –</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: That’s okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: – somebody would break down crying.</span> <span id="s969">So I thought, oh boy, this is going to be a disaster.</span> <span id="s970">And strangely enough, when I got there, I don’t know why, but su – a sort of a feeling came over me that hey, these people are easy to get – going to be good to handle.</span> <span id="s971">So I said, now I’m going to show you what I have, what I know, but I want people to come up and point out things that I miss.</span> <span id="s972">I’m – I’m – I want you to participate with me here.</span> <span id="s973">And boy it took fire.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: Did it?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: Oh, it was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s976">They were – they were really in it.</span> <span id="s977">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: What did they do, what did people do?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, they pointed out things.</span> <span id="s980">They said, now that’s – the boxcars – the boxcars were here, and – and then at night, what they – they were ex – telling this – telling me experiences at the – at the camps at night, what they did at night and how they got along.</span> <span id="s981">And then who died, and how they died.</span> <span id="s982">But – but then there was a little – there was a little break and there was coffee time.</span> <span id="s983">And one of the fellows came up, and I said look, I said, how in the hell did you – you survive the cold, because that’s e – Auschwitz is equivalent to the Canadian – U.S. border.</span> <span id="s984">And he said, well that was our secret.</span> <span id="s985">And I said, can you share it with me?</span> <span id="s986">And he said yes, he could.</span> <span id="s987">I say, well what – what was it?</span> <span id="s988">He said, well, he said, you know, the cement bags used to come in.</span> <span id="s989">The bags were made out of paper and tar and paper to keep them dry.</span> <span id="s990">And he said, we made ourselves underwear.</span> <span id="s991">Made themselves thermal underwear.</span> <span id="s992">Then a lady came up, and I said, I guess you strived to get first in line.</span> <span id="s993">She said no –</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: First in line for what?</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: First in line for what?</span> <span id="s997">What should she – what line was the first in line for?</span> <span id="s998">What was the line for?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: For food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">Q: Oh, for food, okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">A: Cause they – they had – I say, well, did you get in line at the beginning or at the end?</span> <span id="s1002">If you went in the beginning, you got sure.</span> <span id="s1003">She said no, about the middle.</span> <span id="s1004">I said, well, why the middle?</span> <span id="s1005">She said, because if you’re at the beginning you go – only got water.</span> <span id="s1006">But at the – but the bin – beginning – I mean, the middle to the end, you got some – some potato peelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: So it sounds to me –</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: They got – they got food –</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: – more nutrition as food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: It sounds to me that – that this was such a huge event because the photographs that you were showing, this aerial photography was the first real proof –</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: That’s it, right there.</span> <span id="s1013">That’s what made them – that’s what th – not a person cried, because they said, you’re proving the fact that the Holocaust existed.</span> <span id="s1014">That was – that was – that was a – that was a whole – whole – their whole feeling, was that I had done something.</span> <span id="s1015">Now, when I got back – when I got back I talked to Dr. Berenbaum.</span> <span id="s1016">I said, hey, look.</span> <span id="s1017">Gosh almighty, the stories they were telling me, they gotta get – gotta get something done with them.</span> <span id="s1018">So Berenbaum said, I’ll – Dino, I agree with you, he said, but we don’t have any money.</span> <span id="s1019">So then it later was Steven Spielberg put the money.</span> <span id="s1020">That’s – but it started with – wi – I mean, he – he knew about it, but it was emphasized by my – my story, and – and – but th-they – they had to show me their – their – their tattoos.</span> <span id="s1021">The men were, for the most part were, I say about five foot five, they’d been starved in there.</span> <span id="s1022">And the women were even, some of them were –</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Smaller, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: But one woman came up to me and she said, you know – you know why I wanted to become American?</span> <span id="s1025">I said no.</span> <span id="s1026">She said well, she said she was liberated, and she said she were – they were filthy dirty.</span> <span id="s1027">So he said, th-they put up a shower unit, but she said they put curtains around it.</span> <span id="s1028">I mean, a tent – the tents around it.</span> <span id="s1029">And she said, I had my first bath.</span> <span id="s1030">And she said, I knew then I wanted to be an American.</span> <span id="s1031">She said, they didn’t bother us.</span> <span id="s1032">She said they – they let us shower, and she said they didn’t bother – and stories like that.</span> <span id="s1033">And then they – then they start telling me about some of the little sneaky things they would do.</span> <span id="s1034">That was – that was it – that was interesting too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">Q: So, was this because –</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">A: How they falsified, they – they – especially the – the woman that were hired – not hired, but the women that made records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: What were they falsifying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: They fal – falsifying records.</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: What ki – and what kind of records?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: Well, the – the personnel were – on personnel primarily, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1042">I see.</span> <span id="s1043">So –</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: But anyway, th-th-there – there were so many stories coming at me, just one right after the other.</span> <span id="s1045">They were so wanted – they so wanted to share them with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Was this your first – as a result of the photographs, had you ever met with any survivors before, of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">A: No, but you see, my best friend was mar – was Cohen, a boy named Cohen.</span> <span id="s1048">And he’s a classmate and he – he still comes to all of our funerals, our family funerals.</span> <span id="s1049">I can’t re – I can’t think of his first name.</span> <span id="s1050">But anyway, I have – I had Jewish friends.</span> <span id="s1051">Simply because the Jewish friends – made friends because they were on the out, and Italian in a German – German high school was on the out.</span> <span id="s1052">I mean –</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Way – way back in Missouri, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: So we made friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1058">So you found out how – you had personal connections with people who were Jewish already, but had any of them had relatives who were survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: No, most of them had – lost relatives.</span> <span id="s1060">But let me mention now, now all of a sudden, I get – I get some – I’m called down to the National Archives to brief the press.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: So word goes out that – that Dino knows a little bit about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1063">Immediately I get calls also, how much did the Jews pay you?</span> <span id="s1064">What did the Zionists – how did the Zionists – then there was a guy up in – there was a doctor up in – up in, I think Rhode Island that was giving me a hard time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1067">That I had – and then there was a – there was a guy up in Canada that – that I finally told him, I – he told me – he said that I had – had the zipper effect on the photograph, I had faked photographs.</span> <span id="s1068">And you know what it is?</span> <span id="s1069">It was people standing in line and they were – there was a gap, and the sun was si – shining, so it looked like a zipper.</span> <span id="s1070">And I said, you dumb bastard, when you learn something more about photo interpretation, you call me again, but don’t call me.</span> <span id="s1071">But this guy up in Canada has constantly ti – tried to find fault.</span> <span id="s1072">He’s a professor.</span> <span id="s1073">But then also, I got involved with the ta – the Englishman that sued –</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: David Irving?</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Yeah, that said that the Holocaust didn’t exist, and the – the lady down in university, and I – so I told her, I – I – you know, I told her fo – the originals are still available, so she could prove her point with the originals, and she did.</span> <span id="s1076">But then –</span></p> <p><span id="s1077">Q: So, in other words, the whole can of worms, or Holocaust denial opened up as well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: – when the photographs appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1081">Yeah, but I – yeah but – yeah but I – on that scrapbook that I gave my friend here, well, you see, there’s a lot of complimentary notes in it too, I don’t know what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: Of course there is.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1084">But also, I got called by the district attorney of Chicago three times tha – whether I’d testify against people that were at Auschwitz that claimed that they didn’t see anything, that they were in the tower but they didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s1085">And so I – I said, okay, sure, I’ll testify against them.</span> <span id="s1086">And when he told them who the expert was, why they pulled away.</span> <span id="s1087">They went back.</span> <span id="s1088">So it’s been a – been a lot of good things, but there’s still people don’t believe that the Holocaust existed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: Well, it sou – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: – and if you have proof like this –</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: Yeah, so – yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">A: So – so that one picture of people being marched to their death has done more good – and strangely enough, that was the first one.</span> <span id="s1095">Now, something interesting too.</span> <span id="s1096">I looked at Ebensee.</span> <span id="s1097">Ebensee, the first troops that – that – that freed them, was troops from my father’s old a-army outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: No kidding?</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">A: The 80th – 80th division.</span> <span id="s1100">Isn’t that something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: So anyway, all of this is tied in, and so – so when – when – when my friend first – she’ll beg you for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: She’s – Q3: He’s talking about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Oh, I see, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: First – first she sa – first I gave her pictures, that wasn’t enough.</span> <span id="s1107">Then she saw my scrapbooks, then she wanted my scrapbook.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: You’re talking about my colleague here from the museum, who could see, of course, the value of these photographs, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1110">And you know, the thing that – the thing that convinced me to give all this stuff to you; I looked – I – I Googled these ca – these camps, and there’s not many photographs on them.</span> <span id="s1111">There’s no photographs, there’s no [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1112">So, where there’s photographs, use the photographs.</span> <span id="s1113">Not only that, but the combination of the photograph and the sketches.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: That’s ri – and then you have – you have people on the – who were on the ground, the survivors, who can say, I was in this barracks, or this barracks.</span> <span id="s1115">It is par – it’s a puzzle, and these are the various pieces of that puzzle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Well, let me mention.</span> <span id="s1117">I – I – I – I think I briefed about probably a half a dozen temples.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">A: And one guy came up to me and he said he was from Ebensee, he had been at Ebensee.</span> <span id="s1120">And he told me, he said, you know what the punishment was?</span> <span id="s1121">I said no.</span> <span id="s1122">He said, they’d take you out in that – that square, and they’d spray you with water, and you’d – you’d freeze to death.</span> <span id="s1123">You know what – what – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">Q: Here’s another quo – quandary, though, that I’ve got.</span> <span id="s1125">And that is, you first identified these photos during the Carter administration, which is, I’m saying 30 years, 35 years after the war is over.</span> <span id="s1126">And when they were first taken, albeit it was for the I.G. Far-Farben plant, to see if that should be destroyed, did nobody recognize what these camps were?</span> <span id="s1127">Did nobody see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: But who – who did – who did they make photo interpreters out – young people, six week course.</span> <span id="s1129">What the hell – what the hell did I know about Fischer-Tropsch coal distill – distillation process?</span> <span id="s1130">I didn’t know anything about them.</span> <span id="s1131">But I – I – I gained interest in them.</span> <span id="s1132">And whether I’ll bite into anything, I – I won’t let go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Okay, I didn’t understand that.</span> <span id="s1134">I’m saying aft – at the war, during the war itself, there were other people who were taking these photographs.</span> <span id="s1135">You weren’t in – in that part of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Well, one thing – one thing historians didn’t use fo – aerial photos.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: And yet I find out that historians make excellent photo interpreters.</span> <span id="s1139">I’m the first guy – you see, let me just – let me explain.</span> <span id="s1140">Intelligence was primarily a main domain.</span> <span id="s1141">And the only time that you – the on – only time that you hired a woman was to be a clerk in the 1960s and 50s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: Oka, I was getting real good folders of women that applied for a job with the CIA.</span> <span id="s1144">And I said, why in the hell can’t I use them?</span> <span id="s1145">So I go up in the career board, and I’d get flogged.</span> <span id="s1146">Navy – old navy men, and oh, I don’t want – I don’t want to work with a wo – oh God, you have to put up with her, you know, you have to [indecipherable] then you work, you train her, and then three years later she’ll – she’ll leave and she’ll get married.</span> <span id="s1147">And then when they’re – when they’re in love you can’t handle them [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s1148">And so I started hiring them.</span> <span id="s1149">I got – I got backing by the exec, cause he had been a dean of men at Dartmouth and he said, by God, we’ll start hiring them.</span> <span id="s1150">You know that 50 percent now are – are – of the photo interpreters are women?</span> <span id="s1151">Simply because we made – we made – we made room for them.</span> <span id="s1152">We had – we had enough intellect, I guess, that we – we – we wanted women to try.</span> <span id="s1153">And not only women, not only – not only photo interpreters, they became supervisors.</span> <span id="s1154">But, you know, I told them, when you come in, damn it, I don’t want you to cry.</span> <span id="s1155">You – y-you get – you get – you get – I – I gotta go to career board, I don’t want to hear that stuff.</span> <span id="s1156">Not only that, but don’t ask for any – don’t ask for any credit, an-and don’t take crap – crap from anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1158">But I want to go back to the wartime.</span> <span id="s1159">So you’re saying that people took – who took the aerial photographs in 1944, of Auschwitz didn’t know what they were looking at?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: No.</span> <span id="s1161">No, I talked to two pilots.</span> <span id="s1162">Nobody – said nobody told us.</span> <span id="s1163">Nobody told us anything was there.</span> <span id="s1164">One – one in South Africa, my – I think there’s a letter in the folder, I don’t know, I’ve forgotten his name.</span> <span id="s1165">But then, they were flying out of Fogia(ph).</span> <span id="s1166">There were people flying out of those areas.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">Q: So in other words, they would take these aerial photographs, they would bring them back –</span></p> <p><span id="s1168">A: Well, they would – let – well, let me mention another thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: The eight – the eighth air force was a – was a – you got a – you – you – you – you had a good life.</span> <span id="s1171">You lived in London, you had – you could eat good, you drank good, you had the parties you had and so forth.</span> <span id="s1172">You had th – and so the eighth air force was kind of the organization.</span> <span id="s1173">Now here was a second cousin down in – in Fogia(ph), the 15th.</span> <span id="s1174">And they were primarily you mi – might get some Italian food and maybe a bottle of wine, but you didn’t have the life that you had in – in – in England.</span> <span id="s1175">So when it came to bombing Auschwitz, it was – the English pre – would – was barely – they were hitting – being able to hit, but it was about the extremes.</span> <span id="s1176">But the 15 had no problem at all hitting and re-conning th – Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1177">But they didn’t particularly care for the 15th.</span> <span id="s1178">There was a snobbery among the air forces, beca-because th-the real work –</span></p> <p><span id="s1179">Q: The British American?</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">A: – both – both the re – both the recon and – and the – and the bombing of Auschwitz was done by the 15th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1181">Q: But I thought Auschwitz wasn’t bombed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: No, I mean, the – the – I’m not – talking about bombing of the I.G. Farben plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: You’re talking about the bombing of the I.G. Farben plant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1186">Okay.</span> <span id="s1187">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">A: But nobody had looked at those photographs.</span> <span id="s1189">I checked that.</span> <span id="s1190">Nobody had looked at the photograph, and nobody had – had sent any copies of those photographs to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Did the Brits have any of their own photographs of any of the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Yeah, they had the one of Auschwitz – I mean, the one of – one that’s got [indecipherable] on it, which – which one is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q3: You mean of the Auschwitz photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: No, not Auschwitz, the one –</span></p> <p><span id="s1195">Q: Of any – of any camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1196">Q3: I think they have Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: And they did –</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: Which one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1199">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q3: Bergen-Belsen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">Q: Bergen-Belsen?</span> <span id="s1202">Did they ha –</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q3: No, Westerbork.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Westerbork?</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: No, it’s – it’s in – what’s a – what’s the one that still near Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">Q3: Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q3: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">A: Dachau.</span> <span id="s1212">They had fa – pictures of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">Q: And they didn’t know what they were looking at either?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: No, they knew about Dachau because Dachau wa – you know, that – that was sort of built up about – if you look at the photographs of Dachau, it looks more like a prison that it does a –</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: Concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: I mean, it – it’s a – it – it looks like a – oh, a modified vacation plant, vacation hotel.</span> <span id="s1217">You know [indecipherable] what I’m talking about is small units.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: Me – where – where all the other camps were made out of wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: I keep going back to my question though, that with this aerial photography going on, at the time, in 1944 and ’45, nobody was looking at it, loo – ca – looking at what came back and said, aha, in addition to I.G. Farben, there’s also the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: Oh, more than that.</span> <span id="s1222">The first thing that you do in photography is always look for the transportation.</span> <span id="s1223">What – how – who – who’s there?</span> <span id="s1224">What – what – what’s transportation.</span> <span id="s1225">The biggest sin that World War II photographers tha – with all those boxcars, all those trains and boxcars, my God that should have – somebody should have said what the hell are – what the hell are the – what the hell are they there for?</span> <span id="s1226">Nobody did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: And they didn’t because they didn’t think to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: They didn’t have a requirement.</span> <span id="s1229">Nobody had asked them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1231">A: See, normally you work when you get a requirement.</span> <span id="s1232">Somebody asks you to do something.</span> <span id="s1233">But then it was the training too.</span> <span id="s1234">They weren’t – they weren’t the – you know, what – what can you expect from – from just a few weeks of training?</span> <span id="s1235">And basically the training was primarily on ships and – and things military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: And would this have been the very first war that there would have been aerial photography?</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: No.</span> <span id="s1238">There was – wor – World War I</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: World War I had it as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">A: I’ve written about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1244">Is there anything else that you’d like to add to what you have explained to us today about how you got the photographs, how you – how you found them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Well, I think – I think – I think somebody ought to ca – what’s Mauthausen?</span> <span id="s1246">Have you got a photograph of that one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">Q3: Mauthausen, yeah.</span> <span id="s1249">You want to see it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">A: Mauthausen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1251">Q: Mauthausen, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Huh?</span> <span id="s1253">I don’t think – I don’t think there’s a photograph.</span> <span id="s1254">Is there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q3: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1256">No, there’s one of Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: See, but I – I’m sure that – I’m sure that if you research, you have to back into the problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">A: I mean, I’d like to see a – an album of – of all these photographs put together.</span> <span id="s1260">And then – then ti – for example, if you had a – a survivor of a – of Ebensee, I – I can’t – I couldn’t find a – a – a – normally – normally at these places you have a place that get – makes the food.</span> <span id="s1261">You have a place that – for – you have toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: In other words, I always looked at sa – li-li-like – like Auschwitz as kind of an example for me.</span> <span id="s1264">You gotta see that – you gotta feed people, and you gotta – they gotta be – they gotta have places to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1265">For example – now I found the – I found the … what the hell, help me out there.</span> <span id="s1266">By the – by the – by the – by the shadow fall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: The crematoria?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: The crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: Found the crematorium by the shadow.</span> <span id="s1271">But okay now th-the – what the hell – what’s that – what’s that – what’s the – what’s the fire going on there?</span> <span id="s1272">I don’t see any cordwood.</span> <span id="s1273">See, not only that, but there’s – there must have been a hospital or someplace to – to take sick.</span> <span id="s1274">Which – which building is the hospital?</span> <span id="s1275">In other words, somebody that – that lived through – could help you – could help you, and you ought to get them before they pass away, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: I – I – I fully agree.</span> <span id="s1277">I fully agree.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: I’d like – I’d like – I’d like to sit down with the guy that looks at Ebensee together.</span> <span id="s1279">All I – all I heard about Ebensee, the people that – few people that I’ve met, is that – how harsh it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: How cold it was, and how bad it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">Q: How had this changed you, or changed the world that you moved in, p-prior to looking and analyzing the Auschwitz photo and then meeting with Mr. Berenbaum?</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">A: All right, there was one photograph of the wa – Russians women with a bunch of kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1286">I have a grandson, he’s Jewish, and I think about him, you know, wo-wo – what ha – what would have been him – what would have been Ben’s fate?</span> <span id="s1287">Or how would Ben felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Now, he happens to be an army surgeon now, and he’s my buddy.</span> <span id="s1290">And he comes to me with problems.</span> <span id="s1291">Now, he came back, and I said, who have you worked on?</span> <span id="s1292">He’s – he was in – he was in Afghanistan.</span> <span id="s1293">So while he worked on American soldiers, he worked on – on – on the – on the state guard troopers, he worked on Italians and Germans that were assigned to that area.</span> <span id="s1294">He said, Grandpa, I even worked on the Taliban.</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">A: He said, he had his arm shot.</span> <span id="s1297">He said, I saved his arm.</span> <span id="s1298">I said, you feel good about it or bad about it?</span> <span id="s1299">He said, I feel good about it.</span> <span id="s1300">That was it.</span> <span id="s1301">So I – I – so –</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: Is this how you feel about having – having dug into the archives and looked and found those photos?</span> <span id="s1303">Do you feel –</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: That’s why I keep the one book.</span> <span id="s1307">I’ll keep one book and he’ll – he’ll probably be the one that – that will – will get it when I pass.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Well, I’d like to thank you for sharing all of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Oh, you don’t have to thank me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">Q: But I do, I do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q2: Do we get to ask one question?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s1313">All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q3: I mean, I have a few, too, sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">Q: So, my colleagues would like to ask a few questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">Q: And now at the end of our interview, so I’ll start with Josh Blinder.</span> <span id="s1318">What would you like to ask?</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q3: Do you know, I’m going to ask you to look at her while I ask the questions, cause it’s going to be as if she was asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Ask what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Okay, all right, he’s going to ask, but you look at me, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">Q2: Dino, this is kind of a hard one, but if you had to put a quantity on what you think you’re the most proud of for having done this, in looking at these photos, what do you think of this achievement – what – o-of this achievement, what do you think you’re the most proud of having done?</span></p> <p><span id="s1325">A: When a – when I was at Skokie, I was expecting – I was expecting the worst, people crying.</span> <span id="s1326">And meanwhile it was just the reverse.</span> <span id="s1327">They were happy that I had – I had proof that the Holocaust existed.</span> <span id="s1328">That’s – I’ll never forget Skokie.</span> <span id="s1329">And a funny thing, I had my cousin with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1330">Q: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1331">A: And he couldn’t get over it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s1332">Q: What it meant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">A: What it meant to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1335">Becky?</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q3: Okay, so I have a few more questions about the reaction to the release of the photos.</span> <span id="s1337">So part of it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s1338">Q: Come over here Becky, come over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1339">Q3: Sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Okay, hang on a minute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">A: She won’t come near me now – now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">Q3: I’m not supposed to be on camera.</span></p> <p><span id="s1343">A: Before – before – before she – before she – she was – she couldn’t – she couldn’t leave me.</span> <span id="s1344">Now she got it – now she’s got a man, she said the hell with – Q3: I’m not supposed to be on camera, so I have to use – Q2: Stand right in back of her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1345">Q3: I have to use Ina’s microphone.</span> <span id="s1346">So you and I have talked about this before, but when – thank you – when the photos were released, there was the reaction of, this proves what we – this proves that this actually happened.</span> <span id="s1347">And for a lot of people, especially Auschwitz survivors, there really weren’t a lot of photos of Auschwitz taken during the war, so it really was proof that – in-incredible proof that people could point to, it was all over the news.</span> <span id="s1348">It also started a debate among historians, which you know, and you and I have talked about, and you’ve written about it, about whether or not Auschwitz, the crematoriums and gas chambers at Auschwitz could have been bombed.</span> <span id="s1349">And you and Ina have talked about the intelligence aspects of that, how these photos weren’t discovered until the 70s when you discovered them, and how at the time, the interpretation couldn’t have happened.</span> <span id="s1350">You know, they didn’t have the intelligence or the tools to analyze the photos, to be able to pin out what was the crematorium, and what was the gas chambers and do those sorts of things.</span> <span id="s1351">But Ina was surprised to hear that Auschwitz had been bombed, and so I wanted to – you to talk through kind of what happened when the U.S. tried to bomb I.G. Farben, when the Auschwitz complex actually was bombed, and whether you think – and again, I know you’ve written this, but I want you to say it on camera, so we have you on camera saying it; what you think the – say, McCoy(ph) had said, yes, we should go ahead and do it.</span> <span id="s1352">What would have happened after that?</span> <span id="s1353">Does that make sense?</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q3: Is it a fair question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1356">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q3: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Now I think – now, I was with an outfit that we had – we took pleasure in pinpoint bombing.</span> <span id="s1359">We – we knocked out bri – we had a record for knocking out bridges, we had – we – we hit the battleship and cruiser.</span> <span id="s1360">Whatever they had something [indecipherable] they – we could hit it.</span> <span id="s1361">And – and medium bombers, they are much more accurate than the – than the heavies.</span> <span id="s1362">And I think it could have been bombed by medium.</span> <span id="s1363">In fact, I would have volunteered on that type of mission.</span> <span id="s1364">You could have moved B fif – B-25s into position and B-25s could have got them, cause it – now, how long would it take them though to – to reconstruct?</span> <span id="s1365">I don’t think you can reconstruct one of those killing stations in say, six weeks.</span> <span id="s1366">They – somebody said, well you can – oh, we can build them in six weeks.</span> <span id="s1367">But they said, well, the one guy said oh yeah, well, we can’t – we can’t – we can’t gas them, but we’ll – we’ll u – we’ll kill them with rifles.</span> <span id="s1368">Well, the Germans had found out that killing by – by rifles is – is pretty hard on the people that are doing the killing, too.</span> <span id="s1369">So I – I – I think it – if – if – if it – if somebody said gets – get a – bomb it, I think the medium L-2 bombers would do it, B-25s especially.</span> <span id="s1370">And – and our outfit would have been a good one to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q3: Were – were medium bombers flying over Auschwitz at the time?</span> <span id="s1372">Th – who was doing the recon and the bombing of –</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">A: No, that was heavies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q3: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: But you could move – you could move the – you see, we had taken – we had moved into France by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">Q: So, E.J. far – E.J. Farben – I.G. Farben was bombed.</span> <span id="s1377">Is that correct?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: Well, let me tell you, when you release your bombs, normally you have something in mind.</span> <span id="s1379">You want to – they call them linear.</span> <span id="s1380">You la – you drop them so that they – they’re pinpoint bombing in a l-long area.</span> <span id="s1381">Or you salvo, you want them all to go one time.</span> <span id="s1382">Now, one of the problems that they have is that when the bombs come out, when you – when you release the bombs and they hit – hit the airflow, they have a tendency sometime to fishbed, or sometime even to tundle – tumble.</span> <span id="s1383">And the fins are very, very li – they’re sheet – the sheet metal, they’re not heavy.</span> <span id="s1384">So that I – I think that what happened, either bombs got hit and tumbled and one of – one or more – more had hit the – not – didn’t hit the – what you want to hit, they hit they ark – hit the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q3: Yeah, so we –</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: You – you want them to hit the –</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: We inadvertently – Q3: We inadvertently hit Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1390">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q3: So that – so part of the debate has always been, why wasn’t Auschwitz bombed, and that’s the wrong question, because Auschwitz was bombed, just by accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Well, the thing about it though, my God, you got the – you got the stick of bombs right over the – right over the number one and number two killing complexes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q3: So – so the – the problem that I’m hearing you say – and I don’t want to put words in your mouth, so make sure that you correct me, is we didn’t have the intelligence – the – the photos were not interpreted properly at the time to give us the intelligence needed –</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q3: – to bomb the gas chambers and the crematorium, and we were using the wrong bombers.</span> <span id="s1398">We would have had to put different planes in place to actually pinpoint hit –</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: But don’t – don’t – Q3: Both of those things could have happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">A: Yeah, but just don’t blame the photo interpreters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q3: No, no, no, no –</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: Blame the fact that – blame the fact that you had people that had been at Auschwitz –</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q3: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: – and were trying to tell people that – and – and were – were – you had a failure of intelligence –</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q3: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1406">A: – hey, hey, what’s – what the hell’s going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">Q3: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">A: That’s collateral information that something – something is going on and we got some source – not one source, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: Several.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: – I – I think probably if you add them up there was about 10 sources that had said that there was something going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q3: And because that report never got to the 15th –</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: Well –</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">Q: Not only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q3: Not only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: Not only.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q3: There are lots of different –</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: A direction would have had to come down, as you explained before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q3: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: You said that, you know, when you analyze a photograph it’s based on what instructions you’ve gotten as to what to look for.</span> <span id="s1420">And if you haven’t gotten instructions to look for something, you won’t look for it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">A: Well, there was something about – see, you had the – the invasion was about ready to come off, okay.</span> <span id="s1422">So the idea was wh-where do we use our resources?</span> <span id="s1423">And the – we use most of our resources on V-1s and V-2 sights.</span> <span id="s1424">General Spotz(ph) wanted the – the synthetic fuel plants to be hit.</span> <span id="s1425">So, you had so many photo interpreters doing work, searching for V-1 and V-2 sights that – that they weren’t looking at these synthetic fuel plants.</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s1427">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: But I – I think the big – biggest sin though, my God, the – those – all those boxcars and they – nobody – nobody said what the hell are these – all these railcars, boxcars, especially during wartime?</span> <span id="s1429">Cause boxcars are in short supply always in wartime, and not only that, but you see so many, gosh I don’t know how many.</span> <span id="s1430">I mean i – tha – there again, you can – you can measure those and count how many boxcars there are, but has anybody ever counted them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q3: In those photos, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1433">I think people have said 40.</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q3: I think people – the one that we have at the museum, I think it has about 40 boxcars in it.</span> <span id="s1436">The one that we have in the big mural.</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">Q: Somebody has –</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">Q3: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: Somebody has counted them –</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: I think that’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: – but it’s not conclusive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">Q3: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1443">And that’s a zoomed in part of the photo.</span> <span id="s1444">When you zoom out there’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q3: – actually more.</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: Well, you could do it, you could do it, you could measure it – Q3: Yeah, you could do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1448">A: – measure the – measure the size and then divide that by the size of a boxcar, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: In-Incidentally too, you have to be a little careful there too, because in some cases – did you see that there’s some – some vehicles next to the boxcars?</span> <span id="s1451">In other words, those are probably buses taking the people from the boxcars to the main – Q3: Yeah, the Red Cross out –</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q3: – ambulances, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: So called.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q3: I’m making [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1457">Any other questions?</span> <span id="s1458">Any other questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q3: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">Q: So – Q2: Now let’s give about 15 seconds of room time please.</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: Wait – yeah, hang on a second.</span> <span id="s1462">So I would like – I would like to thank you, and I would like to then formally conclude the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Mr. Dino Brugioni, on November 13th, 2014.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">A: You tell your boss that it was a joy having you down here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">Q: Thank you, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1465">A: And then you – you give her a little photo interpretation lesson on Ebensee.</span></p> <p><span id="s1466">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q3: It won’t be as good, but maybe we can just play the video.</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span
