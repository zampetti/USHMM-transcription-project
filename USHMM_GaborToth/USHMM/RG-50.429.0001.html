I’m 82 years old and I was born in Lowell, Massachusetts but we moved to Lowell when I was about five years old to Brookline, Mass.</span> <span id="s6">And we went to temple, I went to Temple Israel in Boston since I was about five years old till even now.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: …growing up, family, religious background.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: Yes, I moved to, to Brookline in 1925 and I have a twin sister and a brother and another sister.</span> <span id="s9">And we lived in Brookline and I went to Temple Israel which is a Reform temple and the head of that temple was Rabbi Levy, was a well known rabbi in those days and it’s a Reform temple.</span> <span id="s10">And my parents were quite religious and I was actually bar mitzvahed at a temple in Brookline and also went to Temple Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">And we observed all the holidays or most of the holidays but specifically we weren’t really terribly religious.</span> <span id="s12">We didn’t, we didn’t have kosher set up and all but we always went at different holidays, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and we still do.</span> <span id="s13">But our religious training was, was moderate.</span> <span id="s14">And I went to school at Brookline and it was a grammar school called Edward Devotion School and us that’s when I started to be interested in track and I was captain of the grammar school track team.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">And the principal of the school was named Charles Taylor and he was very interested in my athletic activities and he really encouraged me especially in track.</span> <span id="s16">‘Cause in those days I held a record in high jump when I was eleven years old.</span> <span id="s17">And he was sort of sponsoring me in all activities.</span> <span id="s18">And then I went to high school and I was captain of the track team there.</span> <span id="s19">And held quite a few records in the interscholastic meets and that was in 1932.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">And then I went Exeter Academy for one year in preparation to go to Harvard and while I was at Harvard, I, well I was at a summer camp rather in 1932.</span> <span id="s21">I met this Norman Carnis who eventually became my roommate and he was an outstanding track athlete too.</span> <span id="s22">He was a hammer thrower and also a hundred yard dash runner.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">And in 1935 there was a Harvard-Yale track team that competed in London against Oxford-Cambridge and Norman Carnis was a hammer thrower mostly at that time.</span> <span id="s24">And they didn’t have the hammer throw in the Oxford-Cambridge meet so he trained in the 100, 220 and made the team in the hundred and the 220 which was an unusual combination, a hammer thrower and a hundred year dash.</span> <span id="s25">And I was in the, in three events.</span> <span id="s26">At the Oxford-Cambridge meet.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">That was in 1935 in the high hurdles, the low hurdles, and the running broad jump.</span> <span id="s28">It was called broad jump that time but it’s called the long jump now.</span> <span id="s29">And I won two events at the Oxford-Cambridge meet.</span> <span id="s30">And we, I’ve been always thinking and wanting to be in the Olympics.</span> <span id="s31">And of course that was my hope to be in the Olympics but in 1936 in the Harvard-Yale game, the Harvard-Yale track meet, Carnis and myself had won six of, six gold medals between us.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">And there was quite a bit of publicity about it and about our Olympic plans and whether we were going to the Olympics or whether we could qualify.</span> <span id="s33">And I had qualified for the final tryouts in Randall Island.</span> <span id="s34">And I got a certificate from Avery Brundage and I think I had submitted to your group the certificate from Avery Brundage saying that I had qualified for the final tryouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: …without mentioning the museum, got the certificate.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Yes, I had, I received a certificate from the American Olympic committee.</span> <span id="s37">Avery Brundage.</span> <span id="s38">And it stated that I had qualified through all the preliminary tryouts for the final tryouts at Randall Island.</span> <span id="s39">And about at that time, there was some publicity in the Boston papers about my roommate and me, Norman Carnis and myself.</span> <span id="s40">There was a picture of us winning six gold medals.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">And some of the executives or the committee members at Temple Israel and Rabbi Levy had seen the publicity and knew that we were potential Olympic candidates.</span> <span id="s42">And one of the committee members called me and said he would like, congratulated me for our performance at the Harvard-Yale track meet.</span> <span id="s43">And said that Rabbi Levy would like to talk to us about the Olympics and the potential there.</span> <span id="s44">And could we meet with him.</span> <span id="s45">And we met with him.</span> <span id="s46">At Temple Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">And they explained to us what was happening in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s48">The terrible things that were going on and all the activities against the Jews and people in Germany.</span> <span id="s49">And we, we sort of knew something about the problem of ( ) but not in any great details.</span> <span id="s50">And were really quite taken aback with information that they gave to us.</span> <span id="s51">And then he, and at that time it was suggested that it might be a good idea for us not to go to the Olympics.</span> <span id="s52">Because of all this, these problems that sort of register our objections and sort of boycotting the Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">And we were quite taken aback about that thought.</span> <span id="s54">They tried to explain to us that we would never regret if we did take that action, to boycott the Olympics and they suggested that we talk it over and let them know what, what our thoughts were, if we wanted any further discussion.</span> <span id="s55">And we, Norman Carnis and I went back and talked it over and thought we had discussed it with our parents as we had great respect for their judgment.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">And after talking it over with our parents, they also called Rabbi Levy to see what his thoughts were again.</span> <span id="s57">To get an explanation from him.</span> <span id="s58">And my father told me that he was satisfied and had confidence in Rabbi Levy’s judgment and that we wouldn’t regret it if we did boycott the Olympics.</span> <span id="s59">Of course the problem was, not the problem but the question was we, you know how imminent our selection onto the Olympic team would be.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">And I held the world’s record in the high hurdles and also the Harvard-Yale record in the broad jump.</span> <span id="s61">And at that time and the Harvard-Yale broad jump event which I held the record in was over 24 feet, 11 inches.</span> <span id="s62">And I had been running in three events at that track meet and the coach said not to take too many jumps because I had to save myself for the other events.</span></p> <p><span id="s63">And on the first try on the broad jump I had fouled the take off, stepped over the mark.</span> <span id="s64">And he said to be very careful on the next jump because he didn’t want me to take all my full jumps.</span> <span id="s65">So on the next jump I was very careful and took off about a foot behind the take off board and I did 24 feet 11, so I was close to 26 feet in the actual jump.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">And they thought that I could, had a good chance of qualifying for the Olympics in the long jump.</span> <span id="s67">Where I had the potential to go close to 26 feet.</span> <span id="s68">And in the high hurdles, which was the other event that I was, had qualified for, I had been running around 14, 9, 15 seconds in the high hurdles and the qualifying times were in the 14 second, probably 14, 2, or 3, but I was improving in the high hurdles and I practiced timing event, timing in the high hurdle practice rounds and I was getting closer to the 14, 5, 14, 4.</span> <span id="s69">And they felt that there was a good chance that I could make the team in maybe two events.</span> <span id="s70">But at any rate, after the discussion with Rabbi Levy and my parents and this whole situation about boycotting, both Carnis and I decided that we would boycott the Olympics and we didn’t go into the finial tryouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">And although I was disappointed I felt that that was the thing to do and that’s what basically happened, as far as boycotting the Olympics [were] concerned because that time I was a senior at Harvard and I was interested in getting into business and whether to go into business right away, after graduation which was in 1936 or to go to graduate school.</span> <span id="s72">And now I decided to go to Harvard Business School and then go into the real estate business.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">So I was interested in looking, I was always interested in athletics.</span> <span id="s74">And I knew that I was a pretty good athlete and as I say I was captain of all the track teams since I was in grammar school.</span> <span id="s75">But my focus after getting out of college was not, had nothing to do really with athletics, although I was interested in all athletics and tennis and skiing and all the other activities.</span> <span id="s76">But I decided to go to the Harvard Business School and then to go into business in the real estate business.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">And that’s what happened and I was interested in, you know, finding a nice gal and getting married too.</span> <span id="s78">So that’s the basic course that I followed.</span> <span id="s79">And after I got out of the business school I participated in tennis.</span> <span id="s80">And I was ranked number six in New England in the super senior category so I was always interested in athletics but that’s really the basic story about what happened in the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: …elaborate on some of those points…came from a Jewish background, identified as a Jewish boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: That’s right, absolutely.</span> <span id="s83">My mother and father as say were Reform at that time.</span> <span id="s84">When I moved to Brookline in 1925.</span> <span id="s85">But their parents were very religious, my mother’s parents particularly because my father’s parents weren’t around at that time.</span> <span id="s86">But my mother’s parents, the name was Waburn and they were very religious and we used to go over to their home, to their apartment and celebrate all the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s87">And as I say they were very religious and my parents were religious but they were Reform.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What about your friends, were your friends mixed or did you really grow up in a more Jewish environment?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: I’d say that I grew up basically in a mixed environment.</span> <span id="s90">After we lived in Brookline, in 1929 we moved to Newton.</span> <span id="s91">And I went to Newton High School.</span> <span id="s92">In those days it wasn’t too integrated.</span> <span id="s93">And my friends, I’d say were 50/50 Jewish and non-Jewish and so our upper was [difficult to figure out what was missing here], was mixed but our social activities were mostly Jewish activities.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism from your classmates or people when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s96">High school, never noticed any.</span> <span id="s97">I knew it was around and there were situations but in college, at Harvard we lived Carnis and I lived in Lowell House.</span> <span id="s98">And they had common room eating and we mixed with all of the, everyone there and we, we never noticed any particular anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s99">But we knew it existed.</span> <span id="s100">But we were never particularly subjected to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Do you think that sports in your early athletic career provided a good opportunity for you to fit into the main stream and move beyond your Jewish environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: I never particularly thought of it in that way.</span> <span id="s103">But it was the focus that you know put us in contact with all the…</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: …start the sentence by saying sports or athletics was the focus so that you say the subject in the sentence…</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Oh yeah, I see.</span> <span id="s106">You know sports and athletics were a focus.</span> <span id="s107">Because as I say I was captain of the team so I was, did pretty well in all the events.</span> <span id="s108">While it was a focus and I enjoyed it, it wasn’t 100 percent focus.</span> <span id="s109">But I trained carefully and did all the training that the coaches had suggested but I would say it was a focus but not 100 percent so.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: And you mentioned that you had worked toward going to the Olympics.</span> <span id="s111">Was that a real serious possibility in your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s113">Going to the Olympics was a very serious focus at that time and it was a focus on training and doing extra training and exercises too and I was watching the performances all over the world, in my particular events, particularly.</span> <span id="s114">And yes it was something that I was always thinking about when I was training and I had hoped to make the Olympic team.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">Q: So it must have been somewhat disappointing when, even though it was your choice, you weren’t going to participate.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: It was my boycotting the Olympics through the meetings I had with Rabbi Levy, yes I was, I was disappointed.</span> <span id="s117">And felt that that focus that I had had all these years was going to materialize but somehow or another I felt that it was the right thing to do and I never had any regrets about it one way or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: What gave you that moral grounding?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Well I don’t think the moral grounding in relation to that was not really a basic factor.</span> <span id="s120">I don’t think it had anything to do with moral grounding.</span> <span id="s121">It was just a realization that was something that should be done and I had great respect for Rabbi Levy because prior to our meeting with him, although I had heard about the problems in Germany and what was going on, I didn’t really have a detailed understanding of the problems there and that meeting was really a shocker to both Carnis and myself.</span> <span id="s122">And it struck home to me that that was something I wanted to do after they explained the situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You talk about this meeting.</span> <span id="s124">Can you go into more detail about what they said to you and what helped you make this choice?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Well the meeting with Rabbi Levy was at the Temple Israel executive boardroom.</span> <span id="s126">And we weren’t sure what he was going to tell us about what was happening in Germany.</span> <span id="s127">But the several board members of the men’s committee and the rabbi went into pretty good detail.</span> <span id="s128">But I don’t remember all the items that they discussed particularly, but they told us about the terrible things that were going on in Germany and the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s129">And it was a shocker to me and Norman Carnis and it just struck home that it was something that we should do or consider doing.</span> <span id="s130">But I don’t remember particularly all the gory details that they went into.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Do you remember any of the details?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Not really.</span> <span id="s133">Something about book burning and taking away the rights of the Jews and putting them in ghettos and I suppose it was – I don’t remember it was that time or afterwards, but they mentioned about the killing of Jews.</span> <span id="s134">And then all those details were pretty repulsive to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Were there at that point to your knowledge, press statements or public statements about boycotting and about Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: Yes there were.</span> <span id="s137">There was publicity about the boycotting and discussions between the Olympic Committee and there were some other groups that were, had mentioned in the press about they should boycott the Olympics.</span> <span id="s138">And there were other groups that said they shouldn’t boycott the Olympics so I was just aware that there was a discussion going on about boycotting but I wasn’t aware of all the details involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Were you aware of other athletes who were considering boycotting?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: Not particularly.</span> <span id="s141">I did, I wasn’t aware of any other athletes that I knew of and I wouldn’t be in contact with them other than through publicity in the papers.</span> <span id="s142">But I remember something about Stoller and those track athletes that were questioning about going to the Olympics but I don’t particularly remember the time frame in connection with that but I do remember the discussion about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Did the press and some of these organizations who were talking about boycotting influence you or….</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: No, I didn’t think the press or the publicity influenced me one way or the other because I wasn’t aware at that time in any great detail of the problems going on in Germany and the Nazis with the Jews.</span> <span id="s145">I knew there were problems and it was serious but I wasn’t aware of all the details.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: When you decided to boycott was this primarily to take a stand or was there any concern about your safety in going over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: No, I wasn’t worried at all about safety but the reason I boycotted it was entirely a result of the meeting with Rabbi Levy.</span> <span id="s148">That was the essential dominant factor involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Did you consider this a substantial sacrifice on your part?</span> <span id="s150">I mean you had been working for this for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: Well boycotting the Olympics was a sacrifice because I had always wanted to be in the Olympics but I didn’t consider it as, once we made up our mind and I was aware of what was going on there, I didn’t look at it particularly as a sacrifice, although it was.</span> <span id="s152">But I didn’t consider it a terrible blow.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Once you made the decision to boycott, were you asked to or did you make any public statements in an effort to influence other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No.</span> <span id="s155">We never made any public statements or indicated what steps we had taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: When you were in a pretty high profile position.</span> <span id="s157">You were captain of varsity track in Harvard, I’m surprised that someone didn’t come to you and say will you speak out for this boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well after we boycotted the Olympics, no one came to speak to us or ask us if we’d make any statement about it and I don’t think anyone knew particularly that we did boycott it.</span> <span id="s159">Cause there was no publicity about it one way or the other.</span> <span id="s160">The only publicity we had was when I spoke to the track coach at Harvard.</span> <span id="s161">His name was Yacko Macola.</span> <span id="s162">He was the assistant coach but he was the – in 1936 he was the track coach, and we told him about our intention and he tried to persuade us not to do it.</span> <span id="s163">He said he didn’t think we’d do much good and we should try to go to the final tryouts and try to make the team.</span> <span id="s164">But we didn’t want to do that.</span> <span id="s165">And that was the only conversation we really had about it, publicity wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: …ask you about where you were during the games and….</span> <span id="s167">[tape ended and new tape began with the following.]</span> <span id="s168">When we stopped you were telling me that you and Norman Carnis, your roommate went and told your Harvard track coach of your decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: Can you expand upon that a little?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: We, I went to see the track coach, Norman Carnis didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Let me rephrase that.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: You went and told your coach who you had been working with at Harvard of your decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes, I told Yacko Macola.</span> <span id="s176">I went to see him and told him that we had decided not to go into the final tryouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: …say that again…</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Well I went to see, to tell my track coach at Harvard, Yacko Macola, that we weren’t going to go into the final tryouts and told him the reason that we had spoken to our religious leader, Rabbi Levy, and that we had decided because of the situation that we were told about that we weren’t going to go to the final tryouts and he was quite disturbed – not disturbed but felt that we should really go ahead and we’ve always wanted to be in the Olympics and he thought we had, that I had a great chance to qualify in two events.</span> <span id="s179">And that we, that I should really try to change my mind about going to the final tryouts but he didn’t persuade us, persuade me rather.</span> <span id="s180">And that was the extent of the discussion with Yacko Macola, the coach.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: Did other colleagues of yours on the track team at Harvard go the Olympics or go to at least the final tryouts?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: None that I know of.</span> <span id="s183">There was no one else that had qualified for the final tryouts from Harvard, except me.</span> <span id="s184">And I had no discussion with them at that time.</span> <span id="s185">We were, I think, having final exams and graduation around June 10th or 12th and I had no discussion with anyone about the final tryouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s186">Q: You were focused on sports; you were focused on your scholarship.</span> <span id="s187">You really weren’t at that point – it doesn’t sound like that focused on being Jewish.</span> <span id="s188">And yet this meeting at your Temple was very compelling to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Well, no, I was focused on being Jewish.</span> <span id="s190">I was focused on being Jewish because I felt loyal and loyalty to Judaism and I had no, we had contact with non-Jews in college and everything but that wasn’t a problem as far as I was concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Let me ask you where you were at the time of the games?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: At the time of the Olympic games I was working at a summer camp as a counselor up in Maine, up in Waterville, Maine.</span> <span id="s193">It was called Cedar Crest Camp.</span> <span id="s194">And I don’t think they had television at that time or they didn’t have it at the camp.</span> <span id="s195">But I remember of course eagerly reading the papers on the results and figuring out the times that they were winning the events in and the distances in the long jump.</span> <span id="s196">So I was following it very carefully but I didn’t, I don’t remember seeing them actually on TV, but I did later on, on the re-runs.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: What about newsreels in the movie houses, anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Well we didn’t go to the movies at camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: The radio?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah, I think we had, I think there was a radio we were listening to&gt; I don’t remember what the time factor was between the events and the time zone in Waterville, Maine.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Do you remember how you felt as you were following the Olympics?</span> <span id="s202">Wistful?</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: Yeah, I was, I was thinking about how it would have been to have been running in those events and now whether I could have been a medal winner and I was thinking in those terms but I didn’t focus as far as actually winning the event at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Were you sorry you weren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">A: I suppose in a way I was because as I say I had been thinking about it for all those years, so I was in a way feeling that if I could have made the team and I thought I could that I would have liked to have been in that Olympic setting.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">Q: Isn’t the Olympics a real dream?</span> <span id="s207">What does it mean to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: Well now that’s the peak of training or one of the peaks, one of the objectives to be in the Olympics as I’ve gone to a lot of the Olympics to see it myself.</span> <span id="s209">In Los Angeles and in Korea and I’m going to the Olympics in Atlanta this summer with my grandchildren and I always watch those track events with great interest.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Did you feel any resentment about the other athletes who chose to compete, especially the Jewish ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: No, I had no feelings about the Jewish athletes that competed.</span> <span id="s212">I didn’t know them number one, but I had no feelings one way or the other about their competing, I mean that was up to them and I had no resentment at all about those that did go.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Do you think the American government should have made more of a stand?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: In retrospect, I certainly do.</span> <span id="s215">I think they should have definitely boycotted.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: I need you to say the American government.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Well as far as the boycott is concerned, I think the American government definitely should have boycotted the Olympics in Berlin just like they boycotted the Russian Olympics and now they would have all the more of the facts than I ever had and I think it was definitely a mistake that they didn’t boycott the Olympics in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Do you think it would have made a difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yes, I think it would have made a great difference to have the American government show their opposition to what was going on over there in the Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s220">I think they made a serious mistake not to boycott it and I know that there was a lot of talk pro and against the, boycotting the Olympics.</span> <span id="s221">But I think this is a result more in retrospect rather than at the time.</span> <span id="s222">But as I think of it now, I definitely think it was a mistake not to boycott it.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Did you feel at all alone in your decision, as you were following the games?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Well I had no recollection particularly of what my feelings were at that time in 1936.</span> <span id="s225">But it wasn’t any great feeling that I had cause once I made up my mind and felt that it should be that I should go or try for the final tryouts, I didn’t lose any sleep over that decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: It’s really hard for me to imagine that you had been training, that this was a real dream of yours and you made this decision for all of the right reasons but that you weren’t a little bit torn apart by it.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No, I don’t, as I remember it, I didn’t, I don’t remember being particularly torn apart.</span> <span id="s228">No, I had a longing and a desire to have been in it, but I didn’t have as I look back on it, I don’t remember having any terrible regrets for having made the decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: Never a second thought?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: Never a second thought on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Now let me ask you a sort of a different question.</span> <span id="s232">I think you made a pretty bold and moral decision, however you want to phrase it in 1936.</span> <span id="s233">Do you think as you look back on the times since then, do you think that that decision impacted the way you live your life or taught you an important lesson or really meant something very special?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">A: Well my decision not to participate in the final tryouts, I don’t think had any great impact on my future one way or the other.</span> <span id="s235">I mean I participate in athletics and as I said, I was pretty lucky to be performing and held the world’s record and Harvard records and was in the Harvard Hall of Fame for athletes and it had no particular impact one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Did it encourage you when there were other tough decisions to take the high road.</span> <span id="s237">Did you learn anything from it?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well no, I don’t think, I mean I felt good that I made the decision.</span> <span id="s239">But I don’t, as I said I don’t think it had any impact as far as my future activities or living or philosophies were concerned.</span> <span id="s240">It had no great impact one way or the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: It’s a long time ago.</span> <span id="s242">Do you ever think back on that period and what you went through at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Yeah, I think back on making that decision and whether I would have on or not – silver or gold or some sort of a medal and every time I go to the Olympics, I’ve been to three of them and I watch, I particularly watch the high hurdles and the long jump and I picture myself as maybe having won a medal on it, an Olympic medal.</span> <span id="s244">But I participated in the Senior Olympics in 1983 in Florida.</span> <span id="s245">Florida Senior Olympics and I won ten medals at that but that was not the real Olympics, that was the Senior Olympics.</span> <span id="s246">So I, you know I’ve won medals in Olympic senior competition.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Since that time you’ve heard and read a lot about the 1936 Olympics and the extent of the pageantry and the celebration and the propaganda and all of this.</span> <span id="s248">Do you think that sports can be separate from politics or that they’re just inextricably linked in situations like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: Well I think sports can be separated from politics.</span> <span id="s250">In a way they should be but it depends on what the separation is.</span> <span id="s251">I mean interference by the government, particularly in sports, I wouldn’t like to see that but this is a, the boycotting is different, I don’t consider that a mixing of sports and politics or a separation.</span> <span id="s252">I mean I think that’s a moral ground and I just think that they should have been boycotted; the U.S. should have boycotted it, not because it’s – there’s separation of those activities.</span> <span id="s253">But I just think they should have just the way they did in the Russian Olympics.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Germany certainly didn’t separate sports and politics in 1936.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: Well I imagine they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Thank you.</span> <span id="s257">I think that’s all my questions but I just want to make sure.</span> <span id="s258">Tell me about how this meeting came about.</span> <span id="s259">Who was there, why they called you in, what the atmosphere was like and what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: Well I remember after the Harvard/Yale track meet, which Carnis and I won six gold medals there was quite a bit of publicity in the newspapers and there was a picture of Carnis and myself in the sport page.</span> <span id="s261">I forget which paper it was, and saying how we’d won six gold medals and I think they called us Damon and Pythias because we were such good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">About three or four days after the track meet, I got a phone call.</span> <span id="s263">I forget what the fellow’s name was but he said he was calling at the request of Rabbi Levy.</span> <span id="s264">And he was on the men’s council of the Temple and he had read about what we did at the Harvard/Yale track meet.</span> <span id="s265">And that he understood we were contenders for the Olympics and he had some important information that he’d like to talk to us about at the request of Rabbi Levy and as I had mentioned, Rabbi Levy was the head of Temple Israel in Boston, a Reform Temple, and he was well-respected all over the United States.</span> <span id="s266">And I was confirmed at Temple Israel and naturally when they asked us to come, or asked me and Norman Carnis, we agreed to come and I think it was set for two or three days later.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: What was going on in your mind, why they had called you over?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: He said something about he wanted to talk to us about the Olympics and so I wasn’t particularly prepared, I didn’t know what they were going to talk about.</span> <span id="s269">Except that something about the Olympics and we went to the boardroom at the Temple Israel on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, that’s where the Temple was at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">And we went there and they explained about the reason they wanted to talk to us was in connection with what was going on in Germany.</span> <span id="s271">And they explained the problems that were going on there with the Nazis and the terrible things that were happening to the Jews there and I don’t remember the exact details of exactly what items they were talking about but it was a terrible picture as I remember it and they discussed it fully and we told them that, I told them that I was preparing to go to the final tryouts.</span> <span id="s272">And that I’d qualified and had to get prepared for it and train again and they explained to me that again it was a terrible situation there in Germany and they suggested that they thought it would be a very good idea to boycott the Olympics and they were quite sure that I’d never regret it.</span> <span id="s273">Even though I had my heard set on being in the Olympics and they suggested that you know it was up to me and Carnis decided what we wanted to do and so I told them that we’d talk it over and let them know what we wanted to do and that was the basic situation as far as that meeting is concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: And they really left it up to you that decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: that’s right, they left the decision entirely up to us.</span> <span id="s276">They didn’t say you had to or they indicated, they recommended strongly that it was the right thing to do and we would never regret making the decision.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: Why was all this so compelling?</span> <span id="s278">You were excited, you were ready to go to the tryouts, the finals and that meeting really turned you around.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: Yes, that meeting really turned us around because we were horrified at what the terrible things that were going on in Germany and we just felt it was the right thing to do and made up our mind to do it after as I say we, I talked it over with my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: After the meeting did you go immediately home?</span> <span id="s281">Did you consult with your parents, or your friends?</span> <span id="s282">What took place next?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Well I was living at the Lowell House at Harvard at the time with Norm Carnis and we went back and talked it over and decided that I’d go home and talk things over with my parents, they lived in Newton.</span> <span id="s284">And I went home and talked it over with them and as I explained, my father called Rabbi Levy to find out if I had the right report.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">And after his discussion with Rabbi Levy, he felt that the rabbi had a complete understanding of the whole situation and he could rely on his judgment and that I should rely on his judgment and he said that you know left it up to me but he strongly recommended that I go along with the suggestion from the rabbi and the men’s committee.</span> <span id="s286">I think the head of the Men’s committee I think it was a fellow named Kimler or something close to it, or Kimmel or Kemla, it’s some name like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Did you follow the trials at Randalls Island?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: Yes, I followed it to see what they were doing and…</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Begin that sentence….</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Yeah, I followed the trials at Randalls Island cause I was you know very much interested but as I say, I had no regrets after deciding not to go into the final tryouts.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: When you were following those tryouts, how were your times compared to the times that qualified people?</span> <span id="s292">Would you have probably gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: I don’t remember the details of the times at that time.</span> <span id="s294">As I recollect now I think I could have made the team at two events – the long jump and the high hurdles.</span> <span id="s295">I’m pretty sure I could have done it in the long jump, I’m not that certain about the high hurdles.</span> <span id="s296">Because it depended on how much I improved at my timing there and really concentrating on that event, but I don’t remember the details particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: Go back for a second.</span> <span id="s298">When you received the certificate from Brundage saying you had qualified for the finals, what was it like getting that letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: I was very pleased but I knew that I had qualified because I won the preliminary events and knew that the winning of those preliminary events would get me into the finial tryouts but I liked the certificate and I was you know very pleased to have it and I framed it and kept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: When you followed the games from the camp in Maine, did your campers follow them with you and did they know that you were in this world class…</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: Yeah, they knew I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Can you say my campers?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Yeah, when I was a Cedar Crest camp during the Olympics in 1936, most of the campers knew I was a good athlete and was material for the Olympics and the year before I was in the Oxford-Cambridge meet and there was quite a bit of publicity and they talked about it when I came back to camp.</span> <span id="s304">So yes, there was quite a bit of talk about the Olympics and whether I could have gotten a medal or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: A more personal way to follow the games.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: After ‘36 you went on to graduate school.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Yes I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Did you, during the war were you in the Army or…</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: Yeah, I was.</span> <span id="s311">I enlisted in the Navy aviation and I was in 1943 I volunteered for the Navy aviation and I was in a naval squadron which at that time was a scouting squadron.</span> <span id="s312">It was Scouting Squadron 31 and I came in as a lieutenant junior grade which is the equivalent to a first lieutenant.</span> <span id="s313">And I came out in 1945 as a lieutenant commander and our…</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Overseas and all?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Our squadron was an anti-submarine squadron and we were patrolling for and escorting ships out of Boston harbor and Portland, Maine harbor.</span> <span id="s316">And after the VE Day we were sent to Norfolk, Virginia and our squadron was being prepared to go out to the Pacific.</span> <span id="s317">And I wasn’t a part of it but I was what they call an air combat intelligence officer.</span> <span id="s318">And then the war ended, while I was in Norfolk and about a year, six months later I guess it was.</span> <span id="s319">So I was in the service in the Navy from ’42 I guess to ’46.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: At what point did you, after ‘36, at what point did you start, when did you start learning about what was unfolding in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: Well I followed the war very carefully, of the campaigns in North Africa and all the different campaigns and was watching it very carefully.</span> <span id="s322">But I wasn’t particularly aware of any more activities in Nazi Germany at that particular time other than what was going on in the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you know about Kristallnacht?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Yeah, I remember reading about that and all the terrible things that were happening there and that revolted me tremendously.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: Did you feel vindicated in your decision?</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: I never looked at it in that vein; I never looked at it in the idea I was vindicated or not vindicated.</span> <span id="s327">Because I felt it was the right thing to do when I made that decision.</span> <span id="s328">I didn’t think it was in any other terms.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">THE END</span></p></body></html>
