Krieger was born in Wojnicz, Poland on February 21, 1917.</span> <span id="s4">He never knew his father, who left Poland for America in 1921.</span> <span id="s5">Nathan was one of six children, and the only one of his family to survive the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s6">When he was twelve years old, he worked as a tailor’s apprentice, and later became a tailor.</span> <span id="s7">He got married in the ghetto(?)</span> <span id="s8">in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">Nathan was interned in Auschwitz from 1943 to 1945.</span> <span id="s10">At the beginning of his internment, he was forced to do hard labor, and due to malnutrition, he had become a Muselmann.</span> <span id="s11">Before he was selected for the crematorium, he was chosen to work in the camp kitchen, peeling potatoes.</span> <span id="s12">A Jewish leader helped him acclimate to new foods, so that he would not get sick.</span> <span id="s13">He then started working in the vasherei (camp laundry).</span> <span id="s14">The rest of his group of 500 were sent to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">After Auschwitz, Nathan went on the Death March from January 18 to April 15 1945 from Poland, through Germany, into Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s16">There were originally between 12,000 and 13,000 prisoners on the march, and only about 100 of them survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">After the war, Nathan was reunited with his wife, who had been in Auschwitz and other camps.</span> <span id="s18">They were in the DP camp in Landsberg.</span> <span id="s19">In 1949, they came to the United States, where Nathan found work.</span> <span id="s20">He started his own mens’ clothing business in 1955.</span> <span id="s21">He lived in New York, and initially built his business in New York.</span> <span id="s22">After that, he commuted to his business near Atlanta, Georgia every week.</span> <span id="s23">In Georgia, Nathan experienced anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s24">He treated his employees well, paying them more than they would make in comparable jobs.</span> <span id="s25">At one point, he experienced a nervous breakdown – according to his doctor, it was because he was too happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Nathan and his wife raised a family in New York.</span> <span id="s27">He believes that the Holocaust could happen again.</span> <span id="s28">He is also concerned about the attitudes of Jewish people in their relationships with others.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Tape 1, Side 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">NK: Lately now I’m getting better already, but in the beginning I was very depressed and I took a book and I started to read, my mind was someplace else, before, when my wife was alive, I used to love to read for hours - all kinds of books.</span> <span id="s31">Mostly I read history books, and about Israel, novels.</span> <span id="s32">Any book that came out about Israel, I was always interested because in my younger days, I was a Zionist.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">WH: What town were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">NK: Wojnicz, 1917.</span> <span id="s35">(Poland).</span></p> <p><span id="s36">WH: After you were liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">NK: In 1945, we came back to Poland, to my town.</span> <span id="s38">I was liberated in Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WH: This card game, you started it in 1946?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">NK: We were with two, three couples in Germany after the war, very close to each other.</span> <span id="s41">And then when we came here, we all came here in 1949, so we continued.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">WH: When you get together, what do you talk about usually?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">NK: No matter what we talk, it comes out, the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s44">But, my wife was with the sisters, there are two sisters, she was with them together in Auschwitz, and I was with the two husbands in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">WH: How long were you there for?</span></p> <p><span id="s46">NK: From 1943 to 1945, in 1944 I was already a Muselmann and I was in [illegible] for the crematorium, and I remember like today that was on my birthday, February 21st, they picked up the 500 people to the crematorium, the Germans, picked [illegible] people to go [illegible] this was just for the outside world, for the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s47">You know, they picked thirty people to peel potatoes in the kitchen, where they used to cook for the Germans.</span> <span id="s48">And I was picked between the thirty people.</span> <span id="s49">I was swollen, and I was tall, and I always kept myself clean, so I looked a very, very healthy guy, but I was all swollen already.</span> <span id="s50">I couldn’t walk, hardly could walk and between those thirty people, when they took us out and brought us in to the kitchen to peel potatoes, they asked who is a tailor, so I was a tailor, and with five other guys or six, I don’t remember how many, and they gave us two pails of hot water to carry from the kitchen to the vasherei (laundry) where you clean the laundry, so my luck was, I came in, the first one to the vasherei (laundry) with the two pails of water and that was my examination as a tailor.</span> <span id="s51">When I came into my vasherei (laundry) I couldn’t believe my eyes what I saw there.</span> <span id="s52">There were five Jewish guys…and I saw bread, and I saw salami, and I saw butter, it was like – I couldn’t believe it!</span> <span id="s53">So he says to me, (the Jewish leader) ‘Do you want to live?’</span> <span id="s54">So I said to him, ‘Of course!</span> <span id="s55">Who doesn’t want to live?”</span> <span id="s56">So he says, ‘If you want to live, you can’t touch any of those things, because once you are going to touch anything, your stomach is not used to food, whoever comes [illegible] salami or, rich soup, and he gets diarrhea and a day later he’s not here anymore.</span> <span id="s57">So if you want to live, and if you want to listen to me,’ he said ‘you’re going to live.’</span> <span id="s58">So I don’t know.</span> <span id="s59">Today I could say I was smart – God gave me the will power.</span> <span id="s60">You know, I listened to him, and I listened to him, so he goes ahead and he takes a potato and he goes outside in the back of that vasherei (laundry) and makes a small fire, and he said, ‘Here is four pieces.’</span> <span id="s61">He cut them in four pieces, burned it, come back inside, I’ll give you black coffee, and he said, ‘every four hours, this is what you have to eat.’</span> <span id="s62">So, he said, ‘I know you are going to be hungry, but your stomach has to get used to food.</span> <span id="s63">Otherwise you’ll never survive’.</span> <span id="s64">So, anyhow, God was good to me.</span> <span id="s65">He gave me the will power and I listened to him.</span> <span id="s66">And then he started, he gave me a piece of bread, you know, and I toasted it, and black coffee, and after two, three days I ate that stuff he started to give me and I would say within two, three weeks, I was already a mensch… so I walked over to him and I said to all the five guys, ‘I don’t want you to work, I’m going to do all the cleaning, I’m going to do all the fixing, all the ironing.</span> <span id="s67">I don’t want you to work.</span> <span id="s68">I’m going to do the work.</span> <span id="s69">I’m strong and I’m going to do the work for all five of you.”</span> <span id="s70">He says, ‘Why are you doing this?</span> <span id="s71">I said, ‘The reason I’m doing this is because if you are going to send me out from here, I’m finished I’ll never make it.</span> <span id="s72">If I was outside [illegible] better than anybody else, and young, as long the war wouldn’t last forever, maybe I’ll have a chance to survive.</span> <span id="s73">Because I didn’t think that there’s anything better exist than what was outside.</span> <span id="s74">So, he looks at me, and looks at me, and he says, ‘I happen to like you.’</span> <span id="s75">I said, ‘Well, if you happen to like me,’ I said, ‘when I came in you ask me I should listen to you,’ so I said to him, ‘how about if I would beg and plead with you, you should listen to me trying to help me out, and see that I should remain here, or whatever.’</span></p> <p><span id="s76">WH: Why were you worried that they’d ask you to leave?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">NK: Because every four weeks they had to change that person, just one, the other five, they were steady.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">WH: This man was a wonderful man from Czechoslovakia and he went to the head of the SS who was in charge in the kitchen and he said they have a lot of work and they need a sixth man, a steady man, in the vasherei (laundry) there…and he pleaded with them, and everything, and he said, ‘He is a very fine man, and he knows everything, and he has very good hands, and he’s a good tailor.’</span> <span id="s79">And somehow he got me in there as a steady sixth man.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: Why do you think he liked you?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">NK: I think, because he saw, whatever he told me to do, I listened to him.</span> <span id="s82">It wasn’t, believe it or not, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s83">You know, how could I explain, when you come in hungry, I was there already over a year and a half in Auschwitz, so I don’t have to tell you how hungry I was, and you coming into a place, where, like…</span></p> <p><span id="s84">WH: Like a palace.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">NK: Like hell and heaven.</span> <span id="s86">Outside was hell, and this was heaven, I just couldn’t believe that something like this existed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s87">That was Buna.</span> <span id="s88">They that came what I was, was Buna[?]</span> <span id="s89">.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">WH: What were you doing in the camp before you wound up there?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">NK: Very hard labor.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">WH: What were you able to do to try to make it through that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">NK: Well, because I’ll tell you why.</span> <span id="s94">I made up my mind, that whatever I’m going to get, to eat.</span> <span id="s95">There were people when they got a piece of bread in the morning, they changed it for soup, or they changed it you know for, they should, more, let’s say that small piece of bread what they give you, that was nothing.</span> <span id="s96">Some people tried to eat a half and put the other half away so somebody used to steal it.</span> <span id="s97">I made up my mind, whatever I’m going to get, I’m going to finish, and somehow, I had the will power in me to say to myself, ‘You are hungry, but nothing is going to help you, that if you are going to think about food, the only thing that those people, what they were talking about the food the whole day, they didn’t survive too long.</span> <span id="s98">Because that’s all that was on their mind is food, because everybody was starving to death.</span> <span id="s99">So, whatever they gave me, they gave me in the morning a piece of bread with the black coffee, I finished it.</span> <span id="s100">I said, ‘I wouldn’t get anything until 12 o’clock, you know, a little bit of soup.</span> <span id="s101">It came, to a little soup, to some people were to be the last ones to get a little bit, take a soup – you know, I mean, they shouldn’t be just water from the top, so if the Germans used to see somebody was in the front, they went to the back, they hit them, they killed people.</span> <span id="s102">So I said, ‘[illegible] never die like this [illegible] young to go [illegible] say, [illegible] wherever I was, in the middle or the front, or in the back [illegible] and, when they asked to work, I never, ever tired, you know what I mean, to – not to work and the SS should see and get hit for this I said ‘As long as I’m going to have the strength, I’m going to do what I was told to do, and then whatever will be will be’.</span> <span id="s103">And, that was - I did it until February, and then my luck, probably, was that I was picked between the thirty people, because all the others, the 470 went to the crematorium.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: Was your father a tailor?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">NK: No.</span> <span id="s106">I never knew my father.</span> <span id="s107">My father left Poland when I was 4 years old.</span> <span id="s108">So I never knew my father.</span> <span id="s109">He came to America.</span> <span id="s110">And he died here in 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">WH: And your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">NK: My mother was with us, a mother and children; he was going to send for us.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: Were you the oldest?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NK: I was the sixth.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">WH: How many of them made it through the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">NK: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: You’re the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">NK: I’m the only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: What do you think about, when you think about that?</span> <span id="s120">What goes through your mind?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">NK: What shall I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">WH: Do you find yourself asking, how it was that you’re the only one?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">NK: I always ask that question, I have a lot of questions, but I can’t give myself an answer.</span> <span id="s124">[long pause] The best answer [illegible] I could come out with, probably, God wanted to – families should continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">WH: After the war, you were liberated where?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">NK: Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s127">I walked from January 18th until April 15th without food, without shoes, without anything - from Poland, into Germany, from Germany into Czechoslovakia - Death March.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: How many of you made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">NK: I think we went out by 12,000 to 13,000, maybe a hundred.</span> <span id="s130">Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">WH: Maybe a hundred made it?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">WH: Do you still have contact with any of those people who were on that march?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">NK: I have.</span> <span id="s135">I just came back from Toronto.</span> <span id="s136">Which, this is another story.</span> <span id="s137">You see what I have here?</span> <span id="s138">161341.</span> <span id="s139">[name/inaudible] is 161342.</span> <span id="s140">We were together, my name is Krieger, and his name is Kitchler.</span> <span id="s141">We were together from the beginning until the end of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">WH: And after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">NK: After the war…I got married in the Ghetto in 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">WH: Were you reunited with your wife after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NK: After the war.</span> <span id="s146">She was in Auschwitz and all kinds of camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">WH: I just want to understand this better.</span> <span id="s148">You had a factory down there (Georgia), but you lived where?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">NK: I lived up here.</span> <span id="s150">But I start to teach people how to make money.</span> <span id="s151">Took over a factory – we made 800 coats.</span> <span id="s152">And in the same factory, I made 3,000, four dollars an hour was the top, and all of a sudden people start to make in my factory, five, six dollars an hour, everybody wanted to leave them and come to work for me.</span> <span id="s153">Because I am a tailor, and I had a good business in New York, and I adopted the American way very fast.</span> <span id="s154">You know.</span> <span id="s155">And I showed it.</span> <span id="s156">I was teaching them.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">WH: In Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">NK: 35 miles from Atlanta</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WH: So, this letter, ‘Go home Jew boy’ was something that was sent to you at the factory?</span> <span id="s160">Where were you when it came?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">NK: When I came Monday morning, opened up the mail, and I see a letter, ‘Jew boy go home.’</span> <span id="s162">I went to the sheriff, I went to the Chief of Police, I went to the mayor, because we bought there eight acres of land, we wanted to build a factory, and the town put in over $100,000 you know, developing the land, putting in sewers and they realized, you know what I mean, that if I’ll build up a factory and I’ll increase production, I’ll take away a lot of help from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">WH: What was the population of Buchanan?</span></p> <p><span id="s164">NK: Very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">WH: You don’t know who sent the letter?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">NK: No.</span> <span id="s167">The Ku Klux Klan came to me and they said to me that I’m going to get better protection than President Reagan gets.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">WH: If what?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">NK: If I stay, I shouldn’t close down.</span> <span id="s170">So I said, ‘I lived under the gun already for twenty years.</span> <span id="s171">They said that I was in the [illegible] and that they are going have 24 hours a guard there to watch me.’</span> <span id="s172">So I said, ‘I’m going to be afraid to go out?</span> <span id="s173">You know, I used to love nature, used to go out and take the car, you know, I was finished by 4:30; 5:00 I had nothing what to do.</span> <span id="s174">There was no place where to go to eat, you know, and you know if I wanted to have a kosher meal, I had to take the car and go to Atlanta, which I had all the time in the world, but I didn’t want to drive back at night.</span> <span id="s175">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s176">By myself.</span> <span id="s177">Because those trailers, when they went there, you know, I thought that they are going to pick up my car!</span></p> <p><span id="s178">WH: Did you consider staying when they offered you this protection?</span></p> <p><span id="s179">NK: No, no.</span> <span id="s180">Because my wife has a telephone call, ‘If you husband would show his face once more in Georgia, he’s going to blow his head off.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: And you knew that these were the people who had these – [inaudible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">NK: I assumed.</span> <span id="s183">What else?</span> <span id="s184">That is, everybody was happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">WH: Why didn’t you continue paying them the regular minimum wage?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">NK: Because I needed production – and I put them, instead of time work, I put them with piece work.</span> <span id="s187">It was good for them, and it was good for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">WH: So the other coat manufacturers?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">NK: They don’t have [inaudible] like me.</span> <span id="s190">Those were big times, they run the business like they used to run, you know, twenty, thirty, forty years ago because it’s very hard to get jobs there you understand?</span> <span id="s191">There’s very little industry there.</span> <span id="s192">It’s a different America there.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">WH: They couldn’t raise the wages because they couldn’t raise the production?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">NK: They didn’t want it – in order to – I didn’t raise the wages, I showed people how to make money.</span> <span id="s195">I have the know-how, I know every operation, I know every machine, not too many guys around in America like me, because I had my business, and I was interested, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s196">I wanted to know everything.</span> <span id="s197">I even had foremen and managers but those foremen and managers knew what I had to do, what has to be done; otherwise, I’m no better than them.</span> <span id="s198">I told my managers I must have 600 coats a day, and good ones, by the end of the day, I can’t ship excuses.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">WH: Were you in Atlanta then?</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NK: In 1981.</span> <span id="s201">I never lived there.</span> <span id="s202">I went there Monday morning by plane, and I came back Thursday afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">WH: And you stayed in Buchanan in a hotel?</span></p> <p><span id="s204">NK: Yes.</span> <span id="s205">And that’s what bothered them.</span> <span id="s206">Because I was there only for two, three days and I set up the factory, and everything, like a clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">WH: You have to watch over a business?</span></p> <p><span id="s208">NK: You have to know how to set up a business.</span> <span id="s209">You have to know how to talk to people, you have to prove yourself that you are a straight man, and an honest man, that I was always.</span> <span id="s210">My biggest problem was, when I came to this country, and after two years, I knew a little bit of English.</span> <span id="s211">I became a foreman, and then I wanted to go into the business for myself.</span> <span id="s212">And then they scared me, they said, ‘Clothing business is a whore business.’</span> <span id="s213">I said, ‘I lived through concentration camp,’ I said, ‘I don’t want to become a whore.</span> <span id="s214">(short laugh) - I wasn’t there and I don’t want to become a whore in America.’</span> <span id="s215">I’m making a good living, I was happy, you know, I made nice money.</span> <span id="s216">I was a very, I adopted the American system very fast.</span> <span id="s217">Then I had to plead with the people and they explained to me why a person has to be a whore to be in the clothing business.</span> <span id="s218">They tried to explain to me, there are manufacturers and contractors, they give them a dollar more, so they put away – I said ‘I’m going to try to be a mensch and when I promise something, I deliver.’</span> <span id="s219">That was my policy all my life.</span> <span id="s220">And if I can’t deliver, I didn’t promise.</span> <span id="s221">And, thank God, I did well by being mensch.</span> <span id="s222">And that the approach I had over there, when I sat down with a person, I was talking to him; I knew what the person could do.</span> <span id="s223">That person didn’t know.</span> <span id="s224">So I used to tell him, ‘What do you have to lose?</span> <span id="s225">Why don’t you do piece work?</span> <span id="s226">You could only make more money.’</span> <span id="s227">I said, ‘Trust me.</span> <span id="s228">If you’ll make more money it’s yours.</span> <span id="s229">If you make less you’ll get the same rate.</span> <span id="s230">What do you have to lose?’</span> <span id="s231">And I said, ‘If you’re ashamed I should show you now to do it,’ I said, ‘4:30, when everybody will go home, I’ll sit down with you and I’ll show it to you.”</span> <span id="s232">And I had to do it with the five, six, eight people.</span> <span id="s233">Then, those eight people, they did the rest of the job for me already because they went around telling the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WH: How many people were employed in that factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">KN: About 180.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">WH: And they all lost their jobs and they had nothing?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">NK: (indicates yes).</span></p> <p><span id="s238">WH: So they must have been sad.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">NK: And how!</span> <span id="s240">That’s the reason the mayor, the chief of police, the sheriff, everybody pleaded with me.</span> <span id="s241">You know.</span> <span id="s242">And I tried to tell you, I never knew who, that all the women that worked for me, their husbands were Ku Klux Klan!</span> <span id="s243">But they came home and they said, you know they came home with money, and they came home, ‘He’s a Jew from New York,’ you know, because over there, a Jew from New York, if you’re a New Yorker, you’re no good!</span> <span id="s244">But if you are a Jew on top of it, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s245">But they used to come with, ‘He’s a very nice man.</span> <span id="s246">He’s a very nice man, he shows people, he sits down, and he knows everything.</span> <span id="s247">And when he says something, he keeps his word.’</span> <span id="s248">And I took a woman, made her a manager, I took a guy, and I used to help out the boys.</span> <span id="s249">The school was across the street so the parents used to work for me, ‘Maybe you’ll take the boy, you know, to come, he needs a few dollars to make,’ so instead to take a guy to clean, a steady guy, I used to take these boys from schools.</span> <span id="s250">They used to clean the factory and everything.</span> <span id="s251">Once you make money, you could be a gentleman.</span> <span id="s252">You could be a hero.</span> <span id="s253">You throw away $50 a week, which didn’t mean anything; they didn’t know what to do for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">You know those people.</span> <span id="s255">And the boys used to come to clean my car to fix my car for free.</span> <span id="s256">And they were happy because here the work was hard.</span> <span id="s257">The boy came in, I opened up the soda machine, they used to take a soda, you know, or take this, and I trusted them.</span> <span id="s258">Once you put the trust in people, they wouldn’t have the heart to steal, you know.</span> <span id="s259">So, if the parents worked for me, I knew I could give the boys the key.</span> <span id="s260">When they finished, they locked the factory, and the next morning, I came and everything was clean.</span> <span id="s261">Those kids were happy, you know.</span> <span id="s262">I had a keen understanding of human nature.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">WH: What year did you come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">NK: 1949, Marine Shark.</span> <span id="s265">That was the last luxury ship.</span> <span id="s266">My wife was pregnant.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">WH: How did you get the affidavit?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">NK: HIAS, from the Joint.</span> <span id="s269">My wife had a sister here so we landed here in New York.</span> <span id="s270">I came here Thursday, Monday I went to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">WH: Do you remember what it was like?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">NK: I remember Monday I bought the Forwards and I saw ‘Operators Wanted’ and they needed an operator on Kosciusko Street.</span> <span id="s273">I took the train, and I see a stop, Kosciusko Street.</span> <span id="s274">That’s it.</span> <span id="s275">What I didn’t know was that I had to walk about forty blocks to get to that number, but I learned.</span> <span id="s276">On the way back, I didn’t go that way.</span> <span id="s277">The way back already, I asked, and I did it right.</span> <span id="s278">By Friday, I brought home a check already, I think $78.00.</span> <span id="s279">I was a hero.</span> <span id="s280">That was a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">WH: You were an operator in a regular factory?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">NK: Yes, ladies clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">WH: Did you think of going to Israel at any time after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">NK: Yes I did.</span> <span id="s285">My brother-in-law said to me, ‘If you’re going to go to Israel, it’s going to be very tough for you to come to America [illegible].</span> <span id="s286">If you’ll come to America, from here you could go any place you want.’</span> <span id="s287">So….</span> <span id="s288">.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">WH: You said you worked for two years and then you wanted to go into business for yourself, right?</span> <span id="s290">Did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">NK: I went into business, 1955.</span> <span id="s292">I went into business, and then what happened is, I had the nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s293">So I went to my doctor and he said to me, ‘You know, people get a nervous breakdown because business is bad.’</span> <span id="s294">I met a Russian guy, and he tested me, and I came in, and before he took me in, he’s supposed to put in $12,000, I put in five and seven thousand dollars for payroll.</span> <span id="s295">I was there a week, he said, ‘You don’t have to put in money for payroll.’</span> <span id="s296">And it started to improve, because I had the, what happened, the delegate from the union liked me very much, and he wanted me, to train me, because they made me for a chairman.</span> <span id="s297">I wasn’t able to speak even English so I became a chairman, because I used to help out the people in the factory.</span> <span id="s298">Somebody made a mistake, and I knew how to run over, [inaudible] and all the people say that, ‘This is a nice man.</span> <span id="s299">This is what we want.</span> <span id="s300">He should be a chairman.’</span> <span id="s301">So they used to tell me, ‘Okay if I’m going to groom you, you’re going be a big union man.’</span> <span id="s302">So I said, ‘Who wants to be a union man?</span> <span id="s303">I want to be in business.</span> <span id="s304">I don’t want to be a union man.’</span> <span id="s305">So he put me in the business, but for happiness, I got a nervous breakdown.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">WH: What do you mean, ‘for happiness’?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">NK: I wanted a partner, so I could be in business.</span> <span id="s308">It was a Russian guy, and I was there for four weeks.</span> <span id="s309">Whatever I promised, I did at(?)</span> <span id="s310">times as much.</span> <span id="s311">And it came Friday, he says to me, ‘Well, don’t bring in money for payroll, I have plenty of money.’</span> <span id="s312">He said, ‘with the profits, you are going, we are going make plenty of profits,’ He said he’s going stay a few years because he wants to retire.</span> <span id="s313">And I couldn’t believe it, what happened to me.</span> <span id="s314">You know, all of a sudden, you know, everything – I was young, strong, and everything - and all of the sudden I get up in the morning, I go to sleep, and I can’t sleep.</span> <span id="s315">I didn’t sleep a whole night, to get up in the morning, I start to cry.</span> <span id="s316">My wife was in the country.</span> <span id="s317">I called up my friend, and I ask him, ‘Bring me out to the country.’</span> <span id="s318">I came out there, and I was sitting there for three days crying.</span> <span id="s319">Monday morning, we took a taxi, we came back, my wife came back with the kids, and we went to the doctor.</span> <span id="s320">I told the doctor the story, and he says to my wife, ‘He got a nervous breakdown from happiness.’</span> <span id="s321">He said, ‘People get a nervous breakdown from tsuris (concerns/worries.)</span> <span id="s322">And there are people who get a nervous breakdown from happiness.’</span> <span id="s323">He says, ‘You want to be happy the way you were?’</span> <span id="s324">I said, ‘Of course I want to be!’</span> <span id="s325">He said, ‘Get out of business.’</span> <span id="s326">Tape 1, Side 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">NK: I didn’t even think twice.</span> <span id="s328">I called up that delegate, and I told him.</span> <span id="s329">He called down my partner and he says, ‘What are you doing?</span> <span id="s330">Why don’t you go and rest up?</span> <span id="s331">Feel better.</span> <span id="s332">Don’t worry about it.</span> <span id="s333">Everything is okay.</span> <span id="s334">You’ll get paid.’</span> <span id="s335">I said, ‘No, no, no.</span> <span id="s336">I don’t want to be sick.’</span> <span id="s337">And he said, ‘I have two children, and I was happy and I live nicely, I made a nice living.’</span> <span id="s338">And I said, ‘I don’t want it.’</span> <span id="s339">He said, ‘What do you want me to do?’</span> <span id="s340">I said, ‘Give me back my money.’</span> <span id="s341">He said, ‘I’ll give you back the money right now, but don’t do that.’</span> <span id="s342">He said, ‘I’m happy with you.’</span> <span id="s343">He was pleading with me.</span> <span id="s344">But I didn’t want to hear about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">WH: What do you think really happened?</span> <span id="s346">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NK: That’s what the doctor said.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">WH: And you believed him?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">NK: I believed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">WH: Why did you believe him?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">NK: Because I wanted to be what I was before.</span> <span id="s352">You know, I was home, I couldn’t eat, I was crying.</span> <span id="s353">I couldn’t eat.</span> <span id="s354">I used to eat, you know, (laughs).</span></p> <p><span id="s355">WH: Maybe then all the pressure that came from the war suddenly had an opportunity to come to the surface.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">NK: It came like out of nowhere.</span> <span id="s357">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s358">I want to sleep; I couldn’t all night, can’t eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">WH: This doctor was not a psychiatrist, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s360">NK: No, a medical doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">WH: Did you ever go see a psychiatrist, social worker?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">NK: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">WH: Do you believe in them?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">NK: No.</span> <span id="s365">To me they all look like they need psychiatrist (short laugh).</span> <span id="s366">And I’ll tell you one thing.</span> <span id="s367">Once, I’m the type of a guy, if I make a decision, I live with my decision.</span> <span id="s368">Good or bad.</span> <span id="s369">I make the decision, and I’m not going to go ahead and cry over spilled water.</span> <span id="s370">But I felt better, it was only a week or two and then my old boss heard that what happened to me, he calls me up and he says, ‘You want to come back to work?’</span> <span id="s371">And I was the happiest one.</span> <span id="s372">And I said to him, ‘You know, I’m not feeling so well, I can’t produce as much as before.’</span> <span id="s373">He said, ‘But I want piece work [inaudible].’</span> <span id="s374">Came in, I worked a few weeks, I was a new person.</span> <span id="s375">But I couldn’t sit any more.</span> <span id="s376">Once I felt better, I said to myself, there is a better life out there.</span> <span id="s377">There’s more money to be made there.</span> <span id="s378">But this time, maybe, I’m going to do it a different way.</span> <span id="s379">I’m going to ask doctors, I’m going ask how to, you know, conduct myself, not to get, you know, so overwhelmed with it, you know what I mean, so I said after a while, I want to go into business.</span> <span id="s380">So he said, ‘If you’ll take my son-in-law in, we’ll find another business.’</span> <span id="s381">So I took his son-in-law, for a partner, and a few months later I was back in business.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">WH: Weren’t you afraid that the same thing would happen again?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">NK: I was afraid, very much.</span> <span id="s384">But I also had my mind made up, that I’ll never be happy for the rest of my life if I’m going to remain a worker, because I have the knowledge, I have the know-how.</span> <span id="s385">You know, I had a way of dealing with people.</span> <span id="s386">I was say, a straight person, an honest person, with whom I dealt, and whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">WH: Do you see that you learned anything [illegible] with people as a result of the experiences in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">NK: [illegible] don’t what to answer [illegible] would say, I came out I was a different, I mean, I was young when I went in you know, but I would say one thing, that’s more in my nature or the more the way I was brought up, you know, the way you know, I actually, you know I [inaudible]…as a kid, I was twelve years old I went to work.</span> <span id="s389">My mother gave me away for four years as a tailor.</span> <span id="s390">And I really didn’t have anybody to tell me what to do, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s391">Parents to overlook, you know, or whatever, because one child raised the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">WH: You didn’t have your mother, or father, so what do you think it is?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">NK: You were brought up to listen to your mother, you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s394">Whatever mother said, that went.</span> <span id="s395">You know, and I actually, I developed my life on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">WH: When you make a decision, do you make it quickly or do you like to think it over?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">NK: I like to think it over, or ask somebody, or consult with somebody, which I feel knows more than I do, he’s more experienced in the field.’</span></p> <p><span id="s398">WH: Are you an optimist?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">WH: So now, even after you lost your wife, do you feel that things will get back to normal eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s401">NK: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">WH: That’s too much.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">NK: I hope, you know that things are going to get better.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">WH: Do you think that today the generation has a different attitude toward Jews than before?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">NK: I think that they have better than the parents, the grandparents, you know, because that was poured into the, you know, anti-Semitism, you now, this and that.</span> <span id="s406">To me, I’m hoping that it is because I would like to see a better world for my children, for my grandchildren, you know, so I always like to look at the bright side.</span> <span id="s407">If I’m not sure with something, I say, ‘Let me think that they are better’.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">WH: Do you think that what happened in Europe could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s409">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">NK: Because if things are going to get bad here, economically, there go the shvartzes (blacks).</span> <span id="s412">Give them a little bit of freedom, take all the gentiles, which they look at the Jews, the way they live, and it bothers me a lot about our Jews.</span> <span id="s413">The way they conduct themselves, you know.</span> <span id="s414">I’m sitting in a shul (synagogue), and listening you know, to those [inaudible].</span> <span id="s415">Young Israel, those landlords, the way they talk, and the way everything, it’s terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">WH: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s417">NK: No steam.</span> <span id="s418">No hot water.</span> <span id="s419">Who gives a damn about them [inaudible]?</span> <span id="s420">I believe one thing, if you buy a house, and if you’re a landlord, and if you’re smart enough to buy a house, people should get service.</span> <span id="s421">And if not, don’t get into it.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">WH: You think that they are just creating anti-Semitism?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">NK: Yes.</span> <span id="s424">Absolutely and it really bothers me, because you know, there has to be a reason why people hate us so much.</span> <span id="s425">I understand people hate us because we are [inaudible] a little bit above them; we are a little bit smarter.</span> <span id="s426">We are a little bit – I lived through that when I came here with our own Jews.</span> <span id="s427">But they came, you know, before me, and here’s the ‘greeners’ (immigrants)…look at him!’</span> <span id="s428">And I go to the shop, and I have the American boys working for me, they always look at the way he’s doing, what he’s doing, and I overheard once, and I walked over to him and I said, ‘Let me ask you a question.</span> <span id="s429">You were here on that shop before me.</span> <span id="s430">Why didn’t you buy [inaudible]?</span> <span id="s431">You didn’t want to have the headache, correct?</span> <span id="s432">If you don’t want to have the headache, you’re happy the way you’re sitting, and you’re working and this way you get a good dollar and this one get, so I says, ‘Why do you angry at me?</span> <span id="s433">You were here before me.’</span> <span id="s434">‘Yah, but I don’t know what you know!’</span> <span id="s435">So I say, ‘So, what do you want?</span> <span id="s436">I envy you too.’</span> <span id="s437">I said, ‘I wish I would know the language the way you know it.’</span> <span id="s438">I said, ‘If I would know the language then before, I wouldn’t sit the way I’m sitting here.</span> <span id="s439">I go still a step higher and a step higher but because of the language’, I said, ‘I have to hold myself down to the level where I feel I could do the best to my ability.’</span> <span id="s440">And this is the reason that scares me and worries me.</span> <span id="s441">You know, reading the papers and what’s going on with the whiteheads, with the Ku Klux Klan, and with this one, and with the other one.</span> <span id="s442">Germany was a wonderful country.</span> <span id="s443">I remember growing up, that everybody from Poland went to Germany to make money, you know the story, we have Palestine in Deutschland.</span> <span id="s444">The German Jews, they lived like kings there and everything.</span> <span id="s445">They were good citizens and they were nice people, you know.</span> <span id="s446">They were more educated than the Polish Jews, or the Hungarian Jews, or the Czechoslovakian Jews.</span> <span id="s447">Really, they were on a higher level and they were, as people, they were nicer people.</span> <span id="s448">And there wasn’t any reason; you know what I mean, the way they conduct themselves, you know, that something like this should happen.</span> <span id="s449">Do you understand the comparison I’m trying to make?</span> <span id="s450">I’m trying to make?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">WH: That it could happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NK : That the German Jewish people, were much, I wouldn’t say much nicer, they were the, beautiful, I mean, I can’t say a bad word, because American Jewry, they come, they help me, you know, I mean, whenever, if not the Joint, and not the HIAS, I wouldn’t be here and wouldn’t be able to live and bring up children, they should live the way they live, and everything, I don’t mean to criticize, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s453">The American Jews, or America, when I daven (pray) every morning, I say every morning, ‘God Bless America’.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">WH: Yes, but?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">NK: But you ask me a question, and I see the way some of the American Jews, the way they conduct themselves, comparing to the German Jews, the way they were for Germany, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s456">Before Hitler came up.</span> <span id="s457">They were much nicer you know what I mean, for Germany, than our Jews are for America.</span> <span id="s458">And that could bring another Holocaust or disaster, or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s459">WH: You mean, when they don’t supply the steam or heat to the shvartzes, what they’re really saying is, ‘They’re not Jewish, so who cares about them?’</span> <span id="s460">It’s not that they’re shvartzes, but that they’re not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">NK: [illegible] you know, their policy is, with the [illegible] could do anything you want, [illegible].</span></p> <p><span id="s462">WH: [illegible] you [inaudible] you warn [illegible] some [illegible] [inaudible], and you wanted to stop this threat of anti-Semitism in America.</span> <span id="s463">What would you do?</span> <span id="s464">What do you think we have to do as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">NK: To conduct themselves like human beings, like people.</span> <span id="s466">Know to respect the next person, whoever that person is.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">WH: You were in shul (synagogue) yesterday, and I thought about the Rabbi’s speech, about stealing exams, also creates anti-Semitism.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">NK: I was.</span> <span id="s469">Shall I tell you something?</span> <span id="s470">I was heartbroken to listen to that.</span> <span id="s471">You know?</span> <span id="s472">It’s really a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s473">And the yeshivas, you know, we should be – teaching other values and everything.</span> <span id="s474">And that, that what bothers me.</span> <span id="s475">Because, I hate to use the word, that the Hassidim, they worse than this and that, but mostly, of those very orthodox, very extreme people, that they’re policy is, ‘It’s me’, and everything else, the hell with it.</span> <span id="s476">You know, and the clique, what [inaudible] one will do for the other one.</span> <span id="s477">But they will find a way of, I would say, allow them to steal from a poor tenant, or from a businessman, or from a next, you know, they are going go into a deal right away to get your money.</span> <span id="s478">Not to go into a deal to create a business, and to make money but how to get out the money from the next guy without thinking, [inaudible] whatever they sit and pray every day, you know, doesn’t mean anything, because somehow, they’ll find a loophole, you know what I mean, that you are allowed.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">WH: What about the way they act with each other?</span> <span id="s480">Do you think they act nice to each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">NK: I don’t think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">WH: So you see that when they find the excuse to deal this way with the goyim (non-Jews), they eventually extend it to themselves?</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NK: Themselves too, the problem with them is, that their upbringing, that derekh eretz (respect), that they didn’t grow up, that you had to fight for a piece of bread, that you went to bed hungry, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s484">I’m not talking concentration camps.</span> <span id="s485">I’m talking before the war.</span> <span id="s486">I think a person becomes a better person if he grows up, you know, if he has to earn every little thing what he has instead of it to be handed to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">WH: And you did, I mean, to work for yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">NK: I started up all my life from scratch every place I went.</span> <span id="s489">And, I started up many times in life.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">WH: At your stage in life, you said it was 1982, right, you went in again (in business)?”</span></p> <p><span id="s491">NK: I was in business for 22 years manufacture men’s clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">WH: Did you find that the survivors in the business helped each other out?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">NK: I did, not friends necessarily, whoever - somebody else, or somebody friend told me he has an uncle or this or family needs a job, I said, ‘Send him over!’</span> <span id="s494">And I used to teach him, and give him a break.</span> <span id="s495">Why not?</span> <span id="s496">I felt God was good to me you know, I accomplished something and if I could help somebody, it was my biggest pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">WH: When you think of how you survived the war, what do you think it was due to?</span> <span id="s498">What do you think was responsible for you being able to make it through?</span></p> <p><span id="s499">NK: I would say luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">WH: Would you say only luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">NK: No, I didn’t do anything different than I was asked to do.</span> <span id="s502">And when I was asked to go to work, I went.</span> <span id="s503">I didn’t want to hide and then get hit, you know, get killed because they called me – whatever food they gave me, I finished, I ate, and in my mind I think I was lucky that I could make up my mind, seven o’clock in the morning, whenever I got a piece of bread, that until twelve o’clock, no matter how much I’m going to think about it, it’s not going to help me.</span> <span id="s504">I’m not going to get it.</span> <span id="s505">So, by twelve o’clock I’ll have a little bit of soup, and then I knew, we’ll come home by six o’clock, we’ll have another soup.</span> <span id="s506">And I tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s507">WH: Did you find that people helped each other in the camps, did better than people who didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s508">NK: I don’t think so, everybody was looking to survive.</span> <span id="s509">You have to understand that.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">WH: In business, you were in what part of the clothing business?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">NK: I was a contractor.</span> <span id="s512">I set up my factory in East New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">WH: You were in it for 22 years, and then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">NK: The neighborhood started to get bad.</span> <span id="s515">They killed the grocery next to my factory.</span> <span id="s516">My son read it in the paper and he called me up, and he says, ‘Daddy, I want you out of there!</span> <span id="s517">I don’t want to get a phone call.</span> <span id="s518">Come pick up your father.’</span> <span id="s519">Which I said, I have nothing to worry about, because they all were watching me, when I went down, it was dark, and they wouldn’t let me go down by myself.</span> <span id="s520">I always had people who would work for me, to go, they went down until I went into the car and drove away on Atlantic Avenue and Jerome.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">WH: That was what year you closed the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">NK: 1980.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">WH: Did you find that in business, here in America, that you had to be tough to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s524">NK: I knew my business.</span> <span id="s525">I never had a problem with people, because people used to come into work, they used to come in for a job.</span> <span id="s526">I said, ‘If you want to work, this is the place for you.</span> <span id="s527">You want to come in two, three days and the next time call up I’m sick, and get the check Thursday, and don’t show up on Friday.’</span> <span id="s528">I said to one guy once, I said ‘four days I’m working for you.</span> <span id="s529">Even I’m the boss’.</span> <span id="s530">But the fifth day, I said, ‘It’s mine.</span> <span id="s531">And if you take the check on Thursday, and you don’t show up on Friday’, I said, ‘If you’re not interested in me, I’m not interested in you.</span> <span id="s532">It’s piece work and everybody needs the next guy.’</span></p> <p><span id="s533">WH: When you came here, did you establish, did you have connections right away with people from the war?</span> <span id="s534">In the first years when you came to this country, did you get together with people who were also what they call ‘greener’?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">NK: Yes.</span> <span id="s536">We used to go out on Eastern Parkway.</span> <span id="s537">That was the gathering on Pitkin Avenue in those days.</span> <span id="s538">We used to live in East New York.</span> <span id="s539">And all the refugees used to meet.</span> <span id="s540">Marching with the carriages, with the kids, because the shopping center was Pitkin Avenue, that time there were very good stores and movie theatres, and everything.</span> <span id="s541">Then we used to go Eastern Parkway, which was already the better part, we used to sit on the benches, the parks there and everything, Crown Heights part.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">WH: What was life like then?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">NK: Well, I’ve always had a group, we were together, and those days when was a good movie, you know, we [illegible], our son was born we would never leave our son with a babysitter.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">WH: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">NK: First of all, who could spend the money?</span> <span id="s546">So either my wife used to go with her friends, or I used to go with, you know, with the men to movies or whatever, because everybody was the same way.</span> <span id="s547">You know, there was one child, and then came another child, and those days we didn’t have babysitters.</span> <span id="s548">First of all, the money part, second of all, nobody was even thinking to leave the kids.</span> <span id="s549">You left there, you had a bar mitzvah, or you had something.</span> <span id="s550">A friend came over and watched your children.</span> <span id="s551">And when they had, we went to them, to watch their children.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">WH: That’s lost today.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">NK: That’s history.</span> <span id="s554">It’s a different world now.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">WH: But didn’t that world mean that you were closer because then you knew about each other’s children more?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">NK: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">WH: It meant that it kept you closer.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">NK: We kept together, because somehow it was like a family because, you know, and we were very close.</span> <span id="s559">We used to go there for suppers to them, they used to come for suppers to us, and we got together to play cards, we were young, we always had, first we had the meal and then we sat down and we talked for an hour, or whatever, and then we sat down and we played cards, and – or went to a show.</span> <span id="s560">You know, used to go to the Jewish theatre.</span> <span id="s561">We loved it.</span> <span id="s562">We enjoyed it very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">You see you have to understand one thing.</span> <span id="s564">We enjoyed it I think more than anybody else, because coming out from the camps, you know, I thought what’s going to happen with the Jewish nations.</span> <span id="s565">There were no children.</span> <span id="s566">Where we talked, they lost the whole family, when we got together in the DP camps, so, when a child was born it was like a [illegible] for the whole camp.</span> <span id="s567">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s568">It was - there were no children.</span> <span id="s569">And so, we developed a friendship there, and the people what went to Israel, we still the best friends.</span> <span id="s570">I still call all my friends that I’m going here, and I’m going there, don’t call because I’m not going to be here, and if I call one, this one has the telephone numbers from the other one, calls them, you know, whatever, and the friends what came here, we still friends from – since 1945, 1946, most of them we know each other from home or from during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">WH: What DP camp were you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">NK: Landsberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">WH: One of the things that I’ve been coming across has been that there’s a sort of dislike in many cases between the Hungarian and the Polish Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">NK: Let me explain you one thing.</span> <span id="s575">It comes from it, because after the war, everybody was looking, you know what I mean, you had more – you were looking for connections.</span> <span id="s576">You were looking to have somebody.</span> <span id="s577">And it’s only human nature, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">WH: That you go to the ones that you have in common?</span></p> <p><span id="s579">NK: That you know that you speak Polish, you speak Yiddish, there was a language barrier.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">WH: Well, among the people who have something in common, does it matter – let’s say you have something more in common with Polish Jews, does it matter if the Polish Jew is from Galicia or from [inaudible]?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NK: It doesn’t, you know, it goes around a joke.</span> <span id="s582">You’re a Galicianer, you a Litvak, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s583">The Litvaks think that they are on a higher level than the Galicianer, the Galicianer feel they more educated people who came out, big scholars, from Galicia then, well, (needs translation – I would not?</span> <span id="s584">Litvak yidded) They are, really, I personally like the Litvak Jews better than the Jews what I was brought up.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">WH: From the Jews who were in regular Poland like (?)</span> <span id="s586">, Galicia, there’s no big difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">NK: Well, let me explain to you one thing.</span> <span id="s588">To me when I came even before the war, during the war, after the war, to me, a person is a human being.</span> <span id="s589">You know, I don’t care, you know, even as a Jew I always respected the Gentile.</span> <span id="s590">If he’s a person, if he’s a human being, I would go out of my way to give him more respect, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s591">That I would give a fellow Jew, because this you take for granted.</span> <span id="s592">And this, you feel the guy’s a person, he’s entitled, you know what I mean, [inaudible] that’s the way I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s593">WH: (talking about nursing home in Long Beach) Do you have nightmares?</span></p> <p><span id="s594">NK: It’s a miracle that I could think normal, that I could function like a human being.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">WH: What do think accounts for this miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">NK: I think that life to life.</span> <span id="s597">You see, we wanted to raise a family; we wanted the best for the children.</span> <span id="s598">We wanted to accomplish something.</span> <span id="s599">We came into this country, and I said, it’s a wonderful country, and the opportunity is there, and I had the drive in me, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s600">Not to, some people decided that making $200, $250 a week, they were happy, they didn’t want to have any responsibilities and headaches, and they lived their life.</span> <span id="s601">And plenty of times, I was wondering, who’s better off?</span> <span id="s602">You know?</span> <span id="s603">Because business is a lot of aggravation, you know?</span> <span id="s604">I had a big responsibility.</span> <span id="s605">But everything, I complained once to my manufacturer, so he gave me a good lesson.</span> <span id="s606">He said, ‘Come over here, boychik (little boy), stop complaining so much,’ he said.</span> <span id="s607">‘If business would be easy, we wouldn’t need you.</span> <span id="s608">Everybody would be in business.’</span> <span id="s609">You know, and that gave me something to think about it.</span> <span id="s610">You know, and so I learned, the aggravation comes, don’t take it in, you know, too much too heart, try as much as you can, you know, to live through the day.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">WH: You have two children, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">WH: Did you tell them about the war?</span> <span id="s614">Did you discuss it with them when they were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">NK: More to my son than to my daughter, because it was very hard for me to talk to my children, because once I started to talk, my family comes up, and then I get very depressed, and then I can’t talk about it, because sometimes I sit and wonder, ‘Did I abandon them, or did they abandon me?</span> <span id="s616">We were nine kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">WH: Did you ever deal with the larger question of how G-d could have allowed something like this to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s618">NK: I used to go into that, because [illegible] to me.</span> <span id="s619">I came out of the camp.</span> <span id="s620">I became more religious than I was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">WH: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">NK: Because I said, G-d helped me.</span> <span id="s623">I lived through the war, [illegible] I never, you know, people ask me, ‘How did you survive?’</span> <span id="s624">I could tell them [illegible].</span> <span id="s625">I was smart, I was shrewd, I was you know, I outsmart the Germans, my fellow inmates, or whatever.</span> <span id="s626">I said, ‘G-d helped me’.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">WH: Do you think if G-d was watching that He wouldn’t have done something about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s628">NK: I’ll tell you, If I would go in deep into that, I had to change my life, and I didn’t want to change my life because I believed in G-d, and it was easy for me to live, because every time when I had a problem, or whatever, it’s – my saying was – ‘G-d will help and I [illegible].</span></p> <p><span id="s629">WH: (needs translation)</span></p> <p><span id="s630">NK: And I’ll creep out of it.</span> <span id="s631">So somehow, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s632">WH: It’s easier, and it works.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">NK: And it works.</span> <span id="s634">And if I should start the question out, there are a lot of questions, but who’s going to give me an answer?</span> <span id="s635">I have to come up with an answer myself.</span> <span id="s636">Because you will ask a thousand people and everybody has a different answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">WH: So you believe in G-d.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">NK: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">WH: Didn’t your children ask where G-d was during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">NK: I know one thing.</span> <span id="s641">There was a G-d.</span> <span id="s642">And I know one thing, I always believed in G-d, and I said, if G-d wants me to live, I’ll live.</span> <span id="s643">G-d wants me to die, I’ll die.</span> <span id="s644">But I’m not going to go die because I’m hungry, go out steal a piece of bread from him, or take my bread and change for a soup, or do other things.</span> <span id="s645">I said, ‘I’m here, I’m not alone, that what happen to Jewish people and I’m not better than anybody else,’ and...</span></p> <p><span id="s646">WH: Do you think that your children were affected?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">NK: I think so.</span> <span id="s648">I really don’t know how to answer that question.</span> <span id="s649">But I think that children of survivors are different than children when they are born, you know, to – I don’t want to use the world, ‘normal parents.’</span></p> <p><span id="s650">WH: Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">NK: Americans, or Israelis, or whatever.</span> <span id="s652">You have to understand one thing.</span> <span id="s653">We were very protective of our children, I feel they wanted to have more freedom, you know, as kids to grow up, and if I would understand then, what I understand now, maybe I would tell them to do things different.</span> <span id="s654">Maybe I wouldn’t tell them so much to do.</span> <span id="s655">Maybe I would let them a little bit more, freedom, or how you say in America, I would give them more ‘room to breathe.’</span> <span id="s656">I don’t remember having too many arguments with my son.</span> <span id="s657">Really, we had a very good relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">WH: Do you think that he’s more protective of his own children?</span> <span id="s659">Do you see that he gives his children more independence or less?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">NK: Ah, yes, well you have to understand one thing.</span> <span id="s661">You know he was my first son, I lost my whole family, he was my – my whole life!</span> <span id="s662">He was my whole life.</span> <span id="s663">And I had to make another decision, he came home once, and he says, that was 1967, he wants to go as a volunteer to Israel.</span> <span id="s664">And I had to sign papers for him, because he was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s665">And it was like (needs translation) here I was a Zionist, and here, all my friends heard that the American children that are coming in as volunteers so they all made bet between themselves, ‘I’ll bet you that Nathan’s son is going to be the first one there because he was…’ I signed the papers, I let him go, it was a tough decision…” Tape 2, Side 1.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">WH: What did you think of his involvement with the [inaudible] with the whole business?</span> <span id="s667">I mean, what’s your opinion of these organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s668">NK: Oy.</span> <span id="s669">I don’t want to answer that.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">WH: Really?</span> <span id="s671">I didn’t know that I’ve touched on something?</span></p> <p><span id="s672">NK: No, no.</span> <span id="s673">I tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s674">To me, everybody’s looking for kovod (honor/respect).</span> <span id="s675">You know, too much involved there with them.</span> <span id="s676">I think if people doing those things, should be done for history reasons, you know, everything should be recorded, but not that I’m on top, and not that I’m sitting here now at the dais, not that a president has to be for life because you know, I feel that there are more people capable of doing it, you know, don’t argue, don’t fight, you know, it comes to a commemoration, it comes to – I never missed the one in Madison Square Garden, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">WH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">NK: But I saw all the fights that went in with that and everything, and the selfishness, you losing a little.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">WH: Do you feel that it’s right that, I mean, the survivors make the money, right, and they did well, but is it right to have a fancy dinner at the Waldorf Astoria, to commemorate something like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">NK: That to me, it’s a disgrace.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">WH: You’re not the only one to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">NK: I’m saying my opinion.</span> <span id="s683">I say we should get together and have coffee and cake, and take the money and donate it to the poor children or to Israel, or whatever.</span> <span id="s684">Not to come and show-off the tuxedos, with the dresses, pay so much money – I never went to fancy stuff.</span> <span id="s685">I never go for those.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">WH: Why do you think they do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">NK: To show off.</span> <span id="s688">To knock the other guy down or somebody should tell his friends, which he wasn’t as fortunate as he was [illegible] made as much money as he was, that I’m on the top and you’re on the bottom.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">WH: There’s a lot of resentment out there by the little guy, the average Schneider living in Canarsie.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">NK: There are a lot of guys there which are more a mensch.</span> <span id="s691">I’m talking about the human being.</span> <span id="s692">More dedicated person to the cause than the other guys with the money, well, it was always like that, you know, somehow, one reason or other, they say every person is a selfish person, you know, if you come to commemorate your parents and your uncles, and your sisters, and your brothers, it has to be a different way, than to make a party out of it.</span> <span id="s693">Or to have a million fights over it, that to me, it’s like they’re trying to make a business out of the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s694">You know, for their selfish way.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">WH: They claim that if they didn’t have these fancy dinners, they wouldn’t be able to raise fifty million dollars for Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">NK: It’s possible, I agree with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">WH: And then they said, if you want to get a guy to give a million dollars to Israel, you got to honor him at a dinner, you got to have the dinner.</span> <span id="s698">So in that sense, is it wrong to do it?</span></p> <p><span id="s699">NK: If this is the only reason, there’s nothing wrong with it, because, I’m involved in a Yeshiva [inaudible] in San Rockaway.</span> <span id="s700">I’m one of the founders there, get 600 to 700 people for $300 a couple to the Sands, we spend a lot of money, but it brings in a lot of money.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">WH: So it sounds like in a way, it’s really an evil, but a necessary evil.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">NK: I think that’s the way of life in America, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s703">WH: What you’re really saying is that you personally are turned off by all this [inaudible], but you know that if they didn’t have it, they probably wouldn’t get half as much as they’re getting – but it’s still not pleasant to watch it.</span> <span id="s704">What you’re condemning really, is that the system makes it necessary for this kind of narrishkeit (foolishness) to go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">NK: Yes, you have to understand one thing.</span> <span id="s706">When I go to those dinners, 80% of the food is being thrown out.</span> <span id="s707">That’s what hurts me more than everything else, throwing out food, which to me, I can’t take a piece of bread and throw it out – I eat the toast, if not I’m going here to feed the ducks.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">WH: So many people who are survivors mention bread to me, does it seem, because bread was so important in the camps that it’s more of a shame to waste a piece of bread than say a half a piece of corn or peas or cherries?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">NK: Who dreamed about peas or cherries, you know, in the camps – there was a potato or bread - most of the survivors said, ‘Before I die, I would like to have enough potatoes to eat’, and I should say, now I could be happy, because I’m not hungry anymore, so bread and potatoes, that’s the two things what you were dreaming, I can’t throw out any food.</span> <span id="s710">It doesn’t matter what.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">WH: Israel.</span> <span id="s712">How do you feel about the ‘Who is a Jew?’</span> <span id="s713">problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">NK: I would say that they should leave that for the rabbinate.</span> <span id="s715">To me, it is, not the government’s business.</span> <span id="s716">You know, we survived, because we lived by the Torah.</span> <span id="s717">Otherwise we would not have survived.</span> <span id="s718">If we wouldn’t have Jews, what believed, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s719">How long would the Jewish nation exist with the Reform Jews?</span> <span id="s720">They would be assimilated.</span> <span id="s721">You wouldn’t exist 4,000 years, but at the same time, I don’t agree with those extremists you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s722">To go ahead and don’t do this, or don’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">WH: Of your four closest friends are they all survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">WH: What do you think is more important, a job that provides security, or a job that is challenging?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">NK: I like challenge.</span> <span id="s727">I have to tell you a story.</span> <span id="s728">My son had finished law school, Hofstra.</span> <span id="s729">He comes over and says, ‘Daddy, I’m opening up an office.’</span> <span id="s730">I said to him, ‘What are you talking about?</span> <span id="s731">You just finished law school.’</span> <span id="s732">‘I know, my friends, they go to work to get experience, this and that,’ so he lets me talk and talk and talk.</span> <span id="s733">And then he says, ‘Dad, could I tell you something?’</span> <span id="s734">I said, ‘Yes.</span> <span id="s735">What do you want to tell me?’</span> <span id="s736">He said, ‘Anything wrong to go in a father’s footsteps?’</span> <span id="s737">I said, ‘What are you talking about?’</span> <span id="s738">I said, ‘I’m a tailor, you’re a lawyer.’</span> <span id="s739">He said, ‘Daddy, let me finish.</span> <span id="s740">All my life I was brought up, you were sitting by the table, or you with your friends, you always, everybody asked you, how did you accomplish, what did you do, what do you have to say, and I always heard by the table, you said, you came with a little bit of knowledge and a little bit of ambition, and you applied that with your work.</span> <span id="s741">And thank G-d you did well.</span> <span id="s742">So is there anything wrong with a son to go in a father’s footsteps?</span> <span id="s743">Daddy, I have a little bit of knowledge, I have a little bit of ambition, I live at home, I don’t have any expenses, I have money in the bank.’</span> <span id="s744">Because he used to teach Hebrew, bar mitzvah classes, and he said, ‘Why are you against it?</span> <span id="s745">Let me go and open up an office.</span> <span id="s746">A year later, if I fail, if I don’t do well, I’m going to go and get a job.</span> <span id="s747">Didn’t you say, you quit one job and you went to another job?</span> <span id="s748">And I heard you always said, ‘A job I could always get.’</span> <span id="s749">So you took the chance to better yourself.’</span> <span id="s750">I couldn’t say anything to him.</span> <span id="s751">I had to agree with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">WH: And it worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">NK: It worked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">WH: Do you think that people who say that they’re lucky, that they make their own luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s755">NK: You have to do something.</span> <span id="s756">I believe in one thing.</span> <span id="s757">First you have to do.</span> <span id="s758">And then, you can’t sit and wait until lucky will strike you.</span></p> <p><span id="s759">WH: (needs translation) You are an optimistic person, why?</span></p> <p><span id="s760">NK: Because I always look at things the good way.</span> <span id="s761">I always look at the other person with good eyes.</span> <span id="s762">I try to get out, I don’t know if it’s a nature or I developed it, I always said, I’m bad enough.</span> <span id="s763">What I want now from you, is the good parts, what I don’t have.</span> <span id="s764">The bad parts, I don’t want to hear them, because I’m bad enough.</span> <span id="s765">You know, I see that every person has in him all kinds of [illegible].</span> <span id="s766">So, when I talk to people, when I deal with people, or whatever, [illegible] to get, to get out the better part of the person, not to learn from him, you know, the things what I don’t want to do.</span> <span id="s767">Do you understand what I’m saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">WH: In the war, you seem to come to the conclusion that then, it wasn’t a good time to take risks.</span> <span id="s769">That the most, that if you followed the rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">NK: I followed the rules as long as I was in Auschwitz, there’s no other way out.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">WH: So really you would say that you’re a person who adapts, you adjust?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">WH: You know when to fight and when not to fight.</span> <span id="s774">You know when to run and when to sit still, and that’s not something you learn, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">NK: I grew up; I had nobody to learn from, which, whatever I am, I had to do it on my own because my father died when I was nine, ten years old.</span> <span id="s776">We were nine children with a mother.</span> <span id="s777">And, I don’t remember anybody telling me do this, or do that, you know.</span> <span id="s778">I mean, you have to understand that life with nine children at home, one child raises the other, you have to listen to your mother, you have to listen to your older brother; you have to listen to your older sister.</span> <span id="s779">That was the life in Europe.</span> <span id="s780">Here, that would be a total disaster.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">WH: Is that part of the reason why you had more in common with the people who came from Europe when you got together with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s782">NK: It’s the same culture.</span> <span id="s783">You have to understand one thing, you now.</span> <span id="s784">You were brought up together.</span> <span id="s785">Everybody was brought up in the same way.</span> <span id="s786">You know, almost the same way.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">WH: Did you belong to any survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">NK: No, when I came here they told me I have to belong to a society, I said, ‘What they want from my life?</span> <span id="s789">I came here to live; I didn’t come here to die.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">WH: You mean you thought of it only as a chevra kadisha (burial society)?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">NK: (laughs) I belonged to the Zionist Organization.</span> <span id="s792">When I came here I belonged to the (inaudible name) society.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">WH: Did it mean going to meetings?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">NK: Yes, once a month, I enjoyed the meetings until there was a fight for three hours that the chazzan’s (cantor’s) son became bar mitzvah and the treasury gave a $25 present and didn’t have a committee.</span> <span id="s795">I said, ‘You guys expect me I should spend a half day here, going to fight.’</span> <span id="s796">That was the time already, I was already a little bit on the upper level, which $25 you know, didn’t mean so much.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">WH: What year?</span></p> <p><span id="s798">NK: ’54, ’53, ’55, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">WH: So what happened after that?</span> <span id="s800">You lost interest?</span></p> <p><span id="s801">NK: I said, ‘I’m not going to come here, spend you know four hours, you guys should sit and fight.</span> <span id="s802">Don’t you have anything better to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s803">WH: What did they say?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">NK: They were on a different category, you know.</span> <span id="s805">We were more updated, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s806">We went with the times, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">WH: The ones that were fighting, were they the people that were here before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s808">NK: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">WH: How did they get along, the ones that came before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s810">NK: That was two different people.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">WH: In what way?</span> <span id="s812">You both came from Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">NK: They both came from Europe, we were more educated, sophisticated, whatever you want to call it, you know what I mean, more up-to-date, or whatever.</span> <span id="s814">You know?</span> <span id="s815">We lived a different way.</span> <span id="s816">I could see it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">WH: How were you more educated?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">NK: Self-education.</span> <span id="s819">As a result, your mind was sharpened more, you know, you learned, first of all, you had to learn how to survive.</span> <span id="s820">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s821">That was a lot, after the war, you still had to learn how to survive.</span> <span id="s822">Let’s say I was in Germany, I didn’t want to take anything from (UNRRA), a package or this or that I found out that there’s a black market where you could do some business, and what happened, I joined the club.</span> <span id="s823">Why?</span> <span id="s824">Because I wanted to have a car, I wanted to have a motorcycle; I wanted to have nice clothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">WH: People here who said to you, ‘Well you had it tough but we had a depression here.’</span> <span id="s826">What do you say?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">NK: What would I say (needs translation)?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">WH: So in reality, the survivors on the whole, do you think that they did better than those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">NK: Oh, 100 – I would say, 1,000%.</span> <span id="s830">You take the majority of survivors, you know, they grabbed the opportunity, you know what I mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">WH: (the American) why is he such a shvitzer (show off)?”</span></p> <p><span id="s832">NK: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s833">Because that’s the way they live, you know.</span> <span id="s834">They have everything, but [inaudible] on credit cards.</span> <span id="s835">They pay all the payments; I used to tell, ‘What are you buying all that stuff?’</span> <span id="s836">I said ‘How could you afford it?’</span> <span id="s837">He said, ‘I have credit and I pay every month $130 or $140, I know, so whatever I buy, they still can’t take off more than $140 or $150, my credit is good, because I pay.</span> <span id="s838">So, I want to have everything.</span> <span id="s839">I said, ‘I’m different.’</span> <span id="s840">I said, ‘If I have money, I buy it.</span> <span id="s841">If I don’t have money, I could live without it.’</span> <span id="s842">I never bought anything on payments, or this or that.</span> <span id="s843">In the beginning, whatever, we wanted to buy something we were waiting until we saved up enough money, and then we bought whatever it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">WH: What did you do when people told you that it’s economically better to buy on credit?</span></p> <p><span id="s845">NK: I never believed him.</span> <span id="s846">I didn’t want to have payments.</span> <span id="s847">My mind was made up.</span> <span id="s848">If I have money, I’ll buy.</span> <span id="s849">If I don’t have money, I could live without it.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">WH: Would you say that your health is good, though, in general?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">NK: Well, I’m not a young man.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">WH: Do your feet get swollen still from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s853">NK: I walked for 3 and a half months without shoes in the snow, at 30 below zero – you ask me a question, I said, I think I am the healthiest person in this world, because what I went through, I still could get up in the morning, and take a shower and take a shave, and go into a car and drive and this and that.</span> <span id="s854">That means, thank G-d, my general health is good.</span> <span id="s855">I’m lucky.</span></p>
