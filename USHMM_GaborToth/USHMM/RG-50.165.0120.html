I had a distributorship for the U.S. from Canada.</span> <span id="s51">In 1966 I returned to Toronto and in 1969 we moved to Santa Clara.</span> <span id="s52">But in all of these places I kept businesses that I started.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: Did you see any differences between living in Canada and the U.S. from the perspective of a survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">JT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">WH: Could a Holocaust happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s56">JT: I think it would be more difficult, but it could happen here.</span> <span id="s57">Here you have such a mixture of different types of people, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">WH: What type of work did your father do?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">JT: He was an "upper shoemaker".</span></p> <p><span id="s60">WH: Did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">JT: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">WH: Was it a religious family?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">J T: No.</span> <span id="s64">My grandfather was religious.</span> <span id="s65">He was a Gerer Hasid.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">WH: How were you able to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">JT: (He points to the sky)</span></p> <p><span id="s68">WH: Do you believe in God?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">JT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">WH: Are you active in the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">JT: Well, I help to build synagogues.</span> <span id="s72">I am Conservative.</span> <span id="s73">I help all kinds of Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: You've accomplished so much and I know you're a very hard-driving individual.</span> <span id="s75">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">JT: For me it was very simple.</span> <span id="s77">I came to the U.S. knowing no one and I had to prove to myself that I'm equal to others, that I can accomplish.</span> <span id="s78">I also had goals---that anything I would do would help society.</span> <span id="s79">It's not enough simply to accumulate money.</span> <span id="s80">We have to live with all kinds of people and whenever people are denied their human right or discriminated against, it is up to us to help them.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">WH: Are you involved in helping non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">JT: Very much.</span> <span id="s83">I am a trustee of the Congressional Human Rights Foundation, with Tom Lantos.</span> <span id="s84">We're involved all over the world.</span> <span id="s85">When we saw that the Dalai Lama was being discriminated against in China, Tom and I went to China.</span> <span id="s86">We helped the Chinese dissidents.</span> <span id="s87">We made a seder for the students and translated to the concepts of freedom from the Hagadah.</span> <span id="s88">It was unbelievable to them that here was a people which for five thousand years was struggling for freedom.</span> <span id="s89">They thought they're the only ones.</span> <span id="s90">My drive was to accomplish those kinds of things.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">So when it comes to the computers, by the way, the most important thing was to manufacture a computer (Commodore) which every kid in the world will be able to afford to buy.</span> <span id="s92">Before I did this the IBM people took the attitude that computers were only for the privileged people, which meant that if you didn't have $100,000, you couldn't buy it.</span> <span id="s93">We sell mostly abroad now.</span> <span id="s94">I met with German youth in computer clubs and there wasn't a time when I was speaking to them that the word concentration camp didn't come out.</span> <span id="s95">I explained to them why I wanted to help youth, to develop the brain and its information capabilities as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">WH: Is it your feeling then, that computers can be a very valuable tool for doing good?</span></p> <p><span id="s97">JT: Information is good?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">WH: How did the Germans react?</span></p> <p><span id="s99">JT: Very good.</span> <span id="s100">They wanted to know more about me.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">WH: Do you sell in the U.S. now?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">JT: We do about half a billion dollars in sales.</span> <span id="s103">About $425,000,000 of our sales is in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">WH: Do you plan to sell more in the U.S. in the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">JT: I plan to but it's not easy because an American does not buy a computer because he tested them all, but rather because Professor Shlomo Rosenberg from Columbia says so.</span> <span id="s106">He just follows the crowd.</span> <span id="s107">I've slowed down now.</span> <span id="s108">My sons are more active now.</span> <span id="s109">I'm not directly involved in the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">WH: Why not be involved?</span></p> <p><span id="s111">JT: I'd like to be able to help my children when I'm alive, not when I'm dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">WH: What organizations are you involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">JT: Co-Chairman of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in Northern California; Director of Federation in San Jose.</span> <span id="s114">I'm involved with United Way, the Red Cross, and on and on and on.</span> <span id="s115">My permanent organizations are probably 60% Jewish.</span> <span id="s116">I helpled a Lubavitcher build his synagogue in Palo Alto.</span> <span id="s117">I belong to Chabad even though I'm not Orthodox.</span> <span id="s118">The rabbi there helps a lot of people in need; he visits people in the hospitals.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">WH: It's interesting that as a Polish Jew, you're friendly with Tom Lantos who's a Hungarian.</span> <span id="s120">Yet often the two groups are separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">JT: I was so busy through the years with my business that I never had much time for social relations.</span> <span id="s122">I find that Jews are basically all the same and I don't go by where they came from---Lodz or Buenos Aires.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">WH: What did the Holocaust teach you about people?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">JT: Helen and I are married about 43 years and we have different opinions about human nature.</span> <span id="s125">I believe people aren't guilty until they've done something wrong.</span> <span id="s126">Helen does not forgive.</span> <span id="s127">A German is a German and a German is bad.</span> <span id="s128">I believe that we even have to try to show an older German how wrong he was, not just take a pistol and kill him.</span> <span id="s129">We're not animals.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">WH: Well, the SS guards…</span></p> <p><span id="s131">JT: They were, but we are not.</span> <span id="s132">I don't want to go down to their level.</span> <span id="s133">This is very important because if we do, then they've won.</span> <span id="s134">Helen takes restitution money every month.</span> <span id="s135">I don't.</span> <span id="s136">I don't want to sell myself.</span> <span id="s137">Helen feels she's not selling herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">WH: What did the war teach you about human nature with respect to your own fellow Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JT: Most people are selfish, especially under stress.</span> <span id="s140">Education and knowledge can help people a lot.</span> <span id="s141">When you live isolated, as we Jews did, on one street in Europe, you're scared when you suddenly leave that world, the way I did after the war.</span> <span id="s142">I learned that there are good people everywhere and only a small proportion are bad.</span> <span id="s143">The selfishness comes in when living in isolation you only trust your group.</span> <span id="s144">You don't realize that we all have to help each other.</span> <span id="s145">Five percent cannot survive alone.</span> <span id="s146">So we have to share.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">WH: Did your father try to inculcate these values in you as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">JT: My grandfather did.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">WH: But you come across so tough in the newspaper articles.</span> <span id="s150">You were once quoted as saying, Business…</span></p> <p><span id="s151">JT: Is war.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JT: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">JT: I believe in separation of church and state.</span> <span id="s154">The same thing is in business.</span> <span id="s155">Friendship and business are separate things.</span> <span id="s156">Private life and business are two separate things.</span> <span id="s157">When you're an officer of a public corporation, you're representing other people's money and you have to fight to the last drop.</span> <span id="s158">You're entitled to do whatever you want with your own money and your own time.</span> <span id="s159">That's just the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">WH: I guess it's sometimes hard to separate business and friendship.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">JT: A friend who doesn't understand this, is no friend.</span> <span id="s162">I declare myself before I start.</span> <span id="s163">I prefer to be divorced before I start.</span> <span id="s164">I tell people: "If you'll demand a high salary, I'll demand a lot from you.</span> <span id="s165">If you don't perform, your ass is out."</span></p> <p><span id="s166">WH: Have your wartime experiences shaped your attitudes in this area?</span></p> <p><span id="s167">JT: They must have.</span> <span id="s168">As I said before, whatever you do, it has to help society.</span> <span id="s169">So you have to be up front with people.</span> <span id="s170">You should never try to say how wonderful a person is if he isn't.</span> <span id="s171">If someone asks me about a former worker, I won't say how wonderful he was if he was fired.</span> <span id="s172">Most people don't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">WH: How were you able to find the strength to go on after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">JT: Maybe it was my youth.</span> <span id="s175">I came out like a tiger.</span> <span id="s176">I wanted to get back everything I had lost.</span> <span id="s177">I wanted to see everything.</span> <span id="s178">At first I had feelings of revenge, but that changed when a priest said to me: "If you are going to treat the Germans the same way they treated you, what's the difference between you and them?"</span> <span id="s179">The way he said it, just totally changed my outlook.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">WH: Did you think of going to Israel after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">JT: No.</span> <span id="s182">I wasn't a Zionist.</span> <span id="s183">I give to Israel now and support her but I don't buy Bonds because that's not really giving.</span> <span id="s184">I've built a number of hospitals.</span> <span id="s185">Right now I'm building a home here in California and I'm going to make sure it'll have Jerusalem stone.</span> <span id="s186">The idea is to try to work with Israel as much as possible.</span> <span id="s187">We're going to have a factory in Israel which makes semiconductors.</span> <span id="s188">We'll have 74% and the government will have 26%.</span> <span id="s189">This is much better than buying Bonds.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">WH: Do you favor Likud or Labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">JT: Definitely Labor.</span> <span id="s192">I don't think Sharon and Shamir are the right people.</span> <span id="s193">We have to live in the world and not by ourselves.</span> <span id="s194">The way they do it, we're going to that much more hated in the world because we're only looking out for ourselves.</span> <span id="s195">We've been helping South Africa for years, which I'm totally against.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">WH: Tell me a little about your children.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">JT: All three are married.</span> <span id="s198">Sam is in charge of Atari.</span> <span id="s199">He has three children.</span> <span id="s200">His first wife converted to Judaism and died tragically, at 26, of cancer.</span> <span id="s201">Her dying wish was that he marry an Orthodox girl so the kids would identify as Jews.</span> <span id="s202">She taught us more about Judaism than anyone else.</span> <span id="s203">And he did, to an Orthodox girl named Tzippy.</span> <span id="s204">Leonard has a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia.</span> <span id="s205">He's in charge of our software.</span> <span id="s206">He's more in technology.</span> <span id="s207">He's also married, had one child, and is expecting another.</span> <span id="s208">Gary, the youngest, is in charge of operations and administration.</span> <span id="s209">He's married and just had a baby.</span> <span id="s210">The youngest one's wife converted too.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">WH: It doesn't bother you, does it, that the wife was not Jewish initially.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">JT: I will never allow my child to marry a non-Jew since the culture is so different, if only for the sake of the kids.</span> <span id="s213">So they would have to convert so they'll be raised in one religion.</span> <span id="s214">My children try to please me as much as they can.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">WH: Any idea why some survivors did so well?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">JT: Americans, in general, are lazy.</span> <span id="s217">Survivors had different values.</span> <span id="s218">As immigrants they see a lot, namely, that if you'll work your ass off, you can do anything.</span> <span id="s219">Today, I would not do what I did 35 year ago.</span> <span id="s220">Then, nothing is impossible.</span> <span id="s221">I had nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s222">I could only gain, so I could take chances.</span> <span id="s223">People set in their lives with families, are afraid to take risks.</span> <span id="s224">I had to take risks because I had nothing.</span> <span id="s225">[Some who took risks had nothing to lose, failed.</span> <span id="s226">They are forgotten] So when I was asked by Sears Roebuck to assemble a typewriter for them, I asked them: "Would you lend me the money to do that?"</span> <span id="s227">They said: "Yes," and lent me $176,000.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't know how to assemble typewriters.</span> <span id="s229">So I went to Royal, Smith Corona, and they all laughed at me.</span> <span id="s230">They had their own branches in Canada.</span> <span id="s231">I wound up in Prague, Czechoslovakia and I got a license from Prague to build typewriters.</span> <span id="s232">I set up an assembly line there.</span> <span id="s233">That's how we did it, by taking a chance, by not giving up, searching until you succeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">WH: So it would seem it wasn't only God.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">JT: It's always like that.</span> <span id="s236">God gives your opportunities, but you have to take them (He chuckles.)</span> <span id="s237">You always have to find something new.</span> <span id="s238">That's the only way you can grow.</span> <span id="s239">Necessity is the mother of invention.</span> <span id="s240">If I would have had a lot of education, I would have wanted to be in that, a professor.</span> <span id="s241">Same thing if I had been a plumber.</span> <span id="s242">I had no education and I was therefore forced to reach out.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">WH: Do you think the majority of people make it, if they're forced to reach out?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">JT: If they are reaching out, the majority will make it.</span> <span id="s245">But very few will reach out, they're afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">WH: Who should the Holocaust Museum portray?</span></p> <p><span id="s247">JT: It is a museum of the Holocaust, between 1933 and 1945.</span> <span id="s248">So the Armenians are out because that happened before, but Gypsies, homosexuals, Catholics, all people who have suffered, should be represented.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">WH: Are you involved with Ben Meed's group?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">JT: Ben is giving the thing over to the Museum.</span> <span id="s251">Vladka is a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s252">We met with the Secretary of Agriculture in April, they're our neighbors, next door to the museum.</span> <span id="s253">And he said: "It's wonderful that we're building a memorial to all those people who are no longer living."</span> <span id="s254">(He laughs.)</span> <span id="s255">And this is a Secretary.</span> <span id="s256">We didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s257">Like you pulled out an article about me, but very few people will research something.</span> <span id="s258">In Japan and Germany, people have a staff that gets the material for them automatically.</span> <span id="s259">Here you have to ask for it and you're lucky if you get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">WH: What should we do in terms of the future?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">JT: We should extend ourselves to others.</span> <span id="s262">When I bought my factor in Germany, the fellow who introduced me to his non-Jewish father-in-law said to me: "Jack, one thing you should not do.</span> <span id="s263">Don't tell them you're Jewish.</span> <span id="s264">You've got 2,000 German employees because you won't get their loyalty."</span> <span id="s265">So what did I do?</span> <span id="s266">I made a speech to them and told them I was Jewish (like Gross in Alabama) and that I was a survivor of the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s267">And then I said that I wanted anyone who was in the SS in my office in the next two days.</span> <span id="s268">Over twenty of them came and about six of them walked out and said they will never work for a Jew.</span> <span id="s269">The others apologized; it wasn't their fault and all that.</span> <span id="s270">I saw it as honesty and that they were looking for forgiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">WH: And you gave it to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">JT: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">WH: Were you beaten during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">JT: At lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">WH: You seem to have a large capacity for forgiveness.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">JT: It's so much better to be able to forgive than to hate.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">WH: Well, it's clear you've done very well in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">JT: You see that bridge out the window, the 59th Street Bridge?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">WH: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">JT: I just looked straight ahead, in front of me, and never turned back.</span> <span id="s281">Plus people have always underestimated me.</span> <span id="s282">I never competed against the little guy because I was a little guy.</span> <span id="s283">The little guy will fight back.</span> <span id="s284">I went against the big guys like IBM who didn't pay much attention to me because I was a mouse to them, unimportant.</span> <span id="s285">So I sneaked up on them and succeeded before they knew it.</span> <span id="s286">(He laughs.)</span> <span id="s287">And now let me ask you a question since you know about Jewish history and that kind of thing---What was the first Jewish settlement in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">WH: I think, maybe, somewhere on the East Coast, eh…</span></p> <p><span id="s289">JT: No.</span> <span id="s290">Ten cents on the dollar!</span> <span id="s291">(He laughs heartily as we say goodbye.)</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s293">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0120 PAGE 8</span></p> <p><span
