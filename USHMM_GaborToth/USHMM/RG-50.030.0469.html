<span id="s89">Then when it went a little bit better, they did took somebody to work there.</span> <span id="s90">Since -- I come from a poor -- quite poor family.</span> <span id="s91">Since my parent didn’t have money to send my brother to school, so they let him to learn some trade.</span> <span id="s92">So he was a glasser.</span> <span id="s93">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: A

nice.</span> <span id="s101">Unfortunately, too nice.</span> <span id="s102">And the money which he made, the bi -- bigger part he gave to his -- to my mother.</span> <span id="s103">And then he usually worked extra.</span> <span id="s104">Besides the store he framed pictures during the weekends, he should earn for himself.</span> <span id="s105">And that was a little bit easier, because my brother made money, the bakery was a little -- the best business was when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s106">The Germans invaded Slovakia.</span> <span id="s107">That was the best business in the bakery, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Well let -- let’s -- let’s go back just a little bit.</span> <span id="s109">Tell me what your father’s name was.</span></p> <p><span

I appreciated them very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Many times in the evenings, when they slept already, I was looking at them, and I thought, oh my God.</span> <span id="s127">Somehow I had a feeling, something wrong.</span> <span id="s128">But not like that.</span> <span id="s129">Only that they worked so hard, that my God, where will all this

me the most sad, because my -- when they took the parents, my parents, he was at work, and he was hidden in the basement, there where worked.</span> <span id="s137">And when he heard that they took my parents, he ran away from his hidden pla -- place, came home to help my parents, to go with them, and therefore he went with them.</span> <span id="s138">And there -- I met once in a train, one of his friends who was in the same lager that he -- he says they worked in a forest with my brother, many people went in, and the young men, in Deblin -- in Deblin, it’s somewhere near to Lublin.</span> <span id="s139">I didn't say -- I didn’t see mention these lager, this concentration lager, but it must have been a small lager.</span> <span id="s140">They worked in the forest and they [indecipherable] they did take the older people, older.</span> <span id="s141">My father was 53, my mother was 51.</span> <span id="s142">But that was older then.</span> <span id="s143">Th-They take them from the lager, they take them away.</span> <span id="s144">My brother wanted again to help them, so he ran away from the forest to help them.</span> <span id="s145">And so they took them -- took him also with my parents.</span> <span id="s146">That’s where they died, all three of them.</span> <span id="s147">My mother, she worked in a bakery, and she worked at home.</span> <span id="s148">She had many friends in the bakery, many, many friends, people liked her.</span> <span id="s149">She liked to talk.</span> <span id="s150">A real woman.</span> <span id="s151">And so I was a quiet child, working very, very hard, I studied hard because I promised myself that I don’t want to be poor.</span> <span id="s152">I have to make it.</span> <span id="s153">And therefore I studied for a decent future.</span> <span id="s154">And like a girl, a young girl, I hoped that I will be happy sometimes.</span> <span id="s155">That’s approximate the same.</span> <span id="s156">Maybe [indecipherable] will -- lived in a big house from my great-grandfather, yes?</span> <span id="s157">Apartment was small, but there were tenants there.</span> <span id="s158">It was an aun -- no, it was a -- an

<span id="s182">People didn’t try to help, they didn’t care about each other.</span> <span id="s183">It’s a like -- like here.</span> <span id="s184">Who cares if somebody’s poor, if some -- if they are not so poor, [indecipherable] somebody should care about us, but still I saw that it’s a big difference between people.</span> <span id="s185">Not too much understanding.</span> <span id="s186">It’s always a -- somehow watching people, how they think, how they -- and so, was interested in people.</span> <span id="s187">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: Was yours a

classes, you know that -- yeah, numerous classes.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: Explain that, wha -- wha --</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: Numerous classes mean a Slovak -- Slovak country, or a Slovak state become -- became a fascist state, and they didn’t permit all the Jew -- Jewish children to study, so it was a time when only the best ones did -- what were permitted to study, so the -- that was the last day, the last year, grade three, so this I made like numerous classes.</span> <span id="s243">So I made together two and six is eight, and three, eleven classes, yes?</span> <span

yeah?</span> <span id="s250">And I made a few scarves and I went from store to store to offer my scarves -- scarves.</span> <span id="s251">Nobody wanted to buy them.</span> <span id="s252">And then I decided, no, I will go into the biggest store in Prešov, and I will try to offer them.</span> <span id="s253">So I showed my collection, and I said, I would like to make you scarf, all you scarf.</span> <span id="s254">He said, “Yes, I will buy it from you, how many you can make, but with one condition.</span> <span id="s255">That we -- you will not do it for anybody else.</span> <span id="s256">O-Only for my store.”</span> <span id="s257">I said yes, and I was happy.</span> <span id="s258">So -- he doesn’t know that nobody want it.</span> <span id="s259">So the whole time I made for them scarf, I was weaving scarves, scarfs -- my mother helped me to -- with the wools, with the yarns.</span> <span id="s260">And then I -- he asked, “Will you make turbans?”</span> <span id="s261">At the time turbans, they were in style.</span> <span id="s262">I said yes.</span> <span id="s263">So I taught my mother how to crochet this material, and I picked it up and I twisted it and so, and I sold turbans.</span> <span id="s264">And there were in the biggest store in the window, my turbans and my scarves.</span> <span id="s265">My father came once home, I said -- he said, “I saw your turbans and your scarves.”</span> <span id="s266">And I was so happy, and I put in pins and sew.</span> <span id="s267">And I made and I sewed, so I made the whole time some money.</span> <span id="s268">But the money -- I wasn’t so nice, and my brother because they didn’t need it, my money.</span> <span id="s269">So I was -- I bought for myself clothing, dressing, material, sewing.</span> <span id="s270">So I was always nicely dressed, like the richest.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Did you sew for yourself --</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: -- you -- you made your own clothes.</span> <span id="s274">And did you create the designs?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span

everything I make [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s280">I save money also, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: That’s fabulous.</span> <span id="s282">So what were you thinking of teaching at

and that was very scary.</span> <span id="s647">An SS man to say -- we saw the Wehrmacht or so in the city, when they occupied there, but there we saw an SS.</span> <span id="s648">[indecipherable] that hat, yes, the SS, I didn’t know that’s SS.</span> <span id="s649">They said [indecipherable] that hat.</span> <span id="s650">And I --</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: So when did you find out it

story.</span> <span id="s659">When we came into our rooms, we had straw only, straw o-on the floor.</span> <span id="s660">There we were, a empty room, they were sitting and sleeping.</span> <span id="s661">We were there for maybe three -- three nights.</span> <span id="s662">And a SS came, strictly in German, he said the rules how we have to behave, and he -- yeah, and also he said that we

didn’t know all of them, but I knew the names.</span> <span id="s673">And he said then -- suddenly he said, “Do you know where you go?”</span> <span id="s674">I said, “No.</span> <span id="s675">Is it Bata?</span> <span id="s676">Is it Svit?”</span> <span id="s677">He said, “No.</span> <span id="s678">You are going to Poland, and your families will go after you, and you will never return from there.”</span> <span id="s679">So I was shocked.</span> <span id="s680">He didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s681">I turned away and I left.</span> <span id="s682">I didn’t say to the girls nothing because I didn’t want to create some panic, and I don’t -- didn’t want for him make some problems, so I didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s683">Only in the lager, when I was in Auschwitz, so I thought about him many times, I thought, well maybe this soldier wanted to help me, because we were somehow only alone there when they [indecipherable] only him and me.</span> <span id="s684">And

times.</span> <span id="s693">And I thought that you were willing to help me.</span> <span id="s694">Do you remember me?”</span> <span id="s695">He said, “Yes, I remember you.”</span> <span id="s696">He said, “Yes, I wanted to help you.”</span> <span id="s697">Maybe he wanted, maybe he said it after the war, I don’t know, but that’s what he said.</span> <span id="s698">He left, and I never met him again, he never entered the store.</span> <span id="s699">Was interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">Q: That’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

id="s919">That was very scary, so many soldiers, so many SS.</span> <span id="s920">And what we spotted was this -- I think on the train station, there were a few men, I don’t know how many, maybe could be 10 - 15 men, 20 men, or more than 20, in this uniforms, this -- this off white and blue stripes, and a little cap, with shovels working.</span> <span id="s921">And this is -- uniforms, they were new, and they didn’t look at us, they were working.</span> <span id="s922">Then we knew that something wrong, cause they were so dressed, and used these shovels and didn’t look at us, so -- so [indecipherable] it was my purpose that we see where we are and so.</span> <span id="s923">And then we had to line up in five, and we had -- we took the direction to -- to the entrance Arbeit Macht Frei.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: There we were.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">Q: You entered Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">A:

id="s934">So, we didn’t have to know too much more.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: You knew this was not going to be the best situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Wasn’t [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s937">Not the Bata company for shoes, no, that be -- yes, and during the way -- during the trip, during the trip, when the trains stopped somewhere, it was still snow, not the 23rd, the 25th, was still snow.</span> <span id="s938">We went to a forest, and with my knowledge of geography -- Hugo would laugh at me, I thought maybe we are in Siberia.</span> <span id="s939">It’s cold, snow, forest and forest and forest, where are we?</span> <span id="s940">So then stopped the train, and some people were at the train station there.</span> <span id="s941">So I asked in Slovak, “Where are we?”</span> <span id="s942">And somebody said, “You are in Poland,” in Polish language.</span> <span id="s943">So we knew that [indecipherable] we are in Poland, and I was sitting next to a girl who was teaching in a kindergarten, so we started to talk about escaping.</span> <span id="s944">We will escape from here, from Poland.</span> <span id="s945">Was very easy to make plans, but -- we came there, we didn’t stopped --</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: You didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: -- she didn’t arrive, she didn’t survive, no.</span></p> <p><span

we came there, to Auschwitz, into the lager, after the Arbeit Macht Frei, everybody was watching, means Arbeit Macht Frei.</span> <span id="s956">And the SS ladies, the SS women, they said, “Drop all your belongings here in the corner.”</span> <span id="s957">So we left everything we dropped there what we had, every -- my rucksack, my suitcase, everything, and zaehlappell, yeah?</span> <span id="s958">So line up into five.</span> <span id="s959">And one girl went to the SS woman and she said, “There woman took my shoes from my suitcase.”</span> <span id="s960">They were haftlings,

id="s977">So then you line up, and what do they do?</span> <span id="s978">They just count you?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: They said the rules of behavior and obedience.</span> <span id="s980">And they said, when you will work, you will get out from here, because Arbeit Macht Frei.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: So what were the rules?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: To

when we have to work, and then we will be free.</span> <span id="s986">And it was, you can imagine how quiet it was there.</span> <span id="s987">We lined up in five.</span> <span id="s988">We have to stretch our hands, it was always [indecipherable] the distance that’s between us --</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: The dist -- uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: -- you can -- they can

so</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">Q: So it’s a very brutal experience, I imagine, so different from anything that you’ve ever experienced or imagined in your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">A: Next to me in the line, next to me was standing a girl, she was before -- in -- in high school, she was my schoolmate, we were friends, Martha Cohen was her name.</span> <span id="s1008">And she told

any more.</span> <span id="s1013">But injections were there, she couldn’t take [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1014">Then when we were standing -- but no, later on [indecipherable] when we’re in the barracks, then 10 girls disappeared, that’s the rumor, oh she -- she -- she is not here.</span> <span id="s1015">10 girls disappeared right away that first evening and we were scared what happened to them, 10 girls went away.</span> <span id="s1016">So we were always occupied with something.</span> <span id="s1017">The entertainment.</span> <span id="s1018">In the morning we were again on

nobody -- and I will survive.</span> <span id="s1225">But basically nobody will survive, nobody, because at the last time, at the last day, they will -- they will throw bombs or something.</span> <span id="s1226">The last day they will kill us all.</span> <span id="s1227">So if alls I hoped, I believed, but logically, nobody will survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">Q: Okay, let’s

id="s1280">Everybody was alone.</span> <span id="s1281">Now on the bunk where we slept, so when somebody sleep there whom I knew from home, I knew him.</span> <span id="s1282">But somebody else, I didn’t bother about his name, or her name, no.</span> <span id="s1283">Everybody was alone.</span> <span id="s1284">We came there, and we lie down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: So if you knew

sister to me.</span> <span id="s1294">I still didn’t forget her.</span> <span id="s1295">I never had a sister and she was like my sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: Dieter Rishter, from Bratislava.</span> <span id="s1298">Was a story -- I have so many stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">Q: That’s great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">A: When I was home, at home, my uncle the teacher, he was not much older than me because he was from the second husband of my grandmother, yeah.</span> <span id="s1301">He wasn’t much older.</span> <span id="s1302">Even I liked him like [indecipherable] boy, and so -- so I went once in his room, and I saw there a letter lying on the table, I was looking at it.</span> <span id="s1303">And there was a little picture, little picture of a girl, and it was signed like, eira Dieter, eira Dieter, yeah.</span> <span id="s1304">I didn’t ask anybody.</span> <span id="s1305">I always had the nature not to ask, I don’t ask people anything.</span> <span id="s1306">When they s -- you say something to me, you say [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1307">So I was -- and I remembered this name Dieter, yes, and I knew that was from Bratislava, because he went, this cousin, to visit.</span> <span id="s1308">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1309">And went to [indecipherable] in the lager, and there -- you see, when people cannot fight enemies, yeah, Americans with the Canadians, with Mexicans and so they turn against groups, yeah.</span> <span id="s1310">So was in lager also.</span> <span id="s1311">The first day, the girls started.</span> <span id="s1312">Oh you western girls, be ashamed, all you eastern girls, yes.</span> <span id="s1313">I was from west Slovakia, or east Slovakia -- my direction is always [indecipherable] -- east Slovakia, Bratislava was from west Slovakia.</span> <span id="s1314">So -- and once, in 1942, we were in Birkenau right aw -- right away, yes, was maybe in -- in -- no, I don’t ri -- in winter after we came there.</span> <span id="s1315">We were standing the whole Sunday outside, was cold, very cold.</span> <span id="s1316">We are standing there.</span> <span id="s1317">And that time I think we didn’t have more these uniforms, we were somehow in civil dresses, and we had the line.</span> <span id="s1318">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1319">There was a group of girls and they played around and talked and so, and they were from the other part of Slovakia, and they asked me where I am from.</span> <span id="s1320">I said from this part of slo -- said, oh, you are the same like we are.</span> <span id="s1321">You are -- you don’t belong there [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1322">I was very honored, yes.</span> <span id="s1323">Bigger group.</span> <span id="s1324">So and there was a girl and they played around with her joking, and said -- oh, somebody said, oh my Dieter.</span> <span id="s1325">Dieter, yeah.</span> <span id="s1326">And I ask her, “Are you Dieter Rishter?”</span> <span id="s1327">She said, “Yes, I am Dieter Rishter.”</span> <span id="s1328">So -- because he told me her name is Dieter Rishter.</span> <span id="s1329">So I said, my uncle is whoever.</span> <span id="s1330">She said, oh, I remember him very well.</span> <span id="s1331">And then I stayed with them, and she said, come with me, come with me, we will be together.</span> <span id="s1332">Because we could move our bunks, yes, and in this barrack where we were, there were beds, everybody had one bed, not this bunk.</span> <span id="s1333">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1334">But two -- two girls slept together because these beds were -- come, come with me, we will be together.</span> <span id="s1335">She has a -- she had the older sister there.</span> <span id="s1336">So then I stayed with her, and we became very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s1337">We worked together, we were in the same commando and we were together.</span> <span id="s1338">But she became sick.</span> <span id="s1339">And when we had our biggest, biggest selection, 1943, so she had swollen legs.</span> <span id="s1340">We were sitting in the sauna the whole night on benches and so, so she had up her legs and I was massaging her legs, she was very, very sick.</span> <span id="s1341">I took care of her.</span> <span id="s1342">And then in the -- the whole night we were sitting there in the sauna, and during the morning we had to line up, and it was a selection, and that was the biggest, biggest selection, because always when the lager was full, it wasn’t place where to sleep, then they made the selection.</span> <span id="s1343">Between that time we went back to the other barrack, we had -- we slept on these bunks and so -- and so it was a big selection, very big, first they took one, then five left, and so on and so on and so.</span> <span id="s1344">So I asked myself someday, how come that they never selected me, that they never pointed on me.</span> <span id="s1345">So I came to the conclusion, maybe it’s true, because I never looked at them.</span> <span id="s1346">[indecipherable] like this.</span> <span id="s1347">I was straight, and I never looked up there.</span> <span id="s1348">I says, and maybe they pointed and I didn’t see.</span> <span id="s1349">But I think [indecipherable] maybe [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1350">Anyhow, so I put Dieter in front of me, Dieter do -- she spoke German, you go in front of me, and I will follow you on the selection, because I was so sure that I will make it, that time.</span> <span id="s1351">So she pointed like that, and she went, and I was praying, oh my God, help me, Dieter should pass by.</span> <span id="s1352">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1353">So -- and she went, she passed.</span> <span id="s1354">They didn’t take her to the gas chamber, she passed by.</span> <span id="s1355">I was so happy, thanks God.</span> <span id="s1356">Dieter went through sick.</span> <span id="s1357">And then we had to line up again and then they send us to barracks, to different barracks, here, here, we stopped, so, so, so -- so I lost her, no.</span> <span id="s1358">She went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s1359">And the next day in the morning, I don’t remember if we didn’t go to work or so, or maybe early morning, I went from one barrack to the other one to call her name.</span> <span id="s1360">Dieter Rishter, Dieter Rishter.</span> <span id="s1361">No answer.</span> <span id="s1362">So I went to the next barrack, and to next barrack.</span> <span id="s1363">And somebody said, “Dieter Rishter died.”</span> <span id="s1364">She survived the selection, but she died, sick and exhausted.</span> <span id="s1365">So what happened?</span> <span id="s1366">She went down from the [indecipherable] from the bank [indecipherable] she had to go down.</span> <span id="s1367">She went down, she fell down.</span> <span id="s1368">And she wasn’t [indecipherable] they took her to the -- through to -- to the other [indecipherable] and I lost Dieter.</span> <span id="s1369">I cannot still forget her, such a nice girl.</span> <span id="s1370">So -- and before -- excuse me -- before her, her sister died, before her, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: So you were together for a -- a year --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: A few months --</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: A few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: -- or maybe longer, I don’t know, maybe longer.</span> <span id="s1375">We made even business together, because she was [indecipherable] work -- working on a place with clothing, you know, from the gas chamber when the people arrived.</span> <span id="s1376">They had to drop there the things, they didn't arrive to the lager to leave them.</span> <span id="s1377">And then they carried the things to our company and we had to -- to -- to fold them, to bundle them, and they send it, probably to Germany.</span> <span id="s1378">And people had some jewelries, diamonds, and -- in their clothing, yeah.</span> <span id="s1379">So it was there a pile of this clothing and they have to sortir it, and she was on the pile and I was folding, yeah.</span> <span id="s1380">So she said once, when I will call summerkleider, summer dresses, so you come, that means that I found something, some jewelry, something.</span> <span id="s1381">So once she found ducats -- ducats, golden ducats, golden [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: So I took it a few ounce, I think eight or so.</span> <span id="s1384">And there was a man, because he worked in a -- in a -- in a -- in the compound where men were, so there was a block -- she was hannah blockalteste, he was a blockalteste, Polish man.</span> <span id="s1385">I used to see him to come in -- into work place, so -- and I noticed that he takes something from girls and then he brings something.</span> <span id="s1386">So I stopped him, I said I have ducats, I have golden ducats, I gave him.</span> <span id="s1387">So for these eight big golden ducats, he gives maybe four little breads, and -- a-and a margarine, I think a [indecipherable] for this one, so we had for two, three days.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: Was that Pinkus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1389">A: Excuse me?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">Q: Was his name Pinkus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: You -- you don’t know his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: I don’t know his name.</span> <span id="s1394">You heard about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: I her -- I think he may be the same person, I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1398">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">Q: Let -- let’s go back before Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1400">You -- y-you are in Auschwitz one from March 26th until --</span></p>

laundry, then I worked in a naishtuber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">Q: That’s the sewing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">A: The sewing room, til May -- til -- til older women came, they exchanged us, and then I went to work into Ausenkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Which is a demolition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: Demolition.</span> <span id="s1420">Demolition with picks and so, concrete buildings, which they were demolished and we had to finish them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: Right, you had a -- like a big pole, you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: That’s -- that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: You were on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: -- the side of this pole, yes?</span></p>

id="s1430">A: These picks, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: So let’s go back, wh-when you got the job in the laundry, who assigned people to the job?</span> <span id="s1432">Do you have any reco -- recollection?</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: By accident probably, but I asked a girl, she was in this block 10, her name was Bluma.</span> <span id="s1434">I think she was from Bratislava, I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1435">She passed away [indecipherable] from Tsipi.</span> <span id="s1436">She worked as a assistant to the kapo, I don’t know how she got this job, in the laundry, and I asked her to take me to the laundry.</span> <span id="s1437">I thought the laundry cannot be so bad.</span> <span id="s1438">So she took me for night shift.</span> <span id="s1439">So I worked there as a -- during night shift, but it wasn’t good for -- I wasn’t a strong girl.</span> <span id="s1440">I was a weak girl, and I had to rest, and I couldn’t relax during the day, during -- during night I worked.</span> <span id="s1441">So I came to -- during the day to the b-block.</span> <span id="s1442">So it was noisy, always on mo -- I couldn’t sleep.</span> <span id="s1443">So I was very tired.</span> <span id="s1444">But I went on and on and on, we had to -- to wash and so, and that happened an accident to me.</span> <span id="s1445">You know these disin -- disinfection water was in a -- in a bucket, and when we worked there one day the kapo said that we have to come to the other room where they [indecipherable] because a transport was coming.</span> <span id="s1446">So we made order clean the basin, and everything there.</span> <span id="s1447">And there was a bucket with -- with disinfection water, and she pointed on me and she said, this water, this water, that she said, she didn’t say what, in German, this water.</span> <span id="s1448">To me it seemed to be a dirty water, so I poured it into canal.</span> <span id="s1449">So she came to me and she slapped me and slapped me, so that I couldn't feel my -- my face, was numb totally.</span> <span id="s1450">And then she -- she slapped me so far, that I -- I di -- I was standing there, I didn’t feel anything more, slap, slap, slap.</span> <span id="s1451">But next day when I went back, I thought, what can I do?</span> <span id="s1452">She’ll be angry at me.</span> <span id="s1453">I will go and I will apologize.</span> <span id="s1454">And I went to apologize.</span> <span id="s1455">I said, it didn’t hurt me that you beat me so much, but it hurt me that I made something wrong, that I made you

for roads, for road, digging soil.</span> <span id="s1587">Then we took the soil from one place to the other one, and so prepare for roads with the this one.</span> <span id="s1588">Sometimes I went like the time with Tsipi on a field, too.</span> <span id="s1589">Sometimes we went -- in the wintertime I remember we went -- we took over some straw from one place to the other one, some useless things.</span> <span id="s1590">And for months, for a few months, I was working weeding out the field for -- for gummy plant [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1591">Gummy?</span> <span

id="s1635">Q: That’s later.</span> <span id="s1636">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1637">A: As I will tell you later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1640">Q: We were talking about the shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1641">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1642">Q: And -- and the problem you

Auschwitz one, in Auschwitz one, and I had good shoes with laces, high shoes, good shoes, but it was I think in the spring, because I remember that the sole was wet sometimes, and -- and cold still.</span> <span id="s1649">So I don’t know which month it could have been, yes.</span> <span id="s1650">Maybe between -- between the naishtuber, laundry, maybe between the laundry, because from laundry I went to the naishtuber between -- before.</span> <span id="s1651">So we had to wear impossible thing, our shoes on our shoulders.</span> <span id="s1652">You tied the shoes to put on the shoulder, and barefoot in to walk to a forest where there were little stones like gravel, yeah?</span> <span id="s1653">And we have to walk, so -- and [indecipherable] little gravels, they were cold, and they were wet.</span> <span id="s1654">And first of all my -- my soles, they became hard and -- and painful, yes, you mention, like that.</span> <span id="s1655">Later on the soles, they became hard, trained well, no problem.</span> <span id="s1656">But my eyes, probably from an infa -- an inflammation from these cold stones.</span> <span id="s1657">So on my eyelashes, they were some kind of glue.</span> <span id="s1658">You know, when I woke up in the morning, I couldn’t open my eyes, cause they were so dry on the eyelashes, got dry glue.</span> <span id="s1659">So I had to take off little by little, little by little.</span> <span id="s1660">And then next night again happened, yes, so I was -- I was f -- quite for a few -- for a time with this -- my eyes, and -- and one morning, I w -- yeah, so we -- we had to walk barefooten, we worked with the shoes, and then we had to take off the shoes, and to come back again barefooten, again this -- to this -- through this -- was so bad, thank God, I still feel chilly when I think about it.</span> <span id="s1661">So one day I was standing on zaeh -- zaehlappell, and I used to stand in the -- I don’t know why, in the front, first one.</span> <span id="s1662">And suddenly was quie -- very quiet, very quiet, and I heard this name Himmler.</span> <span id="s1663">I knew who was him, who was Himmler.</span> <span id="s1664">I looked around, not frar -- far from me was standing Himmler, with his fancy gla -- eyeglasses.</span> <span id="s1665">Oh my God, I was so scared that Himmler will look at me, and he’ll see my -- my -- my eyes, I thought this [indecipherable] I heard the Gypsies, they used to have [indecipherable] too.</span> <span id="s1666">I was so scared he would send me for death.</span> <span id="s1667">I didn't know that time gas chambers was in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1668">So I moved slowly, slowly in the back, he shouldn’t see me, I should save myself from Himmler.</span> <span id="s1669">He was standing there looking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1670">Q: So you did take risks, didn’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: I took --</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: Cause it was risky for you to move.</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: I took always risks.</span> <span id="s1674">I took always risks.</span> <span id="s1675">And I couldn't when I saw the situation is bad, I cannot lose anything, then I took risks.</span> <span id="s1676">But I cannot lose anything, only my life, and this was a risk by itself.</span> <span id="s1677">Yeah, so I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1678">Q: Where did that come from?</span> <span id="s1679">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1684">But I had to do.</span> <span id="s1685">What can I lose?</span> <span id="s1686">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">Q: Did you see dead bodies in Auschwitz one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">A: Body?</span></p> <p><span id="s1689">Q: Dead bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Dead bodies?</span></p> <p><span id="s1691">Q: Yes, corpses.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">A: In Auschwitz one, I don’t remember, no.</span> <span id="s1693">But in be -- Birkenau a lot, a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1694">Q: So in Auschwitz one, there was a gas chamber, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">A: Yes, but we didn’t know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">Q: You didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">Q: So you didn’t smell anything funny?</span></p> <p><span id="s1699">A: No, nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1700">Q: Nothing.</span> <span id="s1701">And nobody’s said anything to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1702">A: But we knew when we were standing in the evening on zaehlappell, so far away, like in a forest, there were moving people, bodies moving, somehow it was far, so it seemed to me, or it m-meant to me that they are in white uniforms, they are moving around, and flame, we saw flame there.</span> <span id="s1703">And there was a rumor always, we talked about lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Said there is the place where they burn people.</span> <span id="s1706">It was flame, and people were moving there.</span> <span id="s1707">But later on I learned that they burned outside the crematoriums, people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">Q: Uh-huh, right [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">A: But I didn’t see close to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">Q: Did you hear about shooting in -- in Auschwitz one, that there was a punishment block, that they were shooting, did you -- did you hear about that when you were there?</span> <span id="s1711">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">A: Not about that, but I -- I heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">Q: You hear -- you heard it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">A: Yes, very silently, very, very silently.</span> <span id="s1715">I was in block 10 -- block 10, that was a last -- well, you said it, in Auschwitz were 11 blocks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">Q: I think.</span> <span id="s1717">In Auschwitz one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: You are right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: And you were in 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: I was in 10.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: And on the 10, on block 10 on the -- and I was sleeping next to the window at the end.</span> <span id="s1725">[indecipherable] block, block, block, the end, and I was sleeping at the window at the end.</span> <span id="s1726">And there were boards on the windows, boards, but there were little distances between the boards, yes, wooden boards.</span> <span id="s1727">Little, little distances, and used to look during the day when I came -- it was light, yeah, but at the beginning I even didn’t go for a few days to work because I was washing the stairs and the -- and -- and the -- the floors and whatever.</span> <span id="s1728">It made me sickening, that was depressing.</span> <span id="s1729">So anyhow, during the day when we came early probably, I don’t know what time, I cannot say that, but I know that was light then, until August was lighter in the day [indecipherable] the little distances, I saw these high, high poles, steel from st -- I think from steel, wood, or steel, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1730">They were high poles, that’s for sure, a pole like this, and then crosswise on the top, and there I saw a man, young men -- they were high, again I say high, higher than a man.</span> <span id="s1731">They were hanging like that, the hands in the back like this, like this, and here betwe -- they were hanging on the poles so that their feet didn’t reach the floor -- the earth -- the floor, yes?</span> <span id="s1732">The earth -- the concrete or what.</span></p> <p><span id="s1733">Q: So they -- they were being hung by their hands behind their back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1734">A: Yeah, they were hanged there.</span> <span id="s1735">So I saw this one, always a few, few, few.</span> <span id="s1736">And then during the night, sometimes -- sometimes, not always, sometimes I -- but I was always scared to look th-there, I knew I don’t have to see that, was a silent shooting, very silently, cause I was at the window.</span> <span id="s1737">And I didn't look out so I wouldn’t see, because it was darkness probably, I don’t -- no, I didn’t look.</span> <span id="s1738">But I heard silent shooting.</span> <span id="s1739">So I thought, oh, now they are killing, and now after the war, I was in Auschwitz, and I asked somebody there [indecipherable] when I left [indecipherable] I met her in Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1740">I said, I didn’t see these poles where the people were hanging.</span> <span id="s1741">But then later somehow on -- before I -- before I ask, because then bef -- then I went through these barracks, becau -- and I saw in one place these pole.</span> <span id="s1742">And my son, I said, you see, these are these poles where people were hanging.</span> <span id="s1743">And she said it was a quiet [indecipherable] I says, and every night I heard a very, very silent shooting.</span> <span id="s1744">She said yes, during the night was this silent shooting.</span> <span id="s1745">And there is now a wall, a-and flowers and Slovak people put flowers.</span> <span id="s1746">I think it’s black.</span> <span id="s1747">And even the wooden walls, I think they are black now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1748">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1749">A: Yeah, because she asked me, was it painted?</span> <span id="s1750">I said no.</span> <span id="s1751">From this side was not, I didn’t see it from the other side.</span></p> <p><span id="s1752">Q: Yeah, Alice, when you say silent shooting, what -- what do you mean?</span> <span id="s1753">You mean that there was -- there was a silencer on the gun that -- or that you were so far away you could only hear it a little bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s1754">A: I wasn’t far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1755">Q: You weren’t far.</span></p> <p><span id="s1756">A: I’m far because I was -- I slept at the win -- next to the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1758">Which was close to that wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1759">A: It’s the closest to the wall.</span></p> <p><span id="s1760">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1761">A: So maybe was silent gun, I don’t understand [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: Yeah, but what were you hearing, a pop?</span> <span id="s1763">Just a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1764">A: Yeah, something like that, yes, not like boom, boom, in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1765">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1766">A: In combat in the field.</span> <span id="s1767">Not like that.</span> <span id="s1768">Silently.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: You -- you didn't help at all in building Birkenau.</span> <span id="s1770">Some of the prisoners were doing that.</span> <span id="s1771">Were you ever over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1772">A: In building?</span></p> <p><span id="s1773">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">A: No -- yes, the roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">Q: Roads.</span></p> <p><span id="s1776">A: We were building the roads and we were demolishing the houses, which they were demolished partially before.</span></p> <p><span id="s1777">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1778">A: We came like to a village, yes, like the village, and that we, for three months were demolishing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1779">Q: And that became Auschwitz-Birkenau?</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">A: I think --</span></p> <p><span id="s1781">Q: You think so, but you you’re -- but you’re not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">A: I think it.</span> <span id="s1783">I am not sure.</span> <span id="s1784">I know we demolished it there, that place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">A: -- and I know we worked on the roads that we -- we made it straight, how to say, plan-planate -- planarate -- in -- in, I would say --</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">Q: Planing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1788">A: Planing, maybe in German, I would say planating --</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Making it smooth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1790">A: We made it smooth and straight, yes, so we had to dig it, and shovels to dig out and to -- and to put it in this wooden container -- container --</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">Q: A wheelbarrow?</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">A: Yeah, something and take it to another place, and so on and so -- many useful thing -- useless things we had to -- from one place to the other one.</span> <span id="s1793">So we did something, yes.</span> <span id="s1794">And it was at the beginning where we worked at the roads, we [indecipherable] the roads, there was also a civilian who was leading this probably [indecipherable] and the kapos, and SS men, and we worked.</span> <span id="s1795">And then they were looking, so we were working when they were not looking and not working, and [indecipherable] see in -- in -- in German number -- number eight is acht.</span></p> <p><span id="s1796">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1797">A: Acht -- acht, and -- and be careful is achtung, no -- achtung, so the SS came close, when he turned, so we said that in Slovak is acht -- is acht -- achtung, so we said awesome is -- is -- awesome is acht.</span> <span id="s1798">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1799">Then we worked hard.</span> <span id="s1800">We couldn’t work always like that [indecipherable] it easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1801">Q: [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1802">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1803">A: We cannot be always a honest worker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1804">Q: No, not in a situation where they treated you so bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1805">A: No [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1806">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">A: No, so if I -- if I helped to -- to build, so I hel -- helped to destroy a place, and I helped to build the roads, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">Q: Were there lights in Auschwitz one?</span> <span id="s1809">Was it -- were there actual lights there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1810">A: I think that there were in the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1811">Q: In -- in the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">A: Yeah, I think so, but around the fences there were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1813">Q: There were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: There were high lights during -- with this high voltage electricity during the night.</span> <span id="s1815">When we arrived, the day when we arrived, and then always during nights, and the guards they were standing on towers and guarding us, the soldiers, yeah, was a [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1816">Q: So when did you find out that you were all -- all the women were being -- I know me -- men were going into aush -- into Auschwitz-Birkenau, they were already there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: The men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: [indecipherable] and being --</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Of the men I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1820">I knew that the women went there because when we came there, they were -- was some life there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">Q: They were there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1822">A: About the men, I -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1823">Q: So how -- you don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1824">A: I didn’t bother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: So did they announce to you what -- get up we’re going to ow -- Auschwitz-Birkenau?</span> <span id="s1826">I mean ho-how -- how did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1827">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1828">Probably it could happen that we were on a zaehlappell on a roll call, and they said now turn and we go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1829">Q: And you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1830">A: There’s nothing to take.</span> <span id="s1831">Moving was very easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1832">Q: Nothing to -- nothing to pack, easy, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">A: I cannot remember, I think and think if this container in which we ate, you know the bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">Q: The bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1835">A: If we took it with us or we -- or we left it in the -- in the barrack and -- and then we got it when -- received it when we ar -- I cannot -- I don’t remember, this I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1836">Q: Did you carry the bowl with you all the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1837">A: No, that what I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1838">I know that we had some little sack hanging, and I don’t remember where we took the material to sew it and a needle.</span> <span id="s1839">I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1840">I can see myself only suddenly hanging here something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1841">Q: Something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1842">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: And what was in it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: And a little -- a little bit of bread which we saved from the evening.</span></p> <p><span id="s1845">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1846">A: And maybe a -- a first knife or s -- when somebody found somewhere on the field a little -- a little steel or something, and we sharped it on -- on -- on a stone, an-and we cut our bread.</span> <span id="s1847">So maybe these -- maybe we found somewhere a -- I don’t know how we got a spoon, I don’t know, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1848">Q: You weren’t given a spoon, you were given the bowl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1849">A: The bowl, but I don’t remember we carried the -- with us when we went to work far, where we were serve.</span> <span id="s1850">I don’t think -- I cannot see the -- the move around, I know we have only this little sack, and a little bread, and if we had a little plate, this is to cut our bread and [indecipherable] I don’t remember that, this I don’t.</span> <span id="s1851">I know only a little bread, and on the way to work, always a bite.</span> <span id="s1852">It was easy, because we didn’t have to think too much, we -- our thinking went so far as into the [indecipherable] I have still a slice of bread, I get still a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s1853">Q: So -- so your mental state becomes smaller and smaller?</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">A: Smaller and smaller.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">Q: So that you think about very few things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1856">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1857">The emotions, they tend to apathy, total apathy.</span> <span id="s1858">You think, I do this, I will think about food, I will think about when they will -- no, only when we arrive -- when we arrive back afterward, we think if we have a blanket to cover ourselves.</span> <span id="s1859">Little things, we -- if it is cold, if it is --</span></p> <p><span id="s1860">Q: If you picture the barrack and your bed in Auschwitz one, do you see the bowl there?</span> <span id="s1861">Do you think that you left the bowl on the bed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1862">A: Not on the bed, maybe there was a little room, concrete floor, maybe -- may -- there were servants stumalteste, stumdienst, maybe.</span> <span id="s1863">Maybe they got there, th-that they put it there, and they washed it there, but it wasn’t dirty because if you didn’t wash it -- in Birkenau, we didn’t have water.</span> <span id="s1864">So couldn’t be so dirty that [indecipherable] after food.</span> <span id="s1865">So probably they carried from -- probably.</span> <span id="s1866">I don’t know -- know, I speculate on it.</span> <span id="s1867">Probably they got from the sauna, water, the sauna in a bucket or so, and they washed it there and they left it and then we took it from there.</span> <span id="s1868">A little room at the end of the barrack -- of the block.</span> <span id="s1869">I -- I don’t remember how it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1870">Q: So do you remember entering Birkenau in August of ’43, do you remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s1871">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1872">Q: -- that first day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1873">A: Yes, yes, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1874">Q: What -- what can you tell me about it?</span> <span id="s1875">What was it like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1876">A: We entered and -- and difference was that they were brick barracks, brick blocks in Auschwitz, also brick blocks, but they were lower -- lower brick blocks.</span> <span id="s1877">And in Auschwitz we had beds, bed, everybody has a bed, or we didn’t have -- and there were these bunks, in Birkenau were bunks, one, two, three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1878">Q: And it’s three, three high, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1879">A: Three, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1880">Q: And more than two people are sleeping on each bunk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1881">A: Oh my God.</span> <span id="s1882">Yes, depends how many people were in the block.</span> <span id="s1883">There were also sometimes five people, and -- and so I fell once down during the night when I had to go on it, so we were four like that, and above us like that, crosswise.</span> <span id="s1884">And I was afraid to s -- that I will sit on -- on this person who is crosswise, so I went to the end, very end.</span> <span id="s1885">So I -- I went to the end.</span> <span id="s1886">So I fell on my back on the concrete, and was a big boom.</span> <span id="s1887">In the morning I went to work, and back pain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1888">Q: In a lot of pain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1889">A: Oh, ho, how.</span> <span id="s1890">I still remember.</span> <span id="s1891">I was young.</span></p> <p><span id="s1892">Q: But it’s interesting, because as bad as Auschwitz one was, Birkenau was much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: Much worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: In b -- in Auschwitz, we didn’t know about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1896">We didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1897">We worked, was very, very hard to work.</span> <span id="s1898">We didn’t know about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1899">When we came from work we ran around into the -- into this washroom or whatever, there were horizontal pipes, went to clean up, and maybe we washed something.</span> <span id="s1900">There were toilets, there were toilets, I -- I remember, so maybe I am wrong, but in my memories that there were -- yes, surely there were toilets, because there were toilet rumors.</span> <span id="s1901">We went in the toilet and we heard rumor that the -- the wagons are from Slovakia here, they came to pick up us, and so on, so -- there were toil -- there were toilets, there is wasser -- water [indecipherable] more.</span> <span id="s1902">We were not gas -- there were gas chambers, which I saw after when I went, after the war, two or three ga -- not gas chambers but crematorium.</span> <span id="s1903">Were no gas chambers, at least we didn’t know about the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1904">We worked very hard.</span> <span id="s1905">The same food, but it was easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: It was easier than in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Yeah, yeah, it was easier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: So Birkenau becomes a shock.</span> <span id="s1909">There is no running water, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1910">A: No run -- only in the sauna.</span> <span id="s1911">In the sauna they used for us and we went for delousing, get delousing.</span> <span id="s1912">And that time [indecipherable] the delousing we went to a -- to a real sauna where they used hot bricks, hot bricks and they pour water on it, so it was a steam, so we went in the steam.</span> <span id="s1913">And there were showers in the sauna, in the same building, yes.</span> <span id="s1914">It was -- but outside was -- it was not -- it wasn’t a toilet, was a latrine, yeah.</span> <span id="s1915">And we had to go far up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1916">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1917">It’s a -- a room with just lots of holes in it, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">A: Not holes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">Q: Holes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">A: The hole was open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">Q: Ah, period, completely open.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">A: Open, and there was like a bench, and we had to -- we went on the bench, and -- and we lean to there, and -- and we hold it on.</span> <span id="s1923">It was also -- they had also -- it was on one side up the hill, and down there were toilets, but a German haftlings, for the German prisoners.</span> <span id="s1924">The Germans.</span> <span id="s1925">They had -- had toilet, but not a toilet like that.</span> <span id="s1926">Was something also like a latrine, something like that, that was a clean one and so for the Germans.</span> <span id="s1927">They didn’t let us at the beginning, only at the end then, the -- they said the Slovaks [indecipherable] Slovaks.</span></p> <p><span id="s1928">Q: The Slovak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1929">A: Yeah, the Slovaks there had [indecipherable] Slovaks make a [indecipherable] and in our barrack where we were, and I was [indecipherable] and with Tsipi.</span> <span id="s1930">You know with Tsipi?</span> <span id="s1931">You know her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1932">Q: Tsipi?</span> <span id="s1933">Helen Teshauer</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: Yeah, yeah, her, her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1935">Q: Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1936">A: So there we -- we had toilets, regular toilets, there we had toilets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1937">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1938">A: Yeah, we had -- it was elite -- elite barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: That’s a little later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: So I came up, up, up, up, up, up, up.</span></p> <p><span id="s1941">Q: Yes, up, up, up, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1942">A: Was a risk, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1943">Q: So, you go to B1A, right?</span> <span id="s1944">The b -- the -- the part that was the women’s camp in Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s1945">A: Yeah, B --</span></p> <p><span id="s1946">Q: B -- B1A.</span></p> <p><span id="s1947">A: Yeah, we called it Birkenau -- Birkenau A, yes, ba -- bar -- yes, and the -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1948">Q: And -- and the men were in B1B.</span></p> <p><span id="s1949">A: Probably, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1950">Q: Do you remember what barrack you were in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1951">A: I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1952">Q: In the beginning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1953">A: In -- in Birkenau --</span></p> <p><span id="s1954">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1955">A: I think it was 27.</span></p> <p><span id="s1956">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1957">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1958">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1959">A: I cannot swear.</span> <span id="s1960">I think so.</span> <span id="s1961">I’m quite sure, but I cannot swear.</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">A: I cannot so -- it was 27, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">Q: So how -- how soon is it that you realize in Birkenau there are gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">A: Saw the crematories -- the crematoriums.</span></p> <p><span id="s1966">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1967">A: In these -- in block seven in Birkenau, I was only -- when I was a [indecipherable] registrar.</span></p> <p><span id="s1968">Q: Register.</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Yeah, before all [indecipherable] I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1971">A: I don’t -- before I cannot say one number, that was when I was a registrar.</span> <span id="s1972">Behind us I know was block 25, of the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1973">Q: The quarantine block, where they kept people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1974">A: Not quarantine -- they kept them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1975">Q: And then they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">A: Til they had enough for the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">Q: Right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1978">A: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1979">Quarantine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">Q: Well, they kept people there --</span></p> <p><span id="s1981">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1982">Q: And then they took them to the -- to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1983">A: From there, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1984">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1985">A: Sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1986">Q: So -- and sometimes not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1987">A: Sometimes not and it was -- when it was selection, they took them right away to the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s1988">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1989">A: Only when they -- when they took here and there somebody and they didn’t have enough so they kept them there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1990">Q: But they started to have -- there were some selections in Auschwitz one, yes?</span> <span id="s1991">So -- or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1992">A: I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1993">Q: But in Birkenau you started to have selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s1994">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1995">In Auschwitz one --</span></p> <p><span id="s1996">Q: One, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1997">A: The -- no -- yeah, it was Auschwitz one, we saw during that zaehlappell, sometimes a black closed car, a -- a truck or so, a closed one a black one.</span> <span id="s1998">So we used to say they take somebody.</span> <span id="s1999">And like these my friend, these -- who had insulin in -- in this one, the purse, in -- in the suitcase, I didn’t see her more, that means they were taken.</span> <span id="s2000">And also up the stairs was a little like a loft, a little room, and some family was looking out through the window, they didn’t go to zaehlappell and they loo -- used to smile at us, you know, they were so happy that they are there.</span> <span id="s2001">They didn’t go to -- but they disappeared also.</span> <span id="s2002">So they -- probably with these black car, they took people out.</span> <span id="s2003">An-And we used to hear or say that they’re in the forest with this white uniform, was where that flame, we say that they take there, the people to burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: To burn.</span></p> <p><span id="s2005">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">Q: So were you working in a demolition, in an au -- in Ausenkommando when you were in Birkenau at first, or did you immediately start working sorting clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2007">A: No, clothes I didn’t sew more, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s2008">Q: No, sort -- sort clothes, you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2009">A: Yeah, to sort -- no, no, no, no, no, no, Ausenkommando

Ausenkommando, to let’s say the fall, maybe October.</span></p> <p><span id="s2014">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2015">A: It was cold.</span> <span id="s2016">And then I took a risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s2017">Q: Yes, and what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2018">A: I -- I knew that I cannot make it more.</span> <span id="s2019">I was so tired, an-and hungry, and everything, and when I will go on like this, next selection I am going, they will take me, I cannot take it more.</span> <span id="s2020">So I took a risk and I stayed in the barrack, in the block, I didn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s2021">And I knew that I take a risk because when -- sometimes, once in awhile the SS, somebody from the SS came through, they went through the barrack, the blocks.</span> <span id="s2022">And when they found somebody who didn’t go to work, they took to block 25.</span> <span id="s2023">And I took this risk.</span> <span id="s2024">I said, I cannot.</span> <span id="s2025">I have to take risk that they will come today and they will take me to block 25.</span> <span id="s2026">I cannot walk, first, then I was lying there on the -- on the bunk, and the -- for lunchtime -- for lunchtime I went to the kitchen to -- to carry this food, that I helped them [indecipherable] and I was lying there.</span> <span id="s2027">And a girl came the afternoon, and she said, in the lager, they are selecting for a new commando.</span> <span id="s2028">So I went there, she said exactly where.</span> <span id="s2029">And that was the place where the -- we saw that there’s a new commando, it was called [indecipherable] a new uniform, stripe.</span> <span id="s2030">In the morning I lined up and I went to [indecipherable] this one.</span> <span id="s2031">And I was not safe, I was happy.</span> <span id="s2032">Had good work, yeah.</span> <span id="s2033">I stayed there for -- for October, ma-maybe through summer or so, ’43.</span> <span id="s2034">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">Q: 1943.</span></p> <p><span id="s2036">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2037">If I didn't take this risk, I collapsed, I couldn’t move.</span></p> <p><span id="s2038">Q: We will stop the tape now and take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Mm-hm, and drink a water.</span></p> <p><span id="s2040">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2041">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s2042">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: Alice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: We were talking about the first job that you had in Auschwitz-Birkenau.</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2047">Q: Which is after August, 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s2048">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2049">Q: Which is working in the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2050">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2051">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2052">A: This means wh-white cap, because we had this white scarves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Scarves, and that’s what you were wearing, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: Yeah, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: And this was where you were sorting clothes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2056">A: Yeah, because there was [indecipherable], in -- in Birkenau was a commando sc -- which they wore red scarves, so they were red scarves and that was the Canada called.</span> <span id="s2057">So they were the red scarves and we were the white scarves.</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">Q: So what was the difference between the work that you were doing sorting clothes and the work that Canada commando was doing sorting clothes, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">A: I couldn’t say exactly.</span> <span id="s2060">I think that we had from the gas chamber, things in the gas chamber, and people arrived straight there.</span> <span id="s2061">And those I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2062">We had that.</span> <span id="s2063">Maybe they had also from the gas chamber, but it was so much that they divided there, [indecipherable] that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2064">Q: And -- and your commando wasn’t connected with Canada commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s2065">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q: No, it was totally separate.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">A: Yeah, only when -- when the commando was closed, then we were transferred or suggested to go there --</span></p> <p><span id="s2068">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: -- yeah, to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Did you like working in that commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: In Canada, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: No, no, the other one [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2073">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">Q: And wh-why did you like that and you didn’t like the Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s2075">A: It was so relaxing there, relaxing.</span> <span id="s2076">We relaxing in [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2077">The commander, the SS, Scharfuehrer, was very nice, a nice man.</span> <span id="s2078">He was very helpful when it was longer -- for longer at zaehlappell, yes, roll call, and during that time was sometimes a selection after this roll call, so -- or when the commanders arrived, then he kept us longer there to work.</span> <span id="s2079">We didn't work, but he kept us longer and he phoned into the lager that we are very busy, that we have to stay longer, and so probably he saved many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: And we had to cross only from one -- from one ba -- not barrack, from one part to the other part through a big door, so we -- we avoided the main door also, by coming home and selection we avoided.</span> <span id="s2082">And then when it was -- it was typhus epidemic there, so he let many girls to sit on, and not to work.</span> <span id="s2083">And he asked for tea, for enough tea to drink.</span> <span id="s2084">So he carried in a lot of tea we should have enough, fever -- feverish and who couldn’t work, didn’t have to work.</span> <span id="s2085">He was a ma -- ma -- nice man.</span> <span id="s2086">That was very important.</span> <span id="s2087">And the other one, maybe he was also nice, but I didn’t like him, he was so noisy.</span> <span id="s2088">During the first lunch when I was there -- during lunch, as we ate, he said lie down all of you.</span> <span id="s2089">We had to put the food down an-and to lie down in the mud.</span> <span id="s2090">And then when -- after work, the girls -- not always, I wasn’t there for a -- for a few days, but sometimes we had to undress and so he looked through ours if we didn’t take something.</span> <span id="s2091">He was so s -- crazy.</span> <span id="s2092">Didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">Q: Do you remember the name of this nice man [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2094">A: Yeah, I think it Ambrose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Ambrose.</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: I think that Ambrose was his name, I think so.</span> <span id="s2097">Or something similar, because we called him Scharfuehrer.</span></p> <p><span id="s2098">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2099">Were you surprised that there would be somebody who was so nice in that position?</span> <span id="s2100">It’s an odd position to be in and then --</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">A: I wasn’t surprised, I was pleased.</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s2103">So how did it happen that you moved from this commando?</span> <span id="s2104">It was closed?</span></p> <p><span id="s2105">A: It was closed.</span> <span id="s2106">He -- it was closed, but in the meantime he wasn’t more there, the other one, somebody else came.</span> <span id="s2107">I don’t know what -- sometimes they placed to other places.</span> <span id="s2108">Maybe he was too nice, I don’t know, but -- what the reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s2109">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">A: And the other one, he wasn’t for long there, but he suggested me there for, because one day he came and he asked, who knows the difference between pure silk and artificial material.</span> <span id="s2111">I say, I know it, cause I learned at school.</span> <span id="s2112">So then I was, from the bundles I had to find a pure silk lingerie to take out and to bundle it differently.</span> <span id="s2113">So he knew that I am not stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">A: I was -- I was quiet, but I knew things.</span> <span id="s2116">And then the other one, the new one from Canada asked, “What’s your name?”</span> <span id="s2117">And I didn’t answer [indecipherable] say -- so he said, “How is she -- how is she smart, she doesn’t know how to talk even.”</span> <span id="s2118">And he said, “Yes, she knows how to talk.”</span> <span id="s2119">So he took me.</span> <span id="s2120">But I didn’t like him, you know, it was -- for -- for a Auschwitz, wasn’t the attitude, not the -- the girls they were used to him, so they laughed, they joked with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">Q: Yeah [indecipherable] but you didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s2122">A: I couldn’t, no.</span> <span id="s2123">Didn’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s2124">Q: Were these commandos protected commandos, there were no selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">A: No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">Q: There were selections?</span></p> <p><span id="s2127">A: Were selection.</span> <span id="s2128">They came also later from Canada.</span> <span id="s2129">They came also later, so sometimes they avoided selections.</span> <span id="s2130">But this one [indecipherable] be avoided.</span> <span id="s2131">Once happened that in the morning one girl didn’t arrive, and somebody told him.</span> <span id="s2132">He was -- she was selected in the afternoon, or in the morning.</span> <span id="s2133">So he t-took his bike and he went there, and then in -- he returned, he said that he told them that she’s the best worker in his commando, when they will not return her, then she has to -- he has to close the commando, so then he brought her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: And he brought her back.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: Yeah, he was a -- a really -- a good man.</span></p> <p><span id="s2136">Q: But were there selections inside the commando?</span></p> <p><span id="s2137">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2138">Q: Only from the barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2139">A: The -- not from barrack --</span></p> <p><span id="s2140">Q: The say -- zaehlappell, when you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2141">A: Zaehlappell, or when they arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s2142">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2143">A: -- when we arrived from work or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2145">A: Or that time when I met this Dieter Rishter, and we’re standing the whole Sunday, after, when we came into the lager, there was a ditch, a ditch.</span> <span id="s2146">So we had to jump through the ditch.</span> <span id="s2147">And who didn’t make it, went to chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2150">Q: So you had to jump over the ditch?</span></p> <p><span id="s2151">A: Yeah, through, through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2152">Q: Through it?</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">A: Through it.</span> <span id="s2154">It’s a ditch like this, yes, from here to there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2155">Q: Oh, you mean -- so you went --</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">A: Over --</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">Q: -- over it --</span></p> <p><span id="s2158">A: -- over the ditch.</span></p> <p><span id="s2159">Q: -- over it from one side to the other.</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">A: Over -- side to over.</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">Q: And if someone fell --</span></p> <p><span id="s2162">A: I-I wasn’t there, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2163">Q: That’s what you were told?</span></p> <p><span id="s2164">A: -- the back -- they said from the front that who cannot jump over, they take you away because [indecipherable] standing there, but it was before.</span></p> <p><span id="s2165">Q: So when you went to the Canada commando, you didn't stay for very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">Q: How long?</span></p> <p><span id="s2168">A: Few days, and I wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s2169">Q: A few days?</span></p> <p><span id="s2170">A: -- no, for a few days, for a few -- and then I went to Ausenkommando.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: And that was less difficult for you.</span> <span id="s2172">You liked that better, being outside [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">A: I decided.</span> <span id="s2174">I decided I go rather to Ausenkommando, what will happen will happen.</span> <span id="s2175">And then, from that, what I -- it was a good decision because I would have stayed in Canada.</span> <span id="s2176">But from Ausenkommando -- Ausenkommando I took a [indecipherable] a risk.</span> <span id="s2177">Say that’s enough, now I have to do something else.</span> <span id="s2178">So -- and then I became a Laeuferin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2179">Q: And how did that happen?</span> <span id="s2180">Can you explain?</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2182">That was risky.</span> <span id="s2183">There was -- was a Rapportfuehrer, an SS, his name was Hans Tauber, Austrian.</span> <span id="s2184">He was very bad, he was very bad.</span> <span id="s2185">Always on the back and he was hitting.</span> <span id="s2186">He had always something in his boot, here, some -- some -- I don’t know, [indecipherable] or what.</span> <span id="s2187">He was hitting --</span></p> <p><span id="s2188">Q: A whip?</span> <span id="s2189">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">A: -- he -- every pers -- yes, he was hitting, and he was selecting, he was everything bad.</span> <span id="s2191">The both men in the la -- the both -- both men in the lager.</span> <span id="s2192">And I heard that they will open the other entrance, other entrance to the lager from the outside, entrance [indecipherable] and that they will need Laeuferins, you know Laeuferin?</span> <span id="s2193">Well, it’s like they send, run here, run here, there’s a Laeuferin come, go to the other door [indecipherable] go to this barrack, to this block and so -- so they needed, I heard that.</span> <span id="s2194">So I decided -- decided, I says, I will talk to Tauber, the worst.</span> <span id="s2195">And after the appell, after that zaehlappell, I was on the road, on the sidewalk and he went on his bike, this strong Tauber.</span> <span id="s2196">And I stopped him from the bike, and I said, Herr Rapportfuehrer, haftling [speaks German here].</span> <span id="s2197">Mr. Rapportfuehrer -- you will understand, yes, that want to talk -- talk to you.</span> <span id="s2198">So he went down from the bike, and was standing looking at me.</span> <span id="s2199">And I said, I am here from the very beginning -- it was true.</span> <span id="s2200">I didn’t say it between I was a [indecipherable] beginning, and I am -- I worked in Ausenkommando.</span> <span id="s2201">And I know that you are the only one who can help me.</span> <span id="s2202">I heard that you need Laeuferin, other Laeuferin.</span> <span id="s2203">I would like to be a Laeuferin.</span> <span id="s2204">And he said, “Go to Katya,” she was the -- the -- the main registrar.</span> <span id="s2205">Yeah, the Schreibstuber, Katya Singer.</span> <span id="s2206">“Go to her and say that I send you that she should place you in a other block where the Laeuferins are.”</span> <span id="s2207">So, thanks a lot.</span> <span id="s2208">And I let -- ran to Katya Singer, and I said, Tauber send me.</span> <span id="s2209">She said, I need a -- a written note from Tauber.</span> <span id="s2210">Couldn’t do anything else.</span> <span id="s2211">Next day -- morning, I went to Ausenkommando again, and then in the evening when it was zaehlappell, he came to the block, and he was choosing the other girl for Laeuferin.</span> <span id="s2212">So I went out to him, and I said, “Herr l-lager -- Herr Rapportfuehrer, I spoke to you yesterday and I went to Katya Singer, and she said that she wants -- she needs from you a note, a written note.”</span> <span id="s2213">She didn’t say -- he didn’t say anything, he said to the -- turned to the blockalteste and said, “Take her also to Katya, take both to Katya.”</span> <span id="s2214">So she took us to Katya, and I became Laeuferin.</span> <span id="s2215">And then I was safe, I didn’t go to selections, and I had a bed for myself, I had a nice block.</span> <span id="s2216">Became an [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2217">Q: Did you -- did you know of Katya Singer before?</span> <span id="s2218">Had you met her when you were in Auschwitz one, or --</span></p> <p><span

id="s2223">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2224">Q: But you knew about her -- when he said Katya Singer you knew --</span></p> <p><span id="s2225">A: I -- everybody knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2226">Q: Everybody knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s2227">A: Everybody knew [indecipherable] he didn’t have to say Singer, Katya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2228">Q: Katya, and you knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2229">A: Go to Katya, everybody knew Katya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2230">Q: Did you know also that Tsipi, Helen Teshauer was working with Katya?</span></p> <p><span

And that was -- no, no nevermore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2239">Q: Okay, ne -- nevermore.</span></p> <p><span id="s2240">A: No, only when I spoke to her by phone, she said that she was in Novaki with Katya, and then they said, I never saw you and I forgot about you.</span> <span id="s2241">She said sh -- I went to ask Katya and she put me some -- some -- somewhere -- some nationality, this

<p><span id="s2261">Q: So now you become a Laeuferin, which is essentially a runner, you -- you are --</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">A: Always running.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">Q: You’re always running and doing errands and sending messages --</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">A: Messages.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">Q: -- cause there is no phone system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">A: Like a messenger here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2267">Q: Like a messenger.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: Yeah, like a messenger.</span> <span id="s2269">I think that they had some -- some form in the -- in the main offices, in the SS, I said -- because I remember when -- when the other Rapportfuehrerin told me, go there to the -- to Lagerfuehrerin and say that the telephone doesn’t work.</span> <span id="s2270">So maybe they had between them --</span></p> <p><span id="s2271">Q: Yeah, right, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2272">A: -- between one and entrance and the other entrance, they had something, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2273">Q: -- but not -- but obviously not all through the whole system.</span></p> <p><span id="s2274">A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2275">Q: So -- this is going to sound like a really stupid question --</span></p> <p><span id="s2276">A: No, nothing is stupid.</span></p> <p><span id="s2277">Q: -- but is there -- is there training?</span> <span id="s2278">I mean, what did they tell you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2280">Q: -- no.</span> <span id="s2281">They just say go do this, go do that, whatever --</span></p> <p><span id="s2282">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2283">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2284">A: No training.</span></p> <p><span id="s2285">Q: So where do you start living?</span> <span id="s2286">You move out from the barrack you were in, and you move into barrack four?</span> <span id="s2287">Is that where all the --</span></p> <p><span id="s2288">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s2289">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">A: I moved into another barrack before --</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2292">A: -- but it four [indecipherable] there translators, they were Laeuferins before, they lived already there in a other barrack.</span> <span id="s2293">No, I was in block -- in -- in bar -- in lager A before, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2295">A: And then I was moving -- moved into lager B in wooden barracks, wooden.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Wooden barracks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Wooden barracks, and everybody had his own bed.</span> <span id="s2298">And in the same barrack lived Mala Zimetbaum, which run away --</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">A: -- with her three colleagues there.</span> <span id="s2301">We stayed there, we were [indecipherable] that time -- we stayed there, I don’t know how long, maybe a month, w -- I don’t know how long, and then we were moved to block four, where the Schreibstuber was, the main office.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: And -- and you knew Mala Zimetbaum?</span></p> <p><span id="s2303">A: Oh yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">Q: What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">A: Was like --</span></p> <p><span id="s2306">Q: How do you remember her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2307">A: Very proud girl, very proud.</span> <span id="s2308">Courageous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2309">Q: Courageous.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">A: Courageous.</span> <span id="s2311">Nice person.</span> <span id="s2312">Yes, somehow -- so a little bit proud, proud, yes.</span> <span id="s2313">And when some officer came by car in, I used to go and open the door for him, and she was always angry when she saw that.</span> <span id="s2314">Don’t open the door, don’t do anything for them.</span> <span id="s2315">But I wanted.</span> <span id="s2316">I wanted to be nice to them.</span> <span id="s2317">Not a big thing when I open the door for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2318">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2319">And what about the other two, there were two other women who were also Laeuferin --</span></p> <p><span id="s2320">A: Yeah, I think they opened also --</span></p> <p><span id="s2321">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2322">A: -- the door, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: Now, was the situation in that block as good as it was in block four or not?</span></p> <p><span id="s2324">A: In which block?</span></p> <p><span id="s2325">Q: The -- the earlier block, when you were with [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2326">A: Nobody bothered with us.</span> <span id="s2327">We were Laeuferin, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: Right, so you were safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: Yeah, this was so private somehow, like we were -- we had the same -- the same food, we didn’t have more than them, at the beginning, yes.</span> <span id="s2330">But we could go to the -- to the [indecipherable] it’s the -- the clothing where they had the -- we could choose some dresses, some clothing, so we were well dressed.</span> <span id="s2331">That was the different.</span> <span id="s2332">We could go into the sauna to wash --</span></p> <p><span id="s2333">Q: To wash yourself, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2334">A: Wash myself and the clothing to wash.</span> <span id="s2335">We could go to the [indecipherable] to the [indecipherable] hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s2336">Q: The hospital, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: And I needed very much to go to the [indecipherable] because I was full of pus, full of pus.</span> <span id="s2338">Furuncles, and the big full furuncles they were called carbuncles.</span> <span id="s2339">They had more heads, you know?</span> <span id="s2340">When I was running, oh ho, now opened the car -- full of pus, the carbuncles.</span> <span id="s2341">Here I had -- under arm I had pus --</span></p> <p><span id="s2342">Q: And where does that come from, what is that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2343">A: Let me tell you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2344">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2345">A: Here I had full of -- I was full of pus.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: Lack of hygiene.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: La-Lack of nourishment, yeah.</span> <span id="s2350">I survived, but how.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: How?</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: Is there medication?</span> <span id="s2354">Was there anything that you took?</span></p> <p><span id="s2355">A: No, I -- when I was Laeuferin and there was a Dr. Ross, a Jewish doctor, and I went to her to as -- she gave me this well known ishtiole, you know ishtiole?</span> <span id="s2356">So this made ripe these -- these furuncles and these -- and some [indecipherable] she gave me, and -- and I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2357">And then was -- I don’t remember, is white ointment, was when the furuncle was opened and you put it on, white this one.</span> <span id="s2358">And then slowly, slowly I was nursing myself on my bed when I came, and I went to wash myself, to shower myself.</span> <span id="s2359">And I ate better than before.</span> <span id="s2360">So it healed, it healed, it healed, but I still have scars.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: But in that condition, had you not been a Laeuferin, and in a protected commando, you probably would have been killed, because you would have looked sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2362">A: I didn’t look so sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">Q: No?</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">A: No.</span> <span id="s2365">And fortunately, we didn’t ha -- sorry, we didn't have to undr -- I don’t remember that I had to undress.</span> <span id="s2366">It’s only to have straight shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2367">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">A: To walk straight.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2370">A: Fingers, we have to go like this, and I don’t know what, a lock, you know.</span> <span id="s2371">That what -- would have been worse and worse and worse, yes.</span> <span id="s2372">For sure -- for sure it wouldn't help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2373">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2374">A: It wouldn’t help, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2375">Q: Were you surprised at the conditions in block four?</span> <span id="s2376">That everybody had -- you had your own bed, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2377">A: I wasn’t surprised.</span></p> <p><span id="s2378">Q: You weren't?</span></p> <p><span id="s2379">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2380">Q: You knew that that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2381">A: Yeah, because they looked nice, they looked healthy, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2382">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2383">A: And then in -- in a four -- block four, there were girls from the [indecipherable] where the s -- the non-Jewish people, they received parcels, they received packages and some of them, they died, but not in the chamber, not the non-Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s2384">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2385">A: So they were always on the left overs of packages.</span> <span id="s2386">So and gir -- the girls from the [indecipherable] from this package place, they lived also in block four.</span> <span id="s2387">So they had permission, it was a ver -- extras.</span> <span id="s2388">They had permission to bring in, [indecipherable] they gave us something [indecipherable] all we ha -- we received from there some [indecipherable] something that we -- so, was not a problem, or because they ate from there, so more food stayed in -- of our portions, you know?</span> <span id="s2389">So then it became, Laeuferin, we had enough food to dinner.</span> <span id="s2390">We had food, we had water, so we were saved.</span> <span id="s2391">Only something accidentally could happen that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2392">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2393">A: -- for some reason -- because anything was a reason there, he had to send us to --</span></p> <p><span id="s2394">Q: Now, are you saying that you did not know tsip -- Tsipi, Helen Teshauer in block four?</span> <span id="s2395">So she was in that block --</span></p> <p><span id="s2396">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2397">Q: You didn’t -- you never -- you never saw her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2398">A: No.</span> <span id="s2399">Interesting, huh?</span> <span id="s2400">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2401">Q: So there are what, about 90 or a hundred women there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2402">A: Or more.</span></p> <p><span id="s2403">Q: More.</span></p> <p><span id="s2404">A: Just a half a block, half.</span></p> <p><span id="s2405">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2406">A: Because the Schreibstuber was, the office was, and then we had three a-a-and maybe five, maybe [indecipherable] no, maybe, not more -- no, for sure no hundred.</span> <span id="s2407">Less than a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2408">Q: Less than a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s2409">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2410">But she was in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2411">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2412">A: There were rules.</span> <span id="s2413">Katya has the room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2414">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2415">A: Mala had the room, her three colleagues had the room.</span> <span id="s2416">Together, Mala and her three.</span> <span id="s2417">And Tsipi said that she had, I don’t know, that she had her own room also, so we passed by --</span></p> <p><span id="s2418">Q: But she often worked at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s2419">A: Tha -- Tsipi?</span></p> <p><span id="s2420">Q: Tsipi.</span> <span id="s2421">So maybe that’s why you didn’t see her, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2422">A: Yeah, it could be, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2423">Q: But it seems funny that you didn’t see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2424">A: Yeah, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2425">Q: You would see Katya.</span></p> <p><span id="s2426">A: I would see Katya [indecipherable] in the office, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2427">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2428">A: And I knew her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2429">Q: And you know her, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">A: Knew her so I noticed her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: There were also others which Tsipi mentioned, do you know -- did you know this -- this --</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2434">A: I said no, I didn’t know, because they were sitting beside the -- behind their desk, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">Q: So you didn't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">A: -- I didn’t bother.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">Q: You knew Anna Pilarchik, Hanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">A: Hannah -- Hanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">Q: Hanka.</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">A: She was the blockalteste.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">Q: Alteste, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2442">A: And then was the other one, a tall one, I don’t remember her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s2443">Q: So how did people get along --</span></p> <p><span id="s2444">A: Very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2445">Q: -- in that?</span> <span id="s2446">Was it good?</span> <span id="s2447">It was okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2448">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2449">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2450">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2451">Q: So did you now feel if the war ended --</span></p> <p><span id="s2452">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: -- that you would be safe?</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2455">No.</span> <span id="s2456">I felt safe.</span> <span id="s2457">I felt safe, but still I didn’t think so far, because as I said at the beginning, I was afraid, or I -- I thought that the last day they will kill us all, they will throw a bomb, or -- or I don’t know how [indecipherable] what way --</span></p> <p><span id="s2458">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2459">A: -- but they -- they will kill us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2460">Q: Now, did you menstruate, did you get your period?</span></p> <p><span id="s2461">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2462">Q: You ne -- you didn’t get it even then, because some women there were getting their periods.</span></p> <p><span id="s2463">A: When we came, the first day we’re in the sauna, everybody had menstruation, everybody, from fear, maybe [indecipherable] and that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2464">Q: No, but I mean in block four.</span></p> <p><span id="s2465">A: No.</span> <span id="s2466">In block four for sure they got -- they had menstruation, because they didn’t eat the food with brom.</span></p> <p><span id="s2467">Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">A: Katya for sure didn’t eat with brom.</span> <span id="s2471">For sure not and I don’t know Tsipi and the other ones, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Those which they worked with the [indecipherable] they didn't eat there probably, I don’t know, maybe sometimes, but that was not the main dish, but for me still it was the main dish.</span> <span id="s2474">What I got extra was only extra.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2477">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">Q: So describe what a day might be like.</span> <span id="s2479">What would you do, when would you get up, would there be a roll call in that barrack?</span></p> <p><span id="s2480">A: Yeah, yes, every barrack.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">Q: Early -- everybody -- every barrack would have that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">A: Everybody at the roll call.</span> <span id="s2483">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2484">I think maybe at six o’clock we were outside maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2485">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2486">A: Maybe at six o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s2487">Q: And then who would then give you an assignment?</span> <span id="s2488">You would wait?</span></p> <p><span id="s2489">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2490">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2491">A: You go to a place, and whatever they need.</span></p> <p><span id="s2492">Q: And who was the they, who would give -- who would tell you what to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s2493">A: Who were they?</span> <span id="s2494">Mainly Rapportfuehrerin, the Rapportfu -- SS, or from the office also, from the office.</span> <span id="s2495">I was sent sometimes from the office.</span> <span id="s2496">Somebody, I don’t know who, gave the order, but somebody -- maybe Tsipi was also among the -- I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2497">That’s interesting, that was life there.</span> <span id="s2498">Some -- I told you, she said that once we went for -- to -- we were sent together for stationeries to bring for the office from some -- I said, I don’t remember that, no.</span> <span id="s2499">So -- but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2500">Q: So she remembers that the two of you had met each other in barrack four?</span></p> <p><span id="s2501">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2502">Q: Had seen each other.</span> <span id="s2503">And you have no recollection.</span></p> <p><span id="s2504">A: O-O -- only that, that we went for that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2505">Q: Only that -- right, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s2506">A: -- you see, I was more visible because I was out at the entrance --</span></p> <p><span id="s2507">Q: Uh-huh, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2508">A: -- yes, but she was inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s2509">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2510">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2511">And then everybody knew the names of the Laeuferin because we were not many, yeah, and they were more of them, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2512">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2513">A: -- so -- so -- so -- wa -- I say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2514">Q: So someone would --</span></p> <p><span id="s2515">A: Yes, from --</span></p> <p><span id="s2516">Q: -- send you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2517">A: Somebody would come, anybody from the office, for me, and would say today you have to go there.</span> <span id="s2518">Not always, when they needed somebody special, somebody extra, so they said f-first of -- for example, today you will go to Auschwitz -- to Auschwitz one, to the [indecipherable] you know that [indecipherable] to the Gestapo let’s say I think, they wear also uniforms.</span> <span id="s2519">You will go there today.</span> <span id="s2520">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2521">Or today you will go to the [indecipherable] when they had the lot of work.</span> <span id="s2522">They sent always me, maybe -- maybe I spoke the best German, probably.</span> <span id="s2523">You will go to that [indecipherable] to the other lager and so on, it was always accompanied by an SS to go there, to translate.</span> <span id="s2524">So therefore I know what they did.</span> <span id="s2525">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2526">Q: So you would translate from what to what?</span></p> <p><span id="s2527">A: From Polish to German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2528">Q: And you knew Polish?</span></p> <p><span id="s2529">A: I knew Slovak and that is very --</span></p> <p><span id="s2530">Q: And it’s enough -- it’s close enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s2531">A: Close enough.</span> <span id="s2532">Once happened they translated the Polish and -- and German and then SS continued.</span> <span id="s2533">Hitler [indecipherable] spoke in Polish.</span> <span id="s2534">I thought oh my God, how lucky I am that I didn’t say anything else.</span> <span id="s2535">I didn’t instructed him also.</span> <span id="s2536">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2537">Q: So was a lot of your work doing translations?</span> <span id="s2538">Was that a great deal of the work?</span></p> <p><span id="s2539">A: The work, yes, even they send, go there, go there.</span> <span id="s2540">You know, it’s one block to the other one, everybody had to know German.</span></p> <p><span id="s2541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2542">A: But maybe [indecipherable] you had to know better to [indecipherable] I don’t know --</span></p> <p><span id="s2543">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2544">A: Yeah, I -- yeah, I didn't sp -- we didn’t speak in German with my

them.</span> <span id="s2613">So we were standing, looking at them, and didn’t say even anything.</span> <span id="s2614">It was very sad, very sad to see so many people.</span> <span id="s2615">And

the entrance?</span></p> <p><span id="s2665">A: As a Laeuferin.</span></p> <p><span id="s2666">Q: Now, why was Laeuferin standing there, is -- in order to translate if there was a need to translate, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s2667">A: To translate or -- or like a messenger, but they needed to send to some block, some barrack, to say something, some message to give over.</span></p> <p><span

nobody was in the lager, it was not permitted, because the guards stay there on the towers, and suddenly I heard a cry, and -- and -- and -- and running around, and so -- and that was the time when they took the people from Terezín lager, or the family lager it was called.</span> <span id="s2688">Because it was like that that this famil -- those families from Theresienstadt, they were together, and that was called family lager.</span> <span id="s2689">And later on only when I am here, so I read somewhere that it was written on the -- on the wagons, SB, Sonder Behandlung, and that meant -- that what they write in the book, that meant that six -- for six months, or -- I think six months, they had to stay there as a family, and then they sent them.</span> <span id="s2690">And that time, that evening, or that night when I was late night there, they -- in the morning I heard -- in the morning somebody said that they put them on -- on the -- on tracks, on tracks they put them, on car -- on tracks, they took them to the city of Auschwitz, and they carried them the whole night all over, to -- to -- to mix them up, that they don’t know where they are going, and then they put them in the warehouse, or somewhere into a place, I don’t know, I wasn’t there, and then they gassed them there, in some warehouse, or somewhere, a place.</span> <span id="s2691">That was -- I wasn’t there

Auschwitz that time.</span> <span id="s2695">Other times I don’t know, because they gassed them other times also.</span> <span id="s2696">And then in the morning, or the next day I heard that in one

standing between the two barracks, between two lagers, which didn’t have anything to do with Theresienstadt, only the noise.</span> <span id="s2703">Maybe that nobody should be outside, but there were the guards.</span> <span id="s2704">That I know about Theresiens --</span></p> <p><span id="s2705">Q: But being outside and watching that must have been very upsetting.</span></p> <p><span

[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2805">Q: I see what you’re saying.</span></p> <p><span id="s2806">A: Still hard.</span> <span id="s2807">See, once she went by her -- on her own to -- in front of block 25, somehow once I lost her during the day, maybe it was Sunday, I came to the block and asked, where is rish -- where is Dieter?</span> <span id="s2808">Somebody said she went to block 25.</span> <span id="s2809">With some of them, that was suicide [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2810">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2811">A: They were sitting there and waiting til they opened the door, and I -- it was in front of -- of the lager, so the first -- in the first row from the door -- from the -- from the e -- entrance, where the SS were, so they could see the -- and I went there, and I said, “Dieter, come.”</span> <span id="s2812">She said no.</span> <span id="s2813">I tried to pick her up, and -- and -- and I -- I had to fight with her, I fought with her, Dieter, come, come.</span> <span id="s2814">She said, “No, it’s not your life, let me -- leave me alone.</span> <span id="s2815">I want to die, I want to go.”</span> <span id="s2816">And it was also a risk, somebody sees me, then go with her.</span> <span id="s2817">But I managed to pick her up and he came wi -- she came with me.</span> <span id="s2818">She came back to that barrack.</span> <span id="s2819">She was very close to me, I liked her very mu -- nice girl, a simple, nice, good girl.</span> <span id="s2820">Yeah, nice girl, Dieter.</span></p> <p><span id="s2821">Q: Were -- the -- the

-- didn’t know in the commando, also the names.</span> <span id="s2831">I don’t know, I don’t know, probably yes.</span> <span id="s2832">Nobody wants to be lonely.</span></p> <p><span id="s2833">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2834">Did you ever see men coming into the camp and working?</span></p> <p><span id="s2835">A: Sometimes, yes.</span> <span id="s2836">First of all from the gas chamber, they deliver to us this clothing, we worked on it [indecipherable] they pulled like -- like horses, they came there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2837">Q: Wasn’t it the case that there was some -- somebody who was working the Sonderkommando, who spoke with you about what happened?</span> <span id="s2838">Some person who saw you in Auschwitz, and talked to you, who came in the women’s camp?</span> <span id="s2839">Didn’t you write about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2840">A: Yes, it happened --</span></p> <p><span id="s2841">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2842">A: -- happened, yes, happened, I don’t know if I wrote about it, but it happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s2843">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2844">A: I had there a friend, also a man.</span> <span id="s2845">He was so sick and so -- a Polish man, his nose was -- was running and so [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2846">And once he came we had the little [indecipherable] with [indecipherable] a little piece of salami.</span> <span id="s2847">And he asked -- this was winter, I should boil it for him, I should make him a soup.</span> <span id="s2848">Not wa -- this was sick and I made it for him and then he came always, he brought a -- a piece of bread and salami, or only bread, to make him a soup and so [indecipherable] but not so somebody should see.</span></p> <p><span id="s2849">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2850">A: [indecipherable] the back, and here and there, or -- or he drew me a -- a -- a letter or a picture or so.</span> <span id="s2851">And so I learned about his life before and so -- so I knew about him.</span> <span id="s2852">And then I was so happy when I saw him with a mirror to look in, and his cap, he fixed up and so [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2853">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s2854">A: So happy.</span> <span id="s2855">And then when he became maybe the nicest looking boy from that place, yes, that commando, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2856">Q: He found a mirror?</span> <span id="s2857">This was after the war, this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2858">A: During the war, during it</span></p> <p><span id="s2859">Q: -- during?</span> <span id="s2860">He found a mirror and so he was fixing himself up.</span></p> <p><span id="s2861">A: Yes, and before he was -- his nose was running and so -- yes.</span> <span id="s2862">But in sometimes they pass through when they brought --</span></p> <p><span id="s2863">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2864">A: -- other things, they said something and so -- so we knew the names from those who --</span></p> <p><span id="s2865">Q: But there were a number of times when you actually saved people, you risked your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s2866">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s2867">Q: Not just with -- with your friend Dieter, that was very dangerous to go into block 25 to bring her out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2868">A: Not to, in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2869">Q: In front, even in front.</span></p> <p><span id="s2870">A: Yes, I --</span></p> <p><span id="s2871">Q: Cause clearly she was waiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s2872">A: Yeah, yes.</span> <span id="s2873">I did steal people, saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s2874">Q: And how did you do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2875">A: Once five people, from Mengele -- from Dr. Mengele, when I was Schreiberin, you know, registrar.</span> <span id="s2876">And when they emptied block A -- barra -- yeah -- were -- lager A they emptied, yeah.</span> <span id="s2877">So our block had to -- the Jewish women, they had to assemble in -- in the sauna.</span> <span id="s2878">The sauna, to go to the sauna, I had to go with them as the shi -- block Schreiberin went to write down who stays in, so -- and at the door was Mengele, and a other prisoner, Slovak doctor, she wasn’t finished [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2879">She played the doctor, the wise Irna.</span> <span id="s2880">Was a -- a door with him -- with meng -- Dr. Mengele, and they had to line up and to go through the door where he was standing, and it was a small room, and there all -- the small room on the other room, yeah, life or death.</span> <span id="s2881">And my father’s sister was there, my father’s sister, my aunt.</span> <span id="s2882">And I said to Irna, my aunt is coming, help me, yeah.</span> <span id="s2883">Said, tell me when she will be here.</span> <span id="s2884">And she was on the way, I said, she is coming, yeah.</span> <span id="s2885">[indecipherable] because Mengele was the -- she said, I cannot help you, you help yourself.</span> <span id="s2886">I knew that she cannot -- couldn’t help me, we tried.</span> <span id="s2887">So I didn’t -- I could not help neither, so I let her go through selection, he selected her.</span> <span id="s2888">Then came a other one from the city where I was -- where I became married, because my uncle was [indecipherable] so I knew her, I met her there.</span> <span id="s2889">So they were maybe 45, or so, yes, the nine hun -- 19 -- maybe 45 years, around.</span> <span id="s2890">So I let her also go, I let everybody go, he selected, yes.</span> <span id="s2891">Then came -- then came a Hungarian women from Budapest, I let her also go, and I let everybody go yes, and I waited til Mengele will leave, and then I went to the little room where they -- those two -- two -- two -- that selected were, and I said silently, [indecipherable] is -- is in Hungarian, like end, I said, Frieda [indecipherable] come.</span> <span id="s2892">[indecipherable] with one hand, and I took them out from there, from commandos.</span> <span id="s2893">And then I saw there a sister of one girl which was sent to live, yes, so I went to her, come.</span> <span id="s2894">And then was there this lady from Budapest, and she said Aliska, and I saw there in the back, a girl, she was maybe 16 years old, also Hungarian, I said yes in -- in Hungarian, yes if she prom -- and I had the girl shon -- als -- shon -- I had the girl where my hand, I carried her.</span> <span id="s2895">I said yes, will you promise me that you will be her mother?</span> <span id="s2896">She said yes, I promise you.</span> <span id="s2897">So I put the two -- two together, and I took them out.</span> <span id="s2898">So that time I took five people out from Mengele.</span> <span id="s2899">Was a risk.</span> <span id="s2900">And then my cousin, which I said, from she was already in block 25 --</span></p> <p><span id="s2901">Q: So l-let’s stop the tape and we’ll start with that --</span></p> <p><span id="s2902">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2903">Q: -- on the next tape with you -- with getting Vera out.</span></p> <p><span id="s2904">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2905">End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2906">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2907">Q: Okay, before we talk about your saving Vera Isen, tell me what impelled you to do this?</span> <span id="s2908">It was so dangerous, you could have been caught in a second and killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2909">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2910">I knew it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2911">Q: What made you do it?</span> <span id="s2912">How --</span></p> <p><span id="s2913">A: S -- to save people.</span> <span id="s2914">I didn’t think about the danger.</span> <span id="s2915">I knew that I have to do it, be -- that I -- since I had th-the opportunity, it was a way til -- til -- I knew that it was a way how to take them out, so I had to do thi -- I -- I had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2916">Q: And nobody saw you, Irma didn’t see you.</span> <span id="s2917">Irma -- irm -- was Irma Weiss, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s2918">A: Irna.</span></p> <p><span id="s2919">Q: Irna, rather, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2920">A: No, I don’t know, she left with him, but I told her that I want to save my aunt and she said, I cannot help you, you help yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2921">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2922">A: So probably she --</span></p> <p><span id="s2923">Q: She knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2924">A: -- knew probably, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2925">I never spoke to her before and after, that she was working in the -- really in the [indecipherable] house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2926">Q: But if they were going through the -- th -- the process, this wasn’t outside, this was inside --</span></p> <p><span id="s2927">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2928">Q: -- were they not taking down names?</span></p> <p><span id="s2929">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s2930">That was --</span></p> <p><span id="s2931">Q: They can -- not that -- it was just n -- just moving people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2932">A: Just moving people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2933">Q: I see, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s2934">A: This was my work.</span></p> <p><span id="s2935">Q: I see, so they can -- there was no way to check if you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2936">A: No, they di -- couldn’t check, no.</span> <span id="s2937">They left, he didn’t remember whom he sent because he sent a lot of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s2938">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s2939">Now, there were other people in that room.</span></p> <p><span id="s2940">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2941">Q: Did they realize what you were doing, or you don’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2942">A: See, no, wait.</span> <span id="s2943">I had bad conscience about one woman, who saw what was going on -- on, but that was my limit, I could not -- but, I am happy ho -- what happened, okay?</span> <span id="s2944">She was a real musselman, you know what’s musselman, you heard this expression?</span></p> <p><span id="s2945">Q: That was people who were deteriorated and -- and close to death also, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2946">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2947">She was tall, and very skinny, and she came to me and she said, help me, because she saw, she saw.</span> <span id="s2948">I said, I cannot, because when I take yo -- if I take you out, everything wis -- will collapse, I’m sorry, I cannot.</span> <span id="s2949">And I left her there.</span> <span id="s2950">But my conscience was very bad, that oh my God, she died and so and so.</span> <span id="s2951">Til once happened that somebody told me after the war, that a woman, very tall and skinny, a real musselman, she somehow came to the lager, to the other lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s2952">Q: So she escaped herself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2953">A: She escaped herself, and I was very quiet and very happy.</span> <span id="s2954">Til then, til I didn’t hear it, my conscience was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s2955">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2956">A: But I couldn’t, because five people, I had to risk five people and myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2957">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2958">A: That was the limit and I couldn’t go even back to take more, five.</span></p> <p><span id="s2959">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2960">A: Too much time.</span> <span id="s2961">[indecipherable] them, too much time, I couldn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s2962">Q: And what gave you -- were you holding onto this young

her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2965">A: I just took her, I went to her, I didn’t say anything, she didn’t know what -- what I am doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2966">Q: [indecipherable] you just took her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2967">A: I took her, I hold her, and this lady said -- she was a little bit chubby, I don’t know if she was 50, that time 50 was old.</span></p> <p><span id="s2968">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2969">A: And she said, Aliska.</span> <span id="s2970">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s2971">And you promise me that you be a -- be a mother to this gi -- to this

<p><span id="s2978">Q: -- o-on your part, but what made you say that to her?</span> <span id="s2979">Because you didn’t think that the 16 year old would survive if she didn’t have somebody?</span></p> <p><span id="s2980">A: Yeah, she was very young, according to this set up.</span> <span id="s2981">Yeah, she was not -- she needed somebody, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s2982">Q: Did they sur -- did they survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s2983">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s2984">No, I don’t know about the Hungarian woman, but I know about the girl that she survived becau -- it happened my -- my roots, you know, I met so many people there which -- which they belonged to -- belonged to me.</span> <span id="s2985">I met a -- a b -- a -- a woman which was very handy there and very nice when I was Schreiberin, and said stay, and she worked always something other, I said, stay here, be a -- be a Stubendienst, yes, a servant here.</span> <span id="s2986">And she stayed and worked and so [indecipherable] after my work and after the war I went to the city Koshitzer, and I met her on the street and she said, come, visit us [indecipherable] go to a restaurant, she said come, visit us and we’ll have supper with us.</span> <span id="s2987">So I said, what’s your name and what -- I knew her first name -- I said what’s your name and what’s your address.</span> <span id="s2988">So she said her name and I said, we have here a relative, who work there and there and there.</span> <span id="s2989">She said that’s my so -- my brother-in-law.</span> <span id="s2990">She was my cousin’s wife.</span> <span id="s2991">And she told me -- I didn’t say anything to her but she told me about this girl that she lives in -- she has this cousin or something in California, and she mentioned her, described her, so she lived in -- in California, in America after the war.</span> <span id="s2992">So I know that she’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2993">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2994">A: -- she survived, that my aunt survived -- she passed away now, this lady from mana -- from my husband, the three, I know that they survived.</span> <span id="s2995">I don’t know about Koshitzer, I was in Koshitzer, I never asked about her, but I’m sure that [indecipherable] was healthy, and I don’t know about this Hungarian lady, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2996">But three I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s2997">Q: So tell me the story about Vera Isen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2998">A: I told you, no?</span> <span id="s2999">With my father, aha happen, what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s3000">Q: No, you didn’t.</span> <span id="s3001">What happened, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3002">A: I came to the -- came to the barrack and they were sending a nice looking girl, young, maybe 20 or so.</span> <span id="s3003">I said -- and I knew that she’s not from the barrack, because I would know her.</span> <span id="s3004">I said, “What are you -- are you looking for somebody?”</span> <span id="s3005">She said “Yes, I am looking for Aliska Roth,” or for -- yeah.</span> <span id="s3006">So I said, “Why are you looking for Aliska Roth?”</span> <span id="s3007">She said, “Because she’s my cousin.”</span> <span id="s3008">I said, “Your cousin, what’s your name?”</span> <span id="s3009">Vera Isen.</span> <span id="s3010">I said, “Oh, so what’s the problem?”</span> <span id="s3011">I didn’t say anything to her, what’s the problem [indecipherable] wasn’t interest to talk too much.</span> <span id="s3012">I said, “What’s the problem?”</span> <span id="s3013">Said, “I am on 20 -- on block 25.”</span> <span id="s3014">So I said -- I didn’t ask why, I didn’t know why she’s there.</span> <span id="s3015">I said [indecipherable] afternoon, I cannot do anything, I will try tomorrow to do something.</span> <span id="s3016">Come with me, I go with you to 25.</span> <span id="s3017">Since I was -- before Laeuferin, I was Schreiberin, so I -- people knew me, so I had some position.</span> <span id="s3018">So I went there, there was a Slovak lady, older than -- she was a mother of a girl [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3019">I said [indecipherable] didn’t ask who we are, what -- what [indecipherable], no, nothing nothing.</span> <span id="s3020">I said, “Now this is my cousin and she’s here in your block.”</span> <span id="s3021">It was impossible to take out from there.</span> <span id="s3022">“She’s in this block, I want to help her, but today is no time because late.</span> <span id="s3023">So I-I -- I will come tomorrow, so please hide her,” and I looked up there where the dished, and some storage.</span> <span id="s3024">I said, “If something would happen during the night, place her there, send her there, she should hide there.</span> <span id="s3025">In the morning I will be here.”</span> <span id="s3026">She said okay.</span> <span id="s3027">And I am wondering how she could do that, because she had her on the list, yeah.</span> <span id="s3028">She says okay.</span> <span id="s3029">So -- and I went in the morning there.</span> <span id="s3030">I said, I came for my cousin.</span> <span id="s3031">She says okay, so I took her.</span> <span id="s3032">I took my cousin and I went with her to the sauna, because I knew that that time they were sending the haftlings to -- to Germany to work, you know, Philips and so on and so.</span> <span id="s3033">They went there.</span> <span id="s3034">And there was an SS, [indecipherable] and these SS people they knew me, because I was standing there.</span> <span id="s3035">Her name was Ziatz, and I knew she’s a simple woman, older woman, in her 40’s, somehow, I never heard her voice, she must be a nice woman.</span> <span id="s3036">So I went to her and I said [indecipherable], I said this is my cousin, look how beautiful she is, she is nicer looking than I am, I gave her some [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3037">And she’s in -- the problem with -- with her that she’s in block 25.</span> <span id="s3038">She has to go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s3039">And she can go as a nice looking girl, then I can go also.</span> <span id="s3040">I am not so nice looking than her.</span> <span id="s3041">Please help me.</span> <span id="s3042">Send her away with the -- with these people to Germany to work.</span> <span id="s3043">And she looked, and she said, leave her here.</span> <span id="s3044">And I left her there, and I believed her, this [indecipherable] I left her there.</span> <span id="s3045">And that’s it.</span> <span id="s3046">And I had the feeling, that’s a good feeling, the girl is safe.</span> <span id="s3047">After the wer -- war, when I came to Prešov, I met a girl from Hungary, from there, and we were so [indecipherable] saw me, knew the name.</span> <span id="s3048">She said, I was in [indecipherable] with the -- they had a -- a grape garden.</span> <span id="s3049">So I met there Vera Isen, and she said you should come there to pick up grapes.</span> <span id="s3050">So I said, well I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3051">But I knew that I will not go, I wasn’t the mood to travel with grapes, forget about it.</span> <span id="s3052">And then I said, are you go back, tell her that I thank, that I’m here and I thank, and -- but I will not be here, I will be in Humenné, I go to my uncle.</span> <span id="s3053">So then I received from her a letter.</span> <span id="s3054">I’m not sure if I wrote her or she wrote me, that I don’t know.</span> <span id="s3055">[indecipherable] was a little place, Humenné was also a little place, was enough to know the name, okay, [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3056">So I received a letter that she’s with her brother there and they want to go to the States, to New York.</span> <span id="s3057">But that time wasn’t permitted from Hungary to write to New York, wasn’t permitted somehow connection [indecipherable] I should write -- she wrote me the address to New York, I should wr-write in Hungarian [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3058">So I wrote there, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s3059">I never heard about her, never, never, never.</span> <span id="s3060">After years and years my cousin from Koshitza, from Slovakia wrote to me that she -- she received a letter from Israel -- from Israel from my other cousin, that this cousin from Israel was in New York to visit a other cousin and that Vera wi -- Vera Isen was there and she’s in this book about Auschwitz, and she said the story that the -- she was select -- she was selected to -- for -- for Germany to work, and I didn’t know that time that she had a sister and she had a mother there.</span> <span id="s3061">And the other blockalteste came there, and managed -- because she was the last one, that they took her out from the line, and she put her sister or her cousin or somebody, this blockalte -- somebody instead her, and they took her from there to block 25, ye -- and that I took her out, and -- and so -- and sh -- and this cousin from Israel said that she wanted my [indecipherable] wanted my address where I live now, to tell me that she’s alive.</span> <span id="s3062">So I wrote to her, but she didn’t write for a long time.</span> <span id="s3063">So I said, when she doesn’t write, ask from Israel her address.</span> <span id="s3064">[indecipherable] I -- I never said to her -- she doesn’t know the story of my father, that my father had her -- I don’t know what -- what kind of reli -- relative was his mother and so -- so as was -- so a few -- then she in -- then she invited me to Florida, I should come, I knew that I will not go.</span> <span id="s3065">I said maybe.</span> <span id="s3066">And then she called I shouldn’t go for January because her children are there, sh -- I should come for February.</span> <span id="s3067">And I said, I will go rather to -- to New York.</span> <span id="s3068">Then I had my hip operation, I said [indecipherable] called me, I said I -- I cannot go because I have a hip operation.</span> <span id="s3069">Then she called me again, I said I want to go to -- to Washington first, and I will come from Washington, maybe I will come to visit you.</span> <span id="s3070">I never went and she never called or never --</span></p> <p><span id="s3071">Q: So you’ve never seen her since that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s3072">A: No, I saw her only once.</span> <span id="s3073">But then I wrote to the [indecipherable] my new cousin, my new cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3074">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s3075">Did you tell her when you brought her to -- to the sauna, did you say I am your cousin, or you never told her?</span></p> <p><span id="s3076">A: No, I told her, oh I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s3077">Q: Oh, you did tell her.</span></p> <p><span id="s3078">A: -- I -- no, I didn’t tell her I am your cousin, I reacted as I will help you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3079">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3080">A: I ra -- reacted as a cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s3081">Q: As a cousin</span></p> <p><span id="s3082">A: Come, I will help you.</span> <span id="s3083">But I never wrote to her that my fa -- what my father told me, that he lost his mother, who was an Isen.</span></p> <p><span id="s3084">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3085">A: And so I met a few ones.</span> <span id="s3086">Some of my roots.</span> <span id="s3087">A few ones [indecipherable] few ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s3088">Q: So how do you understand yourself doing all of this?</span></p> <p><span id="s3089">A: Yeah, I had other times also when I saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s3090">Q: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3091">A: So -- but how I understand myself, after many years -- and I was happy that I could help.</span> <span id="s3092">After many years I sometimes ask was it worthwhile.</span> <span id="s3093">Who cares, nobody cares.</span> <span id="s3094">If it is worthwhile to be a [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3095">Then but sometimes maybe.</span> <span id="s3096">Nobody said ever, thanks.</span></p> <p><span id="s3097">Q: Nobody?</span></p> <p><span id="s3098">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s3099">Nobody.</span> <span id="s3100">So they were thankful it’s -- my aunt and the other lady, but I don’t know if it is worthwhile to risk your life, as I risked my life.</span> <span id="s3101">I risked also [indecipherable] Polish -- I wrote it, Polish women.</span> <span id="s3102">They wanted to take them to Visla to [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3103">I mean, the SS came and he said where are -- I had to line up.</span> <span id="s3104">It was a rec -- convalescent barrack where they didn’t go to work, they stayed there.</span> <span id="s3105">And he came, where are they.</span> <span id="s3106">Polish women.</span> <span id="s3107">I said, we don’t have here Polish women.</span> <span id="s3108">He left, but I had statistics, I had -- I wrote every day stat -- and they would say, show me your statistics.</span> <span id="s3109">I finished [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3110">He turned and he left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3111">Q: And you had just faked everything?</span></p> <p><span id="s3112">A: I didn’t faked anything, it -- my -- my book was there, my notebook was inside in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3113">Q: But he didn’t look.</span></p> <p><span id="s3114">A: He didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s3115">I looked so little, innocent.</span></p> <p><span id="s3116">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3117">A: Yeah, [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3118">Q: But don’t you, even if people don’t thank you, you have some feeling in yourself about what you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s3119">A: Yes, yes, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s3120">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3121">A: I know that I did the right thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3122">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3123">A: I do know that.</span> <span id="s3124">I’m satisfied.</span> <span id="s3125">I’m satisfied I did the right thing, yeah, even they don’t care, but sometimes I think that nobody -- no, I -- I -- a-always when somebody -- I did something for some, ask me what should I [indecipherable] I said, now you want to repay me?</span> <span id="s3126">Yes.</span> <span id="s3127">Give me a smile.</span> <span id="s3128">It was always my reaction.</span> <span id="s3129">Yeah, it was very risky.</span> <span id="s3130">Once somebody saw me from the sauna, was also a -- some relative that I knew her before.</span> <span id="s3131">And I went to the Schreiberin that time, I said, take her a -- take out her name, yeah.</span> <span id="s3132">She said, find me a razor -- an eraser.</span> <span id="s3133">So I went all over, I found the eraser, so she wrote through and erased, it should be so mixed up that she made the mistake.</span> <span id="s3134">When I took her out, was evening.</span> <span id="s3135">Then one Polish lady who was then my blockalteste when I was Schreiberin with her in the last barrack.</span> <span id="s3136">She came to -- now you stole this girl, you took her out from the -- I said no, no, I didn’t.</span> <span id="s3137">She said yes, I saw you.</span> <span id="s3138">I said no.</span> <span id="s3139">But then when I came onto her barrack, I said -- said, you remember that evening?</span> <span id="s3140">I really took her.</span> <span id="s3141">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3142">Q: But something -- something must have been in your family, there’s a certain kind of justice, or evenness, even what you did after the war, that even though this woman had no right to get money from you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3143">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3144">Q: None --</span></p> <p><span id="s3145">A: None, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s3146">Q: -- whatsoever.</span> <span id="s3147">But you -- it was more important for you to shut her up essentially --</span></p> <p><span id="s3148">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3149">Q: -- so she wouldn’t say nasty things about your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s3150">A: Yeah, was my responsibility --</span></p> <p><span id="s3151">Q: It was your responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s3152">A: -- I felt.</span></p> <p><span id="s3153">Q: And it’s a -- oh, there’s -- there’s something, something.</span></p> <p><span id="s3154">A: Maybe that that my father was a very honest man, maybe.</span> <span id="s3155">Maybe that.</span> <span id="s3156">Maybe, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3157">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3158">A: It was -- it was this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s3159">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3160">A: I was this way.</span> <span id="s3161">No, I didn’t question myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s3162">Q: You just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3163">A: And I was ques --</span></p> <p><span id="s3164">Q: You just did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3165">A: I never question, yeah.</span> <span id="s3166">Never question what I am doing again, so -- have to do it, I do it.</span> <span id="s3167">I can do it, so I do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3168">Q: So you did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3169">A: And that’s -- I looked so -- I knew that I looked so innocent, a little girl.</span> <span id="s3170">Who wouldn’t believe a little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s3171">Q: But you know, when you said -- when we were talking before, about having -- being practical.</span></p> <p><span id="s3172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3173">Q: In a situation that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3174">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3175">Q: -- clearly completely crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s3176">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3177">Q: But in order to live in it, you had to think in a practical way --</span></p> <p><span id="s3178">A: I had to think --</span></p> <p><span id="s3179">Q: -- not in some fantasy land, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s3180">A: -- yes.</span> <span id="s3181">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3182">Q: So you were thinking and strategizing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3183">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3184">Q: -- and seeing --</span></p> <p><span id="s3185">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3186">Q: -- little ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3187">A: Yes, that’s right.</span> <span id="s3188">I had to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3189">Q: To save yourself and to save some [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3190">A: I understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3191">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3192">A: I understand you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3193">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3194">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3195">But it was somehow worthwhile to -- to risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3196">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3197">A: It was worthwhile to risk.</span> <span id="s3198">It was worthwhile to risk.</span></p> <p><span id="s3199">Q: I-I would think it would make somehow living with that experience a little bit easier, but you actually acted --</span></p> <p><span id="s3200">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3201">Q: -- on behalf of other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s3202">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3203">Q: And didn’t simply watch -- you got saved and watched --</span></p> <p><span id="s3204">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3205">Q: I don’t think you could have --</span></p> <p><span id="s3206">A: No, I couldn't do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3207">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3208">A: I couldn’t do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s3209">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3210">A: First of all I -- I was counting at the end that we will anyhow die, all of you.</span> <span id="s3211">Again, I didn’t risk too much.</span> <span id="s3212">I didn't risk too much, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3213">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3214">Because you thought it was going to be over anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s3215">A: Yeah, it will be over anyway, if I die before, or later, it doesn’t make too much difference, and I can help them, so it will never go too much difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s3216">Q: Now, your job as a Laeuferin --</span></p> <p><span id="s3217">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3218">Q: Was stopped because Mala Zimetbaum --</span></p>

[indecipherable] we know that -- knew that from the Sonderkommando who worked there, somebody said that he gave her a pill, and -- and here, poison yourself.</span> <span id="s3348">Or the mer -- there most probably was that he shot her -- I will shot her -- shot you first.</span> <span id="s3349">And the third version was that she took a pill, that she had the poisonous pill.</span> <span id="s3350">She killed her -- poisoned herself.</span> <span id="s3351">And Edek was hanged.</span></p> <p><span id="s3352">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3353">A: Edek was hanged

how many those, those, those, those, those, according, a list has to be put together, and to take to the Schriebstuber.</span> <span id="s3363">Then we had a reconvalescent lag -- block.</span> <span id="s3364">That meant some people, they -- which they were sick and they were not sent to the gas chamber, let’s see, the non-Jews, they were not sent to the gas chamber, yes.</span> <span id="s3365">You are sick, you went to the Revere, to the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3366">And then they send them for a few day -- let’s say for three days or four or five, six days or [indecipherable] mostly to a reconvalescent block.</span> <span id="s3367">And then you had to place them from the reconvalescent block according to regulations, back.</span> <span id="s3368">And back from there they came, yes.</span> <span id="s3369">So, when we had to send them back, we had to go to the same route as who was there when Mala -- was Mala, who me she slapped, for permission -- he had to sign that go to place, and so on.</span> <span id="s3370">But again, I didn’t place back.</span> <span id="s3371">[indecipherable] I knew when I was Laeuferin, he was there in this -- that was his office.</span> <span id="s3372">So I used to go to him, I said, Herr -- it was the Arbeitsfuehrer, something like that, please sign me, sign me this.</span> <span id="s3373">And he used -- used to smile, so -- he didn’t look at me, only smiled, and signed, didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s3374">And I sent to the -- to the sewing room, sewing, because there we were exchange for young -- for older people from Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3375">But the -- here was older people, so mainly older people came.</span> <span id="s3376">So sent them there, or I kept them longer or so -- so we had to be in [indecipherable] maybe he didn’t know, maybe he smiled only like, I don’t know, I never ask him why he smiles, I didn’t care, he sign.</span> <span id="s3377">So we had to be in connection with this -- this Arbeitskommandant.</span> <span id="s3378">We had to go to the Schreibstuber, and the Zaehlappell had to be correct, yes, so that was -- now, and beside that, we help,

Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3407">A: Is interesting?</span></p> <p><span id="s3408">Q: Yes, I think it’s very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3409">A: Very interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s3410">Q: I don’t know when this happened, but at some point you said that an SS man visited the blockalteste’s room drunk, and was asking --</span></p> <p><span id="s3411">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3412">Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s3413">Let me tell you this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3414">Q: Why did he -- yes, can you -- was this in block four?</span></p> <p><span id="s3415">A: Block four?</span> <span id="s3416">No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s3417">Q: No, this was another block, this was --</span></p> <p><span id="s3418">A: That was when we left -- when we left A barrack, the A lager, and we left A lager when I said that we s -- we were there -- left -- we were there, only few girls yes, and I was scared, but we’ll have [indecipherable] to die, I was scared --</span></p> <p><span id="s3419">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3420">A: -- and so on, and so what will.</span> <span id="s3421">So one day came an SS, and he took us to a other lager, to another lager, only by foot, it was close, yeah.</span> <span id="s3422">And I came to this blockalteste, who saw me that evening that I took somebody from this road that was outside there, standing, here they were standing, and then -- but that’s interesting, that this girl became a woman, and she committed in Israel suicide.</span> <span id="s3423">Whom I took from the sauna, you know it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3424">Q: Yes, that one you took from the sauna?</span></p> <p><span id="s3425">A: Which I -- the -- the other --</span></p> <p><span id="s3426">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3427">A: -- Schreiberin erased her name, and so I took her from the sauna, she went to her [indecipherable] and I took her to the other one.</span> <span id="s3428">She came to New York, she divorced her husband, left her son with her husband, went to -- to Israel, married again, and then she committed the suicide.</span> <span id="s3429">Destiny, yeah.</span> <span id="s3430">So the question was, this drunk SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s3431">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3432">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3433">So from there we went to the other and this blockalteste who saw me to steal her [indecipherable] I came there, and she said that she wanted a -- I wrote it there -- somebody as a Polish, a Polish woman, as a Schreiberin, but the other one, who worked with Katya [indecipherable] means miss, misses, yeah.</span> <span id="s3434">She told me, the blockalte -- probably not [indecipherable] that I have to take -- she didn’t know me, I didn’t know her, we saw each other only this evening, yeah.</span> <span id="s3435">She said that Aliska has to be her Schreiberin, because when Aliska was good to -- to save the Polish women, you know, from the Visla that she sent to the latrine, go to the latrine, then she’s got to be Schreiberin here.</span> <span id="s3436">So I became the Schreiberin there, and it was the a-assistant blockalteste a Polish woman, a other one, they were sitting together, two Polish women.</span> <span id="s3437">And I was with them, the Schreiber.</span> <span id="s3438">It was -- I think it was late -- yeah, in October we came there, I think maybe in October, could have been winter or -- or so, it was cold, I know it -- we didn’t have a calendar there.</span> <span id="s3439">I didn’t know the date, I didn’t know the day.</span> <span id="s3440">Sunday we knew because we didn’t go to work.</span> <span id="s3441">So, open the door and an SS man came into [indecipherable] room, because blockalteste, Schreiberin and assistant, we had a little room, yeah.</span> <span id="s3442">So we were sitting that time there, and this drunk SS came in, took off his hat, put on a chair and said -- put -- took off the gun, put on the chair and sit there and said, I will stay here with you, and I will -- I will sleep here on the floor with you, or I will go into the barrack and I will sleep on the bunk, the bunk [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3443">I don’t leave from here, I will stay with you here.</span> <span id="s3444">An SS.</span> <span id="s3445">And this other -- the -- the assistant -- the assistant blockalteste, she was so strict to him, she started to spit on his head, and so -- and then he said -- but he was very, very drunk, and he said, I don’t want to live.</span> <span id="s3446">And there -- therefore, I don’t want to go from here, I -- therefore, I want to stay here, because I am not worthwhile to live.</span> <span id="s3447">I killed so many girls from Holland, Dutch girls.</span> <span id="s3448">They were so beautiful, and I went up the gas chamber, and I threw inside Zyklon B, Zyklon B, and I threw and I killed them, and they were so beautiful, and therefore I don’t want to live.</span> <span id="s3449">Now we were scared.</span> <span id="s3450">A drunk SS and talk like that, and she spitting on his head.</span> <span id="s3451">That was tragic, yeah?</span> <span id="s3452">So it -- what to do?</span> <span id="s3453">So I didn’t say anything, and I left.</span> <span id="s3454">I left them, and I went at the end of the lager was a office for the SS men.</span> <span id="s3455">They stayed always there, I saw them to go into there, yeah.</span> <span id="s3456">Never had anything to do with them.</span> <span id="s3457">I saw them there.</span> <span id="s3458">So I went into that office, to the SS office, and I said, we have in our block an SS who is drunk, and he has a gun, and we are scared of his gun, and of his -- could you please come to pick him up?</span> <span id="s3459">I didn’t say what he said, only that.</span> <span id="s3460">And one of -- I don’t know, there were two or three there, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3461">Maybe I didn’t notice, even.</span> <span id="s3462">So he got up and he followed me again, came into our little room, took him, didn’t say anything -- he was scared when he saw him.</span> <span id="s3463">He took him, and -- he took him.</span></p> <p><span id="s3464">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3465">A: And that was.</span></p> <p><span id="s3466">Q: And he took the gun as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s3467">A: The gun as well.</span> <span id="s3468">This SS had also.</span> <span id="s3469">Was dangerous, dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s3470">Q: Dangerous, but -- but interesting that -- that any of them would have that response, and come to you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3471">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3472">N -- to me accidentally to --</span></p> <p><span id="s3473">Q: I mean, no, no, I know that, but coming to the prisoners --</span></p> <p><span id="s3474">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3475">Q: -- to the

almost as if you could give him forgiveness, or being with you could --</span></p> <p><span id="s3480">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3481">Q: -- save him in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s3482">A: Yes, conscience.</span> <span id="s3483">It -- why did I do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3484">Q: Did you ever see him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s3485">A: Nah, no.</span></p>

people which they were there, or they -- they lost their families and so they were yes.</span> <span id="s3744">No I -- I would say the contrary.</span> <span id="s3745">When Jewish people meet, they come always to this the end.</span> <span id="s3746">They always end up with this lagers, with whom they lost and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s3747">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3748">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3749">The -- they mention, remember him, him, him, my friend, this, this.</span> <span id="s3750">So most of the time they end -- or we end up with Auschwitz, or with -- with

-- so they end up or we end up to talk about it.</span> <span id="s3754">No, it’s a -- something what we never miss when we are among our people which they grew up in the same city as it.</span> <span id="s3755">We have a friend with my husband, we are every Sunday together, besides the other one who doesn’t know, but he is somehow a little bit mixing up maybe.</span> <span id="s3756">He said [indecipherable] why do you go to -- to Washington?</span> <span id="s3757">He said, oh they called her from museum.</span> <span id="s3758">And then I started to talk about something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s3759">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3760">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3761">But when it is somebody from our group whom we knew, we almost always end up about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3762">And my thinking, my feeling is sadness, almost, or very often about the lager.</span></p> <p><span id="s3763">Q: Do you dream about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s3764">A: I don’t dream directly that I am in lager, but I dream often that I am lost.</span> <span id="s3765">I go -- I go somewhere, the place where I don’t know, and I’m barefoot and I don’t have money, I don’t have anything, I’m -- I’m only dressed up somehow and I’m lost, I lost everybody, I lost my husband, my -- my son.</span> <span id="s3766">Nobody’s there and I’m by myself.</span> <span id="s3767">Always I -- I go somewhere and I don’t know where.</span> <span id="s3768">Yeah, something like -- I think something [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s3769">With my family I don’t dream so often.</span> <span id="s3770">I was in Auschwitz, I used to dream with my brother.</span> <span id="s3771">I knew, now I will go to bed and I will dream the same.</span> <span id="s3772">Was still alive that time [indecipherable] thinking about it, and you have no idea.</span> <span id="s3773">That was my life, that I am with my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3774">Q: With your brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s3775">A: Yeah, my life.</span> <span id="s3776">My real life [indecipherable], yes.</span> <span id="s3777">But I imagine.</span> <span id="s3778">When I wake up, I have to get up because my thinking comes [indecipherable] so I get up, stand up and I should finish.</span> <span id="s3779">And I go out to the kitchen cooking [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3780">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s3781">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s3782">End of Tape Nine</span></p> <p><span id="s3783">Beginning Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s3784">Q: -- ing about your brother in Auschwitz, or dreaming --</span></p> <p><span id="s3785">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3786">Q: -- as if you were dreaming with him?</span> <span id="s3787">Is this what you were saying?</span> <span id="s3788">Explain that to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3789">A: I was dreaming that he is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3790">Q: That’s he’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3791">A: That he’s there.</span></p> <p><span id="s3792">Q: Ah, you’re having dreams with your brother in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s3793">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3794">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3795">So when -- did you find out in Auschwitz what had happened to your brother and your mother and father, or was it after?</span></p> <p><span id="s3796">A: No, in Auschwitz -- in Auschwitz, I found out that they left -- that they left --</span></p> <p><span id="s3797">Q: That they left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3798">A: -- my family left.</span></p> <p><span id="s3799">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3800">A: Nothing more, that they left.</span> <span id="s3801">But when I returned, then I met in a train, one of his friends or -- or acquaintances who was in the same lager.</span> <span id="s3802">And he told me in the train, I was with your brother, I worked with him in the forest, and he run away when he heard that they take the parent of the people to help them.</span> <span id="s3803">He said, and then I stayed there, I went again to work there, and somehow I met partisans and the partisans took me with him -- with them, and so I was saved.</span> <span id="s3804">Was a smaller lager ne -- next to Lublin.</span> <span id="s3805">And that -- that he was hidden.</span> <span id="s3806">I think that he said that he knew from him, or the lady where he worked, but I don’t know who told me that he was hidden, and he came home when he heard that they took hi -- but he told me this story and it’s a true story.</span></p> <p><span id="s3807">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3808">A: That he was -- he worked with him in the forest.</span></p> <p><span id="s3809">Q: So twice your brother left a place --</span></p> <p><span id="s3810">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3811">Q: -- where he might have been saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s3812">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3813">Q: Once when he was hidden and he went to your parents to help them when they were being deported, and then the second time he left the forest to be with them.</span> <span id="s3814">Do you know where they were sent?</span></p> <p><span id="s3815">A: I don’t know, but I imagine that to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s3816">Q: You think to Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s3817">A: Because this -- the small lager they sent people to Auschwitz, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3818">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3819">A: Maybe I was -- I wasn’t standing there, because it was ’42, and I came through there --</span></p> <p><span id="s3820">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3821">A: -- ’43.</span> <span id="s3822">Probably not [indecipherable] before.</span></p> <p><span id="s3823">Q: So, you go on the Death March, and you obviously see there are a new set of guards now, right?</span> <span id="s3824">These are not the guards you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s3825">A: Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht, not SS --</span></p> <p><span id="s3826">Q: Wehrmacht, uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3827">A: Wehrmacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s3828">Q: Really.</span> <span id="s3829">So these are all strangers?</span></p> <p><span id="s3830">A: I saw Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s3831">Strangers.</span></p> <p><span id="s3832">Q: And there’s a lot of shooting, isn’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s3833">A: Yes, at the beginning

strong to march.</span> <span id="s3837">I had to lean on somebody.</span> <span id="s3838">We were four girls.</span></p> <p><span id="s3839">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s3840">A: For me it was the most difficult part.</span></p> <p><span id="s3841">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s3842">A: I couldn’t -- so they pulled me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s3843">Q: And so they pulled you.</span></p> <p><span id="s3844">A: Pulled me.</span></p> <p><span id="s3845">Q: In some way like you pulled Dieter out of --</span></p> <p><span id="s3846">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span

id="s3851">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3852">It was there -- Wehrmacht -- Wehrmacht.</span> <span id="s3853">Not everybody was bad, not everybody.</span> <span id="s3854">I couldn’t say that everybody was bad.</span> <span id="s3855">And when they -- it was a order to -- to -- to rest.</span> <span id="s3856">And -- rest [indecipherable] and hi -- I had a -- a raincoat, a raincoat, a tin raincoat and it was very cold, 18th of January, and my shoes with laces, but they were narrow, they were not enough big.</span> <span id="s3857">After the war I had an operation, a bunion operation, both of them, because they became so big my -- see this line here?</span></p> <p><span id="s3858">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3859">A: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s3860">Q: You had big bunions from those shoes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3861">A: I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s3862">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3863">A: And frozen, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s3864">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3865">A: I couldn't march.</span> <span id="s3866">My hip.</span> <span id="s3867">So when they said [indecipherable] I was lying -- I always lied down in this -- my raincoat in the snow, others also, but I always, see?</span> <span id="s3868">And this SS, he was, I know from where, he was from Düsseldorf, Dooler, what Dooler?</span> <span id="s3869">It will come to my name -- my memory, Willie Dooler from Düsseldorf, and -- a Wehrmacht, and he said get up, get up.</span> <span id="s3870">I said no, I am so tired.</span> <span id="s3871">He said, you will get a cold.</span> <span id="s3872">I said, I don’t care.</span> <span id="s3873">I really didn’t care, I so tired.</span> <span id="s3874">[indecipherable] get up, get up, because when you will stay in the back they

<span id="s3885">The other was in a barn.</span> <span id="s3886">And I told him I want -- he -- I loved his approach yes, I saw that he’s so earnest.</span> <span id="s3887">I said, I want to stay here, I want to hide.</span> <span id="s3888">He said, if you want to, hide, but you take a risk because could happen that the Germans will -- will burn the village and you will burn with them.</span> <span id="s3889">If you want I will give you bread.</span> <span id="s3890">You can stay, but rather go on.</span> <span id="s3891">It’s a risk to stay.</span> <span id="s3892">So we went on and on, like him -- with him.</span> <span id="s3893">And between there -- between this time, they -- they were shooting people [indecipherable] the most sad part which I saw was when I saw a woman lying and a ho -- a brain next to her.</span> <span id="s3894">They shoot her through the brain.</span> <span id="s3895">And then a other one when -- a woman, she was Italian, not Jewish, she was pregnant, and she was in my block where I was Schreiberin so she noticed me from somewhere on a higher spot, she was standing with somebody.</span> <span id="s3896">And it made -- she made a impression that she is giving birth.</span> <span id="s3897">A big stomach and so -- felling down and looking at me [indecipherable] but I couldn’t -- first of all, I couldn’t go out and I wouldn’t risk that I couldn’t do, and then I couldn’t walk myself.</span> <span id="s3898">It was very sad, this marching.</span> <span id="s3899">I had these tied shoes, and even th-that time were -- were not pantyhoses, only stockings, remember, and girdles, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3900">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3901">A: And my girdle went into my flesh, so this was bleeding, and in -- in my flesh there.</span> <span id="s3902">The girdle, and my shoes were tied, my -- my raincoat was cold.</span> <span id="s3903">So we went.</span></p> <p><span id="s3904">Q: And this was miles --</span></p> <p><span id="s3905">A: Hm?</span></p> <p><span id="s3906">Q: -- that you walked.</span></p> <p><span id="s3907">A: I walked.</span> <span id="s3908">Miles.</span></p> <p><span id="s3909">Q: Miles and miles and miles in very cold January weather.</span></p> <p><span id="s3910">A: Was very cold [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s3911">Q: Did you have gloves this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s3912">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3913">Q: You don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s3914">A: I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s3915">It was so difficult that some people managed to have some bread in the rucksacks.</span> <span id="s3916">We had some material, we could -- we made ourselves some rucksacks, and they threw on the -- on the road, see loaves of bread.</span> <span id="s3917">Because before, the day when we left for this march, somebody opened the storages, the bread storages and they were stealing bread, so some of them, but th-throwing everything, even -- even a little clothing, whatever somebody had, thrown.</span> <span id="s3918">Everything was too heavy, was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s3919">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s3920">So how many day -- do you have any idea how many days you marched til you got to the train that took you to Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span id="s3921">A: Yes, I think that only two days because I remember two nights that we slept on the way, two nights, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3922">Q: Did you sleep two -- two nights in some --</span></p> <p><span id="s3923">A: Yes.</span></p>

first floor were sleeping SS -- not SS, soldiers, probably Wehrmacht, they were sleeping there.</span> <span id="s3926">And we were upstairs, and he was so nice.</span> <span id="s3927">We were two Jewish girls and two Christians.</span> <span id="s3928">One of -- probably was Jewish and she said that she is Christian because people said that she is Jewish, so I don’t know, but re-regularly were two and two.</span> <span id="s3929">And he was so nice that he said to the two Christian girls, Polish girls, to tell us we shouldn’t say that we are Jewish in front of the soldiers or the people because that would be bad for us.</span> <span id="s3930">We -- we wouldn’t say anyhow, yeah.</span> <span id="s3931">Yeah, he helped us.</span></p> <p><span id="s3932">Q: Were there people in the Polish population that saw you as you were marching?</span></p> <p><span id="s3933">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3934">Q: Wi -- di -- did people say anything, did anybody give you anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s3935">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s3936">It was -- I wrote about it.</span> <span id="s3937">In one village, I don’t know -- I don’t -- didn’t know the villages, I didn't know the times.</span> <span id="s3938">There were a few women standing with buckets full of water and with little containers and they -- they passed on.</span> <span id="s3939">I was on the other side, I didn’t get a water, but on this side, they -- standing, I don’t know, maybe 10 - 12 women, Polish women.</span></p> <p><span id="s3940">Q: Standing there.</span></p> <p><span

the Germans didn’t stop them?</span></p> <p><span id="s3945">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3946">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s3947">A: No.</span> <span id="s3948">Maybe -- maybe they were between

<p><span id="s3952">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s3953">A: Probably first day because we were rushing, and so they could help --</span></p> <p><span id="s3954">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3955">A: -- they helped with water, and that was a big thing, a big thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s3956">Q: It must have been important as a human being to see it, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s3957">A: Very important, very important, even I didn’t get the water, was very important to see that some people are nice, and they were not scared of the Germans, they gave us water.</span></p> <p><span id="s3958">Q: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s3959">A: See that means water, when you don’t have it --</span></p> <p><span id="s3960">Q: Yes, it may be more important than food in some ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s3961">A: Yeah, more important for sure, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s3962">Q: So do you get on a train to go to Ravensbrück?</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s3967">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s3968">Mm-hm, and in the meantime the men were there already, and probably they were the whole night there on the station, because they threw them ou-out, off the trains, frozen, like pieces of -- of wood.</span> <span id="s3969">They take a piece of wood --</span></p> <p><span id="s3970">Q: And throw it out?</span> <span

id="s3980">Musselmens.</span></p> <p><span id="s3981">Q: So were the women in better shape than that -- than the men?</span></p> <p><span id="s3982">A: That time I think that they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s3983">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s3984">A: -- because I didn’t see anybody, only what -- who was shot, but I didn’t see anybody through -- through them, because we came and we

arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s3988">Q: [indecipherable] yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s3989">A: -- so I had that impression that -- and somebody said also, among the men that they are very long here, I don’t know for how -- how many hours or the whole night, or so.</span> <span id="s3990">And they got frozen there on the train, on the train station they got frozen because they arrived there, so they were there.</span> <span id="s3991">But they couldn’t make it.</span> <span id="s3992">After we left, we -- we -- the train stopped in Berlin, was bombed that time.</span> <span id="s3993">And the women said that they don’t know about Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s3994">Girls ask, do you know about a place, Auschwitz, where they burn people?</span> <span id="s3995">No.</span> <span id="s3996">But then they took us to different places, train stopped, and we went further, further, because it was no place.</span> <span id="s3997">Everything was evacuating from -- from pop -- from Poland.</span> <span id="s3998">So we went, went til we came to Ravensbrück, and there started the other misery.</span></p> <p><span id="s3999">Q: It was really bad there.</span></p> <p><span id="s4000">A: Bad because no food, only the second day or third day some food, but we didn’t have containers.</span> <span id="s4001">Only our friend Vera Kubario, she had some [indecipherable] containers she brought, and she gave us sips to take, we counted the sips.</span> <span id="s4002">Now you will take five sips, now five, five, five.</span> <span id="s4003">And once she hit me,

don’t have to believe her everything what she says.</span> <span id="s4163">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4164">Q: You went back to Prešov, we talked about that in the beginning.</span> <span id="s4165">And then you went to your uncle in Humenné.</span></p> <p><span id="s4166">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4167">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s4168">And you met your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s4169">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4170">Q: You met the person who became your husband, if you will.</span></p> <p><span id="s4171">A: Yeah he came -- became his boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s4172">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s4173">Why did the two of you decide to stay in Slovakia, or was there no choice, until ’68?</span></p> <p><span id="s4174">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4175">It’s a reasonable question.</span> <span id="s4176">Life was good there.</span> <span id="s4177">After the war, people were happy.</span> <span id="s4178">They were not -- we were also to dancing, so still, if also [indecipherable] different who was there, not everybody was there, because not everybody returned, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s4179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4180">A: But those who were there, they wanted enjoy life.</span> <span id="s4181">So life was joyful and even the economy was good, because nothing was there more, so when somebody started business or so, so he made -- he was doing well, or -- or he got a job, or so.</span> <span id="s4182">Nothing was there, everything was like a vacuum in Slovakia.</span> <span id="s4183">People were missing, so everything had to be built again, so economy was good.</span></p> <p><span id="s4184">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s4185">A: And it was also music, and it was -- here and there somebody returned, so they were happy, so they used to say, oh here will be better than in America, so I will stay here, yeah.</span> <span id="s4186">But then slowly, slowly we realized that it’s not the same life than it was, because first of all, we missed our families.</span></p> <p><span id="s4187">Q: I was going to say, it must --</span></p> <p><span id="s4188">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4189">Q: -- must have been very difficult to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s4190">A: Yes, it was, it was.</span> <span id="s4191">Well, it’s -- I married.</span> <span id="s4192">I had the home, yes.</span> <span id="s4193">I -- I wasn’t -- I didn’t have to be hungry.</span> <span id="s4194">Was a reasonal --</span></p> <p><span id="s4195">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4196">A: Now, I liked him.</span> <span id="s4197">We didn’t go out, no -- nothing.</span> <span id="s4198">He was a [indecipherable] and I was a -- and suddenly -- I was engaged to somebody.</span> <span id="s4199">And somebody -- suddenly he asked me if I want to marry him, I said yes.</span> <span id="s4200">But beside that, yes, beside that he was a -- was a nice boy, quiet boy and so, but I was happy that I have a home, yes, have a home, and I have somebody, somebody close.</span> <span id="s4201">I needed somebody to talk.</span> <span id="s4202">Somebody who would under -- who would be willing to understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s4203">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4204">A: Who will be willing to listen [indecipherable] so it was not reason to go out.</span> <span id="s4205">Then later on we wanted to go here.</span> <span id="s4206">My uncle left for America, for New York, and he wanted me to come with him, he wrote to his relatives they should send me an affidavit --</span></p> <p><span id="s4207">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4208">A: -- but they didn’t.</span> <span id="s4209">And -- we have to stop, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s4210">Q: No, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s4211">A: And then my husband got an affidavit from his uncle, from Texas or from where.</span> <span id="s4212">But affida -- and then he asked for me because we were engaged, til the affidavit came, we -- we worked on a passport.</span> <span id="s4213">The numbers were very high in the States, yes, registration number.</span> <span id="s4214">And til -- and he has his -- he had his store, his house and so on, til he deci -- he -- til he started to be -- to turn to the Communists.</span> <span id="s4215">So til then we asked for the passport and we send the last minute the pa -- the affidavit to the consulate, to the American consulate, and it was late, was late, because -- because why?</span> <span id="s4216">Because the numbers were high.</span> <span id="s4217">So somehow it didn’t work, til we decided that we want to leave.</span> <span id="s4218">So the numbers were late, and we stayed.</span> <span id="s4219">And then it was impossible to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s4220">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4221">A: For years.</span> <span id="s4222">And then we left still, to s -- we came to New York in 1966.</span> <span id="s4223">They permitted us for a -- for a visit.</span> <span id="s4224">They believed that we will return.</span> <span id="s4225">But we didn’t find that what we -- what we were looking for in New York.</span> <span id="s4226">We stayed for two months, and we had -- had on jobs.</span> <span id="s4227">So we didn’t have to -- where to sleep, we slept once here, once there, we have shift from place to place, yes.</span> <span id="s4228">So we went back.</span> <span id="s4229">And then we started again --</span></p> <p><span id="s4230">Q: Again, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4231">A: -- and we came there, then we returned.</span></p> <p><span id="s4232">Q: [indecipherable] to stop, yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s4233">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4234">End of Tape 10</span></p> <p><span id="s4235">Beginning Tape 11</span></p> <p><span id="s4236">Q: Is it Alice or Alicia, which is -- which do you like?</span></p> <p><span id="s4237">A: Alice, Alicia --</span></p> <p><span id="s4238">Q: Ali -- Alicia -- Aliska --</span></p> <p><span id="s4239">A: Aliska.</span> <span id="s4240">Whatever, is so many -- whatever you want.</span> <span id="s4241">Alice is --</span></p> <p><span id="s4242">Q: Alice is it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4243">A: -- regularly, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4244">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s4245">Do you have -- when you think about your life, do you think that Auschwitz changed you a great deal?</span> <span id="s4246">Or how -- how do you think that -- be-besides the loss, I mean that’s clear --</span></p> <p><span id="s4247">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4248">Q: -- that the loss is tremendous and there’s nothing -- but you as a person, do you think it changed you a great deal?</span> <span id="s4249">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4250">I don’t find things so -- some things for s-so important than -- than many people, ye -- yes.</span> <span id="s4251">I don’t find little things so very important.</span> <span id="s4252">Things are which -- you will leave and they will stay and nothing will change.</span> <span id="s4253">No, I -- I don’t know how I was there at that time, because I was so young.</span></p> <p><span id="s4254">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4255">A: So I didn't have certain [indecipherable] for life.</span> <span id="s4256">I didn’t have certain -- any [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s4257">I wanted to be well, I wanted to be happy, and that’s it.</span> <span id="s4258">So I -- I didn’t have [indecipherable] I want this, this, I -- my values are this or this.</span> <span id="s4259">But only for now, I -- I feel sometimes different from others in this aspect, that not everything is for me so important like for you here in the States, who didn’t go through these harsh times.</span> <span id="s4260">And maybe I understand better people.</span> <span id="s4261">I look for a reasons when somebody is not as I want to.</span> <span id="s4262">So I try to find the reason why is he not, because I believe that everybody has some reason for his way, how he thinks, yes.</span> <span id="s4263">And everybody is right, in his way, and that perception is different, but is a big value to you.</span> <span id="s4264">Doesn’t have to be to me, or to others.</span> <span id="s4265">And then, not everybody has the strength to -- to struggle the same way for life, yes.</span> <span id="s4266">You will go for -- you want to be, let’s see, I don’t know, maybe you are the director of the whole museum or something, or a minister of -- of welfare, or something.</span> <span id="s4267">And somebody will not have courage, or I will not have courage and you do it your way because you believe in your strengths and so somebody doesn’t believe, or you believe in -- in mankind, somebody doesn’t.</span> <span id="s4268">You will risk your life for somebody, and some -- whatever.</span> <span id="s4269">It doesn’t mean the other one is better or worse.</span> <span id="s4270">That’s your -- your -- these are your values and your beliefs.</span> <span id="s4271">Who believes and values the same thing, yes?</span> <span id="s4272">You believe in this [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s4273">Q: So, it -- has it in some strange way made you more tolerant than you would have been?</span></p> <p><span id="s4274">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4275">I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s4276">Q: That you’re easier on people, you don’t judge people?</span></p> <p><span id="s4277">A: Yes, I don’t like to judge people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4278">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s4279">A: I like to understand people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4280">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4281">A: And not to judge people.</span> <span id="s4282">This the difference maybe, yeah.</span> <span id="s4283">That’s a good evaluation.</span></p> <p><span id="s4284">Q: Do you think you were not that way when you were younger, before --</span></p> <p><span id="s4285">A: I say --</span></p> <p><span id="s4286">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4287">A: -- I don’t know, because --</span></p> <p><span id="s4288">Q: You don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s4289">A: -- I was nothing.</span> <span id="s4290">I was nothing, I -- I wanted to be happy, I wanted to be nice looking, I wanted to be liked.</span></p> <p><span id="s4291">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4292">A: I wanted to be -- to make something of my life.</span> <span id="s4293">But I -- I didn’t have -- maybe somehow unconsciously I had these beliefs but I didn't know about it because I didn’t have to deal with real life.</span> <span id="s4294">I went home, I have my food, I have my bed, I have my -- my love from my parents, from my family.</span> <span id="s4295">So I didn’t -- didn’t have to speculate why it’s like that or like that.</span> <span id="s4296">Life was simple.</span> <span id="s4297">Was a [indecipherable] yeah, but I don’t -- didn’t have my own [indecipherable] and I have to make up my own [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4298">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4299">A: -- and that is [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4300">Q: But it’s interesting that such a brutal place as Auschwitz --</span></p> <p><span id="s4301">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4302">Q: -- could somehow -- whether it brought out in you, or you simply made of who you were as a child and didn’t know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s4303">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4304">Q: Because clearly, certain values that you had came out there.</span> <span id="s4305">You didn’t become a brutal person --</span></p> <p><span id="s4306">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4307">Q: -- in Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s4308">A: No.</span> <span id="s4309">No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s4310">Q: So maybe in some funny way it didn’t change you.</span> <span id="s4311">It changed the course of your life.</span></p> <p><span id="s4312">A: Yes, could be.</span></p> <p><span id="s4313">Q: But maybe it didn’t change your character.</span></p> <p><span id="s4314">A: Yes, maybe not, maybe not.</span></p> <p><span id="s4315">Q: It’s interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s4316">A: I didn't try to understand people, because I didn’t have to understand them.</span></p> <p><span id="s4317">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4318">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s4319">Didn’t have to evaluate them because I was a young girl, could I evaluate older people, for politics or something like that, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4320">Q: Right, right.</span> <span id="s4321">But you did realize a dream that you had when you were a child, and that was to become a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s4322">A: Yes, I wanted to become a teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s4323">Q: And you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s4324">A: Yes, and after the war I wanted double to be a teacher.</span> <span id="s4325">Not [indecipherable] so much to teach, but how to behave and didn’t succeed always, not all the students were good, but I tried, I tried.</span></p> <p><span id="s4326">Q: And what did you teach?</span> <span id="s4327">What was the subject for which you --</span></p> <p><span id="s4328">A: My main subject was home economics.</span></p> <p><span id="s4329">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4330">A: That is family living, that is what -- housing and design, that is nutrition and cooking and sewing and material.</span> <span id="s4331">That’s my -- yeah.</span> <span id="s4332">But in Canada is like that, that you don’t -- sorry -- that you don’t stick only to one subject, you teach everything what you need to teach, okay?</span> <span id="s4333">You teach it.</span> <span id="s4334">So I taught many things.</span> <span id="s4335">I studied mathematics, which I am not so good in mathematics, I couldn’t say, but I didn’t know [indecipherable] taught me, and even physics one time I had to teach, lot more.</span> <span id="s4336">I taught many things, what they needed, yeah, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s4337">Q: But what you were really teaching was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4338">A: Well [indecipherable] that was family living, that means -- I studied human relations and family living see, for eight years at Magill to -- to make up my -- my -- my studies, yeah, for update my studies [indecipherable] what did I stu -- yeah, I had special education [indecipherable] and then I had there a teacher certificate and here I made the [indecipherable] three diplomas here.</span> <span id="s4339">But they -- everywhere was psychologic, everywhere was psychologic.</span></p> <p><span id="s4340">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4341">A: To understand people, that was my first thing.</span> <span id="s4342">And I think I master this one, to understand people.</span> <span id="s4343">I try evaluate people, and then to understand them.</span> <span id="s4344">That is my main thing in life, toward people.</span></p> <p><span id="s4345">Q: And what did you enjoy most about teaching?</span></p> <p><span id="s4346">A: Mostly check.</span> <span id="s4347">I used to say, you don’t like your -- your -- your day, think about the check.</span> <span id="s4348">Or -- or think about the -- some people work also in a mental hospital.</span> <span id="s4349">But I -- I used to say really was -- I was joking, that if one -- if only one student understood me, if I changed only one student, then it was worthwhile everything to study, to teach and so -- to change them, to change them, to -- to -- to give them self confidence -- first of all self confidence, that’s very important.</span> <span id="s4350">And self reliance and -- and things like that to -- to help them to -- to make a living, to help them to make something about themselves.</span> <span id="s4351">But then I saw that, that as soon changed, he didn’t believe in himself.</span> <span id="s4352">Sometimes I gave him a better mark, and I implanted into him that he is good.</span> <span id="s4353">And sometimes it worked that he believed in himself.</span> <span id="s4354">That is the most -- that was the most important part to me.</span> <span id="s4355">And they should respect people and so, but mainly self respect.</span> <span id="s4356">I used to say, and you don’t respect yourself, nobody will respect you.</span> <span id="s4357">That was [indecipherable] I believe that’s the main thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s4358">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4359">A: Courage, self respect, self confidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s4360">Q: Did any of the students ever ask you about your European past and where you were?</span> <span id="s4361">Did they -- any -- any of your students ever know that you were in Auschwitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s4362">A: No, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s4363">Q: No, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s4364">A: Nobody.</span> <span id="s4365">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4366">Q: And that was a very conscious decision on your part --</span></p> <p><span id="s4367">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4368">Q: -- not to tell them.</span> <span id="s4369">Do you think now maybe it would have been okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s4370">A: I wouldn’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4371">Q: You wouldn’t say.</span></p> <p><span id="s4372">A: No, I wouldn’t say, because I have to be one of them.</span> <span id="s4373">Nothing has to be in my life which would differ me, which would make me different, yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s4374">Q: Uh-huh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s4375">A: Cause they were not in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s4376">They have to deal with life how it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s4377">Q: [indecipherable] is.</span></p> <p><span id="s4378">A: How it is, they have to deal this way.</span> <span id="s4379">It’s their [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4380">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4381">A: And they -- they have [indecipherable] to work out their life as it is [indecipherable] them up, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s4382">Q: I would imagine you were a wonderful teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s4383">A: I was a good teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s4384">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4385">A: People liked me, yeah.</span> <span id="s4386">Not everybody was -- had discipline in my class, no, because on the other side they counted on the that I am soft, maybe, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s4387">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s4388">Yeah, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s4389">A: Oh that’s right, yes, I couldn’t say for sure I was so respected and so, but they liked me, and they trusted me, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4390">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s4391">So is there anything that we -- I know you have all sorts of things in your life that we haven’t talked about, but there -- is there anything important about your experiences during the Holocaust that you want to talk about that we haven’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s4392">A: Maybe about this lady, it’s amazing, the German lady whom I met.</span> <span id="s4393">She was lageralteste.</span> <span id="s4394">This was lagerfuehrer, an SS, and a haftling was lageralteste.</span> <span id="s4395">She came, I met her, and she said that she was a lagerfuehrerin.</span> <span id="s4396">In a lager she was an SS, and that she opened the door and she let out the prisoners and so she became a haftling.</span> <span id="s4397">I mentioned her in my thing.</span> <span id="s4398">And she -- and so she became a prisoner.</span> <span id="s4399">Then I didn’t see -- see her too much.</span> <span id="s4400">And we discussed with her -- I suppose I spoke to her, discussed about human relations, among human feelings, about beha -- humanly to behave.</span> <span id="s4401">And she said, it’s very easy outside to behave humanly, according to etiquette, and according to -- to -- to rules, human rules.</span> <span id="s4402">But here it’s very difficult, because first of all, we have to think about ourselves, yes.</span> <span id="s4403">Was difficult.</span> <span id="s4404">So that outside I am very -- she said, outside in the world, people move with masks on their faces.</span> <span id="s4405">They smile, they speak nicely, it seems that they care about themselves.</span> <span id="s4406">But here you have to talk, you have to think about yourself.</span> <span id="s4407">So it is not so difficult that here you see the human being as it is -- as he is, as he is.</span> <span id="s4408">There it is a mask.</span> <span id="s4409">It’s a play.</span> <span id="s4410">Outside, the world is a play, in lager --</span></p> <p><span id="s4411">Q: It’s not like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s4412">A: -- is the real human being.</span> <span id="s4413">Y-You show yourself -- you present yourself as you really are.</span> <span id="s4414">You don’t try to cover up yourself.</span> <span id="s4415">However, who -- how is -- whoever -- how he is, so he -- he presents himself.</span> <span id="s4416">That’s the real life, that’s school.</span></p> <p><span id="s4417">Q: And you think that’s true?</span></p> <p><span id="s4418">A: That’s true.</span></p> <p><span id="s4419">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4420">A: That’s true, that’s true.</span> <span id="s4421">Yes, it’s very true.</span></p> <p><span id="s4422">Q: So -- so, if that’s true, then was, in some sense, living outside the lager difficult, even though it was horrible in Auschwitz, there was something about it --</span></p> <p><span id="s4423">A: No, nothing [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4424">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s4425">A: There you learn how to face people, how to understand people, you search in them how they are and you take them how they are.</span> <span id="s4426">You understand them how they are.</span> <span id="s4427">Not difficult.</span> <span id="s4428">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s4429">Q: But outside, it’s harder.</span></p> <p><span id="s4430">A: Outside, well, there are people which they -- which they try to -- to -- to present themselves better than they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s4431">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s4432">A: It’s hard for them to change, they should be really as they think that they have to be, or they want to be seen.</span> <span id="s4433">Understand that?</span></p> <p><span id="s4434">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s4435">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s4436">Q: That’s the mask.</span></p> <p><span id="s4437">A: That’s the mask.</span> <span id="s4438">You have to take off the mask and --</span></p>
