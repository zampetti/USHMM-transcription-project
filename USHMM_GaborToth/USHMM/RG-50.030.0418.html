<span id="s20">And my mother was born in Denmark in ’87, but she grew up in a Swedish town called Helsingborg, just across from Elsinore [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s21">She talked fluent

really remember that much about him because he passed away, oh, guess somewhere around like thir -- 1930, something like that, and his wife died about the same time.</span> <span id="s29">My father’s father had already passed away before that -- before I was born, and my father’s mother passed away in the early 20’s, I think I saw her once.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Wha -- di -- did you ever go visit the farm?</span> <span id="s31">Could you describe it?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: You just knew that about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A:

was the only one, only sibling.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">Q: And her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Inger Margrethe Fischer.</span> <span id="s44">She was born in 19 -- 1919.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Describe what your home life was like.</span> <span id="s46">What -- what did -- what was your house actually like, or your apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s48">We had ah one of the attached houses, you have a long row, and there were two stories.</span> <span id="s49">Downstairs, living room, dining room, kitchen, service porch, and upstairs three bedrooms and a bath.</span> <span id="s50">A garden -- front garden and back.</span> <span id="s51">No garage, no car, room for bicycles, though.</span> <span id="s52">So -- and that is the only pa -- only house I lived in in Denmark, in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And did you know your neighbors?</span> <span id="s54">Or how -- what were your relations with the people who lived on either side of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Well, my father believed that you tip your hat to your neighbors, you don’t get too friendly with them.</span> <span id="s56">You can get friendly with the people down the street, cause you can ignore them if you want to, but your neighbors, you are kind of stuck with.</span> <span id="s57">So we didn’t really know the neighbors.</span> <span id="s58">The people across the street, o-on -- other people on the street we knew well.</span> <span id="s59">There was a polar explorer two houses down the street, Peter Franken, who won a 64,000 dollar question back what, 30 years ago, and had a daughter Pippanuk, she was half Eskimo.</span> <span id="s60">And they had an ice winter in the back there and something like ‘28 I remember we were build an igloo.</span> <span id="s61">That was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s62">Otherwise, we had an opera singer, and we had an author, and we had the fellow across the street was work in the library.</span> <span id="s63">Have a bunch of kids around, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Tell us a little bit about your father, what he did for a living.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s66">My father started out in -- when I was born he was -- he was working for a bank that went broke back in about ’26 - ’27.</span> <span id="s67">And then he bought into paper wholesale, and then as a side job he was working auditing in a savings bank.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Auditing?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Auditing.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: And it got to be more and more time spent on the auditing, less and less on the paper.</span> <span id="s72">So, he kept working til he was middle 70’s, auditing.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: And what did your mother do?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: She -- a housewife.</span> <span id="s75">She didn’t work after I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: What -- what -- what would she do at -- in the home, and did she have help in any way?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: No, she didn’t have any help, but [indecipherable] she did a lot of baking, as I recall.</span> <span id="s78">She liked that.</span> <span id="s79">That was a big thing in those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: And can you talk a little bit about what it would be like at a family dinner, what the talk would be like, your mother and father?</span> <span id="s81">Or would your father come home for dinner?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: Oh yeah, my father was always home for dinner.</span> <span id="s83">Well, I suppose general conversation was what -- what happened in school today, you know, and stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: What about politics?</span> <span id="s85">Is that something that your parents discussed?</span></p> <p><span id="s86">A: No, they were not that interested in it.</span> <span id="s87">My father was very conservative, which is -- would be like a Republican</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: And I think my mother was conservative, too, but we didn’t discuss much wi -- politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: How do you know that your father was conservative?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Well, from what he said about it and from a newspaper he kept and some of the phrases of his, you know, you hear when he was talking -- talking with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What about church or faith?</span> <span id="s93">Was that something that was discussed, or how was that a part of your family life?</span></p> <p><span id="s94">A: Well, we used to go to church fairly regularly.</span> <span id="s95">Denmark has freedom of faith, with one exception, the king has to be Lutheran, or now the queen.</span> <span id="s96">But I was confirmed.</span> <span id="s97">I was -- see, we went six months we went once a week for a couple of hours, and then after that, you know, pretty much up to me whether I -- I wanted to go or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s99">A-At what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: 16?</span> <span id="s101">Something like 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: And was it something that was a part of daily life in any way, besides going to church?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, I was -- did a lot of rowing I was a member of a rowing club, and I did a lot of that, almost every evening in summertime, I would go out there, row.</span> <span id="s104">And then weekends we would take off, usually three man to a boat, go up along the coast with a tent and put that up somewhere, cook.</span> <span id="s105">Not always successfully, but -- and also in summertime you go off for a week or two with a boat and a tent.</span> <span id="s106">So you-- you know, somewhere out in a -- some of the smaller islands around.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: And who -- who -- how did you learn how to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: To row?</span> <span id="s109">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Well, you join the -- the row club and they -- they teach you.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: How close were you to the water?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Oh, about half hour by bicycle.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s114">So did -- no one had a car in your family --</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: -- everyone have a bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: Never had a -- never had a car.</span> <span id="s120">I didn’t learn to drive until I came to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s122">Did your mom get around on the bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: Yeah, she had one too.</span> <span id="s124">My father didn’t, though, he used to walk, or streetcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Do you remember the make of the bicycle?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: There was a -- there was an outfit in Denmark that made them.</span> <span id="s127">No, I can’t -- I don’t know off hand.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">Q: Talk a little bit about the friends that you did have in the neighborhood as a young boy, and as you began to get older, and that you might go out on these rowing excursions with.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: What happened to them -- well, for one thing, I went to a boy’s school, and some of the fellows -- one or-- two of them I’m still in contact with.</span> <span id="s130">One wound up in a real estate outfit, and sat in the same office in Copenhagen for about 60 -- 50 years or something like that.</span> <span id="s131">Then -- he -- he’s now retired with Parkinson’s, pretty bad shape.</span> <span id="s132">Another one wound up as a -- had a bookstore, and one was a professor in some medicine.</span> <span id="s133">One was the head tax man in -- on a small island in Denmark.</span> <span id="s134">I was told once he was the most hated man on the island.</span> <span id="s135">I guess that goes with being a tax collector.</span> <span id="s136">And that’s about the only ones I know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: You mentioned going out on the rowboat and even spending the week --</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: -- alone -- alone or with some friends.</span> <span id="s140">Can you talk about what that was like, you know, wh -- ho -- what kind of equipment did you take?</span> <span id="s141">How long did you spend --</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Hello there.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Stop for a second.</span> <span id="s144">[tape break] Can you describe one of these week -- weekend trips where you went with a few friends and you stayed on the island, you went on the rowboat.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Well, we would leave from the rowing club in Copenhagen, usually on Friday, usually after s -- after work, and -- which would be -- we leave about six, seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s146">And of course, in the summertime it’s light until 11.</span> <span id="s147">So you go up the coast, and stop someplace up there, and we had s -- a certain place picked out we could stay in.</span> <span id="s148">Put up your tent and do some cooking and put your sleeping bag out.</span> <span id="s149">And next day just fool around on the beach, just swimming and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s150">That was -- that would be on a Saturday and then on Sunday row back to the rowing club.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And how old were you when you were doing that?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Oh, started when I was about 15.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Were you ever a -- a -- an explorer or a boy scout, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: -- in any of those groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: What kind of values would you say your father and your mother taught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s158">A: Well, for -- the truth is worse than -- the -- honesty and not to be late.</span> <span id="s159">They tell you that thing about not to be late when you have an appointment.</span> <span id="s160">Be on time and be ready.</span> <span id="s161">So those were some of the important ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s162">Q: And the honesty, what would they say about that, that you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Well, there wasn’t any doubt about it, you had to be honest, you know.</span> <span id="s164">Or, if you get caught not being honest, that was not advisable.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: A-And how were you with your parents, were you a rebellious young man, or were things pretty smooth at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Oh, pretty smooth.</span> <span id="s167">Didn’t have many problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about the city at that time?</span> <span id="s169">Di-Did you leave your neighborhood a lot?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Oh yeah, to go –to the rowing club that was about a half hour’s ride or something like that.</span> <span id="s171">Half hour by bicycle.</span> <span id="s172">See I started working when I was 15, so that kind of changed the whole situation.</span> <span id="s173">Worked full time.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Tell us about that, why did you leave school?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: I finished school.</span> <span id="s176">I started school when I was five years old, in first grade, and then 10 years schools, so I was f-finished at 15, and then I got a job, I was supposed to start the first of September, but they called from the office and a -- oh, a couple of weeks early and said they were kind of short, could I start earlier.</span> <span id="s177">This was on a Thursday.</span> <span id="s178">And I was sitting -- my mother picked up the phone, I was sitting right there, so she told the gentleman, Mr. [indecipherable] that sh -- sure, I could do that.</span> <span id="s179">So he want to know when I could start.</span> <span id="s180">I -- could I come in on Monday?</span> <span id="s181">My mother said, no, Monday, that’s a bad day to start on.</span> <span id="s182">So how about tomorrow, Friday?</span> <span id="s183">Oh, Friday’s a bad day to start.</span> <span id="s184">Well, when could he start?</span> <span id="s185">He can be there in a half hour.</span> <span id="s186">So I went out, got on my bicycle, and went in and started work.</span> <span id="s187">That was in a Danish Steamship owner’s association as a -- as a messenger, and I was there from August til the end of March, and then I got a job in a steamship company as an apprentice, and I was there three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: What year is this that you started at the steamship company?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: ’37?</span> <span id="s190">Yeah, ’37.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: And you say you were a messenger, what did that entail?</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Ah, well, w-we -- I had to supply my own bicycle, of course.</span> <span id="s193">I had to drive around, deliver mail, and -- and run down to post office with telegrams and all those -- stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: So you were kind of a courier, you were moving things around?</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s197">Why did your mom want you to start right then?</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: Oh, I think she knew I was kind of bored.</span> <span id="s199">There comes a time, you know, on a vacation when -- this vacation, you know, if you want to do something else-- I was anxious to get started working anyway.</span> <span id="s200">I wanted to work the ships, so I was lucky I got into that kind of business.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What was your attraction to the ships?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Oh, I guess your -- Denmark is a small country, and I think the fact that you always work with ships, you know, you -- you’ve fooled around with the whole world.</span> <span id="s203">You have ships running all over and.</span> <span id="s204">You meet people from all over the world.</span> <span id="s205">Wind up working all over the world, too.</span> <span id="s206">So I -- I really liked that.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: What do you remember about the Jewish community when you were growing up?</span> <span id="s208">Were you aware of Jews living in the city, and what kind of contact did you have with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: We had, in the school, as a -- as a routine there was religious instruction one hour a week.</span> <span id="s210">And we had, I think about two Jews in my class, Leif Manyas, and [indecipherable] I think that was, and they were both excused from the -- from the religious instruction, as a matter of routine.</span> <span id="s211">And that was really the first I ever heard about Jews.</span> <span id="s212">My sister had a girlfriend that was Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So there were Jews in your class, and your sister had her -- a girlfriend who was Jewish.</span> <span id="s214">Did they live in the same neighborhoods, or where they lived, would they be living in the same community as non-Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Oh, same community as non-Jews.</span> <span id="s216">Oh, just like everybody else.</span> <span id="s217">Oh yeah, there was no different there, they would live in -- in the -- I don’t know if there was anybody in the neighborhood we were, I am not so sure, but there might have been.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: And in your rowing club, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: Yeah, you never -- you never kind of thought about whether anybody is Jewish or Catholic or Muhammadan or Lutheran, whatever they were.</span> <span id="s220">I mean, we all thought there wouldn't be any difference between a Jew and a non-Jew, for instance.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: What, for instance do -- in the -- the -- would you find that the Jews might be merchants in -- in Copenhagen?</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: Well, a lot of the stockbrokers, for instance, lot of stockbroker outfits were run by Jewish people, in name, Jewish names.</span> <span id="s223">[indecipherable] was one name -- Goldsmith was one.</span> <span id="s224">Hanseiger, I -- I knew those people.</span> <span id="s225">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: Were there synagogues nearby?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: There was one synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: One synagogue, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: And where was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: In the middle of Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: And did you ever go there for any reason?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: Inside?</span> <span id="s234">No, not inside.</span> <span id="s235">Oh, I passed it often, I -- my father’s office was about a block down the street, so I passed it regularly, but I never been inside.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s237">Tell us a little bit more about your job as a courier.</span> <span id="s238">What would you be doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: Well, it was a matter o-of running around to the various steamship companies with mail and -- and messages, and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s240">Also running to companies that was involved with shipping, like companies that took care of the signing on of sailors, the customs, immigration.</span> <span id="s241">Certain o-official outfits.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: And this is in the mid-30’s?</span> <span id="s243">1936 - ’37?</span></p> <p><span id="s244">A: ’36 to -- to the end of March in ’40.</span> <span id="s245">About three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: When the -- you can think back, and when you began to be aware of events going on in Europe, what do you remember first hearing, for instance, about Hitler?</span> <span id="s247">How did you hear about him, originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: Well, probably, you know, the -- in the newscast on the -- on the newspapers.</span> <span id="s249">I was on the vacation in -- in May ’39 in Germany on the youth hostel tour, friend of mine and I were down, and we took the train to Hamburg, stayed in a youth hostel, that was on a ship as a matter of fact.</span> <span id="s250">And then with a -- with boat, with train, walking, we went down to Koblenz and the Rhine went down to Heidelberg, and then we came back through Berlin, we came back to Copenhagen, about two weeks.</span> <span id="s251">The other vacations, when I worked for the steamship company they used to put -- put us on the ship as a deck boy and I’d work on the ship for two or three weeks, to give you some idea about the practical part of the shipping.</span> <span id="s252">And also that gave you a chance to go some of the ports around, see them loading.</span> <span id="s253">I was in Riga one time, we were loading railroad ties.</span> <span id="s254">In Finland one time we were loading props -- what they used in the -- in the mines in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: Did you begin to notice more people coming through Copenhagen u-using the ships to perhaps leave Europe, or to leave the country of their origin?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: No, there really wasn’t much feeling about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">Q: You didn’t notice an increase in the volume of traffic in any way, of people perhaps going to Denmark, and then leaving Denmark to go somewhere else?</span></p> <p><span id="s258">A: No.</span> <span id="s259">No.</span> <span id="s260">Then I got called in on the first of April for -- for conscription, and of course that -- on the ninth of April the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s261">That was a short affair.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Well, before we -- we -- we go to that, I just want to chart a lit -- a little more what was happening that you -- I’m wondering if you could think back and remember what your thoughts were about what was going on in Europe.</span> <span id="s263">In 1939, things began to shift, Hitler was a figure, but he was also invading, and I wonder what you thought about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s265">Well, of course, I was down there in May of ’39, in -- in the Germany, but then when the war started in September, and being in the shipping business, that made a whale of a difference in -- in the way we had to operate.</span> <span id="s266">For one thing, there was a danger of -- of mines and -- and you know, torpedoes and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s267">And there was a danger in the ships going into Germany, they were down there to load coal for Denmark, and there was a danger of losing ships, losing personnel.</span> <span id="s268">So, you know, the whole thing changed.</span> <span id="s269">Actually overnight there on -- on the -- the Sep-September, the first, I think, the ger -- German entered Poland on the 13th and the French declared war against Germany.</span> <span id="s270">That’s when really the things started popping.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Y-You mentioned that it changed how shipping operated.</span> <span id="s272">What kinds of new orders came into the ships, or did they stop going certain places because of danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Well, there was -- of course the minute you go to a German port, they were more controlled by the German military.</span> <span id="s274">In Denmark there was -- oh, a lot of things you had to -- to secure the ships against magnetic mines and things like that.</span> <span id="s275">You had to put extra lifesaving equipment on them, all those kinds of things.</span> <span id="s276">You had special instructions from -- from the military which -- where -- where to sail, where to avoid.</span> <span id="s277">So that meant running around and picking up instructions from the military whenever a ship was going to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: Did you go on any of these ships after Germany invaded Poland --</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: -- and these dangers began?</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: No, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s283">And what were your thoughts about what was going on?</span> <span id="s284">What -- how -- how did you understand what Hitler was doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: You know when y -- when you are -- when you are 18 or 19, you really don’t think that much about things like that.</span> <span id="s286">There was a lot of other things going on.</span> <span id="s287">You’re kind of busy, so uh obviously it was kind of scary when you -- the Germans were never very popular in Denmark for one thing.</span> <span id="s288">This goes back to a -- a war in 1864 when Germany and Denmark were fighting and Denmark lost that war.</span> <span id="s289">And part of Denmark was given over to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s290">That was then returned to Denmark in 1920.</span> <span id="s291">But there was still a lot of national [indecipherable] dislike in Denmark of the Germans, they were not very popular, never have been.</span> <span id="s292">So it -- it was -- obviously it was scary when you see what was going on in Poland and in -- in -- in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: Did you think that it would happen to your country, were there precautions or preparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Well, there was -- you know, you couldn’t have any lights outside at nighttime, everything had to be turned off.</span> <span id="s295">You had to be careful walking or driving at night.</span> <span id="s296">Things started getting rationed.</span> <span id="s297">There was a lot of things you couldn’t get.</span> <span id="s298">And what makes it hard was that when you sit in Denmark and you couldn’t get all these thing -- movies, bananas, what have you, you would see across to Sweden, which is only about a couple of miles, all the lights on, and you knew that they were having everything that they used to get.</span> <span id="s299">So that kind of makes you realize that there’s really something going on that’s not very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Do you remember your father talking about this?</span> <span id="s301">What -- was there ever any thought of leaving Copenhagen --</span></p> <p><span id="s302">A: We were-- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: -- of leaving Europe --</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">Q: -- because of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, not in our case, no.</span> <span id="s307">I’m sure that Jewish people, you know, they were concerned, they would try to get away, but in our case there was no particular reason we should -- you consider that.</span> <span id="s308">And in -- during the first World War Denmark was neutral and came through without any problems, so everybody was hoping that it’ll be the same this time.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: At this point where were you living?</span> <span id="s310">When you s -- 15 - 16 - 17, are you still living at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: Yeah, in the suburb.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Are you contributing to the family household?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: Half of what I made.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: And what --</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Which wasn’t very much, though.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">Q: What were you planning -- what were your career plans?</span> <span id="s319">What were you hoping to become?</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s321">I -- I was apprenticed in [indecipherable] three year deals, I will be fin -- that will be finished the end of March in ‘40.</span> <span id="s322">And then I wanted to go overseas for f-further training.</span> <span id="s323">There was at that time a -- a company in Jamaica called Jamaica Banana Producers Association and that was run by a Danish fellow by the name of List, S.D. List, who was also the Danish consul, and I wrote him to try and -- to get involved with that outfit through the consulate.</span> <span id="s324">That didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s325">Then I tried to work something out with an outfit in Sweden and by the time we were getting all ready to, you know, do something, then we got occupied and I couldn’t get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: You said you -- it was a three year apprenticeship when -- what was it an apprenticeship to, exactly?</span> <span id="s327">What was it that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well, it was a three year learning period.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: Three year learning period.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Yeah, you went three years and then after that you finished and then you can go get a job somewhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s331">Q: Did people in your country expect the invasion?</span></p> <p><span id="s332">A: No, no, no, that came as a complete surprise.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">A: I remember that morning, I was in the navy and we got called out on the parade ground and there were these bombers all over the place, which was -- I mean, the Danish air force didn’t have very many planes, so it was obvious that there was something going on and pretty soon we were just told that the Germans had come in and they had started occupying Copenhagen, and for us just to stay in -- in the naval yard and not do anything.</span> <span id="s335">So was -- it was -- the officers, they were kind of hard on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: Well, they had, you know, some of them devote their whole life to -- to defend for Denmark and then to be told that can’t do anything, that’s not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: But no, there was -- a number of Danes got killed, unnecessarily, I think, because I think the government had pretty good idea what was going to happen.</span> <span id="s340">And it was not right for the government to expect the soldiers to put up a defense when they knew that there wasn’t a chance of being successful.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">Q: So what were your feelings about being told not to fight?</span></p> <p><span id="s342">A: Kind of frustration, I guess.</span> <span id="s343">I hadn’t been in that long, I’d in -- only been in for nine days, actually.</span> <span id="s344">So I hadn’t really -- hadn’t fired a gun yet.</span> <span id="s345">But even so, you know, you are -- you are pri -- it -- it’s -- it’s pretty upsetting, a thing like that.</span> <span id="s346">Everybody was pretty uptight about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: H-How did the other sailors and people in the navy understand what the government did by telling them not to – to fight?</span> <span id="s348">How did they make sense of it?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: It just didn’t make any sense, because we – we had been told that this – there might be a thing like that happening, and if it did, you know, then there – there was no purpose in – in – in start fighting it.</span> <span id="s350">We – if y – if the country had bombers all over the place, and th-that -- the soldiers are coming in, there was -- the Germans were putting soldiers ashore at a number of points.</span> <span id="s351">Denmark’s a small country.</span> <span id="s352">I mean, you can drive from the northernmost point to the southernmost point in four hours.</span> <span id="s353">And you can go from the easternmost point to the westernmost point in about the same, which we happen to do last year, so -- you know, it just isn’t that big.</span> <span id="s354">And it’s -- it’s not like Norway with a lot of mountains and all that stuff, it’s pretty flat.</span> <span id="s355">The highest point is 180 feet, or something like that.</span> <span id="s356">So trying to put up mu-much of a defense when you -- a-against the -- the German army is a -- a pretty hopeless task, I mean, bordering on suicide almost.</span> <span id="s357">But even so, though I think most everybody thought at least there should be an effort.</span> <span id="s358">And it was -- it was kind of disappointing just to sit back, not do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Describe that day.</span> <span id="s360">Where were you exactly?</span> <span id="s361">And what was the first awareness you had that you were being invaded?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: When I was in the navy yard in -- in Copenhagen at boot camp, and we just got -- go up in the morning very early, I don’t know, at four o’clock, something like -- like this, because the bombers were all over the place there.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">Q: And were they bombing?</span></p> <p><span id="s364">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Just flying?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: They were just flying around.</span> <span id="s367">They were trying to scare everybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: These are German bombers?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: German bombers, yeah.</span> <span id="s370">And the -- a German ship was putting soldiers ashore in -- in th -- right in Copenhagen for that matter, close to the navy yard.</span> <span id="s371">And then I had seen a number of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">Q: So you came out of your barracks, and what did you s -- what did you see, what did you -- what were you told?</span></p> <p><span id="s373">A: We just told that there was nothing we could do, and the king had decided we’re not going to fight, and we were just going to stand by and then see -- await developments.</span> <span id="s374">So we -- we were staying in the camp for, I guess, about a week befo -- before we were -- permitted outside.</span> <span id="s375">Ours had been assigned a ship that was supposed to go to Greenland on the 17th of May.</span> <span id="s376">Remember that day, that’s a Norwegian national day.</span> <span id="s377">We were supposed to Greenland on the 17th of May for inspection and to make sure that foreign fishing trawlers did not start going into green territorial waters, because Greenland is Danish.</span> <span id="s378">So we were supposed to go out there and I was looking forward to that, that would have been quite an experience.</span> <span id="s379">But instead of that we went to some small port in Denmark and sat there for -- until I got demobbed at the British say, i-in December of ’40.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: You got what?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: Dist -- discharged from the military.</span> <span id="s382">British used to call it demobbed.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: Anyway, when I was sent home there, in the middle of December, that was the end of my military career.</span> <span id="s385">So it was only about eight month, nine month.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: I’m going to go back just to clarify something.</span> <span id="s387">You had been trying to get placed in some companies, the company in Jamaica and the other company, and then I guess that didn’t work.</span> <span id="s388">Is that when you signed up to be in the navy?</span> <span id="s389">Or did you get drafted?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: They have conscription, I got drafted.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: So you had to put in your time, and I was all set to put in my time there, and I was applying to go to these places after the military service was over with.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s394">So that first day when the planes were flying around, did the Germans come inside the naval yard?</span></p> <p><span id="s395">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s396">That day they stayed outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: And did you have any contact with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: No.</span> <span id="s399">No, that -- that -- oh, I think that was almost a week before we could do anything.</span> <span id="s400">E-Even telephone, or write a letter, an-anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Did it feel like you were sort of in prison there?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Basically that’s what it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: And when you finally were able to leave or make telephone calls, what had changed in Copenhagen?</span></p> <p><span id="s404">A: Well, of course, there were German soldiers all over the place, so it -- it wa -- it was obvious there wa -- it was not -- it had changed.</span> <span id="s405">I mean, it wasn’t as nice as it used to be.</span> <span id="s406">When you get occupied like that, you know, it puts a kind of damp on everything else.</span> <span id="s407">The stores closed early.</span> <span id="s408">They were running -- already that time there were certain things that were getting short of.</span> <span id="s409">So I -- I had a bicycle, I bicycled home.</span> <span id="s410">Rest of them went back to th -- to the boot camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: What did your mother and father say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: Well, of course, they were -- they were happy-- I -- I mean, th-there hadn’t been any fighting go on that I’ve been involved with, actually.</span> <span id="s413">But they weren’t too happy about the Germans being there.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Di -- can you describe one of your first encounters with a German?</span> <span id="s415">I mean, what was that like when you’d see them on the street, and they knew you were in the navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Well, I had the uniform on, the navy uniform.</span> <span id="s417">They didn’t pay any attention.</span> <span id="s418">I mean, there was so many of them and basically so few of us.</span> <span id="s419">I think the whole navy was something like, I don’t know, 8,000 -- eight -- 9,000 people, which is not much compared to the German army.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: But did you have any interactions with German soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: No, none whatsoever.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: So they sort of left you alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Basically yeah, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Were they t-taking over people’s homes at all, and using them as offices, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: No, in the beginning, everybody was supposed to be -- everything was supposed to be very friendly and they took over some schools, took over some hotels, but not any private houses.</span> <span id="s426">Not in the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And what were your friends saying at that time about being occupied like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: Well, I -- cause all I -- I did was I -- I went out to my parent’s house and spend the time with them, then went back to the camp, so I didn’t get around to talk much to -- to anybody.</span> <span id="s429">That time there, the Germans announced that everything was supposed to be pretty much continued operating the way it had been, where the police were supposed to be Danish, and the courts were supposed to be Danish, and all that.</span> <span id="s430">The basic government was supposed to be Danish, except of course the foreign office.</span> <span id="s431">So they had indicated that was not going to be much change of anything, which I suppose to an extent was right in the beginning but it didn’t last very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: How did it change?</span> <span id="s433">When did you notice that it began to change?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: The gers -- the Germans started trying to run more and more things, there were more propaganda, there were more things in a -- and in the radio.</span> <span id="s435">There were commentators that was very much in favor of Germany.</span> <span id="s436">Some of the ones that used to be in favor of the British, they were not on the radio any more.</span> <span id="s437">Denmark used to be primarily British oriented, one reason being that the -- the biggest trade partner was -- was Britain.</span> <span id="s438">The Danish economy was a refining economy in the sense that they brought grain in, and they exported bacon and -- and butter.</span> <span id="s439">And all that went to -- or almost all had went to England and so relationship between Denmark and England was very close.</span> <span id="s440">Also because royalty-wise there was family-wise between Denmark and Sweden and not much from Denmark to Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: So what did you do for eight months in the navy during this occupation -- period of occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: I painted the ship.</span> <span id="s443">I think we must have painted our ship 14 times.</span> <span id="s444">There wasn’t much else to do, we are lying in this little harbor, you know, and just keep the thing shined up, keep it clean.</span> <span id="s445">Oh, actually, I was only there for part of the time, then I got transferred to -- back to Copenhagen and I was working for an admiral, I was doing some office work for him, and then I got demobbed in December, that was the end of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And that was -- was that earlier than usual, or they just didn’t need you?</span> <span id="s447">You got demobilized?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: Ah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: But normally you’ll be in between a year an-and a year and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: So it was a lot earlier than -- than normal.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: And -- and why was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Just sitting on a ship someplace, you know, there wasn’t -- you didn’t learn anything.</span> <span id="s455">And they didn’t need a full crew on a -- on -- on most of the -- the ships, so they just had too many people.</span> <span id="s456">So that -- told to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And at this point were y -- you get a salary, don’t you?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: In the navy?</span></p> <p><span id="s459">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">A: Well, yeah, but it -- 25 cents a day or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s461">It wasn’t very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: So were you giving some to your family, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: No, I wasn’t living home.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s465">And then what happened when you were demobilized, sent home, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: And then I and I start to look around for a job, and there was one ad in the paper, there was this one steamship company that was looking for a junior clerk so I applied and I found later that I was the youngest that applied, and I was the one with the lowest requirements salary-wise, so I got the job.</span> <span id="s467">And that was a company called [indecipherable] and that started in January of ’41, and was there until sometime in September, October ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s469">And how old were you at this point in ’41?</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: I was 20 when I started, January of ’41 I was 20.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: And you’re out of the navy now --</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: -- how -- how is your life different from before, when the Germans weren’t there?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: What I see, the work life is entirely different.</span> <span id="s475">As far as like the rowing was concerned, it stayed the same but the day Germany occupied or started go against the Russia, they prohibited rowing in Denmark.</span> <span id="s476">I think because they were afraid we would row to Sweden, which could easily have been done.</span> <span id="s477">But anyway, that took care of -- of all activities over the weekends.</span> <span id="s478">And they a -- it was just, you couldn’t go out in the evening, you know, you had to be home before it got dark.</span> <span id="s479">There wasn’t much partying going on.</span> <span id="s480">If they had a -- if you went to a party, it was an all night party.</span> <span id="s481">That’s in the summertime, that was kind of nice.</span> <span id="s482">That was something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: It was all night because you wouldn’t walk home at --</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Weren’t permitted.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: -- late at night.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: You weren’t permitted to.</span> <span id="s487">And you couldn’t be more than I think like three people meeting in the street, be -- anything beyond that was illegal.</span> <span id="s488">Stuff like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: At what point do you begin to hear about friends or countrymen beginning to resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: That was probably in ’40 -- ’42, I think.</span> <span id="s491">That’s when the -- the illegal papers started coming out.</span> <span id="s492">We always tried to listen to the British forecast, news in the evening, and the -- the illegal newspapers started somewhere around that time, late ’40 -- ’41, I think it must have been.</span> <span id="s493">So I want to get involved and I -- a friend of my mother was married to a chap that was in the newspaper business.</span> <span id="s494">So I went to see him -- went in to see him one day and told him that I was -- kind of like to get involved with some of that stuff there, and so he hemmed and hawed a little bit, he wasn’t going to admit he was involved, but he said why you come back in a week, and so on.</span> <span id="s495">So I came back a week later on, he said okay, here’s a -- a name of a guy, you could go and talk to him.</span> <span id="s496">So I went down to see this fellow and he was pretty deep in one of the illegal newspapers.</span> <span id="s497">I don’t remember the name, free Danes, what it was.</span> <span id="s498">But there was quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s499">The students had one, the Communists had one, the Republicans had one.</span> <span id="s500">I mean, there were a whole batch of those being published.</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: But do y -- why do you think your mother’s friend trusted you enough to send you to the -- to the other person?</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: Oh, they knew me pretty well.</span> <span id="s503">I mean, they’d known me for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: And when you went to see the person who was very involved --</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: -- you thought maybe the paper was called free Danes, just tell us a little bit about what that meeting was like.</span> <span id="s507">What did he ask you?</span> <span id="s508">What did you say to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: Well, I told him that I was, you know, where I came from and that I would like to -- to get involved with some of the stuff and I told him what I -- my background, you know, from the navy, and -- and the steamship company, and all that.</span> <span id="s510">And that I was ready to do whatever was, you know, with -- with a newspaper, either distribution or -- or to run copies of it, or whatever was.</span> <span id="s511">And he just said well, I’ll talk to you one of these days, and then I went home and then a few days later I got word, I had to go -- come back in.</span> <span id="s512">And he ha -- must have done a little checking other ways.</span> <span id="s513">So I came back in and he said okay, let’s get at it.</span> <span id="s514">Then I went somewhere, I don’t know where -- I don’t remember where it was, but I went to this address and -- and started running copies of this paper.</span> <span id="s515">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: And when you got to the address, what would you say?</span> <span id="s517">Ho-How would th -- you assure them that you were to be trusted?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: I guess the fact that I came from the other chap.</span> <span id="s519">So then we -- we would run newspapers off, and then we would take care of the distribution, and then kind of one -- one thing took you, you know, it -- you get more and more involved, get more and more mad at the Germans.</span> <span id="s520">So you get -- you get really -- you -- you -- you get pretty satisfied that you think that what you’re doing is not going to change the war, obviously.</span> <span id="s521">But at least, under the circumstances, it’s kind of more or less the most you can do.</span> <span id="s522">You can’t do a heck of a lot more than that, under those circumstances.</span> <span id="s523">But that was a beginning.</span> <span id="s524">And in those years there wasn’t much sabotage or any of that stuff going.</span> <span id="s525">That came later.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: What gave you the desire to resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Well, my whole career being ruined by this stuff, in a sense, you know, I mean here I was trying to get to Jamaica or -- or whatever, and th-that’s all ruined because they came in there.</span> <span id="s528">And after all, there wasn’t much reason for the Germans coming in, just the fact that they want to be sure that they would get the Swedish iron ore down along the coast of Norway, and they wanted protect a -- protect th-the ships.</span> <span id="s529">Didn’t seem to be any particular reason for them to occupy Denmark and ruin my career, two of them at the same time.</span> <span id="s530">So I just didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Ca -- the place where you made the newspapers, what -- where was it?</span> <span id="s532">Was it in a -- a hidden place, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Oh, somebody’s basement somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s535">And there was a printing press down there?</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: No, it was a duplication.</span> <span id="s537">Every time around you get one sheet, you know, and there was a lot of times around, and then you had to put them together o-on -- you had to take them out and -- and distribute them.</span> <span id="s538">We had to be a little bit careful when you do that, too.</span> <span id="s539">But there were var-various ways you could do that, one was to go into an apartment -- a high-rise, and then start from the top and leave one paper in front of each door and just run down as fast as you could and get out of there, in case there was some Germans living somewhere in an apartment.</span> <span id="s540">The other thing was driving around on a bicycle, if you see a bunch of people standing, say at a -- say at a bus stop, you throw a bunch of papers over there and then you peddle around the corner as fast as you can.</span> <span id="s541">That worked pretty good, too.</span> <span id="s542">And then, of course there was the steady customers, you know.</span> <span id="s543">So, oh, many ways of getting rid of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: When you would go out to distribute, did you ever alter your appearance in any way so that --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: No.</span> <span id="s546">No, cause you don’t think anybody’s going to see you.</span> <span id="s547">I mean, if you run down the stairs pall mall all the doors are closed.</span> <span id="s548">And if you just throw the papers, people are not going to get that much of a chance to really look at you so they can report you, and so no, there wasn’t much problem with that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: What would have happened if you’d been caught with those newspapers, or maybe you were at one point?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: No, I never got caught with the newspapers.</span> <span id="s551">In the beginning the Danish poleesh -- police would have pick you up and probably put you in the jail for a week or two.</span> <span id="s552">It was illegal to do that stuff, officially it was illegal.</span> <span id="s553">You weren't supposed to do that.</span> <span id="s554">But it, you know, it wasn’t any major crime as such.</span> <span id="s555">And at that time, the -- the Germans were not in working as the police, or they were not -- didn’t have any judges around.</span> <span id="s556">We’re talking about ’41 - ’42, and things got hotter after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Well, then in -- in -- was in f-fort -- I mean in ’40 -- kind of hard to remember what happened what year.</span> <span id="s559">The -- the Germans threw the police out that is after I got in court.</span> <span id="s560">The Germans started to get more and more involved, as always, the police.</span> <span id="s561">And they started controlling a bunch of the courthouses, so if you did get caught, you could get really put in the slammer by the -- by the police.</span> <span id="s562">Also, the -- I think the Germans insisted the police pick up all the Communists and put them in the camps somewhere.</span> <span id="s563">And it -- it -- it’s kind of hard to remember what happened, what year that is.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: Did you ever assume another name?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s566">Yeah, everybody had a number of names.</span> <span id="s567">And that wa -- that’s the reason people now, ask me do you, you know, whatever, and what was his name during the war, you know -- oh, you know, something entirely different.</span> <span id="s568">I don’t remember the names I used, but I know I had an I.D. card for several.</span> <span id="s569">But that was kind of standard -- standard -- everybody did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: How did you get those I.D. cards?</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Well, there were -- there were people in official offices, that didn’t like the Germans either, and they kind of slid it to you under the table, you know.</span> <span id="s572">That was not that difficult to get ahold of.</span> <span id="s573">You had an I.D. card, you get a driver’s license, you get, you know, most -- you get rationing stamps too, which, you needed them that time if you wanted legal -- when you became illegal.</span> <span id="s574">So you’d get all these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Okay, we’ll stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Can you tell us any name you remember that you used during that period?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: I’m pretty sure of -- I used Jorgen for awhile.</span> <span id="s581">But, I mean, then after the war, right after the war when I came back th-the liberation, then I had different names and different cards.</span> <span id="s582">I -- I can’t tell you, changing our names, can’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: And you mentioned that you might not use a name for very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s585">Yeah, we never knew whether whether -- particularly, you know, after the German got real hot you never knew whether they knew of one of your names and it might -- if -- if you got picked up for something not very important, that might remind them of something that would have been important.</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Wh-When did you begin to think of yourself as someone who was resisting the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: The whole thing comes gradual.</span> <span id="s588">I mean, that i-isn’t one day all of a sudden, boom.</span> <span id="s589">And th-th-the thing was, everybody was -- was involved all -- no, I shouldn’t say everybody, an awful lot of people were involved, get to be more and more all the time.</span> <span id="s590">So it was nothing unusual.</span> <span id="s591">I mean, later on during the war, when I was in jail, my sister was involved with a newspaper, my father contributed, and my mother would feed these fellows.</span> <span id="s592">The old system, you know, where you have the plant in the -- in the left side of the window stay away, and the right side of the window, come on in and eat.</span> <span id="s593">So I -- everybody was kind of involved one way or the other, and I -- me -- I can’t say th-that this happened this time or that time.</span> <span id="s594">I -- I -- that I’d realized of -- how deep it was.</span> <span id="s595">It just get deeper and deeper all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Are you living at home at this point where you begin to do the underground newspapers?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Did you tell your parents you were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I don’t think I really told them outright, but I’m pretty sure they knew what was going.</span> <span id="s600">I mean that -- you didn’t -- you don’t run around and talk much about those things there, to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">Q: Were you a member of any organization then?</span> <span id="s602">I mean, at some point did you affiliate with one of the underground organizations?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Well, you don’t really join as a -- as a membership card and all those kinds of things.</span> <span id="s604">You just kind of get involved, you work with them.</span> <span id="s605">I don’t think this newspaper group had any membership roster or anything like that, you know, which would have -- not have been a very practical thing in case a German had gotten hold of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: But you would go there and you’d run off the newspapers, organize them and distribute them.</span> <span id="s607">Who would tell you where to distribute them?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: I don’t really remember.</span> <span id="s609">I think you kind of worked that out between yourselves, you know, that -- pretty much what area you were going to cover.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: And when you were together with the people, let’s say working on the newspapers, what would your conversations be like?</span> <span id="s611">Would you be talking about other things you could possibly do, or the war, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Well, nights you -- you would talk about the news that was in the -- in the paper that day, and other things that you might have heard that hadn’t gotten in the paper yet.</span> <span id="s613">You couldn’t have everything in the paper, it was just a few mimeographed sheets.</span> <span id="s614">And as time went by there were -- there were just more and more things happening all the time.</span> <span id="s615">So you couldn’t put everything in there, so you would exchange news, what was happening.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: What other kinds of things did you do to resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s617">A: Well, it started out with the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: And then in the fall of ’43, the whole thing came up with the -- with the Germans wanted the Jews to the camps in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: [indecipherable] intelligence that what they want.</span> <span id="s622">Anyway, they came up, and that must have been September, October of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: This was when the Germans were going to actually round up the Jewish population?</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Right around the weekend of Rosh Hashanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s627">And there was a -- a fellow in the German embassy, Dukritch or something like that, he was the shipping attaché, and he knew about it, and he had told some of the Danish politician about it, and they had passed word out to who the Chief Rabbi was told to -- about it.</span> <span id="s628">And of course that went down the ranks, pretty soon we heard about it and then we started getting -- having the Jews getting away to Sweden.</span> <span id="s629">You had -- you had to get out and -- and -- and warn them, and then find out where they were going to be staying because a lot of them moved away from their own house.</span> <span id="s630">And then they would pick them up and take them out in the countryside to where the fishing boats were.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: But let’s go through that process, I mean, how do you remember hearing about it and saying okay, I’m going to go warn some families?</span> <span id="s632">How did it actually work?</span> <span id="s633">One -- you know, give us one day, one day that you helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Details, they are somewhat blurred.</span> <span id="s635">There was one fellow, he was a doctor, he and his wife, they had one child, and as I recall somebody asked me whether -- whether he had taken off, and I said, I don’t know, but I’ll check him.</span> <span id="s636">So I went to see him, and -- and he was still there.</span> <span id="s637">So I said to him, well, you know, you better start moving.</span> <span id="s638">So he and his wife and the -- and the kid, I took them to a safe house and then I don’t know if it was that night or the next night, I took them out to a small town called Taarbek, that’s on the coast just north of Copenhagen, and got them on a boat to Sweden.</span> <span id="s639">That kind of the way it works.</span> <span id="s640">You hear about somebody who is somewhere and then you go out there and -- and the amazing thing was that -- I mean, I was what, 22 at that time, 23, and you go out and talk to a -- a family, you never see them before in your life, and you say, hey I’m here to -- to help you get away, and they go to -- go with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: No hesitation?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: No.</span> <span id="s643">Well, you know, they were desperate.</span> <span id="s644">And I guess that, what was the choice?</span> <span id="s645">There was going to Theresienstadt and that was not that desirable.</span> <span id="s646">So when you come there an-and tell them, hey, I’ll help you get to Sweden, and they -- they are inclined to go along with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So you went to his house, and then how did you get them to a safe house?</span> <span id="s648">Did you have to wait until the evening to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: There were certain taxis we could use and there were certain ambulances.</span> <span id="s650">There was a -- there was a Dr. Ole Sager at the hospital who was very involved with all this stuff, and we could also, through him get an ambulance, and take them out to a safe house.</span> <span id="s651">And then in the evening there was certain taxis that were, yo-you know, th-the drivers were considered safe.</span> <span id="s652">Then take them -- get ahold of one of them to take them out to Taarbek, it was called, just north of Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s653">And there was an inn right there, right on the water, right in the harbor, so put them in a -- they had a big meeting room -- ballroom I guess it was, and they would go in there and wait, and then during the night the fisherman decided when they were ready to go, and then you walked them down, you get them on the boat, and they took off.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: So they --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: We never loosed one -- lost one.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: When they would be in the inn, they were in a big ballroom?</span> <span id="s657">How many people were in the ballroom?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Well, that all depends upon how many boats you had lined up for the night, but you couldn’t put that many people on board, I don’t know how many -- how many it was, it was 12 - 15 or something like that, on the fishing boat, it wasn’t very big.</span> <span id="s659">But you might have, you know, enough for four or five boat.</span> <span id="s660">One time we had the place full and all a -- all of a sudden rumor started that the Gestapo was coming around.</span> <span id="s661">So everybody had to get outside and hide somewhere.</span> <span id="s662">There were houses around it, you had to hide in the garden and all that stuff, that was bit of a mess.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Did the Gestapo come that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: No, that was false rumors, we go -- we got everybody back in the -- in the ho -- inside, and then down on the -- on the fishing boat and they took off then.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: S-So when the fisherman were ready, you would go and get the people you were in charge of and walk them through the -- the coast, right up to the --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: It wasn’t very far.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: I mean you were in the harbor --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: -- so you just walk down the pier to where the fishing boat was, and then they go aboard, then they take off.</span> <span id="s671">Whenever the fisherman is ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Do you think people in the town besides the innkeeper and the fishermen knew what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: I’ll be very surprised if they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: If they didn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s676">I mean, you know, you have a lot of people running around there in the middle of the night when you’re not supposed to be outside.</span> <span id="s677">So obviously they know that something is cooking.</span> <span id="s678">And a lot of the fishermen lived there, so naturally their families would know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: So this was a -- an effort of many people in a sense, as a sort of network?</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: That --</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: I ope --</span></p> <p><span id="s683">Q: Uh-huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: No, I was just going to say there were -- had -- so happened that the people I was working with used this port at Taarbek.</span> <span id="s685">There were other people who used ports south of Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s686">There were some using ports north of -- there was one port north of Copenhagen called Gilleleje and one time they had several Jews hidden in the -- in the church, and somehow or the other the Gestapo found out, and picked them all up, and they all wound up in -- I think they all went to Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s687">But that was one of the few times anybody were lost.</span> <span id="s688">One time we were just up around Elsinore, and we were helping some people over and the Germans came and they started shooting, and one guy, he was a policeman, Larsen I think his name was, hit him in the stomach, which is pretty miserable.</span> <span id="s689">So I wasn’t involved with that, they got him down to -- to the hospital where Hulsaker was and they operated on him and they shipped him to Sweden the next evening to a hospital an-and he came through okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Did you yourself ever go on one of the boats over?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">A: Mm-hm, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: Could you describe what that trip is like?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I went over three times.</span> <span id="s694">The first time I was told to go because somehow or the other they said that -- that somebody in -- in -- in the Germans I ha -- knew I was involved with the stuff, so they said, you better get over to Sweden for awhile, lay low.</span> <span id="s695">So I went on a boat, and we went about halfway across to Sweden, and then there was the Swedish fishing boat.</span> <span id="s696">And the two of them went alongside, and we climbed over in the Swedish fishing boat and then went over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s697">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s698">Q: How does that transfer actually work?</span> <span id="s699">It seems like it could be dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: No, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: No?</span> <span id="s702">To go -- you would physically just jump --</span></p> <p><span id="s703">A: From one fishing boat they were -- they were right next to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Go right next to each other, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: They go slow ahead you know, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: No, that wasn’t any problem.</span> <span id="s708">That was one time.</span> <span id="s709">Another time I went over there, there was a brewery in a small town, Elsinore, that’s Hamlet’s Castle, called Wiibroe, and they had an arrangement with a boat that would go from Copenhagen to Elsinore, which is something like 20 miles, with empty beer bottles and cases.</span> <span id="s710">Well, they would leave a room in the middle of the -- of the hold, so you would hide down there.</span> <span id="s711">And the time I -- I forgot the reason, I had to get over there, was something I had to bring over and there was a couple with a baby that was going on the same one.</span> <span id="s712">And th-the baby had gotten a shot, you know, of -- to be sure it was quiet, because when you get down there, then they put beer bo -- case with beer bottles all the way around, and then the -- before the ship could leave Copenhagen the German harbor patrol or whatever it was, will come down as a matter of order and just check the ship out.</span> <span id="s713">So you could hear them walking around on the deck.</span> <span id="s714">And then we took off, and we got out on the sound and then the same thing alongside the Swedish fishing boat, and they take some of the beer cases away, and so you get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: What kind of shot did the baby get to be quiet?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: I have no idea.</span> <span id="s717">There was a -- there was a doctor they had.</span> <span id="s718">But that was something there to calm her down you know, it wouldn’t make any -- it wouldn’t make her cry or anything like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: At that moment when you were sort of hidden in this little area surrounded by beer cases, and you can hear the Nazis walking around, what’s going through your mind?</span> <span id="s720">What -- what are people thinking and feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: That wa -- that was one of the three scariest moments I -- I had during the war.</span> <span id="s722">I-It’s -- it’s scary.</span> <span id="s723">You know, you -- you don’t want to do that too often.</span> <span id="s724">But we were lucky the baby stayed quiet, and -- and so we got off in good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: And you said th -- what was the third scariest moment [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Oh, the second time was -- well that was actually after I had been caught by the Gestapo had been in the jail for awhile, they were going to bring us down to Germany, they stopped -- they stopped the car somewhere, there were 13 of us in the -- in this truck.</span> <span id="s727">And you sit there, you handcuffed with your -- in the back and you have a -- a wire going through so nobody get anywhere.</span> <span id="s728">So they went from Copenhagen down to [indecipherable] over the ferry to the island Funen and then we went a piece on this blacktop and then you could feel that you were going on a -- on a dirt road.</span> <span id="s729">And then they stopped and they told us to get out, they took the -- the handcuffs off and said, time to relieve yourself.</span> <span id="s730">So you stand there doing your thing and we knew that shortly before that the Germans -- the Gestapo had taken a bunch of fellows from the camp out somewhere in the northern part of Zealand and they shot them all.</span> <span id="s731">So when you’re do -- standing there doing that thing, one of the German soldiers fired a -- a salvo, this machine pistol there.</span> <span id="s732">That was pretty scary.</span> <span id="s733">But he just fired in the air, you know, for the fun of it, or whatever, so -- and the third time was another time I’d been in Sweden, I came back to Copenhagen in an afternoon, and that was my own stupidity.</span> <span id="s734">I had bought a copy of the London Times, and I had that in my briefcase, and I was sitting the streetcar, and through one end of the streetcar come these German soldiers and start -- want to check everybody’s briefcase.</span> <span id="s735">Fortunately, before they got to me they stopped and they got off and went somewhere else.</span> <span id="s736">But that was -- I -- I was very scared, I -- I’ll admit that.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Were you scared a lot when you were doing this kind of resistance work?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: I -- I think so, yeah.</span> <span id="s739">Y-You don’t really get that used to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Can we go back to that two week period where so many of the Jews were saved in your country.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: ’43 --</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">A: Fall of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">Q: Fall of ’43.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: It’s been described as a -- as some sort of a two week period and there’s a stream of people going over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s747">I-In that two week period, what -- what was going on for you?</span> <span id="s748">Were you just sort of up every day, hardly sleeping, or -- what was going on for you?</span> <span id="s749">Ho -- were you getting assignments of other people to help, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: You don’t get much sleep, that’s one thing.</span> <span id="s751">And they had some kind of pill, I don’t remember the name of it, that I -- could keep you going for a long time.</span> <span id="s752">But usually, after two nights without hardly any sleep, then you had to have one night.</span> <span id="s753">The company I work for, I -- I worked ow -- a lot of times I -- I didn’t show up, but they -- I think the boss knew very well what was going on -- he didn’t ask me, I didn’t tell him, but I think he knew what was happening.</span> <span id="s754">So then after, you know, two -- two or three weeks, then it started easing off, and -- and you wouldn’t be on every night any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: But when you say you’re on, how do you know you’re supposed to be on?</span> <span id="s756">Does someone come and tell you we need you tonight?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: Well, you know, you -- you -- you -- you talk to these people all the time.</span> <span id="s758">Whether they specifically said -- I -- I -- I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s759">I just don’t remember now.</span> <span id="s760">I -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s761">It’s a long time ago, you know, and I tried lot of things in between, so some of them -- those things in that time, you know, they kind of -- I’ve forgotten about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Was there a point that you became known and relied upon for the work that you’re able to do in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Oh, I suppose some of the fellows or the girls I worked with, you know, they kind of respect each other.</span> <span id="s764">There were a couple of fellows that were really out -- there was one girl that was outstanding, that I knew quite well.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: And who was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: The girl’s name was Jette Hec Johansson, she was quite well known, she was a great girl.</span> <span id="s767">And the fellows, oh God, what was their names?</span> <span id="s768">Hec Johan -- Hed I remember her name because I met her, oh what, 10 years ago at a reception in Copenhagen the queen had.</span> <span id="s769">And Jette was invited and I was there, and so I happened to see her, and I hadn’t seen her for so long, I went over to say, You’re Jette, aren’t you?</span> <span id="s770">That was it.</span> <span id="s771">So we had a -- a great reunion.</span> <span id="s772">Yeah, she was a wonderful person.</span> <span id="s773">So that was -- that was a bunch of -- of nice g -- nice people, you know, reliable.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: It was -- did you ever receive any training for what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: No, there wasn’t any of that stuff.</span> <span id="s778">I guess there wasn’t really time for that.</span> <span id="s779">Besides that anything organized, you want to stay clear of.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: So that was something conscious, you really stayed away from the organized --</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Oh, absolutely, you don’t want to get involved with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: Well, Germans have -- the Gestapo had a way of convincing people to talk, and if they got ahold of one fellow in an organized thing like that, you know, they could kind of find out the names of a bunch of other people.</span> <span id="s786">That’s the reason from one group to the other, you didn’t know many people you know, who -- certainly didn’t know the names.</span> <span id="s787">And there were usually one, maybe yo -- one fellow in your group would know one fellow in the other group.</span> <span id="s788">And that’s the way you do the communications.</span> <span id="s789">Then th -- later on, you know, what -- when -- after I got caught and sent and things got more organized, and I don’t know what -- how it was done in that time.</span> <span id="s790">But that was -- that was after the summer of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s792">When you were to leave your home and you might be going -- I’ll go back to the period where -- the two week period where all the rescues were taking place, when you would leave your home, would you be aware that someone might be following you?</span></p> <p><span id="s793">A: No.</span> <span id="s794">No, I never thought about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: So you didn’t feel like people knew what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Very, very, very few did.</span> <span id="s797">I mean, there wasn’t anybody around where I lived that knew, as far as I know.</span> <span id="s798">I never asked anybody af-after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: And did you ever have any encounters with the Danish police?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Well, yeah, I helped one policeman wanted to get to Sweden one time, Danish policeman, he had gotten in trouble, so I -- I help him over.</span> <span id="s801">But that was about the only time I was involved, was really involved in anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s802">Q: How did you regard them, though?</span> <span id="s803">I’ve heard that it was a sort of an open secret that they -- they knew that some of this resistance was going on --</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s805">Q: -- and they didn’t try very hard to stop it.</span></p> <p><span id="s806">A: That’s right.</span> <span id="s807">That’s absolutely right.</span></p> <p><span id="s808">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: As a matter of fact, on occasion they helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s811">Anything that you were involved with?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: No, just what I’ve heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: But poli -- police no -- was not very friendly toward the -- toward the Germans.</span> <span id="s815">And after the war I met a fellow who was in the police at that time, and he was telling me things that was going on that showed the police was -- a lot of times was in -- in a sense against the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: When you would take a family to the coast and get them to Sweden, did you -- was there anyone you had to report back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s818">Q: -- that they were rescued?</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: No.</span> <span id="s822">I think what they -- what they probably did when they got to Sweden, they were th -- I think there was some kind of a -- an organization over there that took care -- I mean, you know, you get over there with a couple of kids, you don’t know anybody, you have no money, so somebody got to look after you.</span> <span id="s823">And there was some organizations over there, both Swedish Jews, and -- and Danish Jews who had escaped and -- and look after them.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Can you talk a little bit about the money.</span> <span id="s825">These -- these rescues did take money, you had to take taxis, or trains, or pay the fishermen.</span> <span id="s826">Where were you getting the money to make this happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: I never paid a fisherman, for one thing.</span> <span id="s828">There are stories that some fishermen got paid because they risked their boat, but I never heard of anybody, seen anybody do it.</span> <span id="s829">The ambulance, of course, we didn’t pay them.</span> <span id="s830">Taxis, most of the time we didn’t pay them either, cause they were kind of part of the whole thing.</span> <span id="s831">Where you get money from -- you never use any.</span> <span id="s832">I didn’t use any.</span> <span id="s833">In those -- in those days I lived at home, and I got the salary for most of the time, even if I didn’t show up.</span> <span id="s834">He was very nice about it.</span> <span id="s835">So -- no, I -- I -- I don’t really know who -- who did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: So in the instances that you were involved in, no money was paid to the fishermen?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Did they ever say why they were doing this?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Well, of course, a lot of those fellows didn’t like the Germans either, so they were all -- that was one of the reasons for it.</span> <span id="s840">And then the other thing is basically that this really wasn’t so much o-of Jews or not Jews, or whatever.</span> <span id="s841">They were -- it was maybe because they were, you know, Danish citizens, they were just like the rest of us, you know, and all of a sudden the Germans -- if they had been going after the red haired, it would have been the same thing, probably.</span> <span id="s842">It just happened that the Germans went after Jews, so then you help the Jews get off -- they wer -- escape.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: I read that one prominent activist, [indecipherable] Jacobsen said that -- that it really wasn’t about Jews, it was -- it was more about democracy, that the Danes were tired of the Germans being there --</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: -- resented it.</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s847">Oh yeah, no, it wasn’t because they were Jews.</span> <span id="s848">And then of course, as time went on, there were other than Jews that -- that had to get to Sweden.</span> <span id="s849">After -- after that fall of ’43 --</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: There were other Jews that had to get to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s851">A: No, no, there were others, than Jews.</span> <span id="s852">I mean, there were -- there were like allied bombers who’d be shot down over Denmark, and then their crew had to be helped to get over to -- to Sweden.</span> <span id="s853">A classmate of mine, Billy Talbotsa was flying for the Royal Air Force, and he got shot down over Denmark, and he managed to get his way to Elsinore and they put him on a kayak.</span> <span id="s854">Unfortunately, he -- he didn’t make it across, he drowned.</span> <span id="s855">But many others got over there.</span> <span id="s856">Also there were parachute agents that had to get back.</span> <span id="s857">Niels Bohr you know, there was one guy that came over illegally to Sweden on a fishing boat and then wound up at the Manhattan Project.</span> <span id="s858">How in the hell where is Las Cruces New Mexico.</span> <span id="s859">Poli -- certain Danish politicians, wound up in England for BBC.</span> <span id="s860">So, there were many others than just Jews that were shipped.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: Were there people that you knew, that you admired i-in your country, who -- for their resistance also?</span> <span id="s862">That inspired you, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: No, not really, because I didn’t know who was, you know, the big mucky-mucks.</span> <span id="s864">They had the Danish Freedom Council, but that was very secret, and I don’t think anybo -- anybody knew who was on -- at that thing.</span> <span id="s865">[indecipherable] Jacobsen was one, they come out after the war.</span> <span id="s866">There was -- there were a -- there was -- I think there were a couple of doctors on that, one or two politicians.</span> <span id="s867">But no, there was -- there wasn’t really much mentioning of names.</span> <span id="s868">It was just too dangerous.</span> <span id="s869">Wouldn’t do any good.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Did you have a sense that there were a lot of people involved, resisting?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: You just didn't know who they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: Yeah, there was -- I don’t think there was any doubt that there were a lot of people, lot of people involved many different ways.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">Q: Talk some about people who weren’t involved and maybe even who were informing or collaborating.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: We had that too.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s879">Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">A: That was one of the things that the resistance movement did was eliminate some of those people.</span> <span id="s881">There were a number of them got -- got -- got shot.</span> <span id="s882">One guy who reported me into Gestapo, that’s the reason I got caught, and he got eliminated.</span> <span id="s883">So that happened to a number --</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: Do you remember who that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: No.</span> <span id="s886">No I never knew his name.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: How did he know that you were --</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s889">I don’t know.</span> <span id="s890">I don’t know who he was, I never talked to him, but I heard afterwards that he was the one that had reported to Gestapo that we were -- we -- we were meeting in this particular place with the -- with the parachute agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s891">Q: [indecipherable] Did you know anybody who was involved in that, that -- in the elimination of -- of informants?</span></p> <p><span id="s892">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: Did you carry a weapon?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: What did you carry?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Parabellum it was called.</span> <span id="s897">I don’t remember whether it was made -- I think it was Belgium [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: And where did you carry it?</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Inside the jacket.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Where did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: But not all the time, you know, only when you -- when you had -- on a job.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: Was it hard to get bullets for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s903">A: We didn't use very many, so no, I don’t -- I don’t recall that.</span> <span id="s904">You didn’t use it very much very seldom you had to -- I think that was only once or twice I had occasion to use it.</span> <span id="s905">You want to avoid that as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: What were the circumstances that you did use it?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Oh, there was one time some guy had got the idea that there was a -- a depot out somewhere that was just absolutely full of -- full of weapons, and there wasn’t many Germans taking care -- looking after -- guarding it.</span> <span id="s908">And there was like a small hill and up on top there was a fellow sitting with a machine gun.</span> <span id="s909">And then there were a couple of guys walking around inside of the fence.</span> <span id="s910">So the way it was set up, we had a friend of mine worked for -- for a brewery, so I had arranged for us to borrow a couple of trucks.</span> <span id="s911">So we drove out there this morning, and the wa -- one guy had a rifle, and he was supposed to shoot the guy on top.</span> <span id="s912">And I had to get the rifle out to him, which is kind of hard when you -- on a bicycle kind of hard to hide.</span> <span id="s913">.</span> <span id="s914">So I borrowed a -- a rake and a spade, whatever it was, and then tied it on the bike and put the gun the middle of the burlap around it and took out the -- anyway, he was supposed to shoot the guy on top, and he missed.</span> <span id="s915">The meantime we drive up alongside, we show -- throw the tarp over the barbed wire and jump inside.</span> <span id="s916">And -- but since he didn’t get the guy up on top -- he was sitting up there with a machine gun and he was doing a lot of shooting, so we got back over the f -- over the fence and ran away.</span> <span id="s917">It was just -- you -- you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s918">When you -- you have a revolver, you don’t start fighting with machine guns, your odds are against you.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Oh, so you -- you shot it, but you also then decided you were outnumbered?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s922">So what were you going to do?</span> <span id="s923">Take all the guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: Yeah, we could always use some more.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: That was in -- must have been ’44, early ’44, I think.</span> <span id="s927">When did I get caught?</span> <span id="s928">I got caught in ja -- June ’44, I think it was.</span> <span id="s929">Must have been early ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: So wa -- did you have any successful raids on German depots --</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s932">Q: -- where you did get guns?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: Was a -- a lot of parachuting down of the allies.</span> <span id="s936">And then they also, they -- they started building some over there, making some, you know, manufacturing some.</span> <span id="s937">They were primarily, they were -- they were parachuted down.</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: When was the other time that you used your gun, or one of the other times?</span> <span id="s939">You said there were a few occasions.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: There was -- there was this -- this girl out there, she had been reporting in, and so we were out there, we were trying to eliminate her, but there were too many -- too many Gestapo people showed up, so we had to forget about that one.</span> <span id="s941">There was a little shooting going on, but not very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Shoot and go?</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: Shooting.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Oh, little shooting, uh-huh.</span> <span id="s945">So you were going to -- to kill her.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">A: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Did she ever get killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Yeah, she got taken care of.</span> <span id="s951">I don’t remember her name either.</span> <span id="s952">I probably didn’t know her right name anyway, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: So she was part of your group, but she had --</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: No, no, she was -- she was telling the Germans about not our group, but some other people --</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: -- she had been reporting on [indecipherable] and then some might have been arrested and it was her fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: But something like that, the elimination of someone, is that something you took upon yourself, or was that -- did that come as an order from someone?</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: That came from upstairs.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">Q: And what’s that --</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: I mean, well --</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: How would you hear?</span> <span id="s962">What is upstairs?</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: The Freedom Council.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: Oh, that came from the Freedom Council?</span></p> <p><span id="s965">A: Or close to that.</span> <span id="s966">Or close to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Close to that.</span> <span id="s969">There was also the -- the freedom no the -- the parachute people.</span> <span id="s970">They had a number one man there Flemming Muse.</span> <span id="s971">And he -- I think he had authority to do that.</span> <span id="s972">Then the -- the communists had a rather large group called BOPA --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: -- and known as the Borgelige Partisaner.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: And they had [indecipherable] part of that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Okay, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: And they -- they had, you know, could decide things like that, that’s how prized they are.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: And would you or someone you knew, how would you get the message that you were supposed to go assassinate, for example, this -- this girl?</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: Well, I -- I don’t know how it came down, I only know that these people I was with at that time, his name was [indecipherable] I think it was, and he had gotten word.</span> <span id="s981">How he got it, who he got it from, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s983">At this point are you beginning also to do some sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No, I n -- I never did any blowing up and such.</span> <span id="s985">I was a guard at some of -- yo-you always had people standing around, watching and I was involved with that, but I didn’t handle the explosives, or -- didn’t like the smell of it, for one thing.</span> <span id="s986">They smell like marzipan.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: It smelled like?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Marzipan.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">Q: Marzipan?</span></p> <p><span id="s990">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s992">What else are you doing to resist at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Well, we were -- actually, when I got caught we had just gotten a new shipment of -- of bombs parachuted down, they were not very big, but th -- the purpose was to put them under the German trucks because they were short of rubber, and they had a hard time getting tires.</span> <span id="s994">So if you could blow their tires to pieces, you know, they couldn’t drive their trucks around.</span> <span id="s995">So all you had to do is put these things underneath the -- the tire, then when the -- th-the car drove off, it would blow the tire up.</span> <span id="s996">You will be 40 miles from there in the meantime.</span> <span id="s997">So we’d just gotten these -- a shipment down of that, and I was with, I think there were four, maybe five.</span> <span id="s998">One was a parachute agent, and he was showing us how to operate, how to use them and all that.</span> <span id="s999">But then the -- the door busted open and in came the Gestapo with a machine gun, and all that stuff, and you’re told to hit the -- the floor.</span> <span id="s1000">He ate the special agent’s pill, and he died right there [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: In what amount of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: A minute?</span> <span id="s1003">It was almost instantaneous.</span> <span id="s1004">A minute, two minute.</span> <span id="s1005">So we never got to use those, but they were used pri -- a little afterwards, those tire bombers.</span> <span id="s1006">They’re only about this big.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: The -- the parachute man who committed suicide, wa-was he Danish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: That’s correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: Did you have a pill?</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">Q: Why -- why did he do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1012">A: Oh, I think he probably had heard what the Germans were inclined to do to parachute people.</span> <span id="s1013">They were pretty hard on them.</span> <span id="s1014">So he is buried in Copenhagen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: Robert Johansson I think it was.</span> <span id="s1017">Robert Johansson.</span> <span id="s1018">Nice guy.</span> <span id="s1019">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: How much had you worked with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Oh, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1022">It wasn’t that long, he hadn’t been there that long, I don’t think.</span> <span id="s1023">I hadn’t known him that long, at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">Q: Did you know he was going to do that if you were caught?</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">A: Well, you know, you know that they had this pill.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: But I suppose it was up to each individual whether he want to -- to take it or not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: What were the Germans like with you, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Well, we were the -- I forgot whether three or four -- anyway, we were taken to the place where they did their interrogation, place called the Shell house, used to belong to the old oil -- to the oil company.</span> <span id="s1032">And then they started the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: Oh, the Shell Oil Company?</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: Shell Oil Company, yeah.</span> <span id="s1035">Germans had taken -- Gestapo had taken that house over, and used for their headquarters, and they did a lot of their interrogation in that one.</span> <span id="s1036">So, we spent some time in there, and I can do without that that wasn’t very nice.</span> <span id="s1037">There was a fellow from the southern part of Denmark, spoke both Danish and German, and he would kind of switch you back and forth.</span> <span id="s1038">So after that was over, I was -- I was sent out to the -- the jail in Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s1039">And had my own cell there, and then they would -- a couple of days I was pulled out and sent back in to the Shell House for a little more --</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: What did they do during the interrogation?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Oh, they kind of hit you with a -- I don’t -- rubber thing, about that -- like a nightstick, but all rubber, hit you over your kidneys, which is all uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1042">And then, you know, hit you other places, and kick you a little.</span> <span id="s1043">Right to the jaw, left to the jaw, whatever they feel like.</span> <span id="s1044">They’re they’re - just not very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: And how long did that go on?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: Well, i -- you really don’t keep check on the time.</span> <span id="s1047">I mean, you just hope it’s gonna be over with.</span> <span id="s1048">But I forgot th -- what -- in there four or five times, something like that.</span> <span id="s1049">And otherwise you sit out yourself, by yourself.</span> <span id="s1050">So -- and that went on for -- I guess I was in that jail for a month.</span> <span id="s1051">And then they came there one morning, I don’t know, three o’clock, told me to get dressed -- get my gear.</span> <span id="s1052">We went out, got in a bus -- a-a -- this truck, then they took us down.</span> <span id="s1053">And they took us down to just over the border, place called Flensburg and there were 13 of us, and that -- put us in the jail there for -- oh, I don’t know, two or three days.</span> <span id="s1054">And then they took us by bus to Hamburg to the jail and we were just there one day.</span> <span id="s1055">And then they took us down to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1056">And then it was strange because normally when you come down there, you get, you know, your prison number at that time was somewhere in the 50 - 60 thousands.</span> <span id="s1057">Ours was 500, and that was because the 13 numbers were what they called politsi haftling.</span> <span id="s1058">That means you are under arrest, but your sentence has not been determined yet.</span> <span id="s1059">So, we were politsi haftling until somewhere around Christmas, and then we became just a -- a normal, regular prisoner.</span> <span id="s1060">But in the meantime, that helped me because one time my name was on a list, I was told, I forgot, but anyway, I found out that I was supposed to be transferred to one of the work camps, which they were building these trenches so the allied tanks couldn’t get in.</span> <span id="s1061">So you walk around in this water up to your knees or whatever.</span> <span id="s1062">You never get dry clothes on, and it’s cold, it was in the wintertime.</span> <span id="s1063">So the fellows there usually didn’t last very long.</span> <span id="s1064">So I heard I’d been transferred there once, I didn’t like that, so I got permission to go up to the camp office, and I said to the clerk up there that I was politsi haftling, which means I had to be -- available again -- in -- in case Gestapo wanted me back and maybe he better not ship me off cause he could wind up and get in trouble.</span> <span id="s1065">So he agreed, so he took me off the list, then some other poor bugger got on the list there.</span> <span id="s1066">Then I really got transferred.</span> <span id="s1067">But the reason for that was that one of the 13 had found out afterwards said we had been sentenced to be hanged, and somehow or other the -- the instruction got lost, and that’s the reason why we got into the camp, we got this strange number.</span> <span id="s1068">The sentence had actually had been pronounced.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: What was the name of the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: Neuengamme.</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">Q: Did you know that camp existed before you were sent to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1072">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1073">We didn’t know -- really know anything about concentration camps then.</span> <span id="s1074">There had been some talk that there were camps like that somewhere around, and that was for anti-socials.</span> <span id="s1075">They had various marks, they had purple, they had red, they had green triangles on your -- on your uniform.</span> <span id="s1076">They had one camp [indecipherable] Denmark for political prisoners, that wasn’t too bad, actually, I understand.</span> <span id="s1077">But the ones down in Germany that -- that didn’t get much publicity that time.</span> <span id="s1078">After the war, I think that’s when a lot was written about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: And your camp was in your country, or were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">A: Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: It was in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Just outside of Hamburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">Q: And -- but before we really move on to the -- to the camps, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about why you think the people in your country really sort of came up and in this spontaneous, organized fashion helped rescue so many people?</span> <span id="s1084">What do you think gave them the desire, the will to do that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">A: You mean to help people get to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Yes, particularly that.</span> <span id="s1087">That two week period but just the ongoing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: Well, you know, Denmark had been independent since, I don’t know, a thousand years.</span> <span id="s1089">Never been occupied.</span> <span id="s1090">And then, naturally when somebody comes in like that, it’s going to cause resentment and everything else.</span> <span id="s1091">So it gets to the point anything you can do that can be anti-German, whether it was help people get to Sweden, whether it was blow a railroad car in the air, whether it was put a bomb on a ship so it would sink, whether it was publish papers, whatever it was.</span> <span id="s1092">Anything that was kind of anti-German, people will be in favor of.</span> <span id="s1093">99 percent, I think, of the people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: And the people who didn’t, I mean, how did you feel about them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: Well, because there always gonna be some who just sit back and watch life go by, and then there’s a certain percentage that will be in favor of the -- of the Germans.</span> <span id="s1096">A part of that could be people who lived in a part of Denmark that had been German f-from 1864 to 1920.</span> <span id="s1097">And y-yeah, that was [indecipherable] you could understand kind of, in a way, that -- that there were -- there were certain reasons.</span> <span id="s1098">But a lot of the other one no, there was no excuse for them, and they really got taken care of after the war, I mean, they were -- lot of them went up in jail for simply being too nice to the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: You haven’t really mentioned the king much.</span> <span id="s1100">Is he someone who inspired you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: And can you talk about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">A: He was a pretty good guy.</span> <span id="s1104">He used to ride around every day, and his son was A-one too.</span> <span id="s1105">They were -- you have to have something to hang on to.</span> <span id="s1106">And politicians are not the real ones.</span> <span id="s1107">Look at politicians in France, Laval, Pétain, I mean they -- Laval got hanged, I think, Pétain wasn’t -- or almost 100 so he got away.</span> <span id="s1108">But I mean, there was nothing there we had to look up to Belgium, the -- the king gave up there, Leopold, he wasn’t considered much of anything.</span> <span id="s1109">But in Holland and Norway, king and queen took off for England and formed exile -- exile governments.</span> <span id="s1110">They didn’t have any in Denmark, exile government in -- in the -- in the -- the allied countries, which was a bit of a handicap in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1111">But the -- the king proved to be pretty good anti-German, although his wife was German.</span> <span id="s1112">But I think he was -- he was very good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: How could you tell he was anti-German?</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: It was known from already before the war that he wasn’t much in favor of them.</span> <span id="s1115">I mean, he got a -- he turned 70 -- yeah, he turned 70 in -- in 1940, and he got a very elaborate congratulation telegram from Hitler, and he answered, thanks.</span> <span id="s1116">Hitler got all teed off.</span> <span id="s1117">That’s not how you thank the -- the fuehrer, just by one word.</span> <span id="s1118">So it -- it was pretty well known that he wasn’t much in favor of -- of the Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Did you yourself ever see him riding his horse?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Was just -- he wore an officer uniform, and he just rode.</span> <span id="s1123">Was a red light, he stopped, wait until it turned green.</span> <span id="s1124">He was very good.</span> <span id="s1125">And his son the crown prince was trained in the navy, which of course made him much better as far as I was concerned.</span> <span id="s1126">But he was pretty good guy, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: In this period in 1943 - 1944, what would you say is the most difficult thing you had to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: The one specific thing was after I went to Sweden in the fall of ’44 -- no, fall of ’43, I didn’t see my parents until after the war was over, except once.</span> <span id="s1131">I was in a streetcar and I saw my mother standing, waiting for another one.</span> <span id="s1132">And it was difficult not to get off and say hi.</span> <span id="s1133">At that time I hadn’t seen her for about a year, and it would be another year before I saw her again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Why wouldn’t you get off and say hi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Cause she didn’t know where I was, supposedly.</span> <span id="s1136">She didn’t know I was back in Denmark, she thought I was in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Tell us about that, you -- you went to Sweden, why and what did you do there, and then how did you come back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: I went to Sweden in -- after the -- after we had helped the Jews get over at the tail end of, of that one which was in the f-fall of ’43.</span> <span id="s1139">And then when I was over there I was working in a -- in a lumber camp for awhile, and then I -- I sent a letter to the British embassy in -- in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1140">I volunteered for service in -- in the British forces, and I got a letter back asking me to come up for this script, so I flew u -- I -- I took the train up there and -- and met the people in the -- in the embassy, and -- and the problem was that it would take, oh, I forgot, six months before there would be room.</span> <span id="s1141">They only had, that time, I think room for one or so every night, the flying a Mosquito bomber back and forth.</span> <span id="s1142">So I figured he -- by the time the war’s over, it’ll be too late to do anything, so I went -- I went back to Denmark, and went back at the re -- the resistance stuff.</span> <span id="s1143">And then I went -- twice more, I went over illegally to Sweden for whatever reason there was -- somebody had to get over there, and some had to -- had hotel some -- whatever.</span> <span id="s1144">So I went over there twice more and came back.</span> <span id="s1145">So I was over -- all told, I was over there three times, back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: So I -- that actually -- want to ask you a couple things.</span> <span id="s1147">Just go back to that moment where you can’t talk to your mother, does she see you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No.</span> <span id="s1149">No, she didn’t.</span> <span id="s1150">That must have been in the spring of ’44, yeah, spring of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: Does she have any idea where you are at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: She thought I was in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So, were you wearing a disguise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: No.</span> <span id="s1155">No, but it was -- you know, you’re in the street car, there’s a lot of people and seeing one face out of many, she just didn't catch a glimpse of me.</span> <span id="s1156">And I didn’t want to call her, cause I didn’t want to cause any -- cau-cause her to get nervous or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1157">If she figured I was in Sweden, she would figure I was, you know, safe and all that.</span> <span id="s1158">So that’s when I got caught; she found out shortly after.</span> <span id="s1159">Obviously she got kind of upset, so did my father.</span> <span id="s1160">But then their -- when I -- when the war was over -- well okay, anyway, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">Q: When you come back and you’re not s -- well, let me ask it this way.</span> <span id="s1162">When you come back and you see your mother on the streetcar, where are you living at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: I was living at a house Lupine (Lupinvej) number nine that belonged to a Jewish family that had taken off for Sweden.</span> <span id="s1164">After I got caught, that was myself in the house and a young student, and when I got caught, the next day the Germans went out and blew the house up.</span> <span id="s1165">Unfortunately, they didn't tell the student, and he was sleeping upstairs.</span> <span id="s1166">And in his bed he went through the window, out on the front lawn, still in his bed, without a scratch.</span> <span id="s1167">That’s rather unusual.</span> <span id="s1168">Anyway, the house was completely knee high.</span> <span id="s1169">I’m -- I -- I saw the people after the war, and they rebuild, and of course government paid for everything, so there wasn’t any financial loss as far as they were concerned.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Were you specifically sought after by the Germans?</span> <span id="s1171">Did they know who you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Well, when I got caught, and I got out to sh -- to Shell house and the fellow said my name -- by that time it was too late to try to hide it.</span> <span id="s1173">So I said what do you want, so he said oh, Steen, we been looking for you.</span> <span id="s1174">Well, they may say that to everybody, just to try to scare you a little bit, but anyway, it di -- it does kind of make you a little nervous.</span> <span id="s1175">Whether they really did or not, I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: To their mind what -- what -- what were you up to?</span> <span id="s1177">I mean wh -- why were you a danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s1178">A: Well, you -- you c -- you got to admit to something.</span> <span id="s1179">You can’t just say that you -- you haven’t done anything.</span> <span id="s1180">So you admit to as little as you think you can get by with.</span> <span id="s1181">And then hope that they’re -- they’re gonna buy it.</span> <span id="s1182">Furthermore, they had -- they were -- they -- they -- they arrested a lot of people at that time, so they were pretty busy, these fella -- these policeman that interrogated you.</span> <span id="s1183">And they couldn’t spend that much time on you, so unless they got something out of you fairly soon in the game, they just usually shipped you down south and leave you there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">Q: So what did you admit to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">A: Somebu -- some with the -- with the papers, and there was one other thing, now what the hell was that?</span> <span id="s1186">There was one other thing, and I got by with that.</span> <span id="s1187">It was something in connection with the -- with this -- this parachute guy, cause they kind of tied it in.</span> <span id="s1188">And he was dead, so he couldn’t say anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">Q: A-And you were caught with bombs?</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">A: Yeah, we had bombs in the -- in the apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">Q: Had you ever been involved in the bombing before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">A: Oh yeah, with those little ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Can you just describe a situation where you bombed something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: Well, this was with the tires.</span> <span id="s1195">You -- you put them under the -- the German trucks and then when they -- when they drive over them they blow up and the tire’s completely ruined.</span> <span id="s1196">You know, it’s not as exciting as blowing up a factory, anything like that, but they had problem getting enough tires for the trucks, so it was helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Maybe you could take us through it.</span> <span id="s1198">Wou -- would it be at night?</span> <span id="s1199">Did you have the bombs in a bag?</span> <span id="s1200">Where would you go?</span> <span id="s1201">How would you get them under the tires without being seen?</span> <span id="s1202">How’d you do it?</span> <span id="s1203">A: Well, you -- you try to do it when it’s dark.</span> <span id="s1204">You’d go on -- on the -- on the -- you would go a bicycle if you have the proper lights.</span> <span id="s1205">And you could go until, I forgot what it was, 11 o’clock in the evening there.</span> <span id="s1206">So you could drive around, then if you saw one somewhere, you could just stop and stick one underneath and then peddle along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: So there was a kind of random quality to it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">Q: -- you might just ride around and see what you could fin -- find.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">A: That’s correct.</span> <span id="s1211">When you found one you went after.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">Q: And did you go back and check later on to see if they had exploded?</span></p> <p><span id="s1213">A: No.</span> <span id="s1214">That wouldn’t have done any good anyway, except if -- you would probably put another one underneath them, but no, we didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1215">Q: And how many tires do you think you were able to sabotage?</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">A: Oh gee, I don’t have any idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">Q: Like five, or 50?</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">A: I don’t -- I -- well, you know, with -- with those things, first of all, you never know when they go off.</span> <span id="s1219">You can put it underneath and it -- it may misfire.</span> <span id="s1220">Or it may -- you may be lucky and get four tires, the ones -- if you have those double -- double tires on the truck, so no, I wouldn’t have any idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: What other kinds of assignments were you getting?</span> <span id="s1222">Were you being asked to go to Sweden and bring things back?</span> <span id="s1223">Or people back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: One time I went over with -- with some plans on -- for some fortifications on the -- on the west coast of Denmark.</span> <span id="s1225">I went to the -- as I recall it, delivered them to the police commissioner in Helsingborg a fellow name of Palm, and he -- he arranged for them to be shipped on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1226">Q: Who were they being ultimately sent to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">A: British embassy in -- in Stockholm.</span> <span id="s1228">Delegation I think it was.</span> <span id="s1229">British Delegation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1230">Q: And when you did go over to Sweden, how would you do it?</span> <span id="s1231">How would you arrange getting over there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">A: Well, go in one of the boats.</span> <span id="s1233">We always knew somebody who was going, so -- so just go with them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: But was it suspicious for just a person to be on a fishing boat in the middle of the evening?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, the fishermen were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1237">Was --</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: So I came -- oh, one time I came and I went up in a small town called Lanscona.</span> <span id="s1239">And I didn’t have any place to stay that night so I called the Palm up in Helsingborg and he said -- he called me back shortly after, he said, well, the drunk tank is open tonight if you want it.</span> <span id="s1240">So I went in there and slept in a padded cell that night only time I ever been in one of those.</span> <span id="s1241">But they were very -- the Swedes were very good about everything, very helpful and did what they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: And did you ever take any items, other than the -- the maps, the plans for the fortification, over to Sweden?</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: No.</span> <span id="s1244">No, just o -- what had to go.</span> <span id="s1245">You didn’t have that much room, so you just took what you had to take, had to bring over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: And you -- did you ever bring guns back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: No.</span> <span id="s1248">No, the only thing I brought was that newspaper, British newspaper, which I shouldn’t have done.</span> <span id="s1249">I only did that once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: In your daily life, what were your interactions like with the Germans, once you were o -- active in resisting them, what was it like to run into them on the street and maybe talk to them?</span> <span id="s1251">What wa -- what was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: You wouldn’t talk to them, for one thing.</span> <span id="s1253">And the other thing, they were -- they were running around on the -- you know, they were walking around on the street, and -- and you don’t do anything special.</span> <span id="s1254">I mean, you don’t want to stand out in any way.</span> <span id="s1255">Some -- some fellows tried to just stop them and -- and take their guns, you know, steal their gun, things like that, but that didn’t always work so well.</span> <span id="s1256">They got caught, and then they were in trouble.</span> <span id="s1257">And there was too much of a risk just for a gun.</span> <span id="s1258">Wasn’t worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: But on a daily basis, did you feel that you might get stopped and searched and caught?</span> <span id="s1260">Was that a fear you lived with every day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: Well, yeah.</span> <span id="s1262">You al -- al y -- you always worry about it, of course.</span> <span id="s1263">Also, because there were these people who would -- they would report people who were in the resistance to the Germans.</span> <span id="s1264">So you never know whether somebody like reported you in, and you know, you were likely to get picked up.</span> <span id="s1265">That was one -- one thing you -- you kind of lived with.</span> <span id="s1266">And that was about the hardest one of them all, because it’s kind of a 24 hour a day proposition.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">Q: Can you remember a close call that you had, where you were very close to being discovered by the Nazis, besides the newspaper?</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">A: Not offhand.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">Q: Was there any sense among the people that you did speak to, who were like yourself, in the resistance, what was the ultimate plan there?</span> <span id="s1272">What was the goal?</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Oh take -- have the Germans lose.</span> <span id="s1274">I mean, everybody was hoping for that, and after the -- after the inva -- I was still out when the invasion happened, and after that started -- that -- that came about, you know, then there didn’t seem to be much doubt who was going to win.</span> <span id="s1275">And after the invasion -- the German police got more difficult, was more active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">Q: More what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">A: There was more active.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: More active, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: Particularly Gestapo fellows.</span> <span id="s1280">So anyway, I mean, everybody -- everybody I think wa -- was convinced that the allied was going to win.</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">Q: Can you take us back then, to that night that you were caught?</span> <span id="s1282">We -- we -- we’ve mentioned it before, but let’s just go back to there.</span> <span id="s1283">You were with this parachute --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: Agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">Q: Agent.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1287">Q: And you were going to use these bombs on the tires.</span> <span id="s1288">And just --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: -- what happened, the -- the ca -- the police came in, the Gestapo came in and what did they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: Hit the floor.</span> <span id="s1292">So you’re down there, you’re -- you don’t argue when they come in, you know, with a bunch of guns like that pointing at you, you just go ahead, and cooperate, do what they tell you to do.</span> <span id="s1293">So you get down on the floor and then pretty soon you -- you get the handcuffs.</span> <span id="s1294">And then the -- this was on the fifth floor, I think, in that apartment.</span> <span id="s1295">Take you down, put you in a -- in a truck and take you to that Shell house for interrogation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: And did they take the agent with you, even though he had died?</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">A: I don’t know what happened to him.</span> <span id="s1298">He was still lying on the floor when -- when I left.</span> <span id="s1299">He is buried in the national cemetery over there now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: So there were a period of time and there were five interrogations, and this went over how long a period of time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">A: Oh, couple, three weeks.</span> <span id="s1302">Couple of weeks, probably.</span> <span id="s1303">Maybe three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">Q: And are you see -- seeing anybody else at that time your -- that your fellow --</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: -- fellow [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Only that fellow that came with food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1308">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: Then after couple of weeks, another fellow came in, another prisoner come in, so we shared the cell for the last -- I think I was there probably four weeks in that jail, so the last two weeks there were two of us.</span> <span id="s1310">I forgot -- I think he went -- he went to -- he went to Neuengamme too.</span> <span id="s1311">He was a baker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: Had you known him before?</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1315">Had you prepared in any way to be captured?</span> <span id="s1316">Mentally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: No.</span> <span id="s1318">I mean, you al -- you always hope you’re not gonna you’re not going to get caught, but no I don’t think you sit down and say, well if I’m gonna get caught, I’m gonna do so and so, think so and so, you don’t do that.</span> <span id="s1319">I think it’s simply too scary a thought.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">Q: So then what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">A: And you se -- oh, oh, excuse me, but during that period, all the time the -- the Germans would shoot -- execute people, there was one innkeeper, he got caught because he and his family had been receiving some weapons parachuted down.</span> <span id="s1322">And so he got shot, and I think he had two sons and a son-in-law, all -- all of them got shot at the same time.</span> <span id="s1323">One of the kids was only 16 or 17.</span> <span id="s1324">But they were all executed.</span> <span id="s1325">And the Germans would regularly execute people from the resistance, and they announced it in the -- in the paper, so it was no secret.</span></p> <p><span id="s1326">Q: Why do you think you weren’t ex -- executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1327">A: That is something that I will never know.</span> <span id="s1328">They had to yo -- I mean, we were supposed to -- to get hanged, I was supposed to -- to -- supposedly sentenced to that, and this -- that happened on the way.</span> <span id="s1329">Why they did that I don’t know it -- it -- I know one -- one of the 13 after the war met a guy, a German policeman -- shortly after the war, you know, and this fellow said to him, are you still alive?</span> <span id="s1330">This chap said, what do you mean by that?</span> <span id="s1331">He said, Well, we heard you were gone down Neuengamme he sent message that you were -- supposed to hang you down there.</span> <span id="s1332">And I never -- nothing ever -- and they used to hang people regularly down there.</span> <span id="s1333">One time they -- they hanged eight Polish girls at one slot -- one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">Q: Danish police girls?</span></p> <p><span id="s1335">A: No, Pol-Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Oh, Polish girls, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: Polish girls.</span> <span id="s1338">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1339">Well, the fellow who was the head of the camp got hanged himself eventually, after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1340">Q: Talk a bit about the camp when you got there.</span> <span id="s1341">What -- what happened when you first arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: The first thing that you do is they take all your clothes.</span> <span id="s1343">Then they shave you, anyplace they can find, and -- and then you get some clothes that doesn’t fit you very well.</span> <span id="s1344">I wound up with a -- with a winter coat that was -- that wa -- must have been like from Poland because it was very thick material and there was like cotton in the middle.</span> <span id="s1345">And it was nice and warm, but during these long nights when we had these appelles, you stand out there for parade, and you were standing out there for four, five or six hours until -- they had to count everybody, there were 20,000 roughly, in the camp.</span> <span id="s1346">And y -- if they only counted 19,999, we just stood there until they found the last one.</span> <span id="s1347">So at least the coat were nice and warm for that.</span> <span id="s1348">So after they -- they put -- give you some clothes, then you’re sent over to some barrack somewhere, and then you had to find a place.</span> <span id="s1349">There were usually oh, three guys to a bunk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">Q: You say you had to find a place that -- so, you sort of walked in and you weren’t assigned a place --</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: -- you had to see if you could sneak in somewhere [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: You know, you see if the -- well, one -- if there was one only, two people in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">A: -- you know.</span> <span id="s1356">One time I found one with only one fellow in, so I climbed in that one bed, then I found out why he was alone and I got out very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">Q: Why was he alone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1358">A: Homosexual.</span> <span id="s1359">So I was out, no time flat.</span> <span id="s1360">Then we worked -- I think they woke us up at six.</span> <span id="s1361">Oh, there’s been a lot written about that, you know, in -- people with better memory than mine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">Q: Were there other people from the Danish resistance at that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">A: The whole police force wound up there for awhile.</span> <span id="s1364">All the Dane --</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: [indecipherable] the whole police force?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yeah, all the Danish policemen.</span> <span id="s1367">They were there for awhile, then they got shipped to another camp.</span> <span id="s1368">My godparent’s son was down there in the same place.</span> <span id="s1369">I didn’t even know he was -- been picked up, but I met him down there one time.</span> <span id="s1370">So there were some other Danes, but the Danes were all in -- in a number of different camps, they were not all in Neuengamme.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q: When you found someone you knew, did you try to stick with them, or bunk with them, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">A: No, but you were assigned to a barrack and you couldn’t start running from one to the other.</span> <span id="s1373">Be -- try to meet them when you can, you know.</span> <span id="s1374">You had Sunday afternoon off, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Off from what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Work.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: What was your work?</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: In the beginning we were keeping some -- they had some -- some -- two big buildings built o-of brick, and that’s -- was meant originally as barracks for the -- th-the guards.</span> <span id="s1379">Then later on they moved the guards outside and then these were used for prisoners.</span> <span id="s1380">But the basement was used for -- in -- in case of air raids.</span> <span id="s1381">Not to protect the prisoners, but to make sure that in case a bomb hit someplace the prisoners couldn’t run away.</span> <span id="s1382">So our assignment for awhile was to keep them clean.</span> <span id="s1383">Then for -- I was switched over one time to make some kind of machinery for volk -- for -- they had a -- a gun down there that the -- the home guard was using, supposedly more dangerous to be the guy f-firing it than the fellow who was in front of it, cause they blew up all the time.</span> <span id="s1384">And we were making some kind of a part to that Volksgewehr thing.</span> <span id="s1385">And then -- oh then I got jaundice, and -- and dysentery and went in -- in hospital and then the war was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: What -- can you talk a little bit about the other people who were there?</span> <span id="s1387">You said it wasn’t just Danes, who else was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">A: There were Belgium, Holland, Polish, Russian.</span> <span id="s1389">I got pretty friendly with a guy from Urkutsk, that’s way out in Siberia somewhere.</span> <span id="s1390">I said Polish, and then there was some Czechs, and no Italians, no Norwegians that I know of, they were in another camp.</span> <span id="s1391">But there were all told, roughly 20,000 there, and about on average 2,000 died every month.</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: How did you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1393">A: Well, you -- you hear this from the camp office, you know.</span> <span id="s1394">I mean, there was a -- a f -- couple o-of prisoners work in the camp office, and they were the one that wo -- w -- ha -- have access to information such as that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Were there Jews in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1396">A: I don’t know it specifically Jews, no.</span> <span id="s1397">I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1398">Ours w-were mostly political prisoners which was the red triangle.</span> <span id="s1399">The green triangle was -- I think yellow was -- was -- was criminal, and there was some religious prisoners down there, because everybody had a sign on them.</span> <span id="s1400">I had -- like I had a red D, for Danish political, and 67399.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">Q: That was your number?</span></p> <p><span id="s1402">A: That was my number, yeah, after I got out of that politsi haftling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: 67399, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">Q: And how were the barracks organized?</span> <span id="s1406">Who was in charge?</span></p> <p><span id="s1407">A: Some of the prisoners that had been there the longest was what they call camp, kind of camp police kapo -- k-a-p-o, kapos.</span> <span id="s1408">The kapo we had was a Polish guy.</span> <span id="s1409">He’d been there -- God, he’d been there a long time, and he was supposed to kind of keep -- keep order in this barracks and make sure everything worked out okay.</span> <span id="s1410">He had a lot of authority from the -- from the Gestapo people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1411">Q: Well, what kind of person was he?</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">A: He wasn’t as bad as the Gestapo, but he was not a very friendly sort.</span> <span id="s1413">It wasn’t very easy for him either probably because each -- I imagine each barrack had at least a thousand prisoners.</span> <span id="s1414">So he had to keep all that in order, and you know, had -- that’s kind of a tall order, cause a l-lot of them are pretty rough characters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: When they did execute people, was it done publicly, and were you made to watch?</span></p> <p><span id="s1416">A: It was usually done Sunday -- see, Sunday we only worked half a day.</span> <span id="s1417">So there we had the appelle, the counting in the morning and then on Sunday at 12 o’clock.</span> <span id="s1418">Regular days it would be in the morning and then again at six, at -- at a -- when work finished.</span> <span id="s1419">But on Saturdays after the appelle was worked out they would hang them before we were excused from so we go back to our camp.</span> <span id="s1420">Although the -- the Polish girls, they were hanged in the -- in the camp, they had a little jail there, and they took them in there and hanged them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1421">Q: And was that done in manner that you could observe?</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">A: No, you couldn’t see them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Why were they hanged, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: Did you usually know why people were hanged?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: Well, one guy was hanged because he tried to hide.</span> <span id="s1427">He wa -- he was really a sa -- I think he was kind of half -- half crazy.</span> <span id="s1428">He had had so much of this camp that he wanted to get away, so he hid in a chimney somewhere.</span> <span id="s1429">And so we were standing there waiting for this last one to count.</span> <span id="s1430">Finally they found him, and then next Sunday they hanged him.</span> <span id="s1431">So that was him.</span> <span id="s1432">That was the end of that one.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: Did you ever consider trying to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s1434">A: No.</span> <span id="s1435">No, by the time you have these dog ruled barbed wire fencing and they were about what, 12 feet high, and you have dogs running around in between, and you have people -- ma-machine guns all over.</span> <span id="s1436">You had nightlights shining down these -- between the two.</span> <span id="s1437">No, you don’t stand a chance.</span> <span id="s1438">I don’t know of anybody who ever got out of Neuengamme anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1439">Q: So once you got in and you saw that, how did you intend to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">A: By surviving.</span> <span id="s1441">I mean, there’s -- we were fortunate in -- in a sense that after a few month we started getting food packages from -- from the Danish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1442">And there was -- the beginning there was a -- th-there was soap -- soap in them, there was food in them, there was all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1443">But in the beginning the Germans would open up the box, open all the packages and dump everything in -- in a -- in a bowl, so you get your soapsuds, and your salami and your coffee beans all in one nice mess.</span> <span id="s1444">But then after awhile then they would leave them alone and then they worked out fine.</span> <span id="s1445">One of the big things was salami, they used to ship us -- God knows how much salami.</span> <span id="s1446">You can get tired of that if you get too much.</span> <span id="s1447">But that really is what -- what helped again.</span> <span id="s1448">And then this -- one time they sent us some clothes, you got a jacket, which was badly needed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1449">Q: Were the other groups of people, the Poles, the other groups you mentioned, were they getting packages?</span></p> <p><span id="s1450">A: Not that I know of, never saw anybody get any.</span></p> <p><span id="s1451">Q: Do you know if the resistance was involved in helping the Red Cross get you this stuff, or was it just the Red Cross on its own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1453">I wouldn’t be surprised if -- if the people in the resistance hadn’t been involved in some of it, but I -- I don’t -- I don’t know one way or the other for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Is that something where your parents could send you a package?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">Q: Did they know where you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1457">A: We were permitted to write a letter, was every month or every six weeks, and we were told what we could say.</span> <span id="s1458">You know, I’m only -- I’m fine, how are you, I hope you are fine, good-bye.</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">Q: Did you write it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1460">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s1461">Well, at least it was your handwriting.</span> <span id="s1462">So they knew you were still alive, that’s about all it amounted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: Was there any one person or couple people that you became particularly close to at the ca -- in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Well, of course, out of the -- the 13 of us that went down at the same time, we managed pretty much to stick together.</span> <span id="s1465">The minister got shipped to another camp.</span> <span id="s1466">The one fellow died, but the other one -- the two -- two got moved to another section, but there was about six or seven, and we -- we managed to stick pretty much together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">Q: Were you in the same barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s1468">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1469">Q: Oh, you were?</span></p> <p><span id="s1470">A: And we -- we came back on the same bus.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: Who -- do you remember any of their names?</span> <span id="s1472">Or, which names do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">A: Well, the fellow that died, his name was Thompson.</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">Q: That was the parachute agent?</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">A: No, no, that was one of the 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">Q: Oh, one of the 13.</span></p> <p><span id="s1477">A: He was an innkeeper from just south of Elsinore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">Q: He was executed?</span></p> <p><span id="s1479">A: No, he died of TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s1480">Q: Oh, he died of TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s1481">A: I think he died of TB.</span></p> <p><span id="s1482">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1483">A: The other ones -- the one called Christenson, he’s the guy that had the stroke after the war.</span> <span id="s1484">No, I don’t remem -- remember their names.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: Did you know those men -- they were all men?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1487">Q: Did you know them before you went in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1488">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1489">Q: You call them the 13, okay.</span> <span id="s1490">But you were rounded up together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: We were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: You were interrogated together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: No, we were pulled out of jail together and shipped down south together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">Q: Okay, you were pulled out of jail together, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">A: I didn’t know them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">Q: -- you became a unit when you were shipped down south --</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">A: Correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">Q: -- to the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1499">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1500">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1501">And when were you sent to the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1502">A: When?</span></p> <p><span id="s1503">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1504">A: That must have been in July of ’44, or August.</span> <span id="s1505">Sometime in the summer of ’44.</span></p> <p><span id="s1506">Q: But not -- just to get all this clear in my mind then, so you didn’t know each other before, but then you got to know each other as you were shipped down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1507">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1508">Q: Were you all Danish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1509">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: Had you all been in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1512">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1513">So, you don’t remember their names, but if you could just talk a little bit about how you stuck together when you were in the camp, what small things would you do for each other, or what might you talk about together?</span></p> <p><span id="s1514">A: Well, like I say, the preferred subject was what are we going to do when we get out.</span> <span id="s1515">There wasn’t really much to talk about what we had done -- not much to talk about what we’d done during the war.</span> <span id="s1516">That was kind of a item you didn’t really talk much about.</span> <span id="s1517">There wasn’t really that much to talk about either what you had done before the war, it was really mostly what -- what you gonna do from now on, when the war’s over, when you get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">Q: What kept you going when you were in the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">A: I don’t know, I’m -- I kind of wondered too once in awhile because you see, some people -- I n --6 there was one Danish fellow I knew, tall, strong, big, good looking, he didn't last a month.</span> <span id="s1520">He just seemed like he -- he collapsed, he just kind of fell apart.</span> <span id="s1521">And all the small, skinny fellows, you know, that would ca -- kind of hang around.</span> <span id="s1522">So it has nothing to do with physique.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s1524">Did you pray?</span> <span id="s1525">Did you rely on your faith?</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">A: Yeah, and that’s where we -- we had that minister, which was very helpful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1528">A: One of the 13 was a minister.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: Tell us about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1530">A: I can’t even think of his name any more, but he was good, he was very, very good.</span> <span id="s1531">Very nice chap.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: What would he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Well, you know, he would ta -- he’d talk to you an-and cheer you up, and pray a little and things like that.</span> <span id="s1534">Can’t think of his name, but he was there an-and that must have been like in -- in January of ’45.</span> <span id="s1535">The Germans ca -- ca -- I think they collected all the ministers in one particular camp, and he was -- he was shipped down there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: When -- when did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: Oh, it was on March or April of ’45.</span> <span id="s1538">Course, jaundice is something that kind of comes fairly slowly.</span> <span id="s1539">I mean, it’s not like all of a sudden boom.</span> <span id="s1540">Dysentery kind of comes pretty quick, and I was in so-called hospital for -- oh, I guess it was only three or four days before we were moved with the buses back to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: So just give me the chronology, do you -- you got sick and then were you taken out of the concentration camp to a separate hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: No, it was just oo --</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: You just were in the hospital in the concentration camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1544">A: Just one of the barracks, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1546">And how sick were you, I mean, were you -- could you get out of bed and walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1547">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1548">But you know, yellow jaundice, you’re all -- your eyes are yellow, your face yellow and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: -- and then you -- when you have this dysentery on top of that, that makes it not so good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">Q: So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">A: Besides, they didn’t have any medicine for anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1554">At what point -- what happens then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: Well then, the head of the Swedish Red Cross, a fellow name -- name -- fe-fellow by the name of Bernadotte had made a deal with Himmler, that he would try to negotiate with the allied and get a peace going, and the price for that, Hitler had -- Himmler had to pay was to agree that all Danish and Norwegian concentrace -- concentration camp inmates should be shipped to Sweden until the end of the war.</span> <span id="s1556">So that’s when several white buses came down to the camp.</span> <span id="s1557">First they collected a bunch of prisoners from other camps in Neuengamme, Norwegian and the Danish.</span> <span id="s1558">Then the buses came down, and then they took all the prisoners up to a camp just north of the Danish German border, fa -- a place called Froslev So we come up there and we were there for a couple of days and then they took us by bus and they -- and train, we were supposed to go through Copenhagen and over to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1559">But I didn't want to go back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1560">So just before the -- you get into Copenhagen there’s fairly long hill.</span> <span id="s1561">And I was in the first car, so I went up in the platform and ended up -- said to the -- to the engineer, I want to get off.</span> <span id="s1562">So he said well, he could slow down at that hill there, which he did, and then I jumped off the train.</span> <span id="s1563">And then I was in -- in Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">Q: You jumped off the train, did -- does that mean that you fell, and you had to roll?</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">A: Well yeah, jump.</span> <span id="s1566">I didn’t fall, I jumped off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: You just jumped off and you ended up standing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1568">A: No, oh no, no, you roll.</span> <span id="s1569">You roll a lot.</span> <span id="s1570">I mean, they’re moving fairly fast.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: But you were sick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Well, no sicker than I got on the train.</span> <span id="s1573">Yeah, I had been -- they took us from the camp in Germany, took us across the border to Denmark, put us in this camp down there just over the border.</span> <span id="s1574">We were there for maybe a week, and then the -- we were gonna go to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1575">And as we came with these buses o-over the border to Denmark, the first place they took us to was a dairy.</span> <span id="s1576">We could have all the milk we wanted.</span> <span id="s1577">And not having had any milk for about eight month, and I drank a lot you really get a tummy ache.</span> <span id="s1578">It sure tasted good.</span> <span id="s1579">So then I got off the train in Copenhagen, and s -- I went over to somebody I knew down there and couple of days later I went and got the -- some I.D..</span> <span id="s1580">And then I went up to Elsinore and stayed for a few days with a -- with a couple.</span> <span id="s1581">And then I heard one night the war was over.</span> <span id="s1582">So I called my parents and then I spoke with them and bought a bicycle, drove home.</span> <span id="s1583">That was a nice trip.</span> <span id="s1584">And that was May five, ’45.</span> <span id="s1585">Interesting years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1586">Q: How did things seem at home, when you got home?</span> <span id="s1587">How was your mom and dad and your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">A: My father was at work and so was my sister, so I called them.</span> <span id="s1589">My mother was there, she said, what can I do, you want a sandwich?</span> <span id="s1590">Of course sure I did that.</span> <span id="s1591">So I had something to eat.</span> <span id="s1592">Then I -- I went out to the office I used to work, just to say hello and I was back.</span> <span id="s1593">And they said, whenever you’re ready, come on back.</span> <span id="s1594">So then I went back home again, my father got home.</span> <span id="s1595">And then I was home for a couple of days, and then they told me to go to the hospital because of the jaundice and that.</span> <span id="s1596">So I was in the hospital for about a week I guess.</span> <span id="s1597">And then I was on -- in the -- in the countryside for a week, and then back to work.</span> <span id="s1598">I think I was back to work within four weeks after I come back from Germany.</span> <span id="s1599">There wasn’t any of the psychological straightening out assistance and everything like that.</span> <span id="s1600">So I went back.</span> <span id="s1601">And then I worked for a couple of month, then I heard about that job in England, went over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1602">Q: How did you celebrate your homecoming that night with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1603">A: Well, I guess we just talked.</span> <span id="s1604">They wanted to know how it had been, and I wanted to know what had happened there, you know.</span> <span id="s1605">So I’m -- I’m sure we talked until rather late in the evening.</span> <span id="s1606">But there wasn’t any celebration in that sense.</span> <span id="s1607">There was just -- I guess we were both pretty -- pretty pleased we were still alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Had the Germans left?</span></p> <p><span id="s1609">A: Oh no, they were all over.</span> <span id="s1610">They were all over the place.</span> <span id="s1611">No, they didn’t leave, but you know they -- they -- the British and the -- and the American came in, and the Germans had given up in all but one very small part of Denmark where they want to fight, and eventually the Russians bumped them out of that Bornholm.</span> <span id="s1612">But -- so the Germans start -- just started walking -- walking home.</span> <span id="s1613">Nice to see them leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s1614">Q: Did people just let them go, or were people angry and did they retaliate?</span></p> <p><span id="s1615">A: No, they -- they just let them go.</span> <span id="s1616">A lot of the Germans would buy -- tried to buy food to take home.</span> <span id="s1617">But the time they get down to the border they just had to leave everything in one big pile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1618">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">A: The -- the -- not to take them back to -- to Germany.</span> <span id="s1620">For one thing, they were paying with -- with money that the German army had borrowed from the Danish government, which means that in a sense the Danish government was paying for all this stuff.</span> <span id="s1621">So they didn’t want to -- all that stuff to leave Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s1622">Q: And how were people treating collaborators who -- who had survived the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1623">A: Well, the standard operation for the women, you cut their hair off.</span> <span id="s1624">You have them standing on a -- on a truck and you drive through Copenhagen.</span> <span id="s1625">For the -- for the men, same thing, cut the -- cut them bald and same thing, and then they put them all in jail and you kind of straighten out within a few weeks, you know, who should stay in jail, and -- and who hadn’t been that bad, they could let them out.</span> <span id="s1626">There were -- some of the worst fellows, some of them who would be shooting Danes for instance there was some of that going on, too.</span> <span id="s1627">They wound up, and the com -- some of them got executed.</span> <span id="s1628">They were shot.</span> <span id="s1629">But I don’t think there were more than 40 and 50 all told, like that.</span> <span id="s1630">And then there were some that were put in jail.</span> <span id="s1631">The German general and the head of the Gestapo in Denmark, people like that, they were -- they were put in jail, they were in for six or seven years, then they shipped them out, back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1632">So there was a big party that night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1633">Q: Which night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">A: That night the war was over.</span> <span id="s1635">You know, you would have all the -- all your doors, your windows open, all the lights you wanted, you can -- you can put candles out in the street if you want to do that.</span> <span id="s1636">You could play all the music we want, with the doors open.</span> <span id="s1637">Could do all those things you couldn’t do during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">Q: So people did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1639">A: Yep.</span> <span id="s1640">As I recall, my mother had one can of Portuguese sardines she had left.</span> <span id="s1641">We ate that night, celebration.</span> <span id="s1642">Yeah, that was some party.</span> <span id="s1643">And then we were back to work, and then the -- the daily routine started again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Some way -- I’m not sure exactly when, I think that you were in Sweden and you ran into somebody who recognized you, that you had helped.</span> <span id="s1645">A doctor and his wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1646">A: Oh, ah --</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: Can you tell that story?</span></p> <p><span id="s1648">A: Yeah, that was Dr. Erstwag, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1649">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1650">Just tell us that story.</span> <span id="s1651">How did that happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">A: Yeah, I met him sometime over there.</span> <span id="s1653">Oh, I knew he was over naturally, cause I’d helped him get over, but I didn't know where he was, and I met him on the street one day, I don’t even remember what town it was.</span> <span id="s1654">But he wa -- it was nice to see them, th-they both looked -- and the baby was doing well.</span> <span id="s1655">Started walking and everything else.</span> <span id="s1656">Little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s1657">Q: Was this the couple that had been inside the beer cases?</span></p> <p><span id="s1658">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1659">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1660">A: No, th-they went over with -- they went over with a fishing boat, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1661">Q: So you didn’t recognize them necessarily, but they recognized you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1662">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1663">Q: And what did they say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">A: Well, th-they told me they appreciate what I -- helped them get over and all that, and told me how well they were doing and everything else.</span> <span id="s1665">They were looking forward to getting back before long.</span> <span id="s1666">Back to Denmark.</span> <span id="s1667">Then he died shortly after, but I met her years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1668">Q: How do you think your country dealt with the war after the war?</span> <span id="s1669">Did people just push things aside, or were there wounds that really had to be healed somehow?</span> <span id="s1670">You think it was something that really weighed on people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1671">A: I think there was a -- a -- quite a lot of people who realized that the people who been resistant had -- had taken some awful lumps, physically, financially.</span> <span id="s1672">What they did on the physical part of it was built some old age homes specifically for people who had been involved with that.</span> <span id="s1673">They have five of them, I think, in Denmark now.</span> <span id="s1674">On the financial part, they examined eventually everybody.</span> <span id="s1675">That was -- I think it was five years before I ever wa-was checked out and -- to find out whether you have anything anything wrong, any -- any lowered ability of making your living, And things like that.</span> <span id="s1676">.</span> <span id="s1677">And if -- decided, I think they decided I was 60 percent unable to work full speed.</span> <span id="s1678">So then they give you a certain amount of money to make up for that.</span> <span id="s1679">Well I been working right along, but of course if -- if I hadn’t been down there, things might have worked out a little bit better, because you do have certain problems after that.</span> <span id="s1680">I mean ow -- you don’t sleep as good as you -- you normally would.</span> <span id="s1681">There are -- there are certain disadvantages.</span> <span id="s1682">But I think they’ve been very liberal over there in -- in what they’ve been doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1683">Q: Do you have trouble sleeping?</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1685">But nothing compared to what I used to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1686">Q: What was the problem wa -- before that was so bad?</span></p> <p><span id="s1687">A: All of a sudden you -- you are back there, in -- in some of it, and -- then you kind of wake up, you know, and you’re a little unhappy and takes awhile before you go back to bed -- go back to sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Nightmares.</span> <span id="s1689">You’re talking about nightmares.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: In a sense, yeah, that’s what it is.</span> <span id="s1691">But eventually, I think, you get pretty much over that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1692">Q: But you had them for a long time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1693">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1694">But it doesn’t bother me any more now, fortunately.</span> <span id="s1695">So -- oh, I came out pretty good, I mean.</span> <span id="s1696">Physically, mentally, everything else, I came out a lot better than a bunch of fellows did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Is there something I haven’t asked that you would like to say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: Well, I think I gotta say the government has been very liberal, considerate and -- and everything else like that.</span> <span id="s1699">Some of the -- some of the natives had a little different attitude, but -- little bit more shortsighted.</span> <span id="s1700">He didn’t help me any, so what good he done for me?</span> <span id="s1701">But that’s a minority.</span> <span id="s1702">I’ve been over there, oh, I don’t know, 20 times since then, and it -- it’s nice to get over there, but it’s not like they used to be, I mean, like it was before the war.</span> <span id="s1703">And I guess it’ll never be like that, at least won’t -- it won’t for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">Q: Well, how is it different?</span></p> <p><span id="s1705">A: Oh, because you can’t help, you walk around and you get to think, you know, this happened there, and that happened there, you know, those things [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1707">Yo-You can’t be there without the war, you’re saying?</span></p> <p><span id="s1708">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: The war is always with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1710">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1711">Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1712">Q: Okay, and what is this here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1713">A: That’s my passport, issued in 1942 and worth ti -- valid until 1947.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: Don’t think, let’s just double check.</span> <span id="s1715">And this one here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1716">A: And this one here is from ’47 to ’52.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: Okay, when is this one here?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Ah, when was that?</span> <span id="s1719">From ’50 -- ’52 to ’58.</span> <span id="s1720">1952 to ’50 -- ’58, yeah.</span> <span id="s1721">And that was the last Danish passport I had.</span> <span id="s1722">Then ’54, I became a U.S. citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">Conclusion of Interview USHMM Archives RG-50.030*0418
