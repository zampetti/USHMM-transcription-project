id="s4">I am Anthony Di Iorio and I am at the home of Mr. George Topas in Lakewood, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s5">I am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum to interview Mr. Topas about his recollections of the Holocaust and about the history of his family.</span> <span id="s6">Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">A: Good afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">Q: Could you first tell us something about yourself, where you grew up?</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Well, I was born in Warsaw to a well- to- do family on November 3, 1924 and I was brought up at home.</span> <span id="s10">We had a villa in Shaborov which was about 20 minutes train ride from Warsaw in the country where I would spend the summers.</span> <span id="s11">Later on I went to a Hebrew academy in Warsaw and went through my grade school there, and had my Bar Mitzvah in Warsaw in the great synagogue and remember playing in the parks and doing the things that kids do.</span> <span id="s12">I had two brothers.</span> <span id="s13">My younger brother was named Syzmon.</span> <span id="s14">He was born in 1928, 27, excuse me, and was roughly three years younger than me and I had another brother Meir who was born when I was already nine years old, in 1934.</span> <span id="s15">I remember his birthday in particular because it just so happens that my grandmother's sister and her husband and their young daughter, about my age, came for a visit to Warsaw from America and it was a big event in our lives to see the Americans visiting us.</span> <span id="s16">So despite the language barrier between us kids; because they could speak Yiddish, you know, the grandparents could speak Yiddish and my parents could speak, it was something of a sensation in our home to see, you know we were not used yet to see kids that were not disciplined, sort of dominate the attention of the whole household.</span> <span id="s17">And after graduating what you would call elementary school in Warsaw, I was admitted to gymnasium, which is high school and went there for one year.</span> <span id="s18">But about that time, the clouds of war began to gather and my father thought of sending me to agricultural school.</span> <span id="s19">I guess the reasoning behind that decision was the fact, well there were several considerations.</span> <span id="s20">One, that I was not doing so greatly in gymnasium.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You weren't the greatest student in the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Except for history which I took genuine interest.</span> <span id="s23">I didn't show great promise at that time.</span> <span id="s24">I don't know in what order of urgency these considerations came but there was the consideration that Poland, they came and__________ for the Jews and my father already at that time, I think Austria was already next to Germany, and Czechoslovakia was next in the frying pan and blackmailed by Hitler at the time, you know the whole incident with Sudetenland and so forth, that served as a pretext for German aggression there.</span> <span id="s25">At any rate, my father felt that immigration became imperative for us and he felt that someone with a farming background would have a greater chance of being admitted to a foreign country than a merchant or professional.</span> <span id="s26">I don't know just how true that was but farmers were always readily admitted to countries like South America and Canada.</span> <span id="s27">Canada was then considered unpopulated and my father mentioned Canada as one of the possibilities of our immigration.</span> <span id="s28">So the decision was made that I should become a farmer or at least I should learn farming and I was sent to that school in a place called Wajenuswolinsky {ph 55} about 350 kilometers southeast of Warsaw and I began my education in farming there.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: All of 1938?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: This was the summer of 1938 because I arrived there just in time for harvest which was the worst period from the standpoint of work, the fact that we had to work nothing like we consider work today, from sunrise to sunset.</span> <span id="s31">But once the harvest was over, then we began class work.</span> <span id="s32">As the season neared winter, work was progressively reduced and class work increased.</span> <span id="s33">And that’s the way it went.</span> <span id="s34">But of course, I never graduated from school because the war broke out.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: Which work did you like or dislike the most, the schoolwork or the physical labor in the fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: Well, I was not too much enamored by the work in the field but I did like work with the animals, with horses and cows and other animals we had there on the farm.</span> <span id="s37">I found it very interesting and I became a very good student there, too, so that school had from a standpoint of my upbringing and maturing, had a very favorable effect on my attitude towards learning and many other things.</span> <span id="s38">So much so far that I surprised my parents when they saw my school report.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Were there other Jewish students at this school?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: There were only Jewish students at this school.</span> <span id="s41">This school was under the auspices of an organization called Tarbot which I think is Hebrew name for culture and the principle objective there was to train Jews in agriculture so they can immigrate to Palestine and become farmers.</span> <span id="s42">This was also a consideration even though my father when he mentioned Canada as a possible place for our immigration, he considered Palestine as well but unfortunately, the British then had a policy of, a restricted policy of immigration to Palestine and it is a strange thing that when we mention today Palestine, today Palestine has a completely different connotation.</span> <span id="s43">In WW II.</span> <span id="s44">The Palestine brigade that fought with the British 8th Army, consisted of Jews alone from Palestine, from Israel as it became.</span> <span id="s45">Now the connotation conjures visions of intifada and mayhem and gang of cutthroats, you know that are</span></p> <p><span id="s46">Q: Anti-Jewish in a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: Anti-Jewish.</span> <span id="s48">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: So this was a school that was affiliated with the Zionists?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Zionist orientated.</span> <span id="s51">It was, you might say it was soft on religion, aspect of it, but the religious life in the school was accented to a certain degree and all the holidays were observed and so forth.</span> <span id="s52">I remember that we did not work in the fields on a Sunday, besides Saturday, also not on Sunday in order not to offend the Christian peasants in the area, to respect because it was their day of rest.</span> <span id="s53">So we were only working internally on the grounds, on the grounds proper.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Q: Were there any Socialistic aspects in the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So it was more religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to Palestine after finishing this school.</span> <span id="s58">In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think and I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out that there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in Israel except me, so they made it.</span> <span id="s59">They joked around and they said “ Topas remained the only Zionist among us”.</span> <span id="s60">Because I was living in America and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them achieved a very high rank in the army.</span> <span id="s61">And only one of the fellows that graduated the farming school remained a farmer.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Did you dream of going to Palestine during that year you were at the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s64">I had my sites set for Palestine.</span> <span id="s65">It was something very attractive to us, to be in a land that historically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous history of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in Poland, in most of the countries of the world in general, then Palestine loomed very largely in our consideration.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular school, do you recall what it was like to be Jewish and to go to public schools for higher education at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in public school for a very brief period, one year that my mother sent me to public school.</span> <span id="s68">I don’t remember the circumstances.</span> <span id="s69">But other than that, I was always going, for instance, the primary school that I went to, the prep school so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one of the most modern of it’s kind and had a religious orientation.</span> <span id="s70">Modern.</span> <span id="s71">Then I went to gymnasium henu which the Hebrew word denotes upbringing, you know.</span> <span id="s72">Then I went to this Tarbot School and I think the reason they sent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">Q: How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s74">A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself.</span> <span id="s75">To that extent that my grandparents were assimilated on my father’s side, not my mother’s side.</span> <span id="s76">But since the grandparents on my mother’s side lived in a distance away from us in Forst we didn’t have much contact with them.</span> <span id="s77">But in Warsaw, we virtually lived with our grandparents.</span> <span id="s78">We were living in the same apartment building.</span> <span id="s79">My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe the Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our stores were open on Saturday; although holidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn’t interfere with business.</span> <span id="s80">And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and he sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot.</span> <span id="s81">So in 1920 during the Bolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the truth about his age.</span> <span id="s82">He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s83">But as he matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit of difference to the anti-Semites.</span> <span id="s84">All the Jews are the same.</span> <span id="s85">So he was a thinking individual.</span> <span id="s86">One of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to courts and listening to trials because he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality, questions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil.</span> <span id="s87">So eventually, eventually, he became aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of acceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt it was a bankrupt.</span> <span id="s88">Although many people at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief.</span> <span id="s89">So at time already when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move.</span> <span id="s92">And our house became kosher and so forth.</span> <span id="s93">Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were well-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so clean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a prayer in German.</span> <span id="s94">This was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s95">But this radically has changed.</span> <span id="s96">For my father became religious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and our bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not only to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Did you notice this when you were seven?</span> <span id="s98">This must have come as a major change.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: It was a major change.</span> <span id="s100">In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware that I am a Jew.</span> <span id="s101">Because I was sheltered you know in my life in Warsaw and in schools and I was not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti-Semitism nor did I understand what it really meant.</span> <span id="s102">We lived in Poland so I was Polish.</span> <span id="s103">That’s the way I understood it.</span> <span id="s104">But one time when we were in our country in the summer, I might have been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the bedroom and he told me to sit down.</span> <span id="s105">I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and that we were enslaved in Egypt because this is the core of our belief and of the historical, factual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of Egypt to become a free people., to become a people to be a light to the nations.</span> <span id="s106">He said a few things that were just beyond me perhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the school I was going to and I was sent to a more religious oriented school.</span> <span id="s107">And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we were alienated from our larger family circle because of my father’s change.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very religious household.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: You are very observant.</span> <span id="s110">That is exactly what happened.</span> <span id="s111">When I gave you the names, I told you that my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of giving Polish names and my brother’s name was given originally in Stanislav although his Hebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef for Joseph Benjamin.</span> <span id="s112">But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my father’s orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my grandfather’s father.</span> <span id="s113">He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Would you describe your father as a strict father?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father.</span> <span id="s116">Although he could have been quite relaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict.</span> <span id="s117">He believed that the key word we have to focus our attention is righteousness.</span> <span id="s118">To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be moral, to be truthful.</span> <span id="s119">He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability to comprehend that.</span> <span id="s120">That this is significant.</span> <span id="s121">Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by the new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own style and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: How would you describe your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: My mother came from a religious home but she was somewhat of a rebel.</span> <span id="s124">Perhaps not consciously so but it was simply a question of economics.</span> <span id="s125">She was born as one of four sisters to a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram, was a hat maker.</span> <span id="s126">And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist.</span> <span id="s127">When he was not working he was spending his time in a house of study, in a religious house of study.</span> <span id="s128">Now, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn’t see future in following this tradition.</span> <span id="s129">Because they didn’t have big dowries.</span> <span id="s130">At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to anybody who was worth his weight in salt.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage.</span> <span id="s133">Three of the four daughters went into the professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence.</span> <span id="s134">There was just no future for them in the town.</span> <span id="s135">Excuse me, in the town.</span> <span id="s136">It is still a town.</span> <span id="s137">It is now even more significant.</span> <span id="s138">I guess Poland calls it the capital of petro chemicals in Poland.</span> <span id="s139">And I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my grandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters.</span> <span id="s140">Now, this, in the United States would be way below poverty level because the whole apartment consisted of one room and a kitchen and six people lived there.</span> <span id="s141">It is just hard to believe.</span> <span id="s142">And I remember visiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always immaculately clean.</span> <span id="s143">Everything was so perfect -- they didn’t have running water.</span> <span id="s144">They didn’t have a bathroom, no plumbing there.</span> <span id="s145">It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit.</span> <span id="s146">My father already became religious at that time because before, we didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s147">And it was contrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan Warsaw with floors that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma’s home and plumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living.</span> <span id="s148">Whereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally.</span> <span id="s149">So my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support herself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the biological process.</span> <span id="s150">Her older sister Franya, you’ll find out in my book, they’re in furniture, you’ll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she herself was a teacher.</span> <span id="s151">My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well-to-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you know a public accountant.</span> <span id="s152">I don’t know if she was certified, if such a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: A notary?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper.</span> <span id="s155">And the youngest one was with the family.</span> <span id="s156">I don’t think she went in to a profession; she remained at home and never married.</span> <span id="s157">They all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war.</span> <span id="s158">The youngest daughter’s name was Razel.</span> <span id="s159">So this was the background.</span> <span id="s160">When my mother came to Warsaw, she __________ in the university in the school of law.</span> <span id="s161">In other words, you must realize that I believe that only 5 or 3% of the Jews could be admitted to any state institution.</span> <span id="s162">She had first to get through high school, an eight year course.</span> <span id="s163">As she said in her own application here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her entry examination she was admitted to the state’s gymnasium.</span> <span id="s164">She covered a course of 8+ course in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years.</span> <span id="s165">And then she was admitted to University of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s166">Before, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still restrictions about how many Jews could be admitted.</span> <span id="s167">And she had two handicaps -- being Jewish and being a woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: And being from a small town, by Warsaw standards.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: By Warsaw standards.</span> <span id="s170">So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the Topas boys.</span> <span id="s171">So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother which was my uncle Ben.</span> <span id="s172">And this is how people fell in love with the tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A; Well, the results were predictable.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Your father was smitten.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: He must have been.</span> <span id="s177">And he married very young.</span> <span id="s178">My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19 when they married.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this matter?</span> <span id="s180">It must have not been the planned marriage of their dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Indeed, it was not.</span> <span id="s182">As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because in Europe it was not like in the United States where you have misalliances between rich and poor and between professional and non-professional.</span> <span id="s183">There was a class-consciousness, even among Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry someone from a very poor family by contrast.</span> <span id="s184">And my grandparents were opposing too on the ground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some obscure town in Poland and they didn’t like the idea that my mother was older than he.</span> <span id="s185">Four years older.</span> <span id="s186">They didn’t like that.</span> <span id="s187">But apparently they were overruled.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: By your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: Probably by my father.</span> <span id="s190">He wanted to have his way.</span> <span id="s191">My mother was never very happy living in such close proximity to my father’s family because she realized the objection and she realized she was married over these objections.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: Interesting.</span> <span id="s193">How about your father’s brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: My father’s brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which was the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing photographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn’t get married until probably maybe a year or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the job of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also the head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, Topaz Shoe Company.</span> <span id="s195">But I have very fond memories of my uncle the bachelor.</span> <span id="s196">Bachelors have money.</span> <span id="s197">Married people have responsibilities and bills.</span> <span id="s198">And he lived with the grandparents.</span> <span id="s199">So my brother Szymon and I and my cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father’s sister Bella Necovyak who lived with them there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping in his room from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to wake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the matinee to go and see the movie.</span> <span id="s200">And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the choices and he would open one eye and say are you here already.</span> <span id="s201">And he knew to buy his peace he had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the streetcars.</span> <span id="s202">Sometimes he would say, “It’s such a beautiful day, why don’t you go to the park?’</span> <span id="s203">“Why do you always have to go to the movie?”</span> <span id="s204">That is one of my fond memories that he was very generous that way.</span> <span id="s205">I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler.</span> <span id="s206">My parents probably couldn’t afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">A: And kids.</span> <span id="s209">That means the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Now I remember that your brother, from your description, he had to have been a hell of a nice guy.</span> <span id="s211">I don’t know whether he was a great student.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: Who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: Your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: Neteck?</span> <span id="s215">I don’t think that he distinguished himself particularly.</span> <span id="s216">He graduated high school.</span> <span id="s217">He might have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s218">But the one who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack.</span> <span id="s219">He was distinguished in many sports too, that’s why we remember him.</span> <span id="s220">The newspaper clippings would tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of the first line teams in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s221">It was a Jewish team.</span> <span id="s222">Hapoyal means the worker.</span> <span id="s223">That didn’t sit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my grandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur an injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood infection.</span> <span id="s224">But I remember that when he graduated high school and I was still then very young, he didn’t want to go or perhaps he couldn’t get admission although he was a very good student, to the University of Warsaw and he wanted to go for chemical engineering.</span> <span id="s225">So he went to the Polytechnic in Prague in Czechoslovakia, and became an excellent chemist in his field.</span> <span id="s226">He survived the war and when he came to America he couldn’t get any employment.</span> <span id="s227">But eventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he distinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became a director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in Los Angeles and he told me one time that the rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as much as a book of matches.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: We were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer.</span> <span id="s229">You were saying that he went to Czechoslovakia to study.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: In the German Polytechnic there.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: In the 1930’s?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: In the 1930’s, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">Q: Just before the Nazis came to Czechoslovakia?</span></p> <p><span id="s234">\A: He graduated before the Sudenland, before the occupation.</span> <span id="s235">He must have graduated around circa 1937.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: What was he planning to do?</span> <span id="s237">When he finished graduating, what would he have done in Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Well, in fact he did graduate and he got a job with a sub clinical lab in Poland so he was gainfully employed as a chemical engineer.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: In Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: In Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q; And what were you hoping to become: I remember you were interested in history and also you had an inclination toward animal husbandry after that first experience at the college in southeastern Poland.</span> <span id="s242">What was on your mind to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Well, once I got my feet wet in this agricultural school that my parents sent me, I really became fired with enthusiasm for being a farmer.</span> <span id="s244">I thought it was a great life, I thought it was a meaningful life because being close to the soil, you are close to nature and it is a very healthy life and since there is some ideological being associated with it because of Jews, basically we are a nation of farmers and freeholders.</span> <span id="s245">If you study ancient history, you’ll find out that in it’s classical period, the kingdom of David and the kingdom of Solomon when the fortunes of the Jews were at it’s highest peak, most people were farmers.</span> <span id="s246">There were some __________, but they didn’t have a class of merchants.</span> <span id="s247">In fact in Israel, when they spoke of merchants, they spoke of Canaanites.</span> <span id="s248">The Canaanite merchants, they used to come to temple grounds and sell trinkets or whatever it was.</span> <span id="s249">I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main road leading to the school buildings as you would approach the field because we had a 50 acre farm there and the name was, said in Hebrew ____________ .</span> <span id="s250">That means for us to return to the plow as we have moved from the plow to the scale, meaning to merchants.</span> <span id="s251">Because the Jews were forced in medieval times and even in earlier times in exile, they forced out of so many avenues of life, they couldn’t own land, so they wound up as businessmen.</span> <span id="s252">So the stereotype of a Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe was not the true echoes of the Jewish people as it was then.</span> <span id="s253">At the time of Moses, that came not out of propensity of the people for that particular subject but because of necessity.</span> <span id="s254">So I felt that we are going to turn the clock of history and we will straighten this out and we will become farmers again.</span> <span id="s255">Idealistic I was fired with enthusiasm, not on a single argument, but on all these that I have mentioned by others but that I cannot think of now.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: So this reversal of medieval, social engineering so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Yeah, medieval, social engineering.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: I remember earlier you described the family reunion.</span> <span id="s259">The relatives from America and the differences in the way in which children behaved and also the language.</span> <span id="s260">What were the languages used in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Well, my grandparents spoke to them in Yiddish because this was the language that was always used as a back up language.</span> <span id="s262">Also used so that we wouldn’t understand it -- they wanted to say something to each other.</span> <span id="s263">My parents were also fluent in Yiddish so that I think this is the language they used.</span> <span id="s264">They might have reverted to Polish because, still, my grandmother’s sister and her husband came from Poland.</span> <span id="s265">They emigrated only after World War I there.</span> <span id="s266">They still remembered the language so they could speak Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very beautiful girl -- she was actually my brother’s age.</span> <span id="s267">I remember they went for a walk in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s268">They got lost and finally we got a call from the police station that they found them in the park.</span> <span id="s269">They were lost and they came to the police station.</span> <span id="s270">Someone from the adults took a taxi and brought them back.</span> <span id="s271">She couldn’t speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up from her parents and we just didn’t know -- we communicated by body language.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Which languages did you normally speak?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">Q: Polish.</span> <span id="s275">I imagine you studied Hebrew?</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: Hebrew, yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: I remember a little bit of German earlier on.</span> <span id="s278">Did you study German too?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: I took German as my -- there was a choice given in gymnasium, usually in Poland.</span> <span id="s280">It was either French or German.</span> <span id="s281">There was a choice.</span> <span id="s282">That’s besides Hebrew and, of course, besides Polish.</span> <span id="s283">Sometimes they would give you an option of English.</span> <span id="s284">We didn’t have this option.</span> <span id="s285">But I learned English anyway through a tutor.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: So your household, would you describe it as being a Polish- speaking household?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Basically it was a Polish- speaking household.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: That didn’t change your father underwent his ____?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A; This didn’t change.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Now, your uncles that we mentioned.</span> <span id="s291">They did not experience the same religious conversion that your father did:</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">Q: They continued to participate in the assimilated culture?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">Q: We’ve mentioned the shoe store.</span> <span id="s296">Perhaps we should describe how the store was founded and by whom?</span> <span id="s297">I know the name of the store was The I. Jacob Topas Store.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">A: Right.</span> <span id="s299">But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather, Jacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas.</span> <span id="s300">It’s hard for me to determine after such a long time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the dynamics of the expansion of this.</span> <span id="s301">But it started from a very modest beginning.</span> <span id="s302">Because after marriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed.</span> <span id="s303">He was a person who modeled ladies’ shoes.</span> <span id="s304">He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that she wanted to set up a store that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would have his imprint on it, his model.</span> <span id="s305">I think this is the way it originated.</span> <span id="s306">First, I think that they had a place on Pyskas Street but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing store in Warsaw, in the same building where we had also an apartment.</span> <span id="s307">Later on they opened two more stores in Warsaw, one on Noves ______ and one on Mar________ which was the main thoroughfare of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s308">But eventually, towards the time close before the outbreak of war, only the main store remained functional.</span> <span id="s309">Because they found out that they don’t need three stores in Warsaw, that people will come to this store.</span> <span id="s310">Because it was unique, because of the hand-made shoes.</span> <span id="s311">This shoe store catered to the intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people who could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes.</span> <span id="s312">They were not inexpensive.</span> <span id="s313">Then we also opened a store in Katovitz before the outbreak of the war.</span> <span id="s314">My father ran that for a while but the Polish government forced him out by saying that they are not going to allow anybody to set up a store who was not a citizen as of 1920 or something like this.</span> <span id="s315">Some restrictive measure that were calculated against Jews, So we had to liquidate that store also about six months before the outbreak of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: That’s interesting.</span> <span id="s317">So the anti-Semitism of the Polish government was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Was also economic.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: Economic, yes.</span> <span id="s320">And of course, there was no Polish state before 1918, 1919?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I really don’t know what they used as a cutoff date as to who is allowed to have a store or not to have a store.</span> <span id="s322">Because initially we had representation there, someone that had stores of shoes already and was just buying our shoes because there was a demand for them.</span> <span id="s323">The demand was so great that we decided, I mean my parents and grandparents, decided that perhaps they should open a store there where they can also benefit from these sales to a greater extent than wholesaling it.</span> <span id="s324">So they went ahead and did it.</span> <span id="s325">But this didn’t sit well probably with the merchants -- shoe merchants in the city and they put pressure on the officialdom to out stop us.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Were there any other changes regarding your father’s companies’ business situation?</span> <span id="s327">I know there were other laws being introduced in the late thirties at this time regarding Jews.</span> <span id="s328">Did you know of any ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: There is one event in the history of our business that I only know second hand from my uncle.</span> <span id="s330">He was closer to the center of action there than to know it.</span> <span id="s331">He claimed that the Polish government had a war debt.</span> <span id="s332">I think probably 1920—1919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s333">That the Jews were disproportionately, very heavily assessed to pay this.</span> <span id="s334">He told me that my grandfather, in the course of several years, had to pay something which would be in American pre-dollar value, a quarter of a million dollars but in Polish currency was close to a million zlotys which was a unit of Polish currency was defined.</span> <span id="s335">The ratio between one was like five zloty to a dollar.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: Was there any chance that perhaps one of the stores was liquidated in order to help to pay this off?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: This is quite conceivable.</span> <span id="s338">It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in order to meet that --- those demands.</span> <span id="s339">Because my grandparents owned land in the country where we had our villa.</span> <span id="s340">(End of Side A, Tape 1) I was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned.</span> <span id="s341">They also, as I understand, had a building in Berlin.</span> <span id="s342">This dates to the time that Poland was occupied; the occupation of Poland.</span> <span id="s343">They also had an apartment house in Danzig.</span> <span id="s344">But by the time I was born, all these properties were liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government.</span> <span id="s345">You know, the assessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us.</span> <span id="s346">Poland had a peculiar labor law.</span> <span id="s347">It permitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened.</span> <span id="s348">Our shoes were hand made.</span> <span id="s349">Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the cottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and helpers, apprentices in his own household.</span> <span id="s350">He would come to our office and get the materials and the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it.</span> <span id="s351">He was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it.</span> <span id="s352">If there were some corrections to be made, he would have to do that too.</span> <span id="s353">So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred or so that were making the shoes for our company.</span> <span id="s354">Now they became members of a union.</span> <span id="s355">I remember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in Poland an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and occupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers.</span> <span id="s356">Bur the strike provided that they had to leave enough seats so that business can continue.</span> <span id="s357">Because I cannot conceive of a customer feeling comfortable in a store where there is a hostile strike.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: A labor conflict?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: Conflict, right.</span> <span id="s360">So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely discussed and talked about later.</span> <span id="s361">That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on the chairs but he stretched himself across several chairs to occupy.</span> <span id="s362">My father took him and forcibly threw him out the store.</span> <span id="s363">But the thing that struck me later is that I don’t recall that any of the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike.</span> <span id="s364">This strike was eventually resolved and everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the first-class citizens in Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Even if they were well off?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine.</span> <span id="s367">Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a citizen.</span> <span id="s368">For instance, when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to show their loyalty, especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My Eyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to the Polish air force as a show of patriotism.</span> <span id="s369">But it didn’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: As if anyone could have suspected or expected Jews to be in favor of Germany in such a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: But they said -- the Polish parliament, which was only debating since the death of Puchentsky, was only debating I should say since 1935, was only debating the Jewish problem and attributed all the economic reverses or problems to the Jewish question of being a large majority there.</span> <span id="s372">Although the largest majority were really Ukrainians, minority I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Minorities, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Were Ukrainians.</span> <span id="s375">But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: So the Jewish problem was the greater one than the German problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Because they made it so.</span> <span id="s378">This was what was debated.</span> <span id="s379">When a Jewish member of their parliament, their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we should unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two separate questions.</span> <span id="s380">That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with the Jewish problem.</span> <span id="s381">That’s the way -- that was the answer</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: The workers, the people who made the shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Non-Jewish.</span> <span id="s384">In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews.</span> <span id="s385">Now there are people which are doing the tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the sphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: The customers would be of all faiths?</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: Yes, very heavily Christian.</span> <span id="s388">Because the product was known and you still can find people today that are of my age who live in Warsaw; they all remember the shoe store in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s389">Because it was a known firm, it was a known name.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Now, 1938, which was the last year you were in Warsaw before the war; that was also the year when the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back to Poland.</span> <span id="s391">Do you have any recollection of any of that?</span> <span id="s392">Did you witness any?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the street.</span> <span id="s394">My father would point out to me and say these are refugees from Germany.</span> <span id="s395">Also we seen photographs in the newspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting.</span> <span id="s396">The stories that were behind them; where they were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they stripped them also of the Polish citizenship.</span> <span id="s397">So they were people without citizenship; it was very sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: Earlier we were talking about patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your father.</span> <span id="s399">I recall when we were looking at the photographs, that you mentioned other family members who were involved in various patriotic efforts; either when Poland was just becoming independent.</span> <span id="s400">I’m referring to the war against the Soviet Union in 1920.</span> <span id="s401">Then I remember too, there is someone who is in the Russian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s403">Poland, as you know, was occupied and didn’t regain its independence until 1918 and prior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was Germany, Austrian-Hungarian empire and Russia.</span> <span id="s404">Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and Russian zone, so to speak.</span> <span id="s405">The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive program of reciprocation, so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the language that you had to do business in Poland, in official Poland.</span> <span id="s406">Also when people were drafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army.</span> <span id="s407">Now my grandfather, probably still a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar’s army and was sent to Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese war.</span> <span id="s408">I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times they executed Chinese.</span> <span id="s409">The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the Russians.</span> <span id="s410">The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn’t do so well with the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to Russia.</span> <span id="s411">But he served with them.</span> <span id="s412">I don’t know, I couldn’t tell you just how long.</span> <span id="s413">I know he was with his friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came back from the war, back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s414">My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my grandmother Esther Topas.</span> <span id="s415">So this was one experience of the military.</span> <span id="s416">I don’t think my grandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during the Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way.</span> <span id="s417">In fact my father served in the Polish army later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army for a short period of time.</span> <span id="s418">My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and after serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically.</span> <span id="s419">He was recalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises.</span> <span id="s420">My father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism regardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination --that we still owe allegiance to the country that we live in.</span> <span id="s421">In that respect, there was no question about it.</span> <span id="s422">He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of Poland because we are an endangered species there.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the University of Warsaw and then the tutoring work that she did.</span> <span id="s424">There was a document that you showed me earlier ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s426">That document showed that after graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during vacation time, did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home, which is apparently, I would imagine it’s a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war.</span> <span id="s427">So she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services.</span> <span id="s428">She introduced that certificate and other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a school sort of to support her application for law school in the Warsaw University.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: This was in 1920 when she was helping, helping to care for the Polish soldiers?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Soldiers, I think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Which would have been the middle of that war?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: Yet, one of your family members was considered not to be a citizen of Poland?</span> <span id="s434">Or not a citizen of Poland early enough?</span> <span id="s435">I remember when you were talking about your store and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: All right.</span> <span id="s437">This was not a citizen of Poland but a citizen of the city.</span> <span id="s438">This is kind of a discrimination, sort of compartment -- put in different compartments.</span> <span id="s439">You can be in this compartment but you cannot be in the other compartment.</span> <span id="s440">What it meant is that our family opened a branch of our store -- I think they opened it probably in 1938 ---.</span> <span id="s441">After six months of existence, the Polish government of the city of Kapolt ______ ordered them out because they claimed that they were not citizens of the city, or dwellers or residents of the city at some undetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it.</span> <span id="s442">Justify them being there, prusterick.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Of course, Katavista was near the German frontier and I imagine they were more paranoid than usual of all the border area.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: I think that basically they couldn’t possibly -- they couldn’t question my father’s credentials since he was a reserve non-commissioned officer, volunteer in a war against Russia.</span> <span id="s445">It was simply a question of economic discrimination.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Economic anti-Semitism regardless of patriotism?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Now meanwhile you were off to the east, studying to be a farmer.</span> <span id="s449">I imagine you had mixed feelings.</span> <span id="s450">You obviously liked being near animals.</span> <span id="s451">You wanted to be a farmer and yet you were far away from home.</span> <span id="s452">You had left the big city and now you’re in the sticks.</span> <span id="s453">I suppose.</span> <span id="s454">For Poland that was the sticks.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: You’re going to make me say things which are in my book, really.</span> <span id="s456">I am firm about that but you are very perceptive in understanding that someone who came from a big city suddenly changes his environment to a very raw surroundings in a sense -- that we had to haul our own water, even in our dormitory and we were always exposed to the elements.</span> <span id="s457">The creature comforts that our home provided were very remote there.</span> <span id="s458">It was not easy to get assimilated there.</span> <span id="s459">I remember from the first class -- there were maybe thirty students that started the course.</span> <span id="s460">By the time of the fall harvest, of the potato harvest, it was reduced to about twenty.</span> <span id="s461">Because the others quit, just packed up and went home because it was just too tough for them.</span> <span id="s462">But with me, it was very tough and I was always on the verge of quitting during the harvest.</span> <span id="s463">But I said -- I felt that it was an embarrassment to come home and say that I failed.</span> <span id="s464">So I said, let me see if I can hold out at least another week because it doesn’t look good to come after the first week.</span> <span id="s465">So by several such resolutions, I extended my stay beyond the harvest time.</span> <span id="s466">Eventually I got to like the school and I took pride in being able to work there and being knowledgeable about crops and about animals and animal life.</span> <span id="s467">Anything that relates to this type of life interested me.</span> <span id="s468">I had a genuine interest in it that was developed by a very dynamic teacher and director of the school, a fellow named Yachim Scholinsky who still lives in Israel.</span> <span id="s469">A very dynamic person who made study an excitement.</span> <span id="s470">He put excitement in it which you don’t normally find in classrooms.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Where were you when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: When the war broke out, I was in that school.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Almost harvest time again?</span></p> <p><span id="s474">A: Well, it was past the harvest time because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and the harvest usually starts in the middle of June and continues up to this point.</span> <span id="s475">Hitler did very well by waiting for the Poles to gather for him, all the harvest and put them in barns where they can easily have it picked up for their own use and for the army’s use, there was feeding off Poland,</span></p> <p><span id="s476">Q: Were you surprised by the outbreak of war?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Yes, I was surprised by the reality of it not about what you read in the papers.</span> <span id="s478">Because the movies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until you are really directly affected by them.</span> <span id="s479">The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of loss of interest for school subjects.</span> <span id="s480">The school authorities suspended classes and they had dismissed all the students to go to their respective hometowns except for the contingent from Warsaw.</span> <span id="s481">Because they said Warsaw is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will remain in school.</span> <span id="s482">Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on Sunday our buildings were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered there.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: In what other ways does the war affect you?</span> <span id="s484">School is closed, Polish army takes over the school, your home is besieged by German forces --?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because Warsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Warsaw before the war was declared.</span> <span id="s486">This was done on September 1st</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: And those continued, the bombing attacks?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s489">Sometimes I think, I don’t know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but it was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already was wiped out on the airfields before they got up in the air.</span> <span id="s490">So they definitely were taken by surprise -- those that shouldn’t have been taken by surprise.</span> <span id="s491">We heard on the radio Friday morning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on Warsaw and about the war.</span> <span id="s492">Of course, there were mixed emotions.</span> <span id="s493">There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern.</span> <span id="s494">What does it mean?</span> <span id="s495">What does it portend?</span> <span id="s496">But the authorities were very reassuring.</span> <span id="s497">They said the war will soon be over and everybody will go home.</span> <span id="s498">I don’t know whether by this they meant that Poland will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were very bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports.</span> <span id="s499">Of course, we didn’t know, we didn’t have the idea, the ability to be critical.</span> <span id="s500">We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence and what truth is in it.</span> <span id="s501">You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry is fighting in East Prussia like wild lions.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: You had never seen a wild lion before?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are -- the Polish army is advancing on Berlin.</span> <span id="s504">I mean this was like on the first or second day of the war.</span> <span id="s505">When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English national anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers were hysterical.</span> <span id="s506">They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- in a short time.</span> <span id="s507">Nobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: That Poland would win?</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: That Poland, together with England and France would win.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: When did you realize that Germany would win this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s511">A: When they told me that -- and I was in the city of Lublin -- that the Germans would be here in one hour.</span> <span id="s512">In a city and Lublin was under bombardment.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: It’s way to the east.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: It’s past Warsaw, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What about the Russian invasion?</span> <span id="s516">Did that come as a surprise?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: It was anti-climatic but it came also as a surprise.</span> <span id="s518">Perhaps to many people it was a welcome surprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone -- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the border was not firm -- there was an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn’t have yet a strict instruction, how to handle the border movement across the border.</span> <span id="s519">So that anybody that thought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of people made that choice and then they went.</span> <span id="s520">They made a wise choice because they had a greater chance of survival in Russia even those who were sent to Siberia.</span> <span id="s521">They were displaced, they still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to destroy the people, no matter what nationality.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: Unless they were Kolaks or _____________ or bourgeois or _____________ of production.</span></p> <p><span id="s523">A: Or Polish officers in Katin.</span> <span id="s524">That’s an interesting aspect of the Polish officers in Katin that many people don’t know about it.</span> <span id="s525">A lot of Jewish officers were among these Polish officers and they were killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army.</span> <span id="s526">The Jewish chaplain of the Polish army.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">Q: What was your greatest priority in September 1939 as your world is falling around you?</span> <span id="s528">What is your --?</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: To be reunited with my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Reunited with your family in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: What is happening to your family in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: I didn’t really know what was happening to my family.</span> <span id="s534">I could not establish contact.</span> <span id="s535">I don’t know whether the telephone lines were still functioning in the few days of the war but I know that I managed to send a telegram to my mother asking her to send me money for a ticket to go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s536">I don’t know whether she send me the money in time or whether the authorities gave us the money to buy the tickets because eventually they relented and they told us that we can return to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s537">I think there were about five or six of us that immediately began to pack and go.</span> <span id="s538">I remember a very interesting incident.</span> <span id="s539">When I was in the post office standing in line to send a telegram, there was a line -- the post office also had the national savings bank of Poland which was called PKO,________________ -- that means Polish Fund of, Saving Fund, which was government fund and people were using savings books.</span> <span id="s540">So there were two Polish women standing in line talking to each other and very patriotically that they still have confidence in the Polish government and that they are depositing.</span> <span id="s541">They were depositing,</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: Eventually you do return to Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: I didn’t make it to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s544">I never made it to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s545">The irony of it is and you can find it in my book that when I came to the cashier’s window in ____________ with other students, I said Warsaw.</span> <span id="s546">So she said the eastern railroad station or the main?</span> <span id="s547">The eastern being on the east bank of the river, the main being in the center of the city of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s548">I said, main.</span> <span id="s549">She said that will be 50 cents more or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: They charged you for it?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient funds to pay for it.</span> <span id="s552">The irony of it was that we never got near Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: Well, you didn’t know it was surrounded, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: Of course.</span> <span id="s555">Not only was it surrounded because the train traveled for about 40 or 50 kilometers and the railroad tracks were going skyward.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">Q: The aerial bombardment?</span></p> <p><span id="s557">A: Right.</span> <span id="s558">There was no further railroad transportation --from there on, we were on foot.</span> <span id="s559">We never got any further than Lublin, the city of Lublin.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: In retrospect, retrospective knowledge, what were your family experiencing in Warsaw during these months?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: You mean, actually weeks of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: What was not known to me and I found out later by miraculously meeting with my father in Lublin is that the Polish government -- there is a controversy about it by historians.</span> <span id="s564">Some claim that the Germans, on Polish language gave the order in Polish to the Warsaw population that all able bodied men of military age should march east for mobilization where they going to make a defense deeper in Poland, in the country.</span> <span id="s565">This was given on the night, I think, of the sixth or seventh of September.</span> <span id="s566">Then my father and his two brothers were of military age and the followed these orders.</span> <span id="s567">They marched east of the Vistula River and they marched east without any specific destination but they continued to march east where they were being strafed by the Stuka planes.</span> <span id="s568">But this order, a few hours later was countermanded.</span> <span id="s569">I think the name of the officer that gave the order, countermanded it, was Romanowski.</span> <span id="s570">By that time, it was already too late.</span> <span id="s571">Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend Warsaw and all the manpower that would have done the defense left Warsaw.</span> <span id="s572">So my father and his two brothers were actually on the road with thousands upon thousands of men and easy targets for the German Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill.</span> <span id="s573">The casualties were tremendous.</span> <span id="s574">Eventually my father lost contact with his two brothers in the confusion that ensued and he got as far as Lublin.</span> <span id="s575">I found him on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, New Year’s, in the synagogue where I went to pray.</span> <span id="s576">I lived there too and I seen my father there.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: So it was a chance encounter?</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: Yes, it was unbelievable because there were thousands upon thousands of refugees that converged on Lublin and flooded the town way beyond its normal population.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: Were the rest of the family back in Warsaw, were they affected at all by the bombardment?</span> <span id="s580">Were there any ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yes, the building that we lived in, the artillery destroyed part of the roof of the building.</span> <span id="s582">One of the bombs struck the courtyard and killed a couple of people who were in a doorway, didn’t go to the shelter.</span> <span id="s583">I was also told that there was a maid in our building, in one of the store that were in the building -- there was a drugstore by the name of Prusak.</span> <span id="s584">Prusak was a very nice man.</span> <span id="s585">I think it was a family store.</span> <span id="s586">He was the son of the owners and used to give candles and other things to kids when they came in with parents.</span> <span id="s587">He, somehow, got set on fire by a firebomb and became like a human torch and was burned alive during the bombardment.</span> <span id="s588">They had no water because all the facilities were disrupted so people literally had to travel to the Vistula River with buckets to bring water.</span> <span id="s589">The utilities were not restored until the Germans took the city at the end of September.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">Q: So your brothers, your mother, your grandparents --?</span></p> <p><span id="s591">A: My grandfather, not grandparents because grandma left for United States on the last ship before the outbreak of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s593">So grandpa is there and what was the plan?</span> <span id="s594">When your grandmother left to go to America, what was the plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s595">A: The plan was that she is able to help us in some way.</span> <span id="s596">Possibly to see if she can send us affidavits so we all can go.</span> <span id="s597">Because she went on a tourist visa and ostensibly to see the World’s Fair.</span> <span id="s598">But in reality, she had a sister living there that visited us a few years earlier.</span> <span id="s599">They were bakers here.</span> <span id="s600">So she went to see this sister.</span> <span id="s601">My father and the family here hoped that she would be able to help because by that time it was already too late.</span> <span id="s602">My grandmother was granted a visa and, of course, after obtaining the visa, she had to buy the ticket.</span> <span id="s603">The name of the shipping company in Poland is called Orbees to this day.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: The same company?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: My father later told me that there was such a melee in the office of wives of important Polish diplomats and government officials, they were asking to get a ticket.</span> <span id="s606">They had no problems with visas and so forth but they were sold out.</span> <span id="s607">They would say that they would sleep on the deck of a ship if there were no more cabins.</span> <span id="s608">You know, they couldn’t get it; they knew already what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: This was on the Puzutski the ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: Yes, Puzutski.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Interesting that some of these people had less confidence in Poland’s ability to withstand the German attack.</span> <span id="s612">You mentioned a family of diplomats and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">Q: So your grandmother was able to help you from America?</span></p> <p><span id="s615">A: Yes, well this happened sometimes later.</span> <span id="s616">It was not-- after the order was restored in the occupied Poland and they allowed return to Warsaw; we left probably already in October sometime, in later part of October; by horse and wagon rather than by train to come back to occupied Warsaw.</span> <span id="s617">My father immediately proceeded, engaged people to repair the building, the roof in the building and to restore it because otherwise we wouldn’t have shelter.</span> <span id="s618">And it was actually in the later fall, perhaps in November of that year, we didn’t get packages.</span> <span id="s619">We got affidavits for the whole family to go to the United States.</span> <span id="s620">My father studied these affidavits and debated whether he should go to German authorities to obtain permission to leave.</span> <span id="s621">I don’t know what specific reasons were given but he never made use of these affidavits because the fear was that there were already some other people that have American relatives reported and they were imprisoned.</span> <span id="s622">This was very strange because American was not at war with Germany at the time.</span> <span id="s623">So we never made use --–there was great excitement and expectation, the great expectation -- but it sort of was left in abeyance.</span> <span id="s624">Bur later on, of course, we didn’t feel it so badly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this.</span> <span id="s625">And things got progressively well.</span> <span id="s626">Then the packages began to come from America, from my grandmother.</span> <span id="s627">She used to send an average of six packages a day.</span> <span id="s628">In the course of two days every member of the family would get a package.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: And you would be able to correspond with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: We could correspond with her.</span> <span id="s631">The mail was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what we are saying.</span> <span id="s632">We couldn’t make any complaints.</span> <span id="s633">We understood this, that we have to be brief in expressing.</span> <span id="s634">We had to sort of let her read between the lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: How long did these packages continue to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">A: The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in the Warsaw Ghetto, meaning until the Germans put an end to it which was a few months before the deportation to Treblinka, the big action as they call it, the Grossactuen which would put it in May of 1942.</span> <span id="s637">The packages became sporadic, eventually there was a cut off point but they were our lifesavers because the famine in 1941 became very severe.</span> <span id="s638">If you read the notes, the Ringlem notes of the Warsaw Ghetto, you’ll find out that people were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day.</span> <span id="s639">It was twice as much already in ’42.</span> <span id="s640">These packages were a thing that made a difference between us living or dying of hunger.</span> <span id="s641">Because we had no other resources that I knew of at the time.</span> <span id="s642">We had some hidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell them even in a clandestine fashion.</span> <span id="s643">The rations were not enough to sustain life.</span> <span id="s644">I remember during the time of famine in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1941 that the children would just go in groups on the streets, after the curfew; I think the curfew was 8 p.m.</span> <span id="s645">But it was not dark yet during the summer months so they would walk on the streets barefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food.</span> <span id="s646">One of the standard lines they would say, Yan___________ which means I don’t want to surrender my ration card.</span> <span id="s647">Surrender meaning dying, so they were begging for bread.</span> <span id="s648">My parents would always do something, however inconsequential this would have been to withstand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: What did your grandmother send?</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: The packages that we would get, I have a feeling, were not something that she, herself, prepared.</span> <span id="s651">There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it.</span> <span id="s652">But it had canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butter, a can of coconut butter which was very useful because my brother, my youngest brother Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was spitting with blood so he needed that.</span> <span id="s653">They would send us Salem Lipton Tea, I remember.</span> <span id="s654">Lipton Tea was worth its weight in gold because you could get -- coffee and tea was at a premium, above other commodities except maybe for bread.</span> <span id="s655">So some of these things we used and some of them were sold in order to buy bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: So she helped feed you and she essentially gave you the wherewithal to supplement?</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: She gave us a lease on life.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s659">And everyone received a package?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">A: Well, everyone received a package by families.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Who would she address it to?</span> <span id="s662">To your -----?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">A: Different names of our family members.</span> <span id="s664">But we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas, it meant it was for our family.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">Q: For everyone, yeah.</span> <span id="s666">What happened to the shoe store under the occupation?</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: Well, in 1939 I believe, in November, late October or November, the Germans had arrived and confiscated all the shoes.</span> <span id="s668">It was quite -- the shoe store was closed already and they came in.</span> <span id="s669">I remember when they were standing; they rang the bell in my grandfather’s apartment which was one flight above the shoe store in the same apartment building.</span> <span id="s670">It was a four-story apartment building with a courtyard in the center and apartments surrounding it.</span> <span id="s671">I remember the chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen _________?</span> <span id="s672">_____, Isaac Yacob Topas?</span> <span id="s673">So when it was answered in the affirmative, then they graciously told him that he could keep something like 20 or 30 pair of shoes, or whatever.</span> <span id="s674">They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest will be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the trucks, himself.</span> <span id="s675">He and my father and people that were caught on the street to help out with this, so there was kind of a, like a bucket brigade carrying the shoes to those trucks that were being loaded.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Do you remember when this was?</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: I would have to look in my book for exact date but it was either in -- the closest I can think, November, more likely November 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: So the Germans knew who your grandfather was?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, they had information about shoe stores and businesses and so forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">Q: I was trying to imagine when we were talking about the affidavits earlier, the reasons why he wouldn’t pursue that and I thought to myself, well perhaps he didn’t want to call attention to himself, especially since other people were being arrested.</span> <span id="s681">---presenting yourselves to the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so.</span> <span id="s683">That anyone, this was probably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and showed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for America, the Germans could let them go, they could tell them to go home, or they could put them in prison.</span> <span id="s684">We knew in Poviac which was the most wholesome prison in Warsaw that they had some Jewish families that had American --.</span> <span id="s685">We didn’t even want to let them know that we had American relationships although the packages would have indicated this.</span> <span id="s686">But they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s687">Food packages is this kind of thing, that it doesn’t have any political significance.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: But it’s curious that the Germans were consciously trying to starve the ghetto of Warsaw and yet they allowed the food packages to come.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s690">Because it was a drop in the bucket.</span> <span id="s691">Maybe they would feel differently if it was a real organized Jewish effort in America to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the people in the city.</span> <span id="s692">Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation.</span> <span id="s693">In fact, my grandmother’s sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in America, there was a limit on what she could take.</span> <span id="s694">She couldn’t take currency, just a few hundred dollars, from Poland when she came over to visit.</span> <span id="s695">But she had some jewelry and she was using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages.</span> <span id="s696">But that was not enough and she had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a paralyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us these packages.</span> <span id="s697">She is a big heroine in our family.</span> <span id="s698">She did this and her sister, I found out when I came to the United States, was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name she was called by.</span> <span id="s699">What are you doing?</span> <span id="s700">What are you knocking yourself out?</span> <span id="s701">They are not going to get these packages.</span> <span id="s702">The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages.</span> <span id="s703">Therefore you are doing it in vain.</span> <span id="s704">My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument because it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if she listened to her, we would have perished sooner.</span> <span id="s705">I probably wouldn’t get the point where I can start my concentration camp career.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: I wouldn’t get that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: You may not have survived the ghetto either.</span> <span id="s709">I mean there were all kinds of ways of not surviving.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: Do you recall any other -- I can remember you had an introduction to farming and no doubt you were able to put some of that training to use in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: Well, the training of the farming stood me well in several ways.</span> <span id="s713">First of all in that school, it was a bodybuilding process.</span> <span id="s714">The hard work.</span> <span id="s715">I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a young man.</span> <span id="s716">Secondly, it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm.</span> <span id="s717">In the Warsaw Ghetto there was an organization called Toporol, T-o-p-o-r-o-l, which stood for ____________, means a society supporting agricultural work.</span> <span id="s718">That opened courses in the Warsaw Ghetto for people interested in this and I took those courses.</span> <span id="s719">This way I became affiliated with this organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">(End of Tape 1.)</span> <span id="s721">In the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the late spring of 1941, the Toporol organization, that organization that was dedicated to the agricultural work, sees an opportunity of utilizing all empty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for the starving ghetto.</span> <span id="s722">Of course, it was a puny effort in comparison to the need where you have half a million people, nearly half a million people, starving in the walls of the ghetto.</span> <span id="s723">But nevertheless, the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was distributed to the students that were working on it.</span> <span id="s724">Because it was not that much that they could -- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to get it past that point.</span> <span id="s725">I was at a time, already sixteen years old and I was made, appointed, one of the instructors.</span> <span id="s726">I remember there was a large plot, yard in the street, Leshner Street, not far from where we lived where I had two groups of students that were coming.</span> <span id="s727">One for two hours and then the next one for two hours and I was showing them how -- we were working those lots and I was showing them how to do it.</span> <span id="s728">They were very eager kids, even some of them were, of course, undernourished.</span> <span id="s729">They were very enthusiastically interested in the work and doing this work.</span> <span id="s730">In fact, one of the girls that was in the group, not in my group but in the group of another instructor who was sick and I was sent there as a replacement one time to fill in, remembered me long after the war and sent me a letter to this effect, which became an appendix to my book.</span> <span id="s731">She is trying to find out whether I am the same person who acted as an instructor at the time.</span> <span id="s732">These kids were very eager and we were planting lettuce, radishes, tomatoes, I remember, cabbage, very basic things in a kind of garden farming or tract farming as they call it.</span> <span id="s733">I was also assigned on a Gensha Street prison and I also remember working at a cemetery on Gensha Street and there was a very stark contrast between what we were doing.</span> <span id="s734">We were pruning tomato plants for the living, while perhaps a 100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in mass graves.</span> <span id="s735">Usually the method that was used, they were using a chute from the back of a wagon into those graves.</span> <span id="s736">The work was going on all day.</span> <span id="s737">Those people were being -- the dead were being collected.</span> <span id="s738">By that time the famine was very severe.</span> <span id="s739">I was occupied with this job, which sometimes the reward was to the students and the instructors that they could pick up some of the crops of their own handiwork, own labor and I think that the instructors were also getting, weekly, a loaf of bread.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">Q: Were you an instructor as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s741">A: Yeah, I was an instructor.</span> <span id="s742">That was what we were getting above the students, the people that were coming in these groups.</span> <span id="s743">In the end of June of the same summer, a call went out from this organization for able bodied men, whom they have on their roster already, to report for volunteer work in the states around the Lublin district to help with the harvest.</span> <span id="s744">My parents very quickly consented to me to go.</span> <span id="s745">They would have one less mouth to feed and the conditions in ghettos were very bad.</span> <span id="s746">By that time, my brother Szymon also already had a touch of tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s747">He was spitting blood.</span> <span id="s748">This is even with the help of the packages we were getting from America.</span> <span id="s749">It was just not enough.</span> <span id="s750">We were shipped to the district of Lublin and we worked there.</span> <span id="s751">We were quartered there and worked there.</span> <span id="s752">Even after the harvest I managed to stay there until February of the following year.</span> <span id="s753">This was a very significant factor in my own personal survival from the standpoint that I was able to eat normally during that period of time and live in a healthy environment of the country, quite a contrast.</span> <span id="s754">In fact after I had been a month on those estates, I thought to bring my brother Szymon there, somehow.</span> <span id="s755">There was a small post office and I managed to make a phone call to a store that was opposite to our apartment building.</span> <span id="s756">My father came to the phone and I told him about this.</span> <span id="s757">He said that my brother Szymon didn’t look like a Jew and he could pass for an Aryan easily -- that he should come and join me, that he should send him out of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s758">He came and he stayed for a few months.</span> <span id="s759">Of course there was a problem there.</span> <span id="s760">He got homesick and eventually he left and went back home to the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">Q: Because he was homesick?</span></p> <p><span id="s762">A: Yes, because he was homesick.</span> <span id="s763">But I did not go until it was absolutely -- I found out that it was dangerous to live there because we no longer, we were no longer needed there for the harvest in February, right?</span> <span id="s764">So in February, I returned.</span> <span id="s765">We were almost shot in Denblin en route by the German authorities who did not recognize our pass or came within seconds of not telling you this whole story.</span> <span id="s766">There were many such incidents because I was also involved in smuggling and I cannot go into this.</span> <span id="s767">There was just too many schemes and escapes and whatnot.</span> <span id="s768">I returned to the ghetto in February, found out that my grandfather, Jacob Topas, the founder died a few months earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: In January?</span></p> <p><span id="s770">A: From typhus epidemic that was raging in the Warsaw Ghetto from famine because the sanitary conditions were very poor at the time and the overcrowding brought in lice and lice begot typhus.</span> <span id="s771">So you had everything together.</span> <span id="s772">But apparently all these things that the Germans put in operation to strangulate the economic life of the Warsaw Ghetto and to bring the demise of the Jews, didn’t happen for them fast enough.</span> <span id="s773">So the inevitable thing is that they had to resort to a more drastic method of bringing about the end of the Jewish community in Warsaw and in Poland.</span> <span id="s774">In April of 1942, a reign of terror started in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s775">We began to talk about building shelters; something was impending, we didn’t know exactly what.</span> <span id="s776">The packages from America stopped coming.</span> <span id="s777">I forgot to mention that when America entered the war, my grandmother resorted to ---.</span> <span id="s778">She was very resourceful, she contacted someone in the Portuguese embassy or consulate and the packages were coming -- the point of origin was Portugal.</span> <span id="s779">Portugal was neutral so we were getting packages probably until spring of 1942.</span> <span id="s780">Then the whole postal system, the whole ghetto system began to break down.</span> <span id="s781">The Germans, as I mentioned to you, launched a reign of terror in April of 1942.</span> <span id="s782">They kept it up.</span> <span id="s783">Later on I learned that this reign of terror was to paralyze the will of the people to resist for what was coming., for what they had in store for them.</span> <span id="s784">That was the “resettlement” action.</span> <span id="s785">Resettlement meant shipment to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s786">It started by them posting the declarations or the ordinance that the Jews should report voluntarily to the umschlagplatz, the umschlagplatz being the depot from which the trains were leaving for Treblinka.</span> <span id="s787">.</span> <span id="s788">They would go east, they would obtain shelter.</span> <span id="s789">Those who report voluntarily would receive jam and bread and surprisingly enough, the first day, which was July 22nd and this happened to be Tish a’Bov, the day of mourning for the Jews for the two destructions of the First and Second Temple in 586 B.C. and 70 A.D. by Babylonians and Romans, respectively; so the Germans launched this action.</span> <span id="s790">The key ingredient in carrying it out was deception.</span> <span id="s791">Deception being that the Jews were promised to go to the east where there’s work, shelter for them and they imagined that nothing could be worse than the ghetto so the poorest of the poor began to report to the umschlagplatz with their luggage,.</span> <span id="s792">The Germans tolerated it.</span> <span id="s793">The first shipment, the people received the bread, they received the jam, they were able to take their luggage and they were put in the box cats and shipped away.</span> <span id="s794">But within 24 hours, rumors spread as a wildfire, that someone escaped from this transport and that Treblinka is really an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s795">I remember that evening when we heard it in our homes ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: So already in July of ’42 ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what Treblinka meant.</span> <span id="s798">Many people didn’t want to believe it, we believed it.</span> <span id="s799">In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were already in a Luftwaffe camp, my brother Szymon.</span> <span id="s800">In other words, he -- we both report as volunteers to go to Luftwaffe camp yet before this action was launched.</span> <span id="s801">This was kind if a transition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor column.</span> <span id="s802">We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just coming to a point at the Warsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our job.</span> <span id="s803">Sometimes they used streetcars for part of the trip.</span> <span id="s804">There was a place called Bilanie; there was a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for aircraft when we were supposed to work.</span> <span id="s805">But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out houses.</span> <span id="s806">I don’t know why but I said to myself, we are back in the brickfields, we are back in the brickfields.</span> <span id="s807">Symbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in Egypt.</span> <span id="s808">But this still was, comparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column.</span> <span id="s809">When the action was launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to go to the umschlagplatz.</span> <span id="s810">So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain sections of -- block by block of the city and emptied the houses.</span> <span id="s811">They also would come in, when the Germans came to conduct this with their trucks and wagons, sometimes, they usually marched people, those that could march.</span> <span id="s812">Those who were already immobile, they were handicapped or they were so starved that they couldn’t walk, they threw them in the wagons and they took them that way.</span> <span id="s813">They could come in and announce that they would respect all the passes because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the ghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the police; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt.</span> <span id="s814">So they were ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: They would respect these passes in the east after resettlement?</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all.</span> <span id="s817">As the time went on, they were less and less respected.</span> <span id="s818">I didn’t have any pass so that if I was caught, I probably would have been shipped out to Treblinka too because we were simply assembling every morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were brought at the end of the day, to the point, to the gate and then we were on our own to get home.</span> <span id="s819">.</span> <span id="s820">But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once we came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with you because you’re going to be here, interned for your own protection.</span> <span id="s821">Then he looked at the faces; he passed all of us in review.</span> <span id="s822">The whole group of about two hundred people.</span> <span id="s823">He looked at my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he’s too young.</span> <span id="s824">He also, maybe, exempted another kid and that was the end of it.</span> <span id="s825">When we came home, the ghetto was in such a state of terror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws.</span> <span id="s826">You know what the rickshaws were?</span> <span id="s827">They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are sitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back.</span> <span id="s828">They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled rickshaw and they would be firing at the windows at the people and the crowds wherever they see them.</span> <span id="s829">.</span> <span id="s830">So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work.</span> <span id="s831">Of course, after that incident, after we were told that we’re going to be interned there, I realized that I’m going to have to part from my family.</span> <span id="s832">The morning after this, when I got up in the morning, my father was still praying.</span> <span id="s833">I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some of my things that I was going to take with me.</span> <span id="s834">I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my youngest brother, Meir, and to Szymon.</span> <span id="s835">Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first time I’d seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence.</span> <span id="s836">He was a very self-possessed individual and confident that somehow we’re going to get through this whole ordeal and so forth.</span> <span id="s837">I don’t know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must have realized that we are parting for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: You didn’t realize it?</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: No.</span> <span id="s840">I was too much of an optimist.</span> <span id="s841">I was too young.</span> <span id="s842">I’m sort of a romantic in a sense that I think that hope can overcome reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: And you had managed to come back before.</span> <span id="s844">I imagine that you had a feeling that somehow you could manage.</span> <span id="s845">From Lublin the first time, and then coming -- I imagine each time you walked back from work, there was sort of a feeling of survival, giving the random violence that was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Correct.</span> <span id="s847">I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good.</span> <span id="s848">So in the long run, I don’t think that there was any doubt even by those who perished that Germany will be defeated and that they’re going to win the war.</span> <span id="s849">The question is when.</span> <span id="s850">But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that war and that the Allies will prevail and win.</span> <span id="s851">But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such optimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being.</span> <span id="s852">Of course when I took my last glance at my father, that was it.</span> <span id="s853">I haven’t seen him again nor my parents.</span> <span id="s854">I went to this camp.</span> <span id="s855">We learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the shipments to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s856">In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last transport to Treblinka because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto, that they and their families would be spared.</span> <span id="s857">So they and their families on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped.</span> <span id="s858">I guess there was some poetic justice in that.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Symbolism at least.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: Right.</span> <span id="s861">I began to realize that if I wanted to know what happened to my parents and to my family, I would have to return t the ghetto.</span> <span id="s862">But you just simply cannot say I am leaving.</span> <span id="s863">We were by that time already interned, we were prisoners, we were not free people.</span> <span id="s864">Although there was such a nebulous air about it as to exactly what is our status there.</span> <span id="s865">We worked there; they intern us for our own protection.</span> <span id="s866">That means if we leave, we are just taking risk with the protection.</span> <span id="s867">But, in reality, you could be shot for leaving without permission.</span> <span id="s868">I began to plan an escape.</span> <span id="s869">The way I went about it, I reported that I am a shoemaker by trade and that we have people here whose shoes need repair.</span> <span id="s870">If they are going to continue to work, someone has to repair their shoes, that I should be given the opportunity to do this.</span> <span id="s871">In order to do this, I need tools and equipment and I can get these in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s872">So they send me with a guard to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s873">On the second such trip, I escaped.</span> <span id="s874">I left the cart waiting.</span> <span id="s875">Then I began to -- I had to go where our home was.</span> <span id="s876">By that time, the ghetto was reduced in size.</span> <span id="s877">There was what they call Niemand’s Land that means Nobody’s Land and it was not permitted to be there but there was a group that the SS employed in the Warsaw Ghetto of Jews which was called Vertafastak.</span> <span id="s878">Vertafastak was sort of a clean up group that was confiscating all the -- collecting all the goods of the people that were no longer there.</span> <span id="s879">Furniture, books, belongings, clothes, whatever else those that were deported to Treblinka left behind.</span> <span id="s880">It was a big operation and a large contingent of these who were working.</span> <span id="s881">They would be doing it by streets.</span> <span id="s882">.</span> <span id="s883">I reported to work with such a group and when they went there, I separated myself from them by just ---.</span> <span id="s884">There were so many people walking upstairs and downstairs and there were only a couple of guards usually at the gate.</span> <span id="s885">I went on the roof and through the roof I walked to the roof of the adjacent building, came down and eventually got to the area of my own building which, of course was deserted.</span> <span id="s886">But I found out that behind iron doors, back doors of one of the delicatessen stores, which really delicatessen in Poland means something else, means like a grocery store.</span> <span id="s887">I found out that the survivors there who knew me and who were tenants in our building, that my mother perished, that she was one of the first -- in one of the early raids -- and they told me that my father might still be around but they don’t know.</span> <span id="s888">Eventually I met in this Niemand’s Land another person who had a store also in the building.</span> <span id="s889">His name was Bart and he told me to look; he told me that there is reason my father and my brother survived in there someplace, perhaps in the camp.</span> <span id="s890">Without going into much detail, I never found out anything more beyond that except returning once with the group I found that my Uncle Melek survived and he’s now in the small ghetto.</span> <span id="s891">I went to him.</span> <span id="s892">He, in turn, told me that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother survived by hiding herself in a clothes chest and her sisters, three sisters.</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: These are your mother’s sisters from Plutz who were moved to the Warsaw Ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: Right.</span> <span id="s895">They survived and they were on U_______Sreet, not exactly where my uncle was.</span> <span id="s896">I went and found them and I lived there because there were also two kids in there, while I was working for this Vertafastak operation.</span> <span id="s897">This I did this until January, In January, I heard a rumor about cleaning up the umschlagplatz again so I went to the arbeizen which is the work office.</span> <span id="s898">I was sort of casing the joint as the word goes and I found out that another Luftwaffe guard came in with a Jewish foreman or leader and they were looking for volunteers.</span> <span id="s899">When I ascertained that they are not from Bilanie but from another place, from Orcencia which was the airport, the largest airfield to this day in Warsaw, I volunteered for this group.</span> <span id="s900">Also forced labor column and I was able to stay with my aunts and just go every morning to work.</span> <span id="s901">But when the action started and the Germans surrounded the ghetto on January 18th or 19th, 1943, I found myself in a dilemma-- – how to get -- the problem how to get out and rejoin the group and not get caught in the net, in the dragnet.</span> <span id="s902">Eventually through Visu_______ who is a friend of Mead who was an artist in the process of painting the picture of the commanding officer of the airport, he and his brother, and a few other fellows gathered that morning and a call was made to the Luftwaffe camp from the Polish precinct.</span> <span id="s903">Polish police and they sent guards and brought us there.</span> <span id="s904">There we were for a while until the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s905">In the interim, I made another foray to the Warsaw Ghetto with another guard to obtain some things from my uncle, some clothes he gave me.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Uncle Melek?</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: Uncle Melek.</span> <span id="s908">The book tells you about the details because I had a fight with him there.</span> <span id="s909">But this I felt that he was hoarding some stuff that he got from the shoe store and that he was not sharing it with me.</span> <span id="s910">Anyway, by that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in its residual stage, was in the final days of its existence.</span> <span id="s911">By that time, we didn’t know about it, but the resistance organization already was functioning.</span> <span id="s912">One of the things was when I visited my uncle under guard, from this Orcencia Luftwaffe camp, there was a shot fired.</span> <span id="s913">We run to the window and we found out that there were just two Jewish civilians that fired and killed one of the informers, Gestapo Jewish informer.</span> <span id="s914">You could see that the Germans didn’t interfere with it, they didn’t care.</span> <span id="s915">In April 18th or 19th, I think, the Passover marked the Warsaw Ghetto revolt which was a reaction to the German entry to the ghetto to start to “resettle”, to liquidate the ghetto.</span> <span id="s916">Also from Orcencia, some weapons were smuggled to the fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto.</span> <span id="s917">I didn’t know it, exactly how they did it and who was ---.</span> <span id="s918">I was not among the insiders.</span> <span id="s919">From our airfield, planes took off to bomb, firebomb the Warsaw Ghetto by the Luftwaffe and we knew about it.</span> <span id="s920">As the Warsaw Ghetto was going up in flames, rumors spread that they’re going to liquidate all the camps around Warsaw including the one where I was interned.</span> <span id="s921">It was a small camp, a little over 100 prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: It was run by the Luftwaffe?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: By the Luftwaffe.</span> <span id="s924">We were working at the airfield.</span> <span id="s925">There was a Yunkirst enterprise, a dismantling division of aircraft, shot down fighter planes over Germany that was brought in there.</span> <span id="s926">This is how the weapons got sometimes in the hands of the fighters.</span> <span id="s927">They were found in these planes.</span> <span id="s928">I think on May 12th, we were being, we were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto under guard.</span> <span id="s929">At that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in ruins but the fight was still going on.</span> <span id="s930">We were taken to the umschlagplatz and shipped to Majdanek.</span> <span id="s931">I didn’t know about it but we found out we were shipped to Majdanek, we decided not to jump the train, not to make any efforts, because we knew we were on a line that was not going to Treblinka; we established that point.</span> <span id="s932">But it turned out to be that we were slated to go to gas chambers anyway.</span> <span id="s933">In Majdanek, also there were gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">Q: But you didn’t know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s935">A: We didn’t know that then.</span> <span id="s936">My father perished in Majdanek; I didn’t know that then either.</span> <span id="s937">Because this was posthumously and after the war.</span> <span id="s938">Anyway I cannot tell you all the details because I would be getting too emotional as to what has happened on this trip but we were lucky that we were only -- by that time -- since what was coming was anticipated, about fourteen guys escaped from our camp.</span> <span id="s939">What was left was about 88 men because I remember when the Luftwaffe turned us over to the SS at the umschlagplatz, they said,________ they yelled.</span> <span id="s940">So they said_______.</span> <span id="s941">There was 88, this is how I remember there were 88.</span> <span id="s942">We lost one guy in the melee in Majdanek but we saved some other people that were behind us and were sent to a camp named Budzyn.</span> <span id="s943">There was a miraculous saving, something happened in there that was just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s944">I describe it in detail in my book and we were sent to Budzyn where there was an aircraft Heinkil Aircraft plant, probably the worst camp in the penal system as far as treatment went by one named Fikes.</span> <span id="s945">Reinhold Fikes was the commanding officer in the rank of a sergeant and he was an incarnation of cruelty and bestiality in what he dd.</span> <span id="s946">In that camp, I stayed about eleven months.</span> <span id="s947">This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp –became a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s948">The difference being that they put us in striped uniforms.</span> <span id="s949">Before we were wearing our civilian clothes.</span> <span id="s950">This was a time where I registered as a chemist, as an inventor and later on this resulted me working on this super-weapon development which didn’t turn out anything but it was a good vehicle to ride out the remaining months of the war.</span> <span id="s951">From that camp, we were sent to a camp called Plaszow near Cracow.</span> <span id="s952">From Plaszow, we were shipped to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s953">In Flossenburg, this group was really commissioned so to speak, really put to work in what was reputed to be a super weapon.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Is this the same group of 88.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s956">The 88 had nothing to do with it.</span> <span id="s957">There was a registry because we were sent to Budzyn ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: This is when you became a chemist?</span> <span id="s959">You were in another group?</span></p> <p><span id="s960">A: There was another group because the camp had over 2,000 people in Budzyn.</span> <span id="s961">This group was only maybe 50, 60 people large and it was an aggregate of people from different camps.</span> <span id="s962">Budzyn had a contingent in it; Plaszow picked up a few people.</span> <span id="s963">But eventually we were being set up in a sort of lab to work in, in Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s964">That’s where the real work went in.</span> <span id="s965">It was an unbelievable experience because I learned English working in this lab.</span> <span id="s966">There was nothing really for me to do.</span> <span id="s967">I found an English textbook and David Copperfield and I learned English, found a tutor as well, among the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s968">Q: A Jewish inmate?</span></p> <p><span id="s969">A: Yes, named Goldfarb who was teaching me grammar.</span> <span id="s970">But there was a group of prisoners who was actually working on plans for this device, as the Germans called apparatus.</span> <span id="s971">There were some rumors as to what it could do if it were successful in doing it.</span> <span id="s972">It fell into the realm of the semi-fantastic.</span> <span id="s973">I spoke once to my uncle who was a chemist, about it, and he says that what they propose to do could not be achieved.</span> <span id="s974">It was unobtainable but they thought it was.</span> <span id="s975">The Germans were not fools; they apparently were convinced that something could be done.</span> <span id="s976">This project was not such a local thing.</span> <span id="s977">We didn’t know about it at the time but it claimed the interest of the highest echelon of Nazi power.</span> <span id="s978">I have a telegram that came after my book went to print, which is addressed to Himmler to grant permission to move this group, which is essential to the war effort, this is German’s writing, a Jewish group essential to the war effort .</span> <span id="s979">Do you see the paradox in this?</span> <span id="s980">If we help them win the war, they’re going to exterminate all the Jews.</span> <span id="s981">To the war effort and I have a reply from Himmler’s office, from Himmler’s headquarters, that he grants permission and that the matter should be taken up with so-and-so to transfer the Jews, the scientists.</span> <span id="s982">So we’re working there.</span> <span id="s983">Eventually, when this project did not produce a mousetrap, it was disbanded and it was just a few weeks later that the Allies armies were already close to Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s984">I don’t know how close they were because I was on a death march for about three, close to four days.</span> <span id="s985">We were liberated in April by the 11th Armored Division and of course, then I realized what happened to the other members of my family.</span> <span id="s986">I knew already in the Warsaw Ghetto, from my Uncle Melek, whom I found after I came from The Orcencia; I met him after the Orcencia place, I was in his apartment.</span> <span id="s987">He told me that Uncle Ben is hiding on the Aryan side of the Warsaw Ghetto and that Rose, his wife, has Aryan papers, works for German industry.</span> <span id="s988">She hides him in her apartment.</span> <span id="s989">I found out that possibly that my Uncle Sevek, the orphan --cousin who lived -- one of the three orphans brought up in my grandparents’ home, is also some place in hiding but he didn’t know where.</span> <span id="s990">He didn’t know whether he is still in hiding or whether he perished.</span> <span id="s991">But beyond that all contact was lost and I have not learned of any details of any of my relatives except that I found out that my father, through_______ Tracing Bureau, they send me this document that I showed you just when you first came in -- that attested to the fact that my father lost his life in Majdanek on September 23, 1942.</span> <span id="s992">So my mother died in Treblinka in the first action, 1942, probably in August with my brother Meir.</span> <span id="s993">Now the only person that I don’t have a definite proof that was killed is my brother Szymon, to this day.</span> <span id="s994">Because all other perished.</span> <span id="s995">My grandmother, who saved herself from the first round-up in 1942, was probably shipped out in 1943 if she didn’t perish sooner, with her daughters, my aunts and with these two boys of the eldest daughter, Frania.</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: So your brother Szymon, the last we saw of him, he went back to the ghetto because he was homesick?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: And he was staying with your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: With the family, at home.</span> <span id="s1000">Now --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: But he didn’t go with your mother and the other brother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1002">A: No, he didn’t go with my mother.</span> <span id="s1003">This much I have learned.</span> <span id="s1004">Also I have learned -- of course after liberation I have received, I have overheard conversation between liberated prisoners like myself, that there was a Topas in Prague, in Czechoslovakia, in Roxy Hotel where refugees converged.</span> <span id="s1005">I immediately -- I was at that time with the United States Army; I was in the CIC corp, Counter intelligence Corp.</span> <span id="s1006">I was one of the most fortunate of prisoners that I was allowed still to fight.</span> <span id="s1007">I was with the 104th regiment of the 26th division with the Third Army.</span> <span id="s1008">After the war, I was attached to a CIC unit in Nuremberg, in the town that you mentioned before, stationed in Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1009">I found out that my uncle survived; Uncle Ben survived and I also later on found out that he fought in the Polish uprising of 1944.</span> <span id="s1010">But Andros was shipped with the Polish people to Germany because all Warsaw was emptied out of people.</span> <span id="s1011">They were sent either to concentration camps or forced labor.</span> <span id="s1012">He was sent to farm work.</span> <span id="s1013">He remained on the ruins of Warsaw and lived from what he -- like a scavenger.</span> <span id="s1014">I sent somebody, a friend of mine who also figures prominently in my book, to bring him.</span> <span id="s1015">He brought him -- he went to the Russian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we had a reunion and we met.</span> <span id="s1016">Then I sent another prisoner to bring his wife from the British zone.</span> <span id="s1017">I found out that she was in Castle because my grandmother’s letter told me this after I resumed contact with her.</span> <span id="s1018">She sent me food packages and money and so forth</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: So your Uncle managed to survive midst the ruins of Warsaw until January ’45 and then he was liberated by the Russians and then at the end of the war --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: He went to Czechoslovakia.</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">Q: He went to Czechoslovakia and you saw him again?</span></p> <p><span id="s1022">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1023">He was searching relatives.</span> <span id="s1024">He wanted to get possible --.</span> <span id="s1025">I don’t know what he intended to do but he found out ---.</span> <span id="s1026">Then he told me about Sevek, that he also survived and that he went to Israel, he and his wife, Rita.</span> <span id="s1027">They were childless and he was already by that time, in his forties.</span> <span id="s1028">Sevek, the cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: He survived in the ghetto, in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">A: No.</span> <span id="s1031">He went into hiding.</span> <span id="s1032">There’s an interesting story.</span> <span id="s1033">He used to work for our company.</span> <span id="s1034">All the orphans, the three orphans worked for our company but he married one of the pretty salesgirls from our company.</span> <span id="s1035">He separated himself from us and he opened his own store of custom made shoes, a smaller --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: This was a non-Jewish wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: No, no, a Jewish wife, a salesgirl, right.</span> <span id="s1038">Her name was Rita, a very attractive girl.</span> <span id="s1039">They established themselves a few streets away from us, with a shoe store.</span> <span id="s1040">When the war broke out, he gave all of the goods to one of the Polish-- his Polish salesgirls.</span> <span id="s1041">That Polish salesgirl took it to her own home and she would be selling, periodically, some of the leather or leather goods and bringing them money to live on, to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1042">She would be going back and forth.</span> <span id="s1043">But later on, established through her contact, they established a liaison with one of the Polish underground operators from the Socialist Party who were more friendly towards – well--disposed to the Jews --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: The People’s Guard?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Whatever.</span> <span id="s1046">But it was not so altruistic.</span> <span id="s1047">What happened is this; that he had in a place called Ramburtoof, I believe.</span> <span id="s1048">I’m not absolutely certain because it had two names in Polish names of the town that sound the same.</span> <span id="s1049">When I went to visit Poland I was searching for the people that hid him in the wrong town because of the similarity of names.</span> <span id="s1050">He had his wife living there -- it was like a suburban town of Warsaw and a daughter and son which were already in their late teens.</span> <span id="s1051">But he also had a lover in Warsaw where he worked so he couldn’t support two of them.</span> <span id="s1052">By getting my uncle Sevek, my cousin Sevek and his wife to hide, he got income for them so they didn’t have to depend on my pay.</span> <span id="s1053">He could live with his lover and they supplied the income for his wife and kids, for the two children.</span> <span id="s1054">He was in hiding there until liberated by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1055">He was there for seventeen months living mainly under the floorboards of their bedroom or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: So his liberation also was in January of ‘45 or earlier?</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Even earlier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Because he’s on the other side of the river?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Right, he was on the east side of the river.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: So we know that much about the town.</span> <span id="s1061">It was to the east?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1063">And something about Sevek.</span> <span id="s1064">He was a very friendly guy.</span> <span id="s1065">When I was growing up, I was a kid., he was already almost 20 years old.</span> <span id="s1066">He had a way with the kids, always a smile on his face.</span> <span id="s1067">You were never told that he had a hard life, that he was an orphan; he was not embittered by it and he didn’t have any chip on his shoulder.</span> <span id="s1068">He would spend a lot of time with the kids and play around, clown to entertain us, and so forth.</span> <span id="s1069">I was very happy to hear that he survived.</span> <span id="s1070">Then, of course, I visited him to find out how he survived.</span> <span id="s1071">That’s why I’m able to tell you that.</span> <span id="s1072">He went to Israel; now he’s in Germany, really.</span> <span id="s1073">Because his wife couldn’t find work in Israel and there were hardships at the beginning.</span> <span id="s1074">They went to Israel when it was still Palestine, before Independence.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: So he settled in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">A: He was settled there; he was there maybe for two or three years.</span> <span id="s1077">Then his wife wanted to go to France to find a job for him and for her and she couldn’t.</span> <span id="s1078">She couldn’t get permission to reside there so she went to Germany, unfortunate.</span> <span id="s1079">This is where he is today.</span> <span id="s1080">He is already 83 years old.</span> <span id="s1081">Now about my brother Szymon.</span> <span id="s1082">In 1989, my wife, in company of my wife, my friend Mark, his wife, Bea, and their two sons, we embark on a trip of memory lane.</span> <span id="s1083">To go back to Poland after 50 years absence and to Israel on our way back and Germany.</span> <span id="s1084">I also stop in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: To see --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">A: To see Flossenburg -- and Sevek.</span> <span id="s1087">We went together to visit Flossenburg.</span> <span id="s1088">Now when we visit Poland, we realize that we are going to be there only six days or seven days.</span> <span id="s1089">Our time was of essence there, so we preplanned exactly what we are going to ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">(End of Side A, Tape 11) We arranged for two chauffeurs and two limos, two cars to take us around so we don’t depend on the regular tourist conveyance top see the places.</span> <span id="s1091">Because there were specific places that the itinerary for our visit to Poland was planned in advance and it was very compact.</span> <span id="s1092">We had to crowd many things into a very short space -- so that when we arrived in Warsaw, we had two limos already when we arrived at the airport to pick us up, to take us to the hotel and the following morning, we started our visit.</span> <span id="s1093">Of course my visit included first of all the city of Warsaw itself, the ghetto monument, the site of our apartment building in the Warsaw Ghetto, which building had been erased, had been destroyed during the uprising or possibly after the uprising, perhaps in the Polish revolt which was in 1944.</span> <span id="s1094">It included visits to my childhood place of Shaboruf where I -- to remember the villa that belonged to my grandparents, perhaps still does, where we spent summers in my childhood days.</span> <span id="s1095">Then we went to Majdanek, we visit in the Lublin district.</span> <span id="s1096">I see also the city of Lublin which I had memory because I knew a family there and a girl that perished in Poland.</span> <span id="s1097">Then we went to places of____________ that was of interest to my friend Mark.</span> <span id="s1098">We went, I think that this is what we did in the course of time.</span> <span id="s1099">We still had Warsaw, increments of Warsaw that were to be seen, for instance, the Warsaw cemetery that we didn‘t have time.</span> <span id="s1100">I don’t know on which day but I think on one day, perhaps it was Sunday, the following Sunday of our arrival, that we decided to split because Mark had his own itinerary with his car to see Radom and I wanted to see my mother’s hometown of Plutz.</span> <span id="s1101">We went to Plutz and we have seen what there was to see.</span> <span id="s1102">The synagogue was destroyed but the buildings were still there.</span> <span id="s1103">I seen my grandparents’ home, apartment, which was very, very small and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: The opposite of luxurious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Of what we were used to in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1106">After seeing all these places and the Vistula River and whatever I could associate with the past, we went to see.</span> <span id="s1107">.</span> <span id="s1108">Then we had a very intelligent driver and driving back to Warsaw I realized that in spite of our frugality in using time economically, in disposing of time, we were coming early.</span> <span id="s1109">I said to myself, I looked at my watch and I think it was something like 4:30 p.m. and the days in late August were very long.</span> <span id="s1110">I said to the driver, I said, do we have time to see another place in the vicinity of Warsaw?</span> <span id="s1111">Which really was not on schedule.</span> <span id="s1112">But it suddenly occurred to me that the last three summers, we did not go to our villa in Shorboruf, but we went to Oralie a village called Oralie which was kind of a summer resort and also a farming community.</span> <span id="s1113">I was there in the summer of ’37 and ’38 and my family was there also in the summer of ’39.</span> <span id="s1114">Because in ’38 in the middle of the summer, I was sent to the agricultural school as you recall.</span> <span id="s1115">I said, it would be interesting to see because I would be able to see the very cottage where we stayed in.</span> <span id="s1116">I asked my wife and she consented and the driver said, by all means, he was gung-ho.</span> <span id="s1117">We directed because it was in the vicinity of Warsaw, it would not take us more than maybe half an hour out of the way, counting both ways.</span> <span id="s1118">We had some difficulty finding our way to the place, to recognize and so forth.</span> <span id="s1119">Finally, some people told me which building it is that I probably was in that summer.</span> <span id="s1120">I came by that building with the car and I look at that building and I say, no this is not the building, it doesn’t have veranda.</span> <span id="s1121">We turn around and went back to the beginning of the street of the village when one of the properties -- a woman, elderly lady told us that this is the building.</span> <span id="s1122">I say this is not the building.</span> <span id="s1123">She says this is the building.</span> <span id="s1124">I spoke to her in Polish.</span> <span id="s1125">She says this is the building, she insisted, persisted rather.</span> <span id="s1126">I said, where’s the veranda?</span> <span id="s1127">She says it was removed.</span> <span id="s1128">That can confuse you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">Q: So you were both right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: I asked her and she took us there.</span> <span id="s1131">It turned out to be she was a sister-in-law of the landlady of the building named Levandofska.</span> <span id="s1132">Mr. Levandofsky was, of course, the landlord.</span> <span id="s1133">When I was there, she was a woman in her twenties.</span> <span id="s1134">Now she was nearly 80 years old.</span> <span id="s1135">She was sitting there; it looked like a rocking chair in the house.</span> <span id="s1136">The lady that brought us in said you have guests in here.</span> <span id="s1137">The guests being my wife, the driver and myself.</span> <span id="s1138">We came in, we looked at her, and I began to orient myself there that this is the building in which we stayed.</span> <span id="s1139">This was a building that -- there were three families in the summer that shared that building.</span> <span id="s1140">I’m repeating something that you can find in my book but I can probably tell you this in a greater detail than you will find in my book.</span> <span id="s1141">I say Mrs. Levandofska; she didn’t know who I was but they knew that we are tourists and that we were probably from America and I spoke Polish.</span> <span id="s1142">Many Poles returned back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1143">I said to her, do you remember who lived in this -- who was vacationing here in the summer, who occupied this building in the summer of 1938, ’39?</span> <span id="s1144">She looked and just stared at me without saying anything like gathering her thoughts.</span> <span id="s1145">Of course, I couldn’t figure what were her thoughts.</span> <span id="s1146">I went one step further and I said, do you remember who was in this apartment?</span> <span id="s1147">Pointing to one of the doors.</span> <span id="s1148">She said Lasolta.</span> <span id="s1149">I said it was a Polish pilot, the family who lived there.</span> <span id="s1150">So she says Lasolta.</span> <span id="s1151">She remembered that name.</span> <span id="s1152">I pointed to another door and she mentioned the other family.</span> <span id="s1153">Then I didn’t say anything for a moment.</span> <span id="s1154">Then I said, wasn’t a Jewish family here also in this apartment here?</span> <span id="s1155">Pointing to the last one.</span> <span id="s1156">She says, yes, Topas.</span> <span id="s1157">She said, Mr. Topas, very sympathetic man, and Mrs. Topas, very nice lady.</span> <span id="s1158">And they had two children.</span> <span id="s1159">The oldest was Yurik and the younger was Szymon, another baby too?</span> <span id="s1160">Oh yeah, Meirick.</span> <span id="s1161">That’s Meir.</span> <span id="s1162">She told them that my father was very good to them.</span> <span id="s1163">He brought gifts, shoes for the family in addition to whatever they paid for the rent.</span> <span id="s1164">She volunteered a few things.</span> <span id="s1165">I said to her I was very pleased.</span> <span id="s1166">We took some photographs.</span> <span id="s1167">I thought the audience was over and I already exchanged some dollars for Polish money which power of dollars was tremendous.</span> <span id="s1168">I was going to give her a few thousand of the Polish zloty which were not very much in American money but I felt that I took her time and so forth.</span> <span id="s1169">I felt that I would do it just as a friendly gesture.</span> <span id="s1170">But just about when I thought that the whole interview was over, she began to shake in her chair.</span> <span id="s1171">She says, Szymonik, such a well-built boy, a pleasant boy, didn’t look Jewish.</span> <span id="s1172">He came here from the Warsaw Ghetto in the summer of 1942, I think.</span> <span id="s1173">He asked me to save him, to shelter him, to hide him.</span> <span id="s1174">I wanted to do it, I really wanted to do it.</span> <span id="s1175">But we were afraid because the trains were going from Warsaw to Treblinka on the track that was stopping in our Ourland during the normal rides and the Jews were jumping off the trains.</span> <span id="s1176">There was a gendarme named Stein who was looking for them here.</span> <span id="s1177">I was afraid that if I’m going to hide him, the neighbors will snitch on me and then we’re all going to be killed.</span> <span id="s1178">So I said to Szymonik, let my husband take you to the next village.</span> <span id="s1179">Maybe you can be a shepherd there to cows, that sort of thing.</span> <span id="s1180">Szymon, my brother, at that time was about fourteen years old.</span> <span id="s1181">But he didn’t want to go.</span> <span id="s1182">He says he doesn’t know there anybody.</span> <span id="s1183">But, and she repeated it again.</span> <span id="s1184">He told me that his grandmother lives in America, is in America.</span> <span id="s1185">I immediately presumed that he said that to make her understand that if she does this, if she takes the risk, that she would be rewarded for it, after the war.</span> <span id="s1186">I ask her, Mrs. Levandoska, then what happened?</span> <span id="s1187">Did he leave?</span> <span id="s1188">She said, well maybe he stayed here a day or two, a few days and then he left.</span> <span id="s1189">I said did you hear anything about him?</span> <span id="s1190">She said no.</span> <span id="s1191">I had right away a premonition that he must have perished not far from this point because he came in and although he didn’t look Jewish, but he was a kid and he was scared.</span> <span id="s1192">You realize that every Jew just by virtue of being Jewish, had a price tag on his life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: And he was in an area where they were hunting for Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s1194">A: And a Polish peasant who turned in a Jew could get a bottle of vodka and two pounds of sugar and maybe a hundred zlotys.</span> <span id="s1195">So there was a reward, just as there was punishment for hiding the Jews, there was a reward for turning them in.</span> <span id="s1196">He might have been turned in by Polish people; he might have made it back to the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1197">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1198">When she came to the end, she was very sad.</span> <span id="s1199">She realized that I’m a relative but she didn’t know who I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: She still didn’t know who you are?</span></p> <p><span id="s1201">A: I told her that I’m Yurik, that I survived the war.</span> <span id="s1202">I joined the American army, fought to the war’s end, and came to America.</span> <span id="s1203">My grandmother lived in America at the time, until 1969, when she died here in Lakewood.</span> <span id="s1204">She’s buried in Lakewood.</span> <span id="s1205">But I still gave her the money.</span> <span id="s1206">She didn’t want to accept the money.</span> <span id="s1207">Why are you giving money?</span> <span id="s1208">I didn’t save your brother, she said.</span> <span id="s1209">Oh well, you wanted to save him.</span> <span id="s1210">Then it seemed like there was nothing more.</span> <span id="s1211">I was pretty -- right now I can speak about it without being as shaken up as I was at the time when it happened and when I repeated it the first time or two, but now it’s in the book.</span> <span id="s1212">Then I said -- I just thought for a moment -- I said do you have any photographs of before the war?</span> <span id="s1213">So they brought in an album of photographs before the war.</span> <span id="s1214">I scanned through the photographs and seen the building, I seen Mr. Landofsky who, incidentally, was laying paralyzed from the waist down in bed next door in the room where we were talking.</span> <span id="s1215">I didn’t see anything.</span> <span id="s1216">I was hoping that maybe they photographed our family, which for me, would have been priceless but they didn’t have any.</span> <span id="s1217">There were some loose photographs that were just bunched up in the bottom of -- the end of the album.</span> <span id="s1218">I went through these photographs.</span> <span id="s1219">I found a photograph of Adolph Hitler.</span> <span id="s1220">.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">Q: That tells you something?</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">A: It was really confusing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">Q: Was there any writing on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1224">A: No writing.</span> <span id="s1225">It was just like a post card, a picture of Adolph Hitler.</span> <span id="s1226">The driver had seen this with me and I just didn’t say anything about it.</span> <span id="s1227">I just shut and closed the album and we left.</span> <span id="s1228">When we get in the car, I was confused but I realized that her husband must have been a Hitler sympathizer.</span> <span id="s1229">That she might have, I feel that she was an earnest person, an earnest woman because she didn’t have to tell me anything.</span> <span id="s1230">She didn’t have to tell me that he came back there to save her, that he came from the Warsaw Ghetto, had to risk his life and get out.</span> <span id="s1231">Came to her and asked her to be kept in there .</span> <span id="s1232">She didn’t have to volunteer any of that; I didn’t ask her.</span> <span id="s1233">She did tell me this so she -- maybe she had good intentions.</span> <span id="s1234">She wanted to save him but maybe her husband was opposed to it.</span> <span id="s1235">He might have been an admirer of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">Q: Or even if he weren’t, he could have opposed it for other reasons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">A: They had reasons but what shall I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">Q: It’s hard to imagine a real Pole being an admirer of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">A: Well there was admiration for ---.</span> <span id="s1240">Until Hitler turning on to Poland.</span> <span id="s1241">There was a tremendous admiration for Germany because of their policy towards the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Considering what they were doing to Poland, that would not have been very patriotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Yes, it would not be patriotic and perhaps it is to their credit, of the Poles, that they didn’t have many collaborators against their own people that we know of.</span> <span id="s1244">They didn’t have many collaborators towards their own people.</span> <span id="s1245">But many among them were very vicious anti-Semites and we were talking about all these people.</span> <span id="s1246">I didn’t mention to you, the Rosenbaums who are in my book, a beautiful girl -- and her mother were hidden.</span> <span id="s1247">They were in Lublin.</span> <span id="s1248">I met them -- I got to know them during the war in Lublin when I was staying there.</span> <span id="s1249">My father was there.</span> <span id="s1250">You remember when I told you we met.</span> <span id="s1251">Later on I got a post card that she is hiding.</span> <span id="s1252">I told you I was still in Warsaw Ghetto when they went into hiding on a farm by a fellow named Sty________ in Sm________, Ko__________ in Poland.</span> <span id="s1253">It was not until maybe five years ago that a widow of the son of the owner, who told me that both women were killed by people other than the Germans.</span> <span id="s1254">She didn’t say so but she says they were killed because of their possessions.</span> <span id="s1255">They went out in the middle of the night with valises having their valuables with them, no doubt, and he says, you know that there was no shortage of vile people during the war and they were shot and buried in the woods nearby.</span> <span id="s1256">This is something I have to return to because I didn’t have a chance to visit Sm____________ where possibly the burial ground is.</span> <span id="s1257">I don’t think that the grave was marked.</span> <span id="s1258">But this is where they were shot and they were shot by Poles.</span> <span id="s1259">My brother Szymon, is still an enigma even in spite of any premonition I have.</span> <span id="s1260">There was an interesting development that is almost anti-climatic to everything we are talking about.</span> <span id="s1261">My wife, first, and then my son visiting Israel went to a cavern which is on the border of Lebanon and Israel.</span> <span id="s1262">The cavern is a tourist attraction and they seen on the wall, the name of Simon Topas.</span> <span id="s1263">It’s a Simon Topas spelled exactly, not with a “z” but with an “s”, Topas.</span> <span id="s1264">Silemonca Spain, familia Topas, familia Simon Topas Silemonca Spain.</span> <span id="s1265">I have -- just as I talk to you I just thought -- why I’m not able to find anything about this family.</span> <span id="s1266">Because I’m asking for the telephone number of Simon Topas at the Silemonca operator in Spain.</span> <span id="s1267">I wrote to the Red Cross and to the post office.</span> <span id="s1268">He said the family of Simon Topas which means, if it were my brother, in the unlikely event, it is not he who wrote this --scribbled that name-- but maybe his son or his daughter who marked this in order to look for someone.</span> <span id="s1269">The name could be -- the first name could be different.</span> <span id="s1270">And if it was a daughter who was married and took another family name.</span> <span id="s1271">I think, in Spain, it works in reverse, the men assume the wife’s -- the family assumes the wife’s last name</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Yes, they use both.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: They use both.</span> <span id="s1274">So this is still an unresolved kink but it’s very unlikely.</span> <span id="s1275">Once I got excited, I found in Israel, Szymon Topas, in a missing persons bureau in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1276">I immediately sent a telegram there and the guy was nice enough to send me a telegram back that he assumed the name Topas after coming from Russia to Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1277">Q: Plus it would be inconceivable that he wouldn’t be looking for you, for others?</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">A: That id true.</span> <span id="s1279">I am still going to check out the Silemonca, Spain –</span></p> <p><span id="s1280">Q: You have to ?</span></p> <p><span id="s1281">A: Yeah, I have to.</span> <span id="s1282">This is because we are -- we have so little and we are hanging on to a straw.</span> <span id="s1283">This is very, very weak indication but I’m saying to myself, who would come, who would be interested in coming to Israel?</span> <span id="s1284">Although non-Jews come to Israel and all the tourists, Jewish and non-Jewish like to see all the tourist attractions.</span> <span id="s1285">Besides the religious aspect, there are non-sectarians so to speak.</span> <span id="s1286">Certainly a cavern is something that interests everybody.</span> <span id="s1287">Could be a Morano</span></p> <p><span id="s1288">Q: No, I wouldn’t have expected you to be descendants of Sephardim from ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: But we are.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: You are?</span> <span id="s1291">From 1492?</span></p> <p><span id="s1292">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1293">According to a distant relative who married my grandmother and comes from Warsaw, a fellow named Max Muskowitz, told me that our family originates in Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1294">Q: Were they expelled in 1492 or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1295">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1296">There was a choice then, to convert or be expelled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1297">Q: In fact the anniversary was just celebrated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: Yes, 500th anniversary.</span> <span id="s1299">I was in Spain but this was before I knew about the ---.</span> <span id="s1300">I was with my wife in Spain but this was before I know about the sign in the cavern.</span> <span id="s1301">I have a photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">Q: How did the family get to Poland from Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">A: I think that the Spanish Jews, when they moved out of Spain, there was such a tremendous flood, that it was exile, that they were moving westward.</span> <span id="s1304">Some of them wound up in France, some went as far as Germany, Italy.</span> <span id="s1305">Italy already had some Jews from before that existed from the destruction of, even before the destruction of the Temple, was a very old community there.</span> <span id="s1306">Then in the 1500’s, the Polish king, Kazmir the Great, thought that the Jews would be good for the development of the country which was backward and invited the Jews to come.</span> <span id="s1307">Gave them their – they became King’s subjects living under his protection.</span> <span id="s1308">So the beginning was very, you might say, idyllic but it didn’t continue very long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: We have any further reflections on this experience?</span> <span id="s1310">Your family was in the middle of the worst part of the Holocaust, Warsaw in Poland.</span> <span id="s1311">Some survived, beginning with your grandmother, others --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: She was lucky that she was sent -- in that sense she was lucky that she was sent to America.</span> <span id="s1313">My uncle owes his survival in a very plain sense to my aunt, to his wife Rose, who hid him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: All of you who survived, to some extent, were helped by your grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s1315">A: Yes, to a very great extent, because we couldn’t get as far as we did if it were not for her help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1316">Q: You had the foresight, for whatever reasons, to send to your new career, temporary career to be sure, as a farmer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1317">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">Q: I also noticed in your story, that it seemed that at several junctures your path took you to Lublin?</span> <span id="s1319">Not voluntarily every time but ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1321">Lublin figures very prominently in my memory, First of all, if this is not apparent in my book, I want you to know that Lublin Jewry was one of the most hospitable communities I have known.</span> <span id="s1322">They took such great care of the refugees and they were inundated with people during the blitz of 1939.</span> <span id="s1323">When we came there from this agricultural school, we went to the synagogue and we were living there.</span> <span id="s1324">People were bringing us meals like regular meals.</span> <span id="s1325">They took it as a responsibility on themselves.</span> <span id="s1326">They did it with a very pleasant demeanor and very graciously.</span> <span id="s1327">My father, when I met with my father, one of the family offered us a place to stay.</span> <span id="s1328">So I didn’t have to sleep in the synagogue anymore on the hard bench.</span> <span id="s1329">I went and stayed with my father.</span> <span id="s1330">Of course, the Rosenbaum family became like a family away from the family.</span> <span id="s1331">I did have a romantic notion about the girl that figures in the book, Gina, although prematurely probably, but definitely ---.</span> <span id="s1332">I idealized her because she was such a pretty and smart girl and talented too.</span> <span id="s1333">She could play piano.</span> <span id="s1334">I taught her how to play chess and she right away, beat me.</span> <span id="s1335">We were there during the war.</span> <span id="s1336">I was there probably from -- I knew her from September 12th, I think, the day that I came to Lublin until we left for Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1337">Then, of course, I was drawn back there under the pretext that I want to go to the Russian zone and my parents didn’t object.</span> <span id="s1338">I came back to Lublin already under German occupation and I was again welcomed and hospitality was extended to me by the Rosenbaums.</span> <span id="s1339">Then, the next time was when I was being taken to this farm work.</span> <span id="s1340">You remember, when I was a volunteer, for the harvest, I also got to see Gina.</span> <span id="s1341">Later on when I got fever, I got sick, and came back to Lublin, I was shown again hospitality.</span> <span id="s1342">They brought me, they really cared for me and nursed me there when I was very sick.</span> <span id="s1343">I got measles at seventeen, is no fun.</span> <span id="s1344">It’s not fun at any time but not then.</span> <span id="s1345">But being a contagious sickness, they were very kind that they wanted to do this.</span> <span id="s1346">At one time, my brother, when he came out to see me in those estates, he also stopped over there in Lublin and was shown hospitality there.</span> <span id="s1347">Very kind people and they all perished.</span> <span id="s1348">The father died during the Lublin occupation days, probably from ill health but the mother and daughter, Gina, the girl that I knew, they were shot in cold blood.</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: An aisle of beauty in a harsh world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: She was very remarkable.</span> <span id="s1351">I had to really condense in the book, I couldn’t express all my sentiment and the feeling for them that was much greater.</span> <span id="s1352">I felt that sometimes you say more by understating it than if you were to try and pour it all out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">Q: Believe me, it shows.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: It shows.</span> <span id="s1355">Because I felt that the intelligent reader will see; this will be like a soldier who goes into battle___________ what great things he did there.</span> <span id="s1356">It is not so much that it would reflect on me but it is not necessary to emphasize the qualities because they are -- you can easily conclude that these were fine people and very dear to me.</span> <span id="s1357">As a matter of fact, I had a photograph of Gina and I think I had a photograph of her mother too, that I carried with me all through my internment in Pilani and Ocencia and Budzyn.</span> <span id="s1358">But when we came to Majdanek, they took everything away from me.</span> <span id="s1359">They took every vestige of your personal life so that when they dress you up in those striped uniforms and the wooden shoes, you didn’t have anything tangible which would connect you with the past except your memory.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: I knew you didn’t have a photo of her because I knew that if you did, she would be in the ID project.</span></p> <p><span id="s1361">A: She would be a very good candidate.</span> <span id="s1362">I think that perhaps this is just my suspicious mind perhaps but I think that her beauty had something to do with her undoing.</span> <span id="s1363">Because I know something of the man who was the son of the owner who was already a married man only he stayed there; that something like this, especially a vulgar individual, that this would not escape his attention, that this might have been the reason they were forced to run away from the farm.</span> <span id="s1364">Whoever killed them were either the people that had something to do with the farm or someone tipped them off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Poles in any case?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">A: Yes, in that case, Poles.</span> <span id="s1367">You know Poles were capable of many admirable things on individual basis.</span> <span id="s1368">There were some exceptional cases like this salesgirl in Sevek’s store, this Loja.</span> <span id="s1369">Her name is Loja and she did a remarkable service to them because she, when they were already in hiding in this place called Tr__________ and I hope I got that right, she had to bring, every month money for ---.</span> <span id="s1370">They couldn’t pay in advance because then they would take the money and their life would not be -- the life would not be safe.</span> <span id="s1371">I mean you cannot say in every case, but it happened many times when the Jews came in and gave everything to the owners and then the owners gave them away anyway after they kept the money.</span> <span id="s1372">So here she was coming in every month to bring the money.</span> <span id="s1373">She was also going and buying produce for the family, for the whole family, vegetables because they did not want to arouse suspicion in the local store.</span> <span id="s1374">They suddenly buy so much when they were buying much less without these people.</span> <span id="s1375">So they had to go some distance away to another town, to a big town to buy the produce and food for the household.</span> <span id="s1376">Hi story is a book in itself.</span> <span id="s1377">How they made the hiding place; he told me, for instance, that they had to saw the boards off the floor.</span> <span id="s1378">They were on the ground floor and there was just a dugout beneath.</span> <span id="s1379">It was not deep enough to really live there so they had to do two things.</span> <span id="s1380">They had to saw and sawing makes noise.</span> <span id="s1381">There were people living directly above them.</span> <span id="s1382">How would they do it?</span> <span id="s1383">The daughter of this woman where they stayed played piano, perhaps the mother.</span> <span id="s1384">She played piano very loud piece while he was sawing the boards, loud piece.</span> <span id="s1385">Then they had to find out how they were going to get rid of the sand that they dig up.</span> <span id="s1386">This is always shown in those escape pictures when they fantasize about it or they take it in their pants.</span> <span id="s1387">It had to go out with the garbage pail, had to go to the garbage.</span> <span id="s1388">I think they also -- he told me something about coal being there where they used some of that sand.</span> <span id="s1389">They had a coal bin someplace that was accessible to them.</span> <span id="s1390">At one time, the Germans came in to this apartment, officers and they requisitioned one room.</span> <span id="s1391">The room was next room where they were down in the bottom.</span> <span id="s1392">They, my cousin Sevek, he regarded this as an insurance that the Germans lived there.</span> <span id="s1393">No other German detachment will come and search the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">Q: They would be above suspicion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">A: They would be above suspicion and they stayed there.</span> <span id="s1396">But it put great restraint on them because usually --.</span> <span id="s1397">He told me that during the wintertime, they would be sitting in a dugout but at night, they went to bed.</span> <span id="s1398">In other words, there was like one spare bed.</span> <span id="s1399">The only people that knew that they existed there was the mother, the wife of the guy that arranged this, this is the fellow that was from the Polish underground with the Socialist party and he was working in a transportation department in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s1400">His wife, the housekeeper and the daughter and the son.</span> <span id="s1401">The son worked for the Germans in one of the warehouses and he was stealing.</span> <span id="s1402">At one time they came and arrested him and he disappeared without a trace, took him to Auschwitz, maybe they killed him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Q: If they knew he was stealing certainly they would ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: It was very stupid of him especially if since they had someone there.</span> <span id="s1405">What if they started searching the house for stolen goods and they would find the place?</span> <span id="s1406">Because they had it cut out and it was covered with a little carpet rug and this is how they lived.</span> <span id="s1407">Very interesting the way they had to arrange; everything had to be thought out.</span> <span id="s1408">All the time, during the daytime, he would standing by the window and looking out who is coming through the gate.</span> <span id="s1409">Whenever he seen – because this was not a single family dwelling, it was like a quadruplex and there were others living on the second floor, but he had to see who comes to the main entrance of the apartment.</span> <span id="s1410">Always watching, if it was a stranger right away he and his wife had to go, get the underneath.</span> <span id="s1411">My uncle lived the same way because he was in my aunt’s apartment but she had a dormer apartment so there was a false, there was a wall, and between the wall and a pitched roof.</span> <span id="s1412">There was airspace.</span> <span id="s1413">What they do, they cut out an opening and there was a mirror that had four special attachment points.</span> <span id="s1414">Every time that he suspected, heard steps on the stairway or something, he had to jump into that -- behind that mirror where they had a chair to sit on and just secure the mirror and hope that nobody gets wise to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">Q: But in Warsaw, this was not possible.</span> <span id="s1416">Warsaw was infinitely more dangerous.</span> <span id="s1417">Apparently the only time it was possible to hide was after the destruction of the ghetto and after the defeat of the Polish rebellion, talking about your uncle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: Yes, he was involved in the revolution.</span> <span id="s1419">He came out of hiding and he fought with them.</span> <span id="s1420">But after it was crushed and all the Polish people were shipped to concentration camps or labor camps, Warsaw was virtually emptied of people, there were people like my uncle who lived like scavengers on the ruins of the --.</span> <span id="s1421">Because after emptying Warsaw, Hitler gave orders to destroy Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Raze the quarter?</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1424">So Warsaw was a --they claimed it was something like 65%, all the buildings were then destroyed, or 60%.</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: No matter how resourceful a person had been, they had hidden, they still would not have survived, given that type of ---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">A: As long as they were deep underground, literally underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">Q: There would be a food problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">A: A food problem.</span> <span id="s1429">This is why -- he had to out --they were going usually at night because the place was completely abandoned.</span> <span id="s1430">Occasionally a patrol would pass by, then they would hide.</span> <span id="s1431">But he lived there from the end of the uprising which was probably, the uprising was in August---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Beginning of October, it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: It was over so from the beginning of October until January when the Russians crossed the Vistula River onto the west bank to Warsaw, he led this kind of existence.</span> <span id="s1434">This apparently caused his premature death because he died being about 65 in California and he died of some kind of liver ailment which might have been caused by the garbage that he had to eat at one time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: If you had to tell of the worst memory that you have, the worst experience that you had, what would it be?</span> <span id="s1436">In Warsaw, in camps and so forth?</span></p> <p><span id="s1437">A: My God, there were so many.</span> <span id="s1438">Of course, I was flogged but this was not the worst.</span> <span id="s1439">The worst experience happened in Majdanek, I think.</span> <span id="s1440">When we arrived there, we were shipped from the Luftwaffe camp, Canjan were taken to Majdanek and on this train ride we were debating what to do.</span> <span id="s1441">Most of us were young men; there were a few fathers among the young men that were with their sons in that group.</span> <span id="s1442">We were fortunate that we were only 88 to a boxcar, where else there were about twice that number that they packed in others.</span> <span id="s1443">Many people perished just from suffocation when they --.</span> <span id="s1444">We were debating what we should do, whether we should break out.</span> <span id="s1445">The train left about, with our contingent, about noontime, perhaps shortly before noon and was just meandering through the various places as it was going.</span> <span id="s1446">We said like this, that if it is going to go in Treblinka, we have nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1447">We are just going to have to escape.</span> <span id="s1448">I know that there were people there already working on the floor0boards, trying to see if we could -- a novel way of escape trying to get out from the floor boards rather than the windows that were normally used.</span> <span id="s1449">They worked at it.</span> <span id="s1450">I don’t think that they did get very far with this operation because within 15 or 20 minutes we found out that we are on a line to Lublin, not Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1451">We felt that perhaps we are being taken to another labor camp.</span> <span id="s1452">We didn’t know that besides Auschwitz and Treblinka that there are so many death camps, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1453">We didn’t know, maybe we didn’t want to know.</span> <span id="s1454">We heard about the camps, like Sobibor.</span> <span id="s1455">Once this was found out, so the attitude changed and the despair that dominated the mood in the boxcar subsided and they say maybe we are going to the camp.</span> <span id="s1456">People sort of tried to slide down because we couldn’t -- there was not enough room for everyone to sit or lie down but if everybody lean against everyone, somehow, the body sort of, like sardines, we were able to manage to be down where we could get some rest.</span> <span id="s1457">Everybody got very thirsty because the boxcars, the sun beat on them and it was hot.</span> <span id="s1458">There was a fellow there with a bottle of water, He took out the bottle of water that he had the presence of mind to take with him.</span> <span id="s1459">We had bread that we took with us, our rations, but we didn’t think of water, we did not think of that -- we didn’t think of it, we didn’t anticipate that it would be needed here, a big bottle of water.</span> <span id="s1460">He was going to have some of the water with his son.</span> <span id="s1461">But when he looked at the faces of us all, he says, no, no, my son, we’ll have to share this water.</span> <span id="s1462">Somehow a spoon was produced and everybody got a tablespoon of water.</span> <span id="s1463">This is the way it went all around.</span> <span id="s1464">But the moment, I think my moment of greater despair came at the end of the journey because I could say when I stood in Lublin before a firing squad, was this the worst moment?</span> <span id="s1465">No, because it happened so quickly and it came as a surprise.</span> <span id="s1466">Before we got scared enough, become numb.</span> <span id="s1467">It was all over.</span> <span id="s1468">I was also, a gun was pointed at me in Lublin on a railroad station by a drunk, an SS officer.</span> <span id="s1469">This ended up without me being shot.</span> <span id="s1470">But here we’re traveling on this train and there’s time on our hands and we were able to think.</span> <span id="s1471">Then it got dark and darker.</span> <span id="s1472">Finally the train slowed down and it was already beyond, not quite so dark that you couldn’t see but it was already further along than the dust, the hour of twilight when you can still see things relatively well.</span> <span id="s1473">The train -- there was also another incident.</span> <span id="s1474">During the ride on the train, a Polish peasant stood when the train was very slowly moving after many stops that it made to give priority to other trains.</span> <span id="s1475">He seen our train and he crossed himself.</span> <span id="s1476">So I said why would he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to extermination.</span> <span id="s1477">I say after all, going to a labor camp still leaves -- there is room for hope.</span></p> <p><span id="s1478">(End of Tape 11.)</span> <span id="s1479">The movement of the train, very slow movement, when the train is --when they are moving sections of the train on the final terminal; there’s more literally, this is literally what terminal is the right word to use, the train was moving very slowly.</span> <span id="s1480">You have the descending darkness, you see that we are being pushed through a tall masonry wall.</span> <span id="s1481">It suddenly, it gave me the foreboding that we are being brought into the extermination point, because we were not given any rations for the trip; people were packed like sardines.</span> <span id="s1482">If you want to get work out of slaves, you have to give them living room, you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the basic needs of subsistence to live on.</span> <span id="s1483">No water, nothing given for us to urinate or to tend to all other needs that are basic needs and suddenly this descending darkness and the train slowly --the train -- like we were going through the gates of hell.</span></p> <p><span id="s1484">Q: That’s exactly what I was imagining.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">A: And the train came to a stop.</span> <span id="s1486">When the train was traveling, we couldn’t hear nothing because you just hear the noise of the railroad tracks and the rails and the wind and so forth.</span> <span id="s1487">But when the train stopped, you could hear the screams of the women and children in other boxcars where they had women and children, where they were packed very heavily.</span> <span id="s1488">Because the heat was unbearable and they had no room to urinate, they had no room for anything.</span> <span id="s1489">There was crying and lamenting and it all suggested a premonition of impending death by some means that we don’t know yet; whether it will be gas chambers or they have something else in store for us.</span> <span id="s1490">Then on the platforms, which on the right and a platform on the left which separated us from the other section of the train, there were big floodlights and there were guards that were standing on both sides.</span> <span id="s1491">Were just maybe two or three guards.</span> <span id="s1492">All of a sudden you hear the sound of a rolling door open and a man, stripped down to his trunks, runs out of this heat.</span> <span id="s1493">He just runs and the Germans, the German guards, they begin to hunt him like a rabbit.</span> <span id="s1494">He says, Ich_______, I have him!</span> <span id="s1495">He says_________, halt.</span> <span id="s1496">This and so forth, then you hear two shots and you see this guy collapsing underneath one of those floodlights.</span> <span id="s1497">By that time the temperature must have dropped, this was in May, and you could see like a steam coming out from his mouth, the blood was running out of his neck.</span> <span id="s1498">He was laying there, a human being.</span> <span id="s1499">All he wanted was a little air and he was shot for that.</span> <span id="s1500">When I seen this, this scene itself was a --I seen people killed before by the Germans.</span> <span id="s1501">I have seen them in the Warsaw Ghetto but I have never seen this, when you put all these elements together, under such circumstances.</span> <span id="s1502">Then the immediate logical conclusion is that we are not coming into any labor camp.</span> <span id="s1503">If you begin to add all these things and as the morning began to dawn, there was a rabbi in our boxcar.</span> <span id="s1504">We have a prayer that is said before death; it is called confession before death, people say it.</span> <span id="s1505">He began to say the confession and he had a younger brother, Hanok was his name.</span> <span id="s1506">That guy began to cry that he is only twenty years old.</span> <span id="s1507">This crying and praying became very unnerving to us although a man has a right to say what he wants before he dies.</span> <span id="s1508">We were still not convinced that this is the end of the line.</span> <span id="s1509">Nevertheless somebody asked them that they should stop this sobbing business and all this, wait to see what happens in the morning.</span> <span id="s1510">In the morning, when they open the boxcars, there came a Jewish crew that was working and the Germans and the dogs, the whole circus.</span> <span id="s1511">They began to open the doors of the car and they begin to pile out the dead bodies from the boxcars.</span> <span id="s1512">Ours was the only boxcar that didn’t have any dead bodies but from all other cars, they were putting the bodies.</span> <span id="s1513">The Jewish crew went in and they were putting the bodies by stacking them in pyres, one on top of the other in squares.</span> <span id="s1514">I seen young women, young men, it was just a frightening sight when you see so much death around you.</span> <span id="s1515">We were bewildered -- there were two hand grenades laying on the bottom of our floor.</span> <span id="s1516">In other words, one of the -- some of our men had hand grenades and they were prepared to make a fight for it, if we escaped.</span> <span id="s1517">If we escaped and went to the woods, we would have something; I mean that was the intention.</span> <span id="s1518">I remember when we empty the car, the SS men take a look in the car; they seen the hand grenades and they ignored it.</span> <span id="s1519">This was the final indication that we are slated for death because if we are not, they would certainly not allow something like this to go unpunished.</span> <span id="s1520">They would want a guilty party and they would make an execution; they would try to show how they deal with something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: You’re all guilty already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: It doesn’t matter because we---.</span> <span id="s1523">Then we were put in a, those that survived the trip were put in a column five abreast.</span> <span id="s1524">The column was standing there and forming.</span> <span id="s1525">While they were forming and we seen that the crew---.</span> <span id="s1526">Another thing is the cleaning crew that was working there, the Jews who were part of the crew of this camp, they wouldn’t speak to us.</span> <span id="s1527">If we ask them, where are we?</span> <span id="s1528">What is awaiting us?</span> <span id="s1529">They didn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1530">So you got the impression like you were on an operating table; you are in a hospital and you see the nurses in white aprons looking at you as though you were dead already.</span> <span id="s1531">We didn’t know that they were not allowed to speak to us, we didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1532">Then the column began to form and there were about a dozen of SS men on each side of the column, guards with rifles.</span> <span id="s1533">They were going to escort us wherever we were going to go.</span> <span id="s1534">We begin the procession, slowly.</span> <span id="s1535">When I was walking, I was bewildered, what was happening there?</span> <span id="s1536">My thoughts were very incoherent, in a situation like this.</span> <span id="s1537">The SS man that was on my left, that was next to me, I record this in the book, he said to me, Veir albist du?</span> <span id="s1538">, how old are you?</span> <span id="s1539">I said, Ich bin_______ I told him I was 18 years old.</span> <span id="s1540">He answered me I__________, I’m nineteen.</span> <span id="s1541">.</span> <span id="s1542">He says_________, it’s a pity that you have to die.</span> <span id="s1543">He said it to me, he meant it; he had no---.</span> <span id="s1544">That was – this is the way he felt apparently.</span> <span id="s1545">We were eventually separated from those that went to the gas chambers; but this moment, these moments in my life, including this question and answer and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a beautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this arrival; this is probably the worst that I had to face.</span> <span id="s1546">Because after that I became already immune to these -- not immune but I began to realize that sooner or later they’re going to get us.</span> <span id="s1547">That there’s a very slim chance of survival.</span> <span id="s1548">So I was not going to get again -- I would not panic anymore in a situation that was awaiting.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">Q: You think the worst and then you survive, then it’s almost a bonus?</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">A: Well, for some people who survived that particular moment was not the best thing because they perished later and they just suffered more.</span> <span id="s1551">But this was such a terrifying thing, this whole thing, the arrival, the descending darkness, the crying of the women, the pitiful crying of the children, and then the killing of that man who just run for a breath of fresh air, the prayers of the rabbi who survived, he lives in Pittsburgh.</span> <span id="s1552">I met him in Israel one time unexpectedly, and his brother survived.</span> <span id="s1553">All these things are just terrifying more than anything else that I have experienced before or since.</span> <span id="s1554">Although I had many close calls after, I was with a flogged person; it didn’t affect me as badly as this.</span> <span id="s1555">I’m not going to tell you how we got out of this situation because then nobody’s going to buy my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: We won’t go into that.</span> <span id="s1557">I was going to recall from another interview that I had, that there was an orchestra at Majdanek, perhaps not at this point.</span> <span id="s1558">But it seems that was all that is lacking---.</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">A: I thought Auschwitz had the orchestra.</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">Q: An orchestra was at Auschwitz but apparently there was one also at Majdanek, perhaps at the labor camp.</span> <span id="s1561">But you’re talking about 1942.</span></p> <p><span id="s1562">A: Forty-three.</span></p> <p><span id="s1563">Q: Forty-three but early---?</span></p> <p><span id="s1564">A: May 12th or May 13th.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: But you don’t recall any orchestra at the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1566">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">Q: I don’t think it would have been at this point in the camp.</span> <span id="s1568">It would have been somewhere else, like a work area at the labor section.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">A: Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we were not in the camp proper.</span> <span id="s1570">We were in the entrance camp and the reason they had the guards because they had to march us yet through a street which I think is called Helmska B________ because it leads to hell.</span> <span id="s1571">That would take us to Majdanek and to the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1572">This was our fate.</span> <span id="s1573">I studied the records of it from a book that was written of Majdanek, by a Polish writer.</span> <span id="s1574">It’s not translated into English yet.</span> <span id="s1575">I bought it in Poland when I was there.</span> <span id="s1576">It said in that period of time, there were no registrations, everybody was going -- especially from the Warsaw Ghetto -- everybody was going straight into the gas chambers.</span> <span id="s1577">Actually I was twice in Majdanek.</span> <span id="s1578">At this time when we were sent to Budzyn and when we were shipped to Budzyn en route to Plaszow, we detoured in Majdanek so I was their guest again.</span> <span id="s1579">I omitted telling you -- it occurred to me that I omitted telling you -- something about my uncle Meynek.</span> <span id="s1580">As you know, we came to Budzyn from this transport in second week of May.</span> <span id="s1581">That would put it about May 13 or thereabout.</span> <span id="s1582">When we arrived there, we found out that there was already one group of Warsaw survivors, Warsaw Ghetto uprising survivors who arrived there a week earlier.</span> <span id="s1583">One of the survivors, I believe his name was Kaufmann, a young fellow my age, recognized me and he said I got something to tell you about your Uncle Meynek.</span> <span id="s1584">He was in our transport with his wife, that would be Irka on the umschlagplatz after the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the umschlagplatz into boxcars.</span> <span id="s1585">While he was in the boxcar with his wife, he was trying to bribe a Ukrainian guard, either to let him go which seems very unlikely; it seemed very unlikely that he would have asked him for it.</span> <span id="s1586">Or he might have asked him for water because they were selling water for something like 500 zlotys a glass if they got the money.</span> <span id="s1587">However, the Ukrainian guard after taking the money, shot my uncle and his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from his legs, feet, and this is how my uncle came to an end.</span> <span id="s1588">I believe he was born 1907, he would have -- this was in May of 1943, he would have been 36 years old.</span> <span id="s1589">This is the story of our family.</span> <span id="s1590">We had very few survivors.</span> <span id="s1591">That would be my Uncle Ben survived, my Aunt Rose survived because she was on Aryan papers and she was able to hide her identity and the only other survivor was myself and my grandmother who left Poland on the last ship that reached the United States.</span> <span id="s1592">My father died in Majdanek, now we know, my mother and my youngest brother, Meir at Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1593">Szymon still remains as enigma, as to what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: Still waiting or hoping for a miracle?</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: Yes, it’s hard to imagine that this late, we would not have been able to establish contact.</span> <span id="s1596">Since even if he lived in Spain, he would know that most survivors went either to Israel or the United States or Canada and he would have tried to exhaust these things.</span> <span id="s1597">There were no enquiries for me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1598">Q: And then there’s your book, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1599">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1600">Q: He would have read a book about that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1601">A: But you know what?</span> <span id="s1602">All this brings me to this understanding --that we, the Jewish people, are very old people.</span> <span id="s1603">We have survived rising and falling civilizations.</span> <span id="s1604">The Germans were trying to put an end to the Jewish people in a most barbaric way in the annals of mankind.</span> <span id="s1605">They didn’t succeed and I don’t think that any ruthless dictatorship would, in the future, succeed.</span> <span id="s1606">But they never stop trying.</span> <span id="s1607">Okay, I think that we had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1608">Q: Okay, thank you very much for sharing your story and your history.</span> <span id="s1609">I hope that it will be of great value, not only for the present, but for the future generations who study and recollection of the Holocaust.</span></p></body></html>
