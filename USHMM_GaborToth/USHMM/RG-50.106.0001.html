and that was destroyed in Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: And so, by 1939, was she still working at all, or was it basically impossible?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: She was still working.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s56">And that would have been still the children's clothing store?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Right.</span> <span id="s58">Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s60">Now, let's start with, I guess, your father's family -- brothers, sisters that he had.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: He

sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No.</span> <span id="s73">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s75">Do you know where she lived, or was she also in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: She lived in small town Germany.</span> <span id="s77">I don't know the name of it, but it was out in the country somewhere.</span> <span id="s78">I do know what happened to her and her brother.</span> <span id="s79">We never heard from again.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s81">Okay.</span> <span id="s82">Why don't you tell me what happened to your aunt, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: She was married.</span> <span id="s84">And on the night of her wedding, they killed her husband and she committed suicide.</span></p> <p><span

id="s88">A: Yeah, Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: And I mean, I know who you're talking about when you say "they," but do you know specifically it was the SS?</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: SS.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s92">And who told you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: My mother.</span> <span id="s94">These are things that my mother told me.</span> <span id="s95">Unfortunately, I didn't take enough dates down.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s97">No, I understand.</span> <span id="s98">Sure.</span> <span id="s99">Now, was your father's family originally from Germany, or do you know how long they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: They were originally from Germany.</span> <span id="s101">They were from Gelsenkirchen.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: Can you spell that for me?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: G-E-L-S-E-N-K-I-R-C-H-E-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s105">And where is that in relation to Berlin, if you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">A: Not really -- outside.</span> <span id="s107">Small town.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: How long had they been in Berlin, your parents, do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: Actually, my father was living in Gelsenkirchen and came to Berlin on a business trip and met my mother at that time through a friend.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Actually, my mother was dating his best friend.</span> <span id="s112">And he was supposed to deliver a note to the best friend.</span> <span id="s113">And that's how they met.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: It was more than a note he delivered.</span> <span id="s115">Okay.</span> <span id="s116">Let's then go to your mother's family now.</span> <span id="s117">Did she have brothers and sisters?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: No, she was also an only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s120">And her background was -- was she also German, or do you know where she was from?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Yes, yes -- her father was from Austria, from Vienna.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s123">Okay.</span> <span id="s124">And her father's name, can I ask you that?</span></p> <p><span id="s125">A: Her father's name was (?</span> <span id="s126">Kamil?)</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: And that would have been K-O.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: K-O-H-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s130">Now, you're born in October of 1939, and I guess what we're going to do is rely a little bit on maybe your mother's recollection of this early period until you had your own recollections as a child.</span> <span id="s131">But do you know what kinds of circumstances you were living in in Berlin at that time from your mother?</span> <span id="s132">Do you know if you're still in a house, an apartment, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: Well, to go back a bit, my grandmother's name was Teresa.</span> <span id="s134">And she converted to Judaism when she married my grandfather who was a devout Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s136">This is on your paternal or --</span></p> <p><span id="s137">A: This was my mother's mother.</span> <span id="s138">So that lays the background a little more of why things happened later on that didn't happen to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s140">So your maternal grandmother basically converted.</span> <span id="s141">And what was her religion before?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Protestant.</span> <span id="s144">Okay.</span> <span id="s145">All right.</span> <span id="s146">So the circumstances you were living in.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: My grandfather was a prominent person in Avatas [?]</span> <span id="s148">until stock market and everything collapsed.</span> <span id="s149">And he lost all.</span> <span id="s150">He died in 1935.</span> <span id="s151">Basically when he lost everything, he gave up.</span> <span id="s152">They were wealthy people, always had a live-in maid.</span> <span id="s153">My mother grew up in those circumstances.</span> <span id="s154">Went to private schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: And, after my grandfather died, my mother -- from the little money that he had left -- she opened the store to sell the children's clothes, started the business.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s158">Tell me about a little bit -- and I'm sorry we're backtracking Mrs. Gelfer, but this is interesting.</span> <span id="s159">Tell me a little bit about her career as an actress -- what you know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Mainly on a stage.</span> <span id="s161">In fact, she was starting to make a name for herself.</span> <span id="s162">Small town stage productions.</span> <span id="s163">She always wanted to be an actress from way back.</span> <span id="s164">She always mentioned she dropped out of school without her parents knowing about it and went to acting school.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: And did she use her name Johanna?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: No, her stage name was Junsi.</span> <span id="s167">That was a nickname my grandfather had for her.</span> <span id="s168">And Karnau, K-A-R-N-A-U, was her stage name.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s170">Okay.</span> <span id="s171">Do you have any memorabilia from that time period or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: I have pictures of her.</span> <span id="s173">She was a slight person.</span> <span id="s174">Very trim.</span> <span id="s175">Boyish figure.</span> <span id="s176">She did things like William Tell's son.</span> <span id="s177">Cape Leer's son.</span> <span id="s178">A lot of these kind of parts.</span> <span id="s179">She did.</span> <span id="s180">My great grandfather was a ballet master of the Vienna opera house, so maybe there was a little theatrical book in there from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And that would have been on her side.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: That's my grandfather's father.</span> <span id="s183">There are three cousins in Austria which are quite well-known writers by the name of Braun.</span> <span id="s184">That's B-R-A-U-N.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s186">Okay.</span> <span id="s187">So she owned her children's store.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: So she was used to the finer things in life, born in well-to-do situation.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s190">And this was in Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: This was.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">Q: When was she born; do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s193">A: December 30, 1904.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s195">Back -- going back now to 1939 time period when you were first born, were you living in an apartment -- just the three of you -- or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s196">A: We were living in an apartment with my grandmother -- the four of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: And that would have been her mother -- your mother's mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: My mother's mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: And we lived in that apartment till we left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s202">So, as far as you know, you lived in the same place.</span></p> <p><span id="s203">A: All my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s205">From 1939 to --</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: -- 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s208">Ten years later.</span> <span id="s209">All right.</span> <span id="s210">What are your first recollections as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: First recollections, I would say, would be wandering around streets with my grandmother not knowing the reason why really.</span> <span id="s212">Days and nights.</span> <span id="s213">I also had an aunt that was really not an aunt; it was just a very close friend of a cousin and later his wife who protected us.</span> <span id="s214">And she would pick me up and walk me in parks and streets.</span> <span id="s215">And I really had no idea why I was doing this.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: Do you know now?</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s218">That was just to hide me.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I remember my father coming home from work and he would put me on his shoulders and ride me around the dining room and my mother would be saying, "You're tired.</span> <span id="s221">Don't do that."</span> <span id="s222">That's -- my father take me to the park.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: Bits and pieces there.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: Do you know what kind of work your father was doing then?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: At that time he was teaching.</span> <span id="s227">He taught until the very end when he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s229">When was that; do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: December 22, 1942.</span> <span id="s231">And he was taken right out of the classroom.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Do you know what happened to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: No.</span> <span id="s234">We just know that there was a sign in Berlin where they always had the -- the lists of people who were gone, had died.</span> <span id="s235">And it just had his number -- 21450 -- and his name behind it.</span> <span id="s236">Some said he was on his way to ___, but there was no proof of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s238">How are you so certain -- it's just interesting Miss Gelfer, that date.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">A: The date was my mother went to the town hall every day to see if his name was there.</span> <span id="s240">One day the date was there, the number was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s242">Now, once your father was taken away, was it just then the three of you in the house?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: Three of us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">Q: Now, what I think I'll do, Ms. Gelfer, just a little bit easier, I'm going to go through your recollections first from your childhood to the time you were liberated essentially to almost the present.</span> <span id="s245">And then what I'd like to do is go back and sort of I'll put you in the shoes of your mother in a sense and have you recollect what she has told you about that.</span> <span id="s246">I think that will be probably a easier way to do it as opposed to skipping back and forth.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">A: I have something that I don't know if you'd like to use or not, but my father wrote me a poem right after I was born.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Oh, terrific.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: And it sort of tells what things were like at that time -- his fear, his knowledge what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: Oh, that'd be great.</span> <span id="s251">Why don't you just take the time now.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: He wrote this to me about four months after I was born.</span> <span id="s253">It was called To Tana.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: And that means?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: My name was Tana.</span> <span id="s256">When I came into your room, you stretched your little hands to the bar of your crib.</span> <span id="s257">I heard a sweet quiet sigh.</span> <span id="s258">You felt free from the loneliness of your prison.</span> <span id="s259">You are still such a stranger in this world.</span> <span id="s260">In a sense nothing in the end is loneliness.</span> <span id="s261">What hatred, fury passion has done to us.</span> <span id="s262">You smiled and consoled so fast from your small grief.</span> <span id="s263">Oh put out love tied around your colorful rich world.</span> <span id="s264">Thank you for all you have already given us -- memories of innocence, purity, and a life gone by.</span> <span id="s265">Life for ourselves has already vanished so long ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Beautiful.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: So he knew what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: Well, if you don't mind, I'd like to make a copy of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Oh, sure.</span> <span id="s270">I translated this from the German.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: It's beautiful.</span> <span id="s272">So your early recollections were unfortunately just of wandering through the streets.</span> <span id="s273">Some early recollections of your father's love for you it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Playing with girlfriends -- German girlfriends.</span> <span id="s275">Really not knowing that this was out of the ordinary the way life was.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s277">Did your mother ever speak to you about your father in terms of that he had been taken away?</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: No, not that I remember at all.</span> <span id="s279">It was just one day he wasn't there.</span> <span id="s280">But, at age two and a half, I wouldn't have known the difference.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s282">Yeah.</span> <span id="s283">Tell me what you recollect as you became an older child so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: You mean two, three -- and that's my recollections?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Four, five.</span> <span id="s286">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: Well, the main ones have to do with -- was the day that we were picked up.</span> <span id="s288">My mother was in forced labor, and I was playing, little non-Jewish girl, German girlfriend of mine -- in the dining room.</span> <span id="s289">And my mother came in, and she looked at my grandmother and my grandmother said, "What are you doing home already?</span> <span id="s290">It's early."</span> <span id="s291">And then she saw the SS man behind -- standing behind my mother.</span> <span id="s292">And my mother just said to my friend, "You have to go home now.</span> <span id="s293">Tana can't play with you anymore."</span> <span id="s294">And the little girl didn't know why, but she left with this sort of look.</span> <span id="s295">And my mother and grandmother just looked at each other.</span> <span id="s296">My mother told me to go get my coat.</span> <span id="s297">I remember I grabbed my teddy bear.</span> <span id="s298">And my mother, my grandmother hugged each other, and we just left and we were put on a truck.</span> <span id="s299">But I had no idea where we were going, what was going on at that time.</span> <span id="s300">It was just that I was being taken away from my playmate.</span> <span id="s301">And next thing I remember was we were in a place called Aranishe I was told afterwards.</span> <span id="s302">And.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: You just spell that to the best you could.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">A: A-R-A-N-I-S-H-E.</span> <span id="s305">And there were a lot of buildings there.</span> <span id="s306">And I was separated.</span> <span id="s307">That was the first time I separated from my mother.</span> <span id="s308">There were a bunch of kids.</span> <span id="s309">And there were bunk beds.</span> <span id="s310">And I wasn't going to stay there.</span> <span id="s311">And I ran away couple of times.</span> <span id="s312">And the last time I did find my mother.</span> <span id="s313">And they allowed me to stay with her.</span> <span id="s314">It was actually a place -- a holding place -- until we were put on a train.</span> <span id="s315">We were there for about four days or five days.</span> <span id="s316">I just remember being very very scared, because it was the first time I was really separated from my mother, and I was with all these children and I didn't know anybody.</span> <span id="s317">And I was determined I was going to find her.</span> <span id="s318">And the next thing I really remember is being in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s319">My first recollections were walking with my mother and it was a park and it had old swings and all of a sudden my mother screamed.</span> <span id="s320">It was a lady walking with a blind man pushing a baby carriage.</span> <span id="s321">And my mother had met one of her earlier very best friends of all places that she had really lost contact with.</span> <span id="s322">The gentleman was a first world war veteran also lost his eyesight in that war.</span> <span id="s323">And so, he was sort of a national hero.</span> <span id="s324">That's why he went to Theresienstadt, not to Auschwitz or anywhere else.</span> <span id="s325">And my mother was overjoyed meeting these people.</span> <span id="s326">The little boy had been born there of all places.</span> <span id="s327">And I remember the camp -- the barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s329">Tell me about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: Lots and lots of people in dark barracks.</span> <span id="s331">The lice you could just take off the walls.</span> <span id="s332">Fleas.</span> <span id="s333">Smells.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Describe the smells.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Waste.</span> <span id="s336">Human waste.</span> <span id="s337">Just foul odors.</span> <span id="s338">You tried to open the door, but not much better outside.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: I remember being fed.</span> <span id="s341">We used to go outside.</span> <span id="s342">And they had these big barrels.</span> <span id="s343">And it was filled with what they called "soup."</span> <span id="s344">And, if you are at the beginning of the line, you get maybe a little meat or something.</span> <span id="s345">If you were at the end of the line, you just get the water and a crust of bread would go with that.</span> <span id="s346">We used to save the crust of bread for a couple of days as long as we could, because when it got hard, you could make it last longer.</span> <span id="s347">So we'd eat it after a few days.</span> <span id="s348">My mother and I would sit together, and we just eat little pieces at a time.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: How often were you given these meals; was it just once a day?</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Once a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: What -- midday, early day?</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Early day.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: I spent a lot of my time in a hospital there.</span> <span id="s355">I had every disease and every childhood illness that -- measles and mumps.</span> <span id="s356">Of course, with all these children there, you'd catch whatever someone else had.</span> <span id="s357">I had intestinal infection twice -- it almost killed me.</span> <span id="s358">One time I remember I needed a blood transfusion.</span> <span id="s359">And then they put my mother on one table, put me on the other table and a tube went from her into me.</span> <span id="s360">Saved my life anyway.</span> <span id="s361">I remember that a lot of people, they didn't speak German, especially in the hospital -- the kids.</span> <span id="s362">There were not that many Germans there.</span> <span id="s363">And I was totally lost language-wise.</span> <span id="s364">We -- when I wasn't sick, while my mother was doing various jobs there, we were allowed to attend a day camp, which was run by, you know, inmates, girls.</span> <span id="s365">And there we were allowed to paint and draw pictures.</span> <span id="s366">We worked with little tiles.</span> <span id="s367">You know, a few little toys for us.</span> <span id="s368">But even there they made -- the Nazis made sure that we would be impressed and would remember our experiences as small as we were.</span> <span id="s369">When the people were brought in -- mainly the men were brought in from the outside, they were half starved -- and this was Czechoslovakia.</span> <span id="s370">And this was December, this was winter, it snows like Russian snows -- they would be taken off the carts.</span> <span id="s371">And these were skeleton of people.</span> <span id="s372">And they were going by outside the windows.</span> <span id="s373">And they would open the drapes for us.</span> <span id="s374">And we were made to watch them move on until they dropped dead.</span> <span id="s375">And this is -- I do remember this was something my mother never really knew that I knew -- never told us.</span> <span id="s376">This was something I actually do remember.</span> <span id="s377">They made sure -- people say now, you know, "How can you remember things when you were four years old?"</span> <span id="s378">But things like that you don't forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s379">Q: Now, were you in a separate barracks from your mother?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: No, I was together -- I was lucky I was together with my mother in the same barracks at the time, except when I was in the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s382">And in terms of these -- when you say that these -- these men were taken off --</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: They were just brought in --</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: -- from trains.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: -- from trains --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: -- and they were just made to stand there.</span> <span id="s388">And this was before they had -- were building the gas chambers there.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: So these people were sick already.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: And they were half-starved.</span> <span id="s393">And, of course, they were freezing.</span> <span id="s394">And they were -- they were nude.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: And they would just leave them out in the elements.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: They would just leave them out there.</span> <span id="s397">And we just -- they opened these big drapes.</span> <span id="s398">And we just -- we turned around and watched them.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Now, in terms of your actual living conditions in the barracks, were you -- did you share a bed your mother, or shared a bunk with several other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: We had bunks.</span> <span id="s401">Bunks.</span> <span id="s402">They were three and three high, the bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s403">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s404">Did you always have the same place; do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: I imagine so.</span> <span id="s406">I would think so, yes.</span> <span id="s407">Because my mother used to talk about barrack number.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s409">Did you have -- do you remember being able to keep any personal possessions there?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: My teddy bear.</span> <span id="s411">I still have my teddy bear.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You still have it?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: My teddy bear came home with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: How do you -- just out of curiosity, how is it kept now?</span></p> <p><span id="s415">A: It's just on my bookshelf.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Oh, really.</span> <span id="s417">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">A: Couple of times I've had him fixed a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: I sent a few things to the museum.</span> <span id="s421">Money from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s422">Postcards that we -- my mother was allowed to send out, which were kind of a joke.</span> <span id="s423">And I was ready to send the teddy bear, but I couldn't do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: No, you don't want to do that.</span> <span id="s425">It's made it this far with you; it seems to me it doesn't leave your house.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: Right.</span> <span id="s427">Yes.</span> <span id="s428">Yes.</span> <span id="s429">And he still got the same -- my mother knitted me for Hanukkah there over in the camp; she knitted me a little outfit for him.</span> <span id="s430">And he's still got that on him.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s432">Did you name your teddy bear by any chance?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: No, I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s435">Can you -- besides that the couple vignettes that you told me about the camp life, is there anything else that sticks out in your mind -- any other people that you can recall, you know, distinctly or relationships that you might have had or things that impressed you?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Mainly the couple that we met there, as I said -- he was blinded WWI and taken to Theresienstadt because he was sort of a war hero.</span> <span id="s437">And they were little careful about killing these people right out.</span> <span id="s438">And his wife was a secretary to him.</span> <span id="s439">He was a lawyer -- an attorney -- I mentioned that.</span> <span id="s440">And she was a secretary.</span> <span id="s441">When he came back and was blinded, they married.</span> <span id="s442">She was always a sickly person.</span> <span id="s443">And they tried very hard to have children; nothing ever happened.</span> <span id="s444">After they wound up in Theresienstadt, she became pregnant.</span> <span id="s445">And my mother says that -- told me that friends -- so woman friends -- helped her have her child in secret there; otherwise, the child would have been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: And they were there for over three years.</span> <span id="s448">So they had been there a year -- two years before us already.</span></p> <p><span id="s449">Q: Do you know what their names are?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s451">Minnie and Fritz Simon.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: S-I-M-O-N?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s454">And the son's name is Michael.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Do you know if he survived?</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: They all survived.</span> <span id="s457">And last we heard of them, they were -- when we came over here -- her brother was a friend of my mother's also in Germany.</span> <span id="s458">He remained in Germany.</span> <span id="s459">And he gave us their address.</span> <span id="s460">And they wound up in Mt. Vernon, New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s462">Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: We saw them several times even after I married.</span> <span id="s464">My husband met him.</span> <span id="s465">My children.</span> <span id="s466">Michael went on to become a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Frits went -- frits went back to Germany and remained there.</span> <span id="s469">And I -- we didn't hear that she died, but I -- she must have died.</span> <span id="s470">And then last we heard of them, we went by to their wedding -- to Michael's wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s471">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">A: And then we lost track of the son.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s474">He would be about -- no, he'd be younger than you, I guess, right?</span> <span id="s475">Because he was just a baby -- three or four years younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: He would be two years older than me.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: No, that doesn't quite match.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: He was younger than me, I'm sorry, younger than me -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">Q: Because he was in the baby carriage and you were standing.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">A: Right.</span> <span id="s481">Right.</span> <span id="s482">Younger -- right.</span> <span id="s483">They were there two years more.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s485">So two to three years.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: Two to three years younger -- right.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: What about the -- the Nazis at the camp; do you recall?</span> <span id="s488">Do you have any memories of what they were like besides forcing you to see those certain things?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No.</span> <span id="s490">Really really not, because I came more into contact with -- in the children's camp, with the inmates.</span> <span id="s491">And also in the hospital -- the doctors and nurses were also inmates.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: The people in prison ____.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Tell me about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: I do have a recollection -- go back to before we left Germany.</span> <span id="s496">A German officer -- he was not an SS officer, but he was in the army.</span> <span id="s497">His name was Zimmerman.</span> <span id="s498">At that time my mother had to take on a middle name, which was a Hebrew name -- Sarah --</span></p> <p><span id="s499">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: -- which, of course, she wasn't used to, because she wasn't born with that name.</span> <span id="s501">And whenever she had to go somewhere and sign her name, that name had to be included --</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: -- otherwise, it would mean instant death with deportation.</span> <span id="s504">Well, one time my mother had to go somewhere and she had to sign some papers and she just forgot.</span> <span id="s505">She just put her regular name down.</span> <span id="s506">They caught her.</span> <span id="s507">It was an excuse to deport somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: This Mr. Zimmerman was a friend of ours.</span> <span id="s510">He lived a couple of houses away from us in Berlin and had been bringing us a little food and was friendly with my mother -- well, my grandmother.</span> <span id="s511">And he saw the papers on the desk that she was supposed to be picked up.</span> <span id="s512">And he took the papers, and he came to my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: And he said, "Look, Katsina[?]</span> <span id="s515">, what you did -- stupid thing you did -- you didn't put your name down, your Hebrew name."</span> <span id="s516">And my mother says, "I just bluntly forgot.</span> <span id="s517">I just wanted to get out of there and forgot."</span></p> <p><span id="s518">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">A: And he said, "This paper is out for you.</span> <span id="s520">These are the papers.</span> <span id="s521">They're official."</span> <span id="s522">And she said, "Well, that's what has to be."</span> <span id="s523">And he says, "I can't do this."</span> <span id="s524">And he burned the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: And they went out and killed him.</span> <span id="s527">And I remember him, because he was a very heavy-set man with a big mustache.</span> <span id="s528">I always cried.</span> <span id="s529">He picked me up, and he loved me to death.</span> <span id="s530">And I always screamed when he picked me up.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: Did you hear from your mother that he had been killed, I guess, later?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s533">From my grandmother, actually.</span> <span id="s534">When we came back from the camp, she told us that she heard that he had been killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: Now just digressing a little bit -- I guess your grandmother wasn't taken because --</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: My grandmother was not taken, because she was born Protestant and converted.</span> <span id="s537">She was 70 years old at the time.</span> <span id="s538">And they hadn't quite made up their mind what to do with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s540">A: I think the reason that we went so late was that -- also because my mother had been asked to come down to be measured.</span> <span id="s541">Her head was measured, her nose was measured to see how much of her was Jewish and how much of her wasn't.</span> <span id="s542">So it took them a little longer to take us, because they couldn't quite make up their mind where she belonged, because she didn't come from a Jewish mother --</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s544">So technically --</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: -- technically.</span></p> <p><span id="s546">Q: Although the -- I guess the code back then was like 1/64th or something.</span> <span id="s547">I mean, it didn't ____ .</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Just to finish up a little bit with Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s550">Do you remember -- in other words, oftentimes people tell us about the -- either the concerts or cultural events that they had.</span> <span id="s551">Do you remember any of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s552">A: No -- only from -- not myself.</span> <span id="s553">Only from what my mother said that the Red Cross came in, and they spruced up the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">A: The banks were opened.</span> <span id="s556">The cafes were opened.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: Bakeries had food in them.</span> <span id="s559">Butcher shops had food in them.</span> <span id="s560">And, of course, it was just a big show.</span></p> <p><span id="s561">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">A: These were things that she told me.</span> <span id="s563">It was just for the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s564">I remember also my mother said that the Red Cross questioned them and said, "Well, how is life here?"</span> <span id="s565">And, of course, they couldn't say too much, because there was always someone listening.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: So the answer they gave was, "I must say it's not too bad."</span> <span id="s568">And that can be taken two ways.</span> <span id="s569">And they hoped it would be picked up in the way that they said.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s571">Back on around the second half, and we have two more, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: -- we're in pretty good shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: You had just asked if I knew what my mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: She had several jobs.</span> <span id="s577">One was working in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: She picked spinach.</span> <span id="s580">She picked rhubarb.</span> <span id="s581">She got that job.</span> <span id="s582">They asked if anybody had any farming experience.</span> <span id="s583">And my mother was always outspoken, brazen, and kind of gutsy.</span> <span id="s584">If she wasn't gutsy, she wouldn't have made it through all this.</span> <span id="s585">She said, "Oh sure -- I have farming experience."</span></p> <p><span id="s586">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">A: And someone said, "Well, you came from Berlin; there's no farms there."</span> <span id="s588">And she said, "Well, I grew flowers in my window at home."</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Whoever she was talking to had a sense of humor and figured she was young, she was strong, and put her in the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s591">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: They tried to steal spinach, put it in their underwear.</span> <span id="s593">And rhubarb.</span> <span id="s594">She fed the rhubarb to me once.</span> <span id="s595">She was overjoyed that she had some rhubarb.</span> <span id="s596">Well, with the intestinal problems I had, it almost killed me.</span> <span id="s597">But they tried to steal what they could out of the fields.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Do you remember eating some of the things from the fields?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: I remember the rhubarb, because I almost died right after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: Another job she had was when the people came into the camp they had showers.</span> <span id="s602">And, as I said before, very few of the people spoke German.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A: And that was -- she didn't speak any other language.</span> <span id="s605">These were showers with water, but these people didn't know that.</span> <span id="s606">They had heard about the gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s607">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: And they wanted to de-lice them, de-flea them before they came in.</span> <span id="s609">And she was one of the people that had to take these women into the showers.</span> <span id="s610">Of course, these people were screaming and yelling thinking that they were going to their death.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: Another job she had was separating belongings of people that had died there.</span> <span id="s613">Assembly-line type of work.</span> <span id="s614">The Nazis wanted any kind that was valuable -- jewelry.</span> <span id="s615">Anything at all that could be of use to them.</span> <span id="s616">And so, they had these boxes, which literally had the ashes -- remains of the people in them, and they had to go through them.</span> <span id="s617">A lot of times the name on them would be somebody that somebody would recognize, a son or daughter or husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s619">Just to backtrack a little bit, Mrs. Gelfer, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the hospital.</span> <span id="s620">You said that it was staffed by inmates.</span> <span id="s621">Do you remember what, you know, physically looked like -- the physical plant so to speak.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Just barrack-type beddings.</span> <span id="s623">Very, very simple.</span> <span id="s624">Everything that was used there was chipped -- the bowls.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Nobody asked from facilities for buckets.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s628">Somewhat less crowded than the barracks?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: Yes, but not -- single beds, not bunk-style beds --</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: -- that was the difference.</span> <span id="s632">Just children where I was.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s634">So you assume that there's a children's section?</span></p> <p><span id="s635">A: A children's section -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: How many kids were in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s637">A: There were a lot I remember -- a lot.</span> <span id="s638">But I don't remember -- maybe say 100, 75 --</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Do you remember being liberated from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">Q: Can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s642">A: Yes, I remember that -- well, the background of it was that -- what my mother told me first before -- what I remember was that the night before they had posted a sign that we were supposed to be gassed the next morning.</span> <span id="s643">They already had built the chambers.</span> <span id="s644">Let me just go back one more -- that just brings something else to mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">Q: Sure.</span> <span id="s646">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: When we first came in, "Tana" was a very popular name at that time.</span> <span id="s648">The children that were born around 1939 -- '38, '39 -- the parents were not allowed to give them names of their choices.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: There was a list of names.</span> <span id="s651">They were horrendous names a lot of them.</span> <span id="s652">Abiga -- which is Abigail here, which isn't too bad, but in German, it's the closest thing to a parrot, which is papagei.</span> <span id="s653">So these were not very nice names.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: So Tana was about the best.</span> <span id="s656">I guess there were about six or seven girl's names and boy's names.</span> <span id="s657">And the parents had to choose from the list.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: So "Tana" was a popular name of little girls at that time.</span> <span id="s660">We were brought into the camp.</span> <span id="s661">We had to line up.</span> <span id="s662">And Kohn -- my mother used -- after my father was picked up, my mother thought she can protect us a little better by using her name -- maiden name of Kohn.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: That also, of course, was a very popular name.</span> <span id="s665">When we were brought in, we were told to line up.</span> <span id="s666">And, if it wasn't a confusion, excitement, everything that was going on.</span> <span id="s667">They knew that the names they were calling were the names that were not going to stay in Theresienstadt; they were going to go to Auschwitz or to one of the other camps.</span> <span id="s668">And my mother just remembers "Frau Kohn and child Tana."</span> <span id="s669">And my mother took me -- and I do remember she took me and pulled me forward.</span> <span id="s670">And a woman grabbed her by the sleeve and pulled her back and said, "Didn't you hear the first name?</span> <span id="s671">That's me and my daughter."</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s673">And they stepped forward?</span></p> <p><span id="s674">A: They stepped forward.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">Q: Did you know at that point -- or did you later sense how important that was?</span> <span id="s676">I guess you must have.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">A: Later on -- yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, anyway back to liberation.</span> <span id="s680">We were supposed to be gassed the following day, so.</span> <span id="s681">And, from what I understood later is that the next morning we were liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: So it was a matter of hours.</span> <span id="s684">They kept us there for two weeks mainly to treat us --</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: When you say "they," was it the Russians that --</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: Russians.</span> <span id="s687">Clean us up -- get the lice out of the hair.</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: I was so weak.</span> <span id="s690">I was so weak that I had to be trained how to walk at that time.</span> <span id="s691">I couldn't walk under my own power.</span> <span id="s692">And we were just set free.</span> <span id="s693">They opened the gates, and we were set free.</span> <span id="s694">And the only place we knew where to go was back to Berlin.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: We walked for a while.</span> <span id="s697">We hitched a ride on a hay wagon.</span> <span id="s698">And I remember we stopped at a farm.</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: And this is you and your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: Me and my mother, yes.</span> <span id="s701">My mother and I.</span> <span id="s702">We walked by a farm, and the farmer came out.</span> <span id="s703">And he must have realized who we were, where we're coming from.</span> <span id="s704">And he invited us in.</span> <span id="s705">And he gave me some goat milk.</span> <span id="s706">And I just remember my mother was so upset, because I wouldn't drink it.</span> <span id="s707">I just -- I just didn't like it, and I didn't drink it.</span> <span id="s708">And she was so thrilled that I was going to get some nourishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: And we mainly hitched rides until we got back to Berlin.</span> <span id="s711">And just continuous process.</span> <span id="s712">A lot of people did it.</span> <span id="s713">And a lot of people stopped to help.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">A: And the next thing I really remember was we were in Berlin and it was a big indoor market -- about three, four blocks away from us -- and we were running.</span> <span id="s716">That's the first thing I remember --</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: -- because we used to shop there before.</span> <span id="s719">And I knew we were close to home.</span> <span id="s720">And my grandmother had no knowledge of us that we were coming back.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: There was no way to get in touch with her.</span> <span id="s723">And she didn't know if we were dead or if we were alive at that time.</span> <span id="s724">And we walked up to the apartment door.</span> <span id="s725">And my mother pushed me ahead of her.</span> <span id="s726">She didn't know if this was going to kill my grandmother from shock or what was going to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: She was in her 70's already.</span> <span id="s729">She rang the doorbell and stepped aside and just had me standing there.</span> <span id="s730">My grandmother opened the door, she just saw me.</span> <span id="s731">Well, of course she went hysterical from crying, but she also thought that my mother didn't make it.</span> <span id="s732">And then my mother stepped forward.</span> <span id="s733">And I remember that.</span> <span id="s734">Crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s736">And your grandmother had just basically lived at the same apartment and stayed there?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Yes, she had stayed there.</span> <span id="s738">Yes, she had stayed there.</span></p> <p><span id="s739">Q: Now, when you moved back into your grandmother's apartment or your apartment, what did you -- what do you recall of those days?</span></p> <p><span id="s740">A: First thing my mother says, "We got to get out of Germany as quickly as possible."</span> <span id="s741">And she just -- and the people, when we came back, all of a sudden the next door neighbors that have turned us in -- or someone who did turn us in probably before -- were our dearest friends, "Oh, we're so glad you made it.</span> <span id="s742">We're so happy to see you.</span> <span id="s743">And so glad to have you back."</span> <span id="s744">And my mother said, "That's it.</span> <span id="s745">We just have to get out of here."</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: So we put in for a reserve for displaced person to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s748">At that time we had an option of going either to Israel or the United States.</span> <span id="s749">My grandmother wanted to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s750">She fought my mother all the way.</span> <span id="s751">And my mother had a friend from Berlin who had gone to Israel also with his daughter Tana.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: And they had survived.</span> <span id="s754">The family had survived and went to Israel.</span> <span id="s755">And they wrote my mother and said, "Don't come.</span> <span id="s756">You're without a husband.</span> <span id="s757">You're going to be separated from your daughter.</span> <span id="s758">You're going to have to work.</span> <span id="s759">Without a man you can't start in a new country like this.</span> <span id="s760">Go to the United States instead."</span> <span id="s761">He was a doctor, and she was a nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: And he said, "We never see our Tana.</span> <span id="s764">We never see each other.</span> <span id="s765">We're working so hard to make a go of it.</span> <span id="s766">Don't come here."</span> <span id="s767">My mother made the decision to go to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: While you were waiting for the visa --</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: While I was waiting, I was sent by the Jewish Counsel to Switzerland for three months to basically get my strength back.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And I went there by myself.</span> <span id="s772">Jewish people in Switzerland near Bern -- I really don't recall the name offhand of the town -- took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: And I lived with them four months and went to school there.</span></p> <p><span id="s775">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">A: I also did my first three years of public school being the only Jewish child in Berlin when I came back there.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: You say you were the only Jewish child in Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: In my school in Berlin, I was the only one left.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Oh, I see.</span> <span id="s780">Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: There just were figures in Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s782">There were 15,000 children that entered and went through that camp.</span> <span id="s783">And 100 of us walked out of there.</span></p> <p><span id="s784">Q: 100.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">A: 100 out of 15,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s787">After coming back from Switzerland, do you -- did you go back to school?</span> <span id="s788">I guess you said --</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: I went back to school.</span> <span id="s790">Went to Switzerland '47, 1947, for three months and just went to school up to third grade in 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s792">Do you remember what school was like then?</span> <span id="s793">I mean, were kids unfriendly, friendly; was it pleasant, unpleasant?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: No.</span> <span id="s795">I was just different.</span> <span id="s796">They had religious training.</span> <span id="s797">And I went out in the courtyard and played by myself while they had religious training, because I was the only Jewish child.</span> <span id="s798">But other than -- no, not really.</span> <span id="s799">I had friends.</span> <span id="s800">I had no problems at all.</span> <span id="s801">And it was in November -- end of October actually.</span> <span id="s802">We had six days to get ready to leave Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s804">Your mother -- what kind of work, or what did she do when she got back to Berlin?</span></p> <p><span id="s805">A: She worked for the town hall, the city hall.</span> <span id="s806">City hall.</span> <span id="s807">Town hall.</span> <span id="s808">I don't remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s810">And when you got the notice that you were able to -- your visa had been approved, was it for the three of you -- your grandma as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: For the three of us, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s812">Q: And how did you -- did you come straight to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s813">A: We came straight to the United States.</span> <span id="s814">We were supposed to come in to the port of New York.</span> <span id="s815">We went by ship, got caught in a storm, and we were diverted into Boston.</span> <span id="s816">We spent one night in Boston.</span> <span id="s817">Very very elemental.</span> <span id="s818">____ which we were.</span> <span id="s819">And then they put us on a train to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: And we were met by someone from the Jewish Council in New York, and they had a room waiting for us in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s822">Q: When you say "a room," what do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s823">A: A room in a private home.</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: People rented a room to us.</span> <span id="s826">And it was the three of us in one room.</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s828">Do you remember much about that crossing or that ship?</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: A lot of people getting very very sick.</span> <span id="s830">It was a battleship, not a luxury liner or anything.</span> <span id="s831">My mother was deathly sick.</span> <span id="s832">We were 350 people, and the room we were in, we were in hammocks.</span> <span id="s833">Person on top would become ill, and everybody else would profit by it.</span> <span id="s834">What you became ill with, you had to clean up.</span> <span id="s835">There was no crew to do that for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: The sailor's plate with oranges.</span> <span id="s838">And I never had even seen an orange, no less eaten one.</span> <span id="s839">But because there were walls, we didn't get any of them.</span> <span id="s840">It was not a kind trip.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: First time I ate a banana, nobody told me you're supposed to peel them.</span> <span id="s843">And I was almost 10 years old already.</span> <span id="s844">I never had a banana.</span> <span id="s845">So I bit into it.</span> <span id="s846">My grandmother was in a room with four, five people, because she was over 70.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: And she was the least sick.</span> <span id="s849">But my mother was deathly sick in the crossing.</span> <span id="s850">They showed us movies of what the United States was going to be like.</span> <span id="s851">I mean, it was gold-paved all over the streets.</span> <span id="s852">And we were going to all be very wealthy, taken care of.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s854">You said it was a battleship.</span> <span id="s855">Was it a --</span></p> <p><span id="s856">A: It was a navy -- navy ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: U.S. navy, or do you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: U.S. navy.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s860">Any other people that you knew from Berlin that came over?</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: No.</span> <span id="s862">No one.</span> <span id="s863">No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s865">So it sailed from -- I guess Berlin is not a port, but whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s866">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s867">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s868">So you're in Newark in someone's home.</span> <span id="s869">You say you stay there for some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We rented a room there.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">A: When we got here, the Jewish Council gave my mother -- I think it was $30 or $33 and a newspaper to get a job.</span> <span id="s873">So she didn't know the language, she spoke no English, and had no training in anything really that she could do with our language, so she got a job as a seamstress in a factory.</span> <span id="s874">She was also instructed to pay those $33 back as soon as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: Hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s876">A: And I don't remember -- the rent wasn't that high, but it was by a German-Jewish family that had come here before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: And they rented rooms.</span> <span id="s879">They had a very large colonial house, and they rented rooms.</span> <span id="s880">And we had basically one bedroom in their home with kitchen privileges in the basement.</span> <span id="s881">And we lived there almost close to a year.</span> <span id="s882">They sold the house, and we moved with them into their next house.</span> <span id="s883">So we stayed with these people for quite a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s884">Q: And, if you could, Mrs. Gelfer, just give me sort of a sketch of what your life was like down the years after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s885">A: Well, I went to -- like, when I came here, they put me into fifth grade.</span> <span id="s886">When I left Germany, I left in third grade not knowing a word of English.</span></p> <p><span id="s887">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s888">A: You had to either learn the language quickly, or you were going to be in the fifth grade for a long time.</span> <span id="s889">So I caught on pretty quickly.</span> <span id="s890">I was a little hesitant at first to open my mouth, because in the end I was different and I was afraid people were going to laugh.</span> <span id="s891">But they weren't; they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s892">People even asked me to come over in the evening and helped me study the language.</span> <span id="s893">My mother remarried in 1952.</span> <span id="s894">She worked for a baking company, and she met my stepfather there.</span> <span id="s895">And things got a little bit easier after that.</span> <span id="s896">We moved again into Irvington.</span> <span id="s897">I did most of my growing up in Irvington, New Jersey.</span> <span id="s898">Went to grammar school, high school there.</span> <span id="s899">My mother was able to buy their own house.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: Your stepfather's name is or was?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: Archie Anklowitz.</span> <span id="s902">A-N-K-L-O-W-I-T-Z</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s904">Did he have children of his own?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: No.</span> <span id="s906">No, he didn't have children.</span> <span id="s907">____ about eight years ago.</span> <span id="s908">And my mother died in 1991.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">Q: So, after you went through American schools, did you end up going to high school, I guess, in Irvington, or?</span></p> <p><span id="s910">A: High school in Irvington, yes.</span> <span id="s911">Irvington High School.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s913">And then what happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">A: And worked for an insurance company.</span> <span id="s915">And from there on to a title company.</span> <span id="s916">I worked with attorneys doing closings in the title company.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">A: And then met my husband, Donald.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: When did you guys get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: 1967 -- '66 -- I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: And do you have any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s923">We have a daughter, 26 -- Karen.</span> <span id="s924">And a son, Steven, who's just about 24.</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Good name.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: And do you work with your daughter now?</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: No, my daughter's in advertising.</span> <span id="s929">She's on her own.</span> <span id="s930">My son just graduated college.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">Q: What's he studying?</span> <span id="s932">What's he doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s933">A: He's working for a company doing computer work.</span> <span id="s934">And eventually he wants to go on to a -- he's going back to school to do a bit more learning on computer science.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s936">I bet he could figure out how to work this tape recorder.</span> <span id="s937">And what kind of work are you doing now?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Oh, I work for Sears &amp; Roebuck.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s940">And Mr. Gelfer, what kind of work do you do?</span> <span id="s941">Speaker H: I retired about a year ago.</span> <span id="s942">About two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: From the post office.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s945">Let's go back, if we could, to your mother, which is obviously important influence and told you a lot of things about -- and again, this is -- I know we've sort of gone through some of it already, some of the things that she told you.</span> <span id="s946">Are there any other kinds of -- and, I guess, if we take them chronologically -- sort of high point -- not 'high point', that's a terrible use of words.</span> <span id="s947">But, you know, anything -- kinds of experiences that you remember she told you about that you'd like to share?</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: Basically, what I've mentioned on here are the things that I remember her telling me.</span> <span id="s949">When we came back from the concentration camp and my mother was working in the city hall, she met a young man.</span> <span id="s950">She was lonely.</span> <span id="s951">And they started to build a relationship.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: He was Hungarian, I believe.</span> <span id="s954">And he asked her to marry him.</span> <span id="s955">And he knew that my mother had put in a visa to come to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s956">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">A: And he kept putting the marriage off and said, "When you get your visa, we'll go together.</span> <span id="s958">We'll go together."</span> <span id="s959">And one day she got a letter to come down to fill out some more forms -- some kind of formality.</span> <span id="s960">And she went down -- and I can't quite remember how it was, but she was in the office and she had to put down how many people were going to come to the United States with her.</span> <span id="s961">And she put down "and her fiancé," and put down the person's name.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: And the young man working behind the desk looked at the name and was kind of bewildered.</span> <span id="s964">And he said, "Just a minute."</span> <span id="s965">He went out of the room, and he came back again, and he said, "I have something I have to tell you.</span> <span id="s966">I don't know how to put it.</span> <span id="s967">But this man has been engaged several times to Jewish women who want to get out of the country.</span> <span id="s968">We're looking for him.</span> <span id="s969">He's one of the biggest Nazi war criminals.</span> <span id="s970">A man trying to use women to get out of the country."</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Did she -- was she able to give him his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: She did give him the name, but then she just -- she didn't say anything to him.</span> <span id="s973">She just broke it off with him.</span> <span id="s974">Luckily we were able to leave right -- soon after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Do you remember what his name was?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: That's all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: It's a real Hungarian name.</span> <span id="s979">I wouldn't remember his last name anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s981">But you remember him -- I mean, you remember coming to the house, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Oh, yes -- I remember him.</span> <span id="s983">Yes.</span> <span id="s984">Very charming.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s986">And he wasn't the only one probably.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: No.</span> <span id="s988">No.</span> <span id="s989">And, of course, these women were very lonely.</span> <span id="s990">They were young women.</span> <span id="s991">Very vulnerable to emotions.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s993">Did your mother tell you much as you got older about what she needed to do to hide her identity in Berlin, you know, before you were taken to Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s994">A: What do you mean by "hide her identity?"</span></p> <p><span id="s995">Q: Well, not so much --</span></p> <p><span id="s996">A: I mean, she had to wear the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: She wore that -- I mean, she had to wear that.</span> <span id="s999">She was in forced labor.</span> <span id="s1000">So, when she walked in, she kind of had that star on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: So basically she lived in -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, Mrs. Gelfer, but she lived in Berlin as a Jew.</span> <span id="s1002">I mean, she was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1004">Yes.</span> <span id="s1005">Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1006">Well, everyone knew that she was a Jew.</span> <span id="s1007">Her neighbors knew she was a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">Q: I guess we're discussing now just a little about your mother's experience in Berlin, just in '38, '39 time period.</span> <span id="s1009">But as you recall, she told you -- I mean, she had to do everything that was required.</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: She had to do everything.</span> <span id="s1011">One time she told me that she went out, and she had to go deliver something to her town hall.</span> <span id="s1012">And there was a Nazi officer there.</span> <span id="s1013">And she wasn't wearing her star.</span> <span id="s1014">She was just -- she just said she had it.</span> <span id="s1015">She wanted to use public transportation to get there, and she took the star off.</span> <span id="s1016">She didn't think she was going to get asked into the office.</span> <span id="s1017">She thought she would just drop this off and turn around.</span> <span id="s1018">Well, they asked her to go in, and there was this big Nazi officer sitting there.</span> <span id="s1019">And he looked at her, and he said -- started to question her -- and she got very nervous.</span> <span id="s1020">And he said, he was just ready to ask her, "Aren't you a Jew?"</span> <span id="s1021">when the phone rang.</span> <span id="s1022">And he got the message that they captured ten or 12 Jews and they were able to execute them, and he was just delighted with that.</span> <span id="s1023">My mother just ran for the hills -- just took off.</span> <span id="s1024">Ran out of there.</span> <span id="s1025">He was so distracted by that.</span> <span id="s1026">But other than that, she had to wear the star at all times.</span> <span id="s1027">My grandmother didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">Q: Grandmother did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">A: No, Grandmother did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Did you get -- you were taken to Theresienstadt what -- 1942, '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: No, I'm sorry, '44 -- September 1944, and we were released in June '45.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1033">Do you have any sense, Mrs. Gelfer, how many Jews there were in Berlin in 1944?</span> <span id="s1034">I mean, I know you were really young, but did your mother sort of say "There were a lot of us around," or?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No.</span> <span id="s1036">No, not that I remember.</span> <span id="s1037">I didn't even know what a Jew was at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">Right.</span> <span id="s1040">But I mean, from your mother's recollection, it just -- it seems --</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: Only from what she told me that when she was younger the circle of friends she had, people that she went to school with.</span> <span id="s1042">She traveled -- not to sound snobbish, but she used to travel in artistic circle.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: And college professors.</span> <span id="s1045">And they were all literary people.</span> <span id="s1046">Most of them were Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: And she lost track of all of them.</span> <span id="s1049">Except for this one couple that I mentioned.</span> <span id="s1050">We did meet -- when we came over, one day we were walking in New York -- one of the main shopping streets going shopping, my mother and I. And this woman passed her and stopped, and she stopped.</span> <span id="s1051">And they looked at each other and said, "You look familiar."</span> <span id="s1052">And it was a next, a friend or an acquaintance from Berlin that she really had lost total contact with.</span> <span id="s1053">And they met in the streets of New York of all places.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s1055">Small world sometimes.</span> <span id="s1056">It's kind of crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Do you know how your grandmother was able to survive in Berlin while you guys were gone?</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: She had food stamps.</span> <span id="s1060">Her sister's son was very helpful to her.</span> <span id="s1061">He lived a couple blocks away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: And since he was Protestant, he had food.</span> <span id="s1064">And there was even people in Germany at that time.</span> <span id="s1065">And he helped her out and watched over her, visited her and watched over her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: Now, these relatives -- the German relatives so to speak -- do you keep in touch with any of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: I call this person Uncle Julie.</span> <span id="s1068">He's 10 years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s1069">As I say, it was my grandmother's sister's son.</span> <span id="s1070">Being that much older than I, he became my Uncle Julie.</span> <span id="s1071">When my mother established herself a little bit over here, she got a visa for him to come over.</span> <span id="s1072">She had a job waiting for him.</span> <span id="s1073">She did the same bakery, which was a large place where they make pies in case it wasn't a small bakery.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">Q: More commercial.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">A: Commercial type.</span> <span id="s1076">Baking institution.</span> <span id="s1077">And she got a visa and got him over.</span> <span id="s1078">And then his stepdaughter -- he had married this woman that was a bit younger who many times saved me by just grabbing me at night when my mother would go over and say, "They're looking for us -- hide in one place.</span> <span id="s1079">But it's Tana that they're really looking for."</span> <span id="s1080">And she walked with me endlessly -- blocks, whatever -- kept me in her house.</span> <span id="s1081">And she had two children.</span> <span id="s1082">And until it became very uncomfortable for her.</span> <span id="s1083">Of course, her kids were blue-eyed; they were blond, German-looking.</span> <span id="s1084">Just the opposite of me.</span> <span id="s1085">No way could I pass as one of her children.</span> <span id="s1086">And my mother finally said to her, "Don't do this; you're going to get yourself into trouble.</span> <span id="s1087">I won't allow it.</span> <span id="s1088">You have two small children."</span> <span id="s1089">And just Julie married this lady.</span> <span id="s1090">She had two children from a previous marriage.</span> <span id="s1091">Her husband was killed in the war before that.</span> <span id="s1092">And my mother brought him over.</span> <span id="s1093">And then his stepdaughter.</span> <span id="s1094">And then later on his son and his stepson.</span> <span id="s1095">So they all came over.</span> <span id="s1096">My mother slowly with visas brought them over.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: And I assume that he's probably passed away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: Yes, he's passed away.</span> <span id="s1099">He's ten years older than my mother.</span> <span id="s1100">Passed away.</span> <span id="s1101">And his wife also passed away.</span> <span id="s1102">I am still in contact with his son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1104">Who lives in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: Actually, his stepson too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">A: Yes, they're all in New Jersey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1109">What about your father's family -- do you know anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">A: Nothing at all -- never heard about them.</span> <span id="s1111">And my mother figured if his father would have survived or his brother, they knew where we lived.</span> <span id="s1112">We never moved away from Grimmstrasse, we would have thought they would have tried to get in touch with us.</span> <span id="s1113">My mother tried to inquire several places and times and was never able to find out anything about them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1115">She had to assume they just didn't make it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">Q: The store that she had -- your mother had in Berlin -- the children's store.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">A: She ran it herself.</span> <span id="s1119">My uncle -- Uncle Julie -- he at that time was also in the business of making pocketbooks.</span> <span id="s1120">He was a fashion designer initially, but with the war went down the drain.</span> <span id="s1121">But he made pocketbooks and odds and ends like that.</span> <span id="s1122">So he was able to get her materials to make the things.</span> <span id="s1123">My grandmother made the panties and outfits in our home.</span> <span id="s1124">I remember sitting and snipping with scissors, kept me busy snipping them apart as she sewed them on the machine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: But it was owned -- I mean, it was one of the Jewish-owned businesses that was identified as a Jewish-owned business; do you recall?</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: No, she owned the store until it was destroyed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1128">Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1129">Your mother did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">A: Yes, because my grandfather had a will and the money he left in the will she used towards that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: Basically, when we came back, the only people aside from the family, what there was -- a member that was there that remembered us and waited for us was -- when I mentioned before this family that met us in Theresienstadt -- Fritz Simon.</span> <span id="s1133">Her brother survived.</span> <span id="s1134">He was in Germany.</span> <span id="s1135">He went into a mental institution and declared himself insane to hide.</span> <span id="s1136">And he spent three and a half years in a mental institution.</span> <span id="s1137">And the only one on to him was his nurse -- not a Jewish woman.</span> <span id="s1138">And she kept his secret.</span> <span id="s1139">Unfortunately, after three and a half years of living in a mental institution, his problems were just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s1140">He did come out.</span> <span id="s1141">He did marry her.</span> <span id="s1142">She stopped by him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">Q: The nurse.</span></p> <p><span id="s1144">A: The nurse.</span> <span id="s1145">His whole emotional being was -- problems after a while.</span> <span id="s1146">You don't live among insane people for that long.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Or fake to be insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: And fake to be insane.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Hmm.</span> <span id="s1150">It's got to take its toll.</span> <span id="s1151">I mean, it's obviously an act of desperation.</span> <span id="s1152">Do you remember any actual physical abuse at Theresienstadt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: No.</span> <span id="s1154">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1156">Just obviously deprivation -- no food --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">A: Just mental.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: -- and seeing the violence, the hardship.</span> <span id="s1159">Mr. Gelfer, you mention that there was 100 survivors from Theresienstadt.</span> <span id="s1160">Is that -- how did you know that?</span> <span id="s1161">100 survivors of children, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">A: It's a figure that's just been released into books.</span> <span id="s1163">I have the book, "I Never Saw Another Butterfly," which I bought in the museum here, because my husband bought it for me when we were here for the opening.</span> <span id="s1164">Which is a book of paintings and poems by children who didn't survive.</span> <span id="s1165">And the preface mentions also the figure.</span> <span id="s1166">But how accurate they are -- I know, but I always heard the same figure.</span> <span id="s1167">It's always been 15,000 and 100 survived.</span> <span id="s1168">15,000 that went through the camp at one time from the beginning to the end -- not that they were all there at the same time -- that went through.</span> <span id="s1169">And most of them went to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1171">At some point.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: So I guess records were kept, because it's always been the same record -- the same figures.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Now, you say that people knew about the gas chambers -- about the gassing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: That I heard from my mother the night before.</span> <span id="s1175">And it was -- she says it was just hysteria.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">Q: Mm-hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">A: And disbelief that they were there so long they weren't going to make it.</span> <span id="s1178">And, from what I heard is that the American Red Cross got word that this was going to be the end of the camp and they were going to destroy this whole camp with everybody in it.</span> <span id="s1179">They didn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in '45.</span> <span id="s1180">And they didn't want any visible signs of this camp.</span> <span id="s1181">Theresienstadt was a fortress at one time.</span> <span id="s1182">Just outside of Prague, a small town in the countryside of Prague, and was used as an army fortress.</span> <span id="s1183">And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it.</span> <span id="s1184">So when this war is over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would be nothing left to say, "Yes, there was something there at one time."</span> <span id="s1185">And they had to do this kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon.</span> <span id="s1186">And so, they had to act very quickly.</span> <span id="s1187">And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: Before that.</span> <span id="s1189">Do you have any idea of why you were sent there to Theresienstadt?</span> <span id="s1190">Why you and your mother were sent there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: My mother, as I said before, was born of a -- born Protestant mother and a Jewish father.</span> <span id="s1192">My grandmother converted when she married my grandfather.</span> <span id="s1193">I think they were treading very easy at that time.</span> <span id="s1194">They didn't want to antagonize the Christians by having too many Christians killed.</span> <span id="s1195">So my grandmother would say because of her age and she wasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much harm.</span> <span id="s1196">My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in.</span> <span id="s1197">She was not born of a Jewish mother, which makes a difference.</span> <span id="s1198">Like I said before, they measured her -- the nose, the head and neck.</span> <span id="s1199">And they really -- it took them a while to say, "Well, we're going to put you in a holding camp until we can figure out what we're going to do with these mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish."</span> <span id="s1200">There were a lot of -- in Theresienstadt -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill off either.</span> <span id="s1201">We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional medal of whatever in Germany and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: People that they were just going to hold for a while and then see what happens type of thing.</span> <span id="s1204">They didn't want to leave them free, but they didn't want to send them to the death camps right away.</span> <span id="s1205">And also people like my mother that they couldn't decide quite how Jewish she was at that time.</span> <span id="s1206">I was lucky, because I was totally Jewish because -- well, almost totally Jewish, because I have a Jewish father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Mm-hmm.</span> <span id="s1208">But so it wasn't because of the fact that she was an actress, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s1209">A: I don't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1211">It sounds more like the fact she was not Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: Yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s1213">The rest was just.</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">Q: All right.</span> <span id="s1215">I think that's all I have.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Conclusion of Interview</span></p></body></html>
