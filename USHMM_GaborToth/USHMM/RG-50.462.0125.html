I was a surveyor, and also a cannoneer for our particular gun.</span> <span id="s26">To give you an idea of what our twelve guns did during that nine month period that we were in steady combat, we fired 45,361 rounds of shells into enemy territory.</span> <span id="s27">And we served under the French First Army in the Colmar area in February of 1945.</span> <span id="s28">We also served with the American First in Cologne, Germany in March of 1945, and we finally crossed the Rhine River with our Howitzers and Ducks [flat boats] and into the south of Stuttgart in Germany.</span> <span id="s29">And we saw many destroyed cities, suffering people, dead soldiers, American and German--and civilians.</span> <span id="s30">All of the horrors of war did I witness.</span> <span id="s31">On March the 26th, 1945 we crossed the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s32">We were, again, we were among the first artillery units to cross the Rhine River again in the area of Worms, Germany.</span> <span id="s33">And in April, well, I'll stop right there.</span> <span id="s34">[tape off then on]</span></p> <p><span id="s35">PS: Harry, when you--after you started your journey starting in France, do you want to give us a little idea of your, the route and the major points that you and your outfit traveled?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">HZ: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s37">Well, we assembled in England, and also Wales.</span> <span id="s38">And from there, by that time, the invasion of France had already begun and we were preparing to land in France on August the 10th, of 1944.</span> <span id="s39">And we landed on Utah Beach.</span> <span id="s40">And then, from, by that time Épinal was taken by the American forces and after that we started our way through, we went through Verdun, France, and Enkhuizen, Holland, and then we went into Bettendorf, Germany then into Colmar, France, which was, there was a very large battle there.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">PS: The Colmar pocket?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">HZ: The Colmar pocket, right.</span> <span id="s43">And, by that time, that was in February the 6th, 1945.</span> <span id="s44">And then we entered Germany for the first time in Bettendorf, on November the 21st, 1944.</span> <span id="s45">At that time that was part of the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s46">And luckily, I understand that about 100 American soldiers were massacred at the Battle of the Bulge by the German forces.</span> <span id="s47">And we were blocking, we were just north of there in Holland, protecting the flank, while the Germans then made a deep pocket into the American lines.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">PS: O.K. Before you arrived at the site of the concentration camp, did you know of the existence of this particular camp that you eventually participated in the liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s49">HZ: No.</span> <span id="s50">I had no idea of any camp or the name of the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">PS: Also, before you arrived at the camp, had you heard anything at all about the mass murder of Jews and political prisoners, prisoners of war and so forth, in Germany and occupied countries?</span></p> <p><span id="s52">HZ: Mmm hmm.</span> <span id="s53">I went into the army in June of 1943.</span> <span id="s54">The war had started September the 1st, 1941.</span> <span id="s55">And during that time, I was a teenager, and as a civilian I did not hear anything regarding any genocide or murdering of any people.</span> <span id="s56">The only thing I can remember was back in 1939 [coughs] excuse me, when I would hear Hitler by short wave radio, talking about what he was going to do for Germany and what he's going to do to the Jews.</span> <span id="s57">But it never entered my mind, the outcome, and the results as to what Hitler called the Final Solution.</span> <span id="s58">But up until then I knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s59">Prior to going into the army I knew nothing about it.</span> <span id="s60">While I was in the army, all through the training period, all through the combat time, The Stars and Stripes, the military mag-, newspaper never mentioned anything about it.</span> <span id="s61">I never read it in the papers or magazines or anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">PS: Harry, when you arrived in France and proceeded your advance through France, Holland, Belgium, then into Germany, during that period did you see anything that, again, that gave you any picture of what was, what laid before you in the way of Nazi atrocities in France, Holland, Belgium, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s63">HZ: The first Nazi atrocity that I heard about, which was very disturbing, and I will, I'll repeat myself, was when they just murdered 100 American soldiers in the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">HZ: They didn't even take them prisoner.</span> <span id="s66">They just murdered them.</span> <span id="s67">That was the first inkling that I had...</span></p> <p><span id="s68">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">HZ: ...of a German atrocity.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">PS: And during that period, you saw no evidence of German atrocity against civilians?</span></p> <p><span id="s71">HZ: No I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">PS: At that point.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">HZ: No I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">PS: Then as you advanced, did you come in contact with displaced persons or prisoners of war?</span> <span id="s75">Did you...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">HZ: This was in southern Germany.</span> <span id="s77">I did come across, while we were in, on the road going into our next battle site there was a man that approached me and it seemed like he had, he was, he broke out into his own freedom.</span> <span id="s78">And he didn't have any shoes on.</span> <span id="s79">And he approached me.</span> <span id="s80">He said, "You see that castle up there on the hill?</span> <span id="s81">I'd like you as an American soldier to go in there with your rifle and demand that they give me a pair of shoes."</span> <span id="s82">So I said to him, and in speaking Yiddish I was able to converse in German a little bit, and I said, "I'm sorry, but I can't break the law because I could be court marshaled for doing something like that."</span> <span id="s83">And, years later it occurred to me just in that one incident that here I was as an individual, as a soldier, who was also trained to kill in offence or defense, yet I had a conscience that I could not break the law.</span> <span id="s84">And here, later on, what I saw of Germany and how they broke international law, it, I, I just, it, I can't make any sense of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">PS: Now I had pretty much the same experience, Harry, that with all the atrocities and cruelty that we saw, examples of German, you know, atrocities against humanity, still we had no--I can say that I never saw an American soldier mistreat a German civilian.</span> <span id="s86">We were pent up with anger, hatred, vengeance, and yet I never saw any American soldier--I think I'm proud to say that.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">HZ: I would say the same thing.</span> <span id="s88">I was--it felt good to be an American soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">PS: Harry, next, can you please give us the name of the camp that you liberated, and its location?</span> <span id="s90">Also the date, if possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">HZ: Well, on March the 26th, 1945, we crossed the Rhine River, and we were among the first artillery units to cross the Rhine a second time, in the area of Worms, as I might have indicated before.</span> <span id="s92">And we came, we fought our way into Munich, but not into the center part of Munich.</span> <span id="s93">It was a little town called Feldmoching, F-E-L-D-M-O-C-H-I-N-G.</span> <span id="s94">And in that area we saw many, many dead Germans and wrecked equipment and destroyed villages.</span> <span id="s95">And we ourselves, we were under tremendous fire from the German 88s.</span> <span id="s96">We could, we were in this open field and we could actually see the town of Munich in the distance.</span> <span id="s97">This was probably a suburb of it.</span> <span id="s98">Well that morning, I myself almost lost my life because an artillery shell landed about 30 feet from where I was.</span> <span id="s99">But I came out all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">PS: A German shell.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">HZ: A German shell, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">PS: That was in the area of Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">PS: Then at that point were you aware of the concentration camp at Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">HZ: No, I was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">PS: You--it was that day that your unit and you personally saw the concentration camp of Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HZ: It was that, at that time, I don't know exactly whether it was on March the 17th, but it was around that time.</span> <span id="s108">We were in that area--we, and we did--by the way, we did, also we had to cross the Danube...</span></p> <p><span id="s109">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">HZ: ...in order to get into Feldmoching or Munich.</span> <span id="s111">And Feldmoching is in the north-east section of Munich, and it's, as I said it's a small town.</span> <span id="s112">We were there in that area from April the 25th until April the 30th of 1945.</span> <span id="s113">I cannot identify the exact day...</span></p> <p><span id="s114">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">HZ: ...when I saw Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">PS: I, it was during that period.</span> <span id="s117">I think it was roughly around April 25th that Dachau was liberated.</span> <span id="s118">Can, to the best of your memory, can you describe the scene when you first saw the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s120">Well, after the Battle of Munich, we...</span></p> <p><span id="s121">PS: At the time you...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">HZ: For some reason or other, our unit commanders said that they would like us to go by a camp.</span> <span id="s123">I didn't know what the name of the camp was.</span> <span id="s124">So, we went in small groups and it might have been April the 25th.</span> <span id="s125">I mean, well, let me see [pause] I still can't identify the date that I was there.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s127">Well, at that time, Harry, American troops had already been in Dachau, right?</span> <span id="s128">I don't believe there was any resistance when the first American troops went in and occupied Dachau, so this was, would you say a day, the same day, or...</span></p> <p><span id="s129">HZ: Well, with hindsight, going back and reflecting on this, I would say that, yes, the American troops were in there before our outfit got there.</span> <span id="s130">It could have been the infantry, because we followed right up behind them...</span></p> <p><span id="s131">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">HZ: ...as light artillery.</span> <span id="s133">So, when we arrived there, in Dachau, there was no military personnel at all, from either side, either the Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s134">PS: Oh no Americans...</span></p> <p><span id="s135">HZ: ...or Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">PS: Or Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">HZ: No.</span> <span id="s138">No, none at all.</span> <span id="s139">But what I..</span> <span id="s140">.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">PS: When you were in the prison, the concentration camp of Dachau, you saw, there were still prisoners, liberated prisoners who were still there in Dachau, that had not yet been...</span></p> <p><span id="s142">HZ: Mmm hmm.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">PS: ...been sent to distribution points or, in other words, were there still concentration camp survivors still within the camp when you...</span></p> <p><span id="s144">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s145">Yes I, there were, but if I might just back track...</span></p> <p><span id="s146">PS: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">HZ: ...before entering Dachau.</span> <span id="s148">When we drove up to the camp, we didn't, we did not enter the camp.</span> <span id="s149">There was a line of boxcars.</span> <span id="s150">It was two blocks long.</span> <span id="s151">We saw the doors were opened of all the boxcars.</span> <span id="s152">And the boxcars were filled with dead bodies, right from the floor right up to the top--on--one heap of bodies on top of another.</span> <span id="s153">And there were even, I'll never forget this because this picture remains in my mind up till today, it was where the, where the two boxcars connect, there was a man sitting in between the, where the boxcars connect, and he was sitting on the outside of it.</span> <span id="s154">And he was dead, of course.</span> <span id="s155">And one leg was cut off and there was toilet paper wrapped around the area of the amputation.</span> <span id="s156">And I was, when I saw that--there were about five other of my fellow soldiers there--and when I saw that I was, those boxcars, I was completely confused.</span> <span id="s157">I didn't really understand it.</span> <span id="s158">I didn't understand what I saw.</span> <span id="s159">I couldn't bring the story together as to why these boxcars filled with bodies were there.</span> <span id="s160">Of course, we know the story now, but at that instant moment it was alrea-, I was, in the morning hours I could not understand what was going on.</span> <span id="s161">But one of my fellow soldiers said to me, and we had been in training for two-and-a-half years, he said, "You see those dead bodies, Zaslow, Zaslow?"</span> <span id="s162">he said, "They're all Jews," he said, "and if you're not careful you're gonna land up in there too."</span></p> <p><span id="s163">PS: This was one of your...</span></p> <p><span id="s164">HZ: One of my buddies.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">PS: Harry, you say, when you saw these bodies in the many, many boxcars, was it your impression that they were being transported to Dachau and died en route, or that they were bodies that had been, a peop-, of the concentration camp victims who died and they were--their bodies were put into the boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">HZ: Well, I had assumed that they died while in transit...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">PS: To, being transported to...</span></p> <p><span id="s168">HZ: To, to be transported...</span></p> <p><span id="s169">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">HZ: ...to wherever they were going.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">HZ: And I still didn't understand why they--this was on the outside of the camp--and I did not understand what these boxcars, where they were going and what they were going to do with the bodies.</span> <span id="s173">And I'm, without--I would estimate that there were maybe about, for each boxcar I think there must have been about at least 200 people dead in each boxcar.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">PS: [unclear].</span></p> <p><span id="s175">HZ: They jammed them in like sardines.</span> <span id="s176">And there was about, I would say there was about, maybe a, seven or eight boxcars, times three, times three hundred...</span></p> <p><span id="s177">PS: Seven or eight boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">HZ: Seven or eight...</span></p> <p><span id="s179">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">HZ: Boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">PS: Yeah, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">HZ: Yeah, which I estimate there must have been about 200 bodies in each one, so that would be like 1400 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">PS: Do you think it's probable, or possible, that they were being transported from another area that had, was being overrun, were being transported to Dachau, in order to keep ahead of the American forces coming down into that area, and that they were probably on the--in those cars for many, many days with no food, no water, and actually were being transported to Dachau for extermination.</span> <span id="s184">And, of course, they obviously were exterminated in the boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">HZ: Well, I can only go with the mind of a 19 year old soldier, and that's what I was at that time.</span> <span id="s186">Of course I'm very well-versed and knowledgeable on this problem, and of course I can make statements now, during the course of the past forty years as to what actually happened.</span> <span id="s187">I do know what happened.</span> <span id="s188">But what I'm trying to relate to you is the shock that I had, and the confusion at that moment when I saw it.</span> <span id="s189">Naturally they were being transported ahead of the Allied soldiers, ahead of the British and the...</span></p> <p><span id="s190">PS: Yeah, that's correct.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">HZ: ...the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s192">But we didn't know that.</span> <span id="s193">They--so, in hindsight I would think that what the Germans were doing was that they were trying to pull back even the evidence of the murder that they--the murderous acts that they did against the Jews and they didn't want the Allies to see it.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">PS: And, you know, for a 19 year old boy to suddenly be confronted with sights like that, with no forewarning.</span> <span id="s195">You had no idea at all of what lay before you as you advanced into that area.</span> <span id="s196">So the shock must have been tremendous.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">PS: Then you were in the prison itself, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">HZ: Well then we walked in...</span></p> <p><span id="s200">PS: Inside Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s202">We walked in through the gates of Dachau.</span> <span id="s203">And right at the entrance of the gate there was a Nazi S.S. storm trooper, pretty heavy built with a beautiful, clean uniform.</span> <span id="s204">He was lying dead on the ground.</span> <span id="s205">And I sort of like nudged him with my army boot to see if he was alive or not, but he was completely dead.</span> <span id="s206">But I would assume that he was not dead for more than a few hours.</span> <span id="s207">That was the only German that I saw, an S.S. trooper.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">PS: Within the camp did you see any survivors that were still...</span></p> <p><span id="s209">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">PS: ...within the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s211">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s212">We walked into the court of Dachau.</span> <span id="s213">I didn't see any of the lodgings of the inmates.</span> <span id="s214">I didn't see any, all I saw was there was a very large court, I guess like a half a city block, surrounded by buildings, four square.</span> <span id="s215">And there was a, I assume that there was German headquarters for the camp on one side, and then on the left and the right side, there were office buildings there and on the other side facing the headquarters was another building, which I did not realize what was in it.</span> <span id="s216">But it was the most terrible sight that I ever saw once I entered that building.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">PS: Did you see in going through Dachau, did you see the instruments of death?</span> <span id="s218">In other words, the gas chambers, the crematorium, the...</span></p> <p><span id="s219">HZ: The only thing that I saw was a room, there were three rooms.</span> <span id="s220">The middle room had three ovens in there.</span> <span id="s221">And we--the doors were open, and they were going full blast.</span> <span id="s222">It reminded me of a bakery shop, when one would put, when a baker would put a loaf of bread into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s223">PS: They were going full blast at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">HZ: They were going full blast, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">PS: They were still going.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">HZ: I would estimate that we arrived maybe about three to four hours after the Germans were chased out.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">PS: Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s228">I didn't realize that you had...</span></p> <p><span id="s229">HZ: We didn't fight our way into the, we didn't fight our way into Dachau...</span></p> <p><span id="s230">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">HZ: What happened was that I can remember later, when the infantry, the American infantry chased the German soldiers, or the Nazis, out of Dachau, they went, they took flight into Munich for refuge, and for military protection under the German army.</span> <span id="s232">And that's why when our outfit arrived, that's why we had such a big battle with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">PS: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">HZ: But they--that battle was after they abandoned Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">PS: Dachau, and went into...</span></p> <p><span id="s236">HZ: And they went into Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">PS: Were there any bodies, any corpses still within the camp when you arrived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">PS: Any of the dead, in addition of course to the boxcars.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s241">We entered this building which was on one side of the courtyard.</span> <span id="s242">As I mentioned before, it had three rooms in there.</span> <span id="s243">The middle room was the three ovens, and all three ovens were working steady.</span> <span id="s244">Now there were two with bodies being burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">PS: Bodies were still in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">HZ: Yeah, they were being burned.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">HZ: And facing the ovens, the room to the right was filled to the top with bodies.</span> <span id="s249">Some were old and decayed.</span> <span id="s250">There were many of them that were, many bodies that were freshly killed.</span> <span id="s251">And that was on the right room.</span> <span id="s252">And on the left room, on the other side of the room that had the ovens, it was the same situation.</span> <span id="s253">In fact some people were murdered maybe an hour, a half an hour before we arrived.</span> <span id="s254">They were just...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">PS: That close.</span> <span id="s256">You were that...</span></p> <p><span id="s257">HZ: They were right on top.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">PS: ...that close on the heels of the fleeing guards.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">HZ: Yeah.</span> <span id="s260">They...</span></p> <p><span id="s261">PS: Now with your estimate of seven or eight boxcars with, you said upwards of 200 bodies in each boxcar...</span></p> <p><span id="s262">HZ: In each boxcar, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">PS: Which would be say, upwards of 1500 bodies just in the boxcars, can you give any estimate of the number of bodies that you saw within Dachau and the train, the boxcars?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">HZ: Yes.</span> <span id="s265">Well, each room was about, I'd say about 10' by 12' in size.</span> <span id="s266">They had--and there were two rooms like that, on either side of the ovens.</span> <span id="s267">And the bodies were stacked, and they, the ceiling was about eight feet high.</span> <span id="s268">And the bodies were stacked about six-and-a-half, seven feet high.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">PS: Those rooms were...</span></p> <p><span id="s270">HZ: From wall to wall.</span> <span id="s271">Wall to wall with bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">PS: Those rooms were not the gas chambers?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">HZ: They were adjacent to the gas...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">PS: Adjacent to the...</span></p> <p><span id="s275">HZ: No the, I didn't see any gas chambers.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">PS: Oh oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">HZ: All I did was, I saw the three ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">HZ: That’s all I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">PS: And the rooms where they had the bodies ready to go into the ovens.</span></p> <p><span id="s281">HZ: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">PS: So your estimate could be pretty well up into many thousands just of unburned bodies that you saw there.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">PS: Did you have any responsibilities, had you been assigned any personal responsibilities in, any arrangements or transfer or anything to do with the few survivors that were still there?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">HZ: I..</span> <span id="s286">.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">PS: In caring, in the caring or, either feeding or medical care or transfer of these survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">HZ: We were in Dachau for about two hours.</span> <span id="s289">And we didn't see any survivors that--well there's another description I'd like to give you.</span> <span id="s290">It's the one I saw in the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">PS: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">HZ: The courtyard was spotless, absolutely clean.</span> <span id="s293">And it was--the camp was very well managed.</span> <span id="s294">And it was almost like sanitized.</span> <span id="s295">What a contradiction between having a clean, sanitary buildings on one side and having death on the other side.</span> <span id="s296">And I believe that the keep--the innkeepers, the Dachau innkeepers there--I call them innkeepers--what would they be called?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">PS: The guards, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">HZ: The guards, the people who worked there, the Germans that worked there.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">HZ: Yeah.</span> <span id="s301">In order to prevent any epidemic from spreading through the camp, which would include the Germans themselves, from what I saw, they worked very hard to dis-, to burn the bodies and dispose of them as quickly as they possibly could, working around the clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">PS: It's surprising.</span> <span id="s303">Well, the reports I've had concerning most of the camps, that disease was rampant.</span> <span id="s304">The filth, that in the courtyards that you described, that bodies, even the--some of the survivors were just laying there in their own filth.</span> <span id="s305">So you found very sanitary conditions on the exterior of the buildings?</span></p> <p><span id="s306">HZ: I was in the area where...</span></p> <p><span id="s307">PS: Of the courtyard.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">HZ: ...the Commandant would...</span></p> <p><span id="s309">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">HZ: He was running the camp.</span> <span id="s311">They were running the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">PS: Right, yeah.</span> <span id="s313">Like a parade ground.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">HZ: Like a parade ground, right.</span> <span id="s315">I was not deep into the...</span></p> <p><span id="s316">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">HZ: ...into the camp itself.</span> <span id="s318">I didn't see any of the quarters where the inmates slept or anything like that.</span> <span id="s319">I didn't see bunks.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">PS: Harry, did you have any personal contact with living survivors, and if so, could you give me a reaction of prisoners who had just been, you'd say liberated two, like two or three hours?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">HZ: Yes, well, we had another experience when we first walked in there, into the courtyard.</span> <span id="s322">The--my description of the ovens came second, but I'd like to tell you what I saw first.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">PS: Yeah, surely.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">HZ: O.K.</span> <span id="s325">In the courtyard there were about 18 men, lined up in military fashion, standing at attention.</span> <span id="s326">They did not--some of them wore like half uniforms, German uniforms.</span> <span id="s327">Some of them did not.</span> <span id="s328">There were about I'd say about 14 or 15 inmates that were there, and they, those inmates had these, this lineup of the people, these soldiers, they had them in, they had them lined up standing at attention.</span> <span id="s329">And from the...</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s331">PS: Harry Zaslow.</span> <span id="s332">Harry, will you continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">HZ: Sure.</span> <span id="s334">Yeah.</span> <span id="s335">When we entered into the courtyard, there was this big fellow, and he was speaking Polish.</span> <span id="s336">And he looked pretty healthy.</span> <span id="s337">But he was an inmate himself, and he just, when he saw me, he said, "Amerikanski!"</span> <span id="s338">And he just embraced me so hard and so tight that my helmet fell off of my head [chuckles].</span> <span id="s339">And he invited us into the courtyard where these 18 German soldiers were standing at attention.</span> <span id="s340">But later on, I found out that they were not German soldiers.</span> <span id="s341">I believe that the S.S. troops, they were in charge of that camp too.</span> <span id="s342">There were S.S. soldiers there.</span> <span id="s343">These were S.S. soldiers, but they were not German.</span> <span id="s344">They came from all over Europe.</span> <span id="s345">And the 18 that we saw lined up there, they were Polish, they were French...</span></p> <p><span id="s346">PS: But they were serving in the German S.S.?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">HZ: They were, that's right.</span> <span id="s348">They were serving the German S.S. and they were probably managing the Dachau camp.</span> <span id="s349">And the inmates, I'm very much surprised even till this day that, when they were liberated, those, within those few hours, I was really surprised that they really didn't murder those...</span></p> <p><span id="s350">PS: Yeah, most...</span></p> <p><span id="s351">HZ: Those foreign S.S. troopers.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">PS: I'm surprised to hear that too, because most of the reports we've had is that those German S.S. or guards who did not escape fast enough were just, you know, literally ripped to pieces.</span> <span id="s353">There were some exceptions.</span> <span id="s354">In fact we've heard there were some guards quick grabbed uniforms that, you know, the striped uniforms of concentration camp inmates and tried to escape.</span> <span id="s355">But the inmates recognized them and...</span></p> <p><span id="s356">HZ: Really.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">PS: ...killed them.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">HZ: Well, I don't know why the inmates there treated them, allowed them to continue living.</span> <span id="s359">Maybe it was because they knew that these troopers, these S.S. troops were not German.</span> <span id="s360">And maybe that influenced them not to kill them.</span> <span id="s361">Or they could have, they probably were mistreated but not, maybe not to the extent that an S.S. German trooper would do.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">PS: Was there any verbal communication between men within your unit and these S.S. guards who were lined up?</span></p> <p><span id="s363">HZ: No, we just watched the military procedures.</span> <span id="s364">They were putting them through various movements, military movements.</span> <span id="s365">The inmates were ordering these S.S. guards--I call them foreign troops...</span></p> <p><span id="s366">PS: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">HZ: They were ordering them to perform various military movements.</span> <span id="s368">And if they did not respond in a military fashion--as an example, one of them, I guess they told him in German, at least they had, and they said, the inmate, one of the inmates said to the eighteen lined up, "If you, if any one of you just flick your eyes or your, you will be beaten severely."</span> <span id="s369">And so they couldn't even close their eyes.</span> <span id="s370">They had to stand there at attention.</span> <span id="s371">But one of them did not.</span> <span id="s372">He fluttered his eyes, and they pulled him out of rank, and they pulled down his pants, and they whipped him severely.</span> <span id="s373">And we were observing that.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">PS: Well at that point, Harry, didn't the American command take over and consider them as prisoners of war and take them into custody as PWs?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">HZ: I think we were there before then.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">PS: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">HZ: We were-- [tape off then on] I would say that at the time, at the moment that we were in the camp, it was utter chaos.</span> <span id="s378">It was a matter of the inmates at that moment taking control of the camp and of the guards, whoever remained there.</span> <span id="s379">And when we arrived, there were no American military police.</span> <span id="s380">There were, there was nobody that was official to take over the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">PS: You were really on the scene very early.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">PS: Which means, at that point, naturally you did not come equipped with food and medical supplies to treat the survivors.</span> <span id="s384">Had anything come into the camp prior to your arrival for the survivors, for feeding and medical treatment?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">HZ: I didn't see any of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">PS: Probably not.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">HZ: But the inmates that we saw were well-fed.</span> <span id="s388">There must have been an arrangement between the camp commandant and these inmates where they were the enforcers of the prisoners...</span></p> <p><span id="s389">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">HZ: ...in the camp.</span> <span id="s391">So they were in pretty good health.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">PS: Yeah.</span> <span id="s393">Among the survivors, did you see any children?</span></p> <p><span id="s394">HZ: No I did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">PS: No children.</span> <span id="s396">Did the experience of seeing these prisoners have any affect on your feeling about being a part of the war and fighting Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">HZ: Well when I, this was the first that I heard that a civilized nation like Germany, the first that I saw, not heard, but saw, that a civilized nation like Germany, who's known for its high technology and culture and I had known about the Germans from the '30s that they were--that it was a great nation.</span> <span id="s398">And I was really shocked to see what I saw, that it was absolutely--it was worse than barbarian, the way they treated those people and the way they had the, they committed absolute genocide in the 20th century.</span> <span id="s399">But I'm trying to--what I'm--my description here, I'm trying to describe not what I know now, but what I saw and heard in 1945.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">PS: Yeah, I agree with you, that my own experience, there was many, many instances and periods of genocide prior to World War II and the Nazi atrocities.</span> <span id="s401">But we always I think ascribed it to areas of the world we considered uncivilized.</span> <span id="s402">They were savages.</span> <span id="s403">But here, as you say, was a country like Germany, this was probably one of the most highly developed societies and cultures in the world.</span> <span id="s404">They were best, I mean their educational system and you know, their production.</span> <span id="s405">And yet, if it happened there it can happen anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">HZ: Yeah.</span> <span id="s407">I'd like to tell you now, that's the end of my story with Dachau.</span> <span id="s408">I don't know any more than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">PS: Very good, but what we...</span></p> <p><span id="s410">HZ: That's probably enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">PS: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">HZ: But I would say that around the camp of Dachau according to my memory, there were beautiful homes, mansions, all the way around.</span> <span id="s413">And there were very wealthy people that lived there.</span> <span id="s414">And, they saw the smokestacks running but...</span></p> <p><span id="s415">PS: Either they...</span></p> <p><span id="s416">HZ: Either they were helpless to do anything or they just ignored it.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">PS: Now, when you saw Dachau, or in the hours afterwards, were you aware at that time, did it enter your thinking that this was only one of many, many concentration camps, that what you were looking at was multiplied many, many times with the Treblinkas and the Auschwitz and Buchenwald?</span> <span id="s418">Did you have any idea at that time that you were looking at only one of many, many concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">HZ: I didn't have any idea about it at all.</span> <span id="s420">And neither did...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">PS: None of us did really.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">HZ: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">PS: In your own mind, can you explain German decisions that led to the setting up of concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s424">HZ: Well, there was the Nazis who were one of the most antisemitic group of people that history has ever known.</span> <span id="s425">They set out to solve the Jewish, what they, what Hitler called the Jewish Problem.</span> <span id="s426">And it's just unbelievable that he would solve the problem by murder and genocide.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">PS: Do you think, Harry, that most of the, your buddies in your outfit had about the same reaction as yours with the sights that they saw there?</span> <span id="s428">My implication is that you being Jewish, that whether others felt the same degree of horror committed against humanity in general.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">HZ: Well, I had to set up a self, psychologically, and be in combat and seeing many dead, people killed, German soldiers, Americans and civilians.</span> <span id="s430">In order to keep my psyche and my psychological balance, I had to sort of like detach myself from all that was happening, because if I did not, I would not have been able to go through it, what I went through.</span> <span id="s431">And as an example of what I just said, when we left Dachau back to our gun emplacement--which wasn't too far from Dachau--it was lunch time.</span> <span id="s432">After seeing a sight like that, smelling the burning bodies and the sight of it, I forced myself to have lunch, because I said to myself, "I can't, I've got to keep going.</span> <span id="s433">I can't have this affect me in that way where I wouldn't survive myself."</span></p> <p><span id="s434">PS: After you left Dachau, you did not see any other concentration camps, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">HZ: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">PS: Did you see, like going, did you continue south of Munich?</span></p> <p><span id="s437">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">PS: Did you see, say going through southern Bavaria, south of Munich, did you see survivors in the woods just wandering, survivors of concentration camps in their striped uniforms, just wandering through the woods looking for food or, probably afraid to go into any of the villages because they didn't know how many, how, whether or not there'd be S.S. there.</span> <span id="s439">Did you see any of the remnants of survivors, starving in the woods?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">HZ: It's, you know, really amazing that you ask that, because I saw nothing.</span> <span id="s441">And the reason why I saw nothing, looking back, is because there were very few survivors.</span> <span id="s442">If there was, if there were like a couple hundred people would have been able to escape from Dachau after the Allied armies came in, naturally we would see them.</span> <span id="s443">But there were hardly any survivors at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s444">PS: Harry, we've covered, I think we've covered this subject very thoroughly.</span> <span id="s445">Is there anything at all that you would like to add to your testimony?</span></p> <p><span id="s446">HZ: Yes I would.</span> <span id="s447">Just for a little foresight, as far as antisemitism is concerned.</span> <span id="s448">When I was in basic training I did not identify myself as being Jewish.</span> <span id="s449">I said I, my parents came from Russia.</span> <span id="s450">I said I was a Russian.</span> <span id="s451">I did it purely as an experiment.</span> <span id="s452">Not to hide the fact that I was Jewish, but I wanted to experiment.</span> <span id="s453">And then, while we were, at the end of our basic training, Rosh Hashanah came along, and our group, our battery, was being punished.</span> <span id="s454">And it was on the night of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s455">And the sergeant said, "Everybody here has to wash down the floors."</span> <span id="s456">They'd been washed down so many times the floors were bleached already.</span> <span id="s457">They were practically white.</span> <span id="s458">And he said, "Everybody get into their fatigues."</span> <span id="s459">And Zaslow's getting into his uniform, and the Sergeant--into his dress uniform--and the Sergeant asked me, "Where are you going, Zaslow?"</span> <span id="s460">I said, "Well, I'm, we have a Jewish holiday.</span> <span id="s461">It's the evening of Yom Kippur.</span> <span id="s462">And even though the battery is being punished, I feel that it's more important that I go to services."</span> <span id="s463">And I picked myself up, and I started to walk out and I said, "Sergeant, I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s464">Whatever you want to do with me, after I come back, you can take action against me."</span> <span id="s465">But I felt confident enough that living in a democratic country and being in a democratic army, that if this subject would ever have come up by the fact that here, a Jewish soldier, his friends were being, his comrades were being punished, and here I walk out on them, and I'm not willing to take that punishment as well.</span> <span id="s466">But nothing happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">PS: No repercussions?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">HZ: No, there was no, there were no repercussions.</span> <span id="s469">That was one thing about antisemitism, there wasn't any that I saw.</span> <span id="s470">I walked down this aisle.</span> <span id="s471">There were beds on both sides, there were about fifteen beds on both sides of the bunk.</span> <span id="s472">And everybody just stood there motionless and watched me as I walked down the aisle and out of the building.</span> <span id="s473">And I went to Yom Kippur services that night.</span> <span id="s474">The other experience that I can tell you about antisemitism which I experienced, was at, during the closing days of the war.</span> <span id="s475">We were assigned to guarding the German prisoners.</span> <span id="s476">And there was a German stockade, and there must have been a couple thousand German soldiers in that stockade.</span> <span id="s477">And there were American posts, lookout posts, at a high level, which guarded them 24 hours a day.</span> <span id="s478">And our unit was assigned to do that.</span> <span id="s479">And I climbed up the steps to the tower about 3:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s480">And I took my position to watch the--to just make sure that everything was in order with these German, captured German soldiers.</span> <span id="s481">I looked down at the railing, and I saw on the railing carved out with a knife, "Zaslow is a dirty Jew."</span> <span id="s482">And I said to myself, "How ironic this could be.</span> <span id="s483">Here we went into Germany to erase Nazism and murder, and a very bad people, and I would say that American, some American soldiers were just as antisemitic."</span> <span id="s484">And I come to, it comes to my mind right now that if they had a chance, they could do just as good as the S.S. troopers.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">PS: They would do the same thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">HZ: They would do the same thing.</span> <span id="s487">And that really hurt when I saw that, because we were on the same side.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">PS: And live within your own unit.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">HZ: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">PS: Harry, we thank you very, very much for your most valuable testimony.</span> <span id="s491">This has been Phil Solomon interviewing Mr. Harry Zaslow for the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archives.</span> <span id="s492">Harry, this will become, this tape will become a permanent part of the Archives, and we thank you very, very much we thank you.</span></p></body></html>
