id="s12">November 29, 1990</span></p> <p><span id="s13">01:00:24</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Okay, we are on.</span> <span id="s15">Would you tell me your full name, including your maiden name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s16">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s17">My full name now is Agnes Adachi, and my maiden name was Agnes Mandl, M-A-N-D-L.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1918, October 26.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s21">Tell me – would you tell me about your parents and your family when you were a child before the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: I can do that.</span> <span id="s23">Well, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s24">I was born into a very rich family right then and up ‘til my six years, we were quite well to do and I went to private school started out.</span> <span id="s25">And then my father lost every penny he ever had through the crash in America.</span> <span id="s26">And instead of coming to America anyhow, he took us to Turkey where I lived for six months.</span> <span id="s27">And that was great experience for a little girl.</span> <span id="s28">That's where I saw my very first Mickey Mouse film what was still black and white and no words, but it was lovely.</span> <span id="s29">And it was a great experience for a little girl and we had a friend there who was once a captain on a boat and he always played with me because I wanted to be a little boy and I wanted to be on that boat and be his mate.</span> <span id="s30">So in the bathtub, we played – a mate.</span> <span id="s31">But, I turned out to be a little girl altogether.</span> <span id="s32">And then we came back to Hungary and we had quite a lot of difficult times.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">01:02:30</span></p> <p><span id="s34">Q: Tell us about – I'd like to know about your family life during that period.</span> <span id="s35">What – did you go to school.</span> <span id="s36">Did you have friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I went to school and, and according to my mother, everybody was my friend.</span> <span id="s38">I was a lonely child.</span> <span id="s39">I was all alone and I loved to be alone, but as soon as some other kids arrived and Mommy said I used to become a leader.</span> <span id="s40">I don't remember that at all.</span> <span id="s41">I just know I always had great time when kids came and while – as I told you before, I was six.</span> <span id="s42">My father was sort of a crazy man.</span> <span id="s43">He wanted to give anything to his child.</span> <span id="s44">That time back in Hungary to get some clowns to come to the house cost a fortune, but that's how I got the friends because the whole neighborhood – every child would come – 50, 60 of them you know.</span> <span id="s45">But then all that stopped and I was alone, but I never felt lonely.</span> <span id="s46">I was always a great dreamer.</span> <span id="s47">I was always full of dreams.</span> <span id="s48">And since I was a little girl I like to put everything down on paper.</span> <span id="s49">Of course, eventually I lost them all naturally.</span> <span id="s50">But I was always writing.</span> <span id="s51">Then when it came up to junior high school….</span> <span id="s52">Well, I, I remember one thing that my father was an absolutely unreligious.</span> <span id="s53">He said he was agnostic.</span> <span id="s54">He was in the Jewish faith, but he ran away from his bar mitzvah.</span> <span id="s55">That much what he didn't believe in anything.</span> <span id="s56">And so he never taught me anything either, but my mother was a little bit more religious and she used to put on the Friday night candles.</span> <span id="s57">That was about as much religion as I got because my father would take me, say, "Come.</span> <span id="s58">Let Mommy give us a blessing."</span> <span id="s59">And I went without a word.</span> <span id="s60">Then as I grew I went to the synagogue because I was a very pretty girl and all the boys were there on Saturday.</span> <span id="s61">So it was fun more than religion because I didn't know that I really should be.</span> <span id="s62">And then when it came to junior high school, then my father decided to put me in a Reformed Church Protestant school.</span> <span id="s63">And my mother first asked him, "Why you want her to go there?"</span> <span id="s64">And my father said, "Because that is the best school in Hungary, and she will get the best education."</span> <span id="s65">And I remembered he hold my hand when he took me there and there was a wonderful lady principal and she would turn to my father and said, "Mr. Mandl, why do you want your little girl to come to our school?</span> <span id="s66">We have no Jewish children."</span> <span id="s67">And my father said, "I don't like bigots.</span> <span id="s68">I want my child to think for herself, and yours is the best school in the country."</span> <span id="s69">So she smiled and she looked at me, says, "Would you like to come to this school?"</span> <span id="s70">And I looked her and I fall in love with her at once, I said, "Yes, I do."</span> <span id="s71">So then she explained to my father that a couple of children are there, but they are not allowed to come to morning services.</span> <span id="s72">Every morning they had a ten minute service, one prayer and two songs.</span> <span id="s73">And right away I picked up, "I can sing?"</span> <span id="s74">That was it.</span> <span id="s75">But the Protestant teacher, the religious teacher was a wonderful lady, another wonderful woman.</span> <span id="s76">She was about six foot tall with very black hair and a huge heart and I was like a half pension in the school until seven because both of my parents worked and she used to take me and she was the one who taught me about Judaism.</span> <span id="s77">And she said, "You have to learn because that was the first religion in the world.</span> <span id="s78">And you have to learn some Hebrew."</span> <span id="s79">So whatever I know, I know from her.</span> <span id="s80">But I was the first and then we got more children so I was there through junior high and senior high.</span> <span id="s81">And I graduated except that I wasn't there on graduation because I got scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s82">And I missed the graduation where I was supposed to be a hostess and that hurt me.</span> <span id="s83">The only little Jewish kid that could have been the hostess, she couldn't be there.</span> <span id="s84">But that's how life is.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">01:06:29</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: What about, what about just being a Jewish child, a Jewish teenager in Budapest at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Well, as a child I really didn't feel much because by that time my father was again quite wealthy and our house was always open and they – more Christians and Aristocrats came to the house, and I never felt that I was different from anyone else.</span> <span id="s88">And also we traveled quite a little bit as I grew up too because we had a very big family in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s89">My mother's sister went out there in 1915 I believe, and she stayed there and married there and so we, we went a lot to Switzerland and to Austria and to France.</span> <span id="s90">And I wasn't home that much, and when I was a teenager, I started to travel on my own sort of.</span> <span id="s91">So in ‘36 I was at the – in Germany at the Olympic games because my very best friend – and if you ever read my book you will read about it, how I came away from there, but I was their guest through the Olympics.</span> <span id="s92">And I was the lucky girl to see Jesse Owens running.</span> <span id="s93">Flying, not running.</span> <span id="s94">And I was so proud and I screamed for him.</span> <span id="s95">And it was a very interesting time in Berlin because it was 1936, and yet during that time they didn't dare to show the Nazism as much as they really were.</span> <span id="s96">They didn't like the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s97">They didn't like Jesse Owens because he was black.</span> <span id="s98">They didn't like some other people because they were another color, like Japanese, but still it was not bad.</span> <span id="s99">And we had a wonderful time and I met a lot of young people there and we exchanged cards and I never asked them, “What religion you are?”</span> <span id="s100">and they didn't ask me, so I had a lovely time.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">01:08:35 Coming back from there I wanted to learn children psychology, and that send us through part of university.</span> <span id="s102">It was hard to get in because then they already started with religion.</span> <span id="s103">“You are a Jew.</span> <span id="s104">We don't want you.”</span> <span id="s105">But I managed, and I went to Montessori school.</span> <span id="s106">So because of that I happened to go to Italy, and I really had Madam Montessori teaching me just before she died.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">01:09:07</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Q: What was she like?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">A: She was wonderful.</span> <span id="s110">She was a very simple woman with a great mind and I am very sorry for today's Montessori schools because her idea was sick children, most of them mentally retarded, to learn to do things by themselves – to dress by themselves.</span> <span id="s111">And today they turned this all out.</span> <span id="s112">Today they have Montessori schools where the kids have to be quiet.</span> <span id="s113">That is not for our children.</span> <span id="s114">The children have to let out.</span> <span id="s115">But hers was a natural thing.</span> <span id="s116">She didn't want the noise because it disturbed these children.</span> <span id="s117">And it was a most wonderful thing to see how little children help each other to close their coats or do their shoes, and I think this is not good to put over to our very healthy children the same thing.</span> <span id="s118">And also it's not good I found out because children learn too much and when they get to elementary school they are bored.</span> <span id="s119">Because in Montessori school most of them already learn how to write, how to count, how to do things.</span> <span id="s120">And it makes children very difficult to grow up.</span> <span id="s121">But it was a great experience to be in Rome.</span> <span id="s122">I love Rome.</span> <span id="s123">And she lived out in, in a not such a good neighborhood either, but her whole life was the children and the teaching the sick children and the poor how to go on in this world.</span> <span id="s124">So I do have my Montessori diploma.</span> <span id="s125">And then from there I went to England because I wanted to learn the King's English in a real good way and I did.</span> <span id="s126">Now, of course, I lost it all.</span> <span id="s127">Waited all the years where I lived in different countries, it came off.</span> <span id="s128">And after England, I came home and that was already ‘39.</span> <span id="s129">And then I decided I wanted to go to Switzerland again.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">01:11:04</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Let's, let's stop one moment.</span> <span id="s132">This is 1939 I believe.</span> <span id="s133">Things are changing.</span> <span id="s134">What was home like then?</span> <span id="s135">What was Budapest like?</span></p> <p><span id="s136">A: I was not home, so I really didn't know what's going on and my parents wanted me to go out.</span> <span id="s137">In so far it was bad, you felt it coming.</span> <span id="s138">So, therefore my father used to send us out with Mommy every year because when you left Hungary – not just Jewish people, but anyone – you had to get so and so much money from the bank, not more.</span> <span id="s139">And then you would go somewhere and you would leave that money and you came home earlier and you said you spent all the money, you had to come home.</span> <span id="s140">So that's how we got our – Mommy had the diamonds and the fur coats and what not since all gone out and we came right back.</span> <span id="s141">By that time I was a big girl so I could do it with her you know, 16, 17.</span> <span id="s142">And still it was quiet.</span> <span id="s143">You did not feel – because there was always antisemitism in Hungary.</span> <span id="s144">But yet like our Regent Horthy who always said, "Yes, I am a antisemite, but I cannot get along without my Jews.”</span> <span id="s145">And he didn't.</span> <span id="s146">Because they were helping and they – the country was pretty well-to-do and it was the “Little Paris” as everybody called it, you know.</span> <span id="s147">The King who abdicated, his rendezvous were all in Budapest.</span> <span id="s148">He always came there.</span> <span id="s149">And I worked for awhile in the Ritz Hotel, which was our best, and he came there but we had hotels where you could not make love, so she had to have an apartment and he lived in the Ritz.</span> <span id="s150">Okay?</span> <span id="s151">But they came to Budapest because that was a “Little Paris” where it was a great place.</span></p> <p><span id="s152">01:12:59</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Did you ever see Edward the Seventh?</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: I saw him once but that was all – not a big deal.</span> <span id="s155">But I went to Switzerland and I went to Geneva because I wanted to perfect my French.</span> <span id="s156">I had a French mademoiselle for 14 years in the house but you forget when you are not constantly talking.</span> <span id="s157">She was also from Lausanne.</span> <span id="s158">And while I was in Geneva in that – ‘39 almost in September with other three students, we made an auto-stop tour.</span> <span id="s159">Now today you wouldn't dare to do it.</span> <span id="s160">We stood on the street and hold cars.</span> <span id="s161">We went all the way to the Rivera and back.</span> <span id="s162">Was a gorgeous trip.</span> <span id="s163">So we were not ready for what we found when we arrived back because ‘39 was already fallen, but young kids don't care and we were happy and we were in Switzerland when we came back.</span> <span id="s164">But there were a Zionist Congress and while these people had to have a rest, I went out to the Lake Geneva to take a rest and have a swim.</span> <span id="s165">And one day we were out there and that was September 9, ‘40 – 1939 when suddenly all the radios started to blare that the Nazis overrun Poland.</span> <span id="s166">And most of these people were from Poland.</span> <span id="s167">And it was a heartbreak to see how they runned half-naked to the phones and the families were all home.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">01:14:33 And then and there, somehow I promised myself that, as I am in a neutral country, I'm going to try to help and see if we can make peace.</span> <span id="s169">And I stayed on in Geneva, and my parents wanted me to stay.</span> <span id="s170">But the friend – and that's a very tragic thing whom we left all our stuff, and they were Jewish – as a matter of fact the husband was, I think, Orthodox –he kept on saying I should go home.</span> <span id="s171">After all, I'm the only child and it's crazy to stay there.</span> <span id="s172">“The Germans will not come to Hungary.”</span> <span id="s173">And I went home in January, 1940, middle of the war.</span> <span id="s174">Okay?</span> <span id="s175">But I found Budapest still very exciting.</span> <span id="s176">American and British film were still shown.</span> <span id="s177">They didn't like people talking English.</span> <span id="s178">They didn't like English.</span> <span id="s179">But we, we did speak it.</span> <span id="s180">And that was the time when I taught Congressman Lantos’ not wife yet.</span> <span id="s181">She was nine years old, and she was beautiful.</span> <span id="s182">She looked like Shirley Temple.</span> <span id="s183">And the two of us would walk on the street talking English, good and loud so everybody can hear us.</span> <span id="s184">But they thought we were foreigners you know, who knows from where.</span> <span id="s185">And then my best friend arrived from Germany and for a couple of weeks, it wasn't bad.</span> <span id="s186">From ‘40 to ‘43, you really didn't feel different like you did before.</span> <span id="s187">Antisemitism was there.</span> <span id="s188">We lived with it as best as we could.</span> <span id="s189">But then in March 1944 – 1940 – yeah, March 1944.</span> <span id="s190">That's right.</span> <span id="s191">I will never forget that day as long as I live.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">01:16:30 Early morning one of our neighbors running and said to my Father, "The BBC just announced that our Admiral Horthy is going to quit the Germans and going together with the Allied Forces and he's coming on the radio."</span> <span id="s193">And my father ran out and brought in the champagne and I looked at him.</span> <span id="s194">I said, "Poppy.</span> <span id="s195">Please don't drink.</span> <span id="s196">I don't believe it."</span> <span id="s197">My father said, "You are too young.</span> <span id="s198">You don't understand."</span> <span id="s199">And sure enough, Horthy came on and he went as far as to say, "And we are now the friends of the Allies," and at that moment the Germans – the Hitler's hymn came on and they cut off his voice and I just dropped my glass.</span> <span id="s200">And I left to go to the Ritz Hotel where I was working there and I also – because I couldn't have no Montessori, nothing worked that time, so I worked in the hotel.</span> <span id="s201">I wanted to become a Manageress or something.</span> <span id="s202">And we had a wonderful, wonderful director of that place.</span> <span id="s203">He was Yugoslavian, but he spoke 16 languages perfectly.</span> <span id="s204">So between him and me we always talked French or English.</span> <span id="s205">And as soon as I arrived, the porter said, "Mr. Marentchic wants you."</span> <span id="s206">When I got out in the street, first of all, it was full with beautiful airplanes.</span> <span id="s207">It was a very sunny day.</span> <span id="s208">And I was sure that they were the Americans and the British and I was so happy I said, "Ah, they listed to Horthy, so they all here now.</span> <span id="s209">We are finished."</span> <span id="s210">And then Mr. Marentchic took me in his arm and he said, "Go home and God bless you.</span> <span id="s211">Horthy was arrested, and these are not the Americans and British.</span> <span id="s212">These are the Russians – these are the Germans – excuse me, the Russians came after.</span> <span id="s213">So I ran home and my father's only words were, "You were right."</span> <span id="s214">And funnily enough, we were not collected from our houses.</span> <span id="s215">We heard that we have to put on a star, so we did that.</span> <span id="s216">We didn't go out much on the street, but we still were not restricted.</span> <span id="s217">Nothing!</span> <span id="s218">But they came in and immediately we heard that many, many, many people were taken and we still were not even touched.</span> <span id="s219">Nothing!</span> <span id="s220">Whether we were lucky, I don't know but we were in the house until – and it was bad because my very best friends lived very far from us and I missed them.</span> <span id="s221">We still had our telephones.</span> <span id="s222">The radios still worked.</span> <span id="s223">So we were watching because I had a big, big radio so you can hear the whole world and that's how we knew the news, what's coming in from all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">01:19:32</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: What were the streets like?</span> <span id="s226">What about school?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: There were plenty food in Hungary.</span> <span id="s228">Don't forget, it's an agricultural country.</span> <span id="s229">Even through the whole Germany, nobody was every hungry.</span> <span id="s230">Food there was plenty, and the shops – it was still lit up because the bombing didn't start so we had plenty of lights.</span> <span id="s231">But we didn't go out much.</span> <span id="s232">We were afraid.</span> <span id="s233">And you also never know what moment they ring the bell and they take you.</span> <span id="s234">So we sort of were prisoner of our own apartment, but we were still safe – amazingly safe.</span> <span id="s235">But every day there was a new announcement in tele– in the radio.</span> <span id="s236">For instance, suddenly the Hungarian Nazis were – who were worse than the Germans – that was the Arrow Cross – so they – when the Germans came in, they said, "The Arrow Cross can take over."</span> <span id="s237">Now what we heard – we didn't see – you see what was the problem was that the Jewish people in Hungary didn't believe.</span> <span id="s238">We didn't believe like here they didn't believe that people are taken away to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s239">We just didn't believe it, that anybody can put out from the apartment, that anybody can be taken away.</span> <span id="s240">We couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s241">So today when the people tell me, "Why the Americans didn't know?"</span> <span id="s242">But they couldn't understand it either.</span> <span id="s243">They were much further than we were.</span> <span id="s244">We were right there, and it was something – it's impossible.</span> <span id="s245">But then suddenly some Czechoslovakian friends arrived.</span> <span id="s246">Rumanian friends came down.</span> <span id="s247">They took everything.</span> <span id="s248">But somehow they managed to come away.</span> <span id="s249">Then we started to realize – started to be afraid that any moment anyone….</span></p> <p><span id="s250">01:25:27 Letters still arrived from Europe, and I had a correspondence with a Swedish gentlemen for a long time because in a long time in Hungary when you were a girl, who spoke lot of languages and you were a girl scout, then they asked you to be a guide for tourists.</span> <span id="s251">And as I spoke lot of languages, once I was a guide for a whole Swedish group.</span> <span id="s252">And the one Swedish man started to write.</span> <span id="s253">He has written for years and years.</span> <span id="s254">We were corresponding.</span> <span id="s255">I didn't think of anything.</span> <span id="s256">I was young and I had a lot of young men around me and all that so I just thought, "How nice.</span> <span id="s257">This nice Swedish man never forget a young kid.</span> <span id="s258">And actually he saved my life before Raoul, but I didn't know that then.</span> <span id="s259">So in any case one day – that was very frightening experience – finally, the bell rang.</span> <span id="s260">And I look out and there is a German soldier standing outside.</span> <span id="s261">And I look back at my parents.</span> <span id="s262">Well, we couldn't not open the door, but then I looked again.</span> <span id="s263">I said, “Oh, my God, I know him.”</span> <span id="s264">When I was in Berlin in 1936, we exchanged cards and he happened to be one of the soldiers coming to Budapest.</span> <span id="s265">And my name evidently didn't mean a thing – that a Mandl could be German.</span> <span id="s266">He didn't think I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s267">And I said to my parents, “What shall I do?"</span> <span id="s268">He said, "Well, you have to open the door."</span> <span id="s269">He didn't want to come in, thank God.</span> <span id="s270">He just said would I show him Budapest?</span> <span id="s271">And I was afraid if I say, "No," or, “Why he was sent here?”</span> <span id="s272">It was a very bad feeling so I turned around to my parents.</span> <span id="s273">I said, "I'm going to show him Budapest."</span> <span id="s274">And I went out.</span> <span id="s275">All I heard is my father said, "Be careful."</span> <span id="s276">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s277">What else could I say?</span> <span id="s278">So I went and everything went alright for about an hour and then we came to a synagogue and he stopped me there and he said, "You see.</span> <span id="s279">That's where I'm going to kill everybody."</span> <span id="s280">So now I didn't know whether I should open a big mouth and tell him who I am or shall I ask a question.</span> <span id="s281">So I quickly thought, “Maybe I'll ask a question.”</span> <span id="s282">I said, "Did ever a Jew hurt you?</span> <span id="s283">Did you know any?"</span> <span id="s284">He said, "I never knew any."</span> <span id="s285">I said, "Well, then, why do you want to kill people whom you never even met."</span> <span id="s286">He said, "Hitler told me to do it, and I am a German."</span> <span id="s287">So I quickly looked at my watch and I said, "Oh, you'll have to forgive me, but I have to teach English and I forgot that the time has come.</span> <span id="s288">Goodbye."</span> <span id="s289">And he let me go and I run.</span> <span id="s290">I never saw him again.</span> <span id="s291">I have no idea what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">01:24:14 But it was a close call.</span> <span id="s293">Yeah, because I really didn't know how to behave.</span> <span id="s294">So then we were all always frightened and then suddenly these two French gentlemen arrived with a note who send them from Paris.</span> <span id="s295">The two French men arrived and they're not supposed to say it, but they said they were French Underground and could we put them up in our house.</span> <span id="s296">Dad said we'd be delighted, but they were in and out and sometimes we didn't see them for weeks.</span> <span id="s297">And they were wonderful.</span> <span id="s298">One was a peasant and one was a very learned young man.</span> <span id="s299">One was a Jew, one was a Christian.</span> <span id="s300">And they came to Hungary and one of them fall in love with my wonderful girlfriend.</span> <span id="s301">He was unmarried.</span> <span id="s302">But they went in and out and they did wonderful things.</span> <span id="s303">I guess they were couriers between Rumania and Hungary for the Allies and for France and it's a very exciting time you know.</span> <span id="s304">Frightening, but when you're young, all you can think, "I have to survive.</span> <span id="s305">I have to survive."</span> <span id="s306">So now in the midst of all this, then came this announcement.</span> <span id="s307">The first day was that any couples mixed marriages have to separate at once or the Christian party is becoming a Jew and being killed.</span> <span id="s308">Well, within a half an hour, there were thousands of suicides.</span> <span id="s309">It's a very easy way to kill people.</span> <span id="s310">And then they reversed it and they said we changed our minds, but by that time thousands of people died.</span> <span id="s311">Thank God, my aunt and uncle called.</span> <span id="s312">My uncle was a grandson of a Unitarian bishop and he was a newspaper man and it was a wonderful marriage.</span> <span id="s313">And they called and they said they're going to commit suicide.</span> <span id="s314">I said, "No, you're not Uncle.</span> <span id="s315">Why don't you get some false papers and just disappear."</span> <span id="s316">Said, "I never thought of this."</span> <span id="s317">I said, "Well, then think."</span> <span id="s318">And they survived.</span> <span id="s319">He died after the war, natural death, both of them.</span> <span id="s320">But many of them didn't make it.</span> <span id="s321">Then came the announcement that anyone who not having the Jewish religion can be saved.</span> <span id="s322">They just talked you know.</span> <span id="s323">It was – nothing was now, but we loved to believe everything because we wanted to live.</span> <span id="s324">So in my house—</span></p> <p><span id="s325">01:26:42</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s327">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s328">Not having the Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s329">You mean if you convert?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: If you change, if you converting to another religion, then you're not counted.</span> <span id="s331">But was a lie, of course, you see.</span> <span id="s332">But we wanted to believe.</span> <span id="s333">So who arrived to my house?</span> <span id="s334">By that time we had a wonderful new principal in my former school who became later on the Protestant Bishop of Hungary and he had six daughters and I was more in his house.</span> <span id="s335">I was the seventh child, and he came to our house and he looked at my father, who was the same age, but he called him “Uncle.”</span> <span id="s336">He says, "Let me baptize that child.</span> <span id="s337">She's my seventh daughter, and she knows as much about our religion as we do, and I want her to live."</span> <span id="s338">And my father said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s339">So we went to his tiny little church, and my father started to drive.</span> <span id="s340">And Pastor Berecky said, "Uncle Arnold, stop crying.</span> <span id="s341">I have full of Jews down in that basement.</span> <span id="s342">If the Germans find out, we all be killed."</span> <span id="s343">And he baptized me more with his tears than with water.</span> <span id="s344">He cried so bitterly, and he hold me in his arms.</span> <span id="s345">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s346">And then he looked at me, says, "Child, you do what you want after the war.</span> <span id="s347">If you want to be a Jew again, go back to Judaism.</span> <span id="s348">But you are my child, my seventh daughter.</span> <span id="s349">So it was a very emotional and very great thing and we went home and all his Jews were saved, I guess, who were down in the basement.</span> <span id="s350">And they made me out original papers and they signed for it.</span> <span id="s351">You know my birth and all that, that I was born as a Protestant.</span> <span id="s352">And I took all these papers with grace.</span> <span id="s353">What else can you do?</span> <span id="s354">And then the next miracle happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">01:28:38 By that time I used to write a lot of poems.</span> <span id="s356">I did that as a little child too.</span> <span id="s357">And we had one wonderful newspaper and I send him one what I wrote during the war.</span> <span id="s358">And suddenly I got two little letters in the mail that morning.</span> <span id="s359">One was handwritten from the editor of this newspaper and he very clearly just said “Dear Madam….”</span> <span id="s360">Oh, that time I wrote under an assumed name and it was “Rolopa” – what meant “Rome, London, Paris,” and I took the first three names and that what it was.</span> <span id="s361">So he addressed it to “Madam Rolopa,” and he said that, "I loved your poem but unfortunately the censor would not allow me to publish it.</span> <span id="s362">But I keep it with all my souvenirs.”</span> <span id="s363">And I screamed and my mother was just in the bathroom, "Why you screaming?"</span> <span id="s364">I said, "Mommy, Mommy.</span> <span id="s365">Can you imagine.</span> <span id="s366">Handwritten and he kept my poem!</span> <span id="s367">That's better than if they publish it."</span> <span id="s368">And I was – I have his letter still.</span> <span id="s369">I was very proud.</span> <span id="s370">The second letter was a very – with little white letters, but within the back it said Swedish Embassy, Budapest.</span> <span id="s371">And I said, "What does the Swedish Embassy want from me?"</span> <span id="s372">And I opened it up and they said, "Could you please come to the Embassy?"</span> <span id="s373">And I was dumfounded.</span> <span id="s374">“Why, why – what do they want from me?</span> <span id="s375">And how do I get there?”</span> <span id="s376">Because by that time you couldn't really get to any foreign embassies without probably being arrested on the street with my yellow star.</span> <span id="s377">So my cousin that time dated a very wonderful Christian boy and he said, "Well, what's the problem?</span> <span id="s378">I'll take you."</span> <span id="s379">I said, "How?"</span> <span id="s380">He said, "Leave it to me?"</span> <span id="s381">And he arrived in a huge big black Mercedes Benz, and he had the German flag on the front and he pushed me in there.</span> <span id="s382">And he said, "Now, you're in.</span> <span id="s383">We can go."</span> <span id="s384">And he took me up.</span> <span id="s385">Nobody stopped us.</span> <span id="s386">How would they dare—</span></p> <p><span id="s387">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s388">01:31:00</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s390">Now we're on tape.</span> <span id="s391">Now let's start with the story about the car.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s393">So my cousin had a boyfriend who was a Christian and he said, "It's no problem.</span> <span id="s394">I'll take you up to the Embassy."</span> <span id="s395">And he arrived with a huge black Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s396">He had the Nazi flag on it, and he had a Nazi uniform, and he was very rough with me.</span> <span id="s397">He pushed me into the car and when I was in he said, "So now, we can relax and I'll take you."</span> <span id="s398">So nobody stopped us and I went.</span> <span id="s399">And then we arrived up there, it was – first, you know it was very funny.</span> <span id="s400">I, I walked in and there was the Minister Danielsson.</span> <span id="s401">He was the Ambassador then and he looked up and said, "Who is that Nazi?"</span> <span id="s402">I said, "He is not a Nazi.</span> <span id="s403">He just brought me up here."</span> <span id="s404">He says, "Clever," you know, “but you never know.”</span> <span id="s405">Anyhow, he and the Hungarian First Secretary, whose name was Mr. Mezey – he was then the Secretary there – they needed somebody who speaks Hungarian.</span> <span id="s406">And they took me in and they told me first that they want to tell me the story about the wonderful Danish king who stood up for the Germans.</span> <span id="s407">He said that, “I don't know any Jews.</span> <span id="s408">I only know Danes.”</span> <span id="s409">And he put on a yellow arm band and I was so stunned because we didn't know all this, you know.</span> <span id="s410">And after he told me that story then he told me about King Gustav the Fifth, the Swedish King, who had told all the people in Sweden – and he blew that up as big as this, you know, on the walls all over Sweden – “Anyone who has family, friends, business associates in Hungary, would they come to the Foreign Department and we will help."</span> <span id="s411">And I said, "Yeah, but why do you call me?"</span> <span id="s412">And he says, "That's my point now.</span> <span id="s413">You have a fiancé."</span> <span id="s414">And I looked at him.</span> <span id="s415">I says, "I have a what?"</span> <span id="s416">He said, "You didn't know?"</span> <span id="s417">I says, "No Sir."</span> <span id="s418">I told the truth.</span> <span id="s419">I didn't know I have a fiancé.</span> <span id="s420">He said, "Well, your fiancé immediately went to the foreign department and he said, "If the war wouldn't be on, she already would be my wife.</span> <span id="s421">So she is Swedish and please take care of her."</span> <span id="s422">And I stood there, you know, and I, I was frozen.</span> <span id="s423">I had no words and I said, “I, I am a Swede?</span> <span id="s424">And he said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s425">And we go make your papers.</span> <span id="s426">And I said, "Oh, my God."</span> <span id="s427">"And that's not all.</span> <span id="s428">You're going to stay with us on the Embassy."</span> <span id="s429">And I said, "Oh no, no.</span> <span id="s430">I can't do that.</span> <span id="s431">I have my parents."</span> <span id="s432">He said, "Well, we will try to save your parents, but first comes you.</span> <span id="s433">We are now responsible for you, and I need some change of clothes and so on.</span> <span id="s434">You're going to stay here."</span> <span id="s435">I was stunned.</span> <span id="s436">So—</span></p> <p><span id="s437">01:34:03</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: This had all come from this young man?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: That young man whom we wrote the letter, letters for years.</span> <span id="s440">And I still don't know whether – well, I will tell you, on the end.</span> <span id="s441">Anyways, my friend Steven, said, "Well should she come home with me?"</span> <span id="s442">And I said, "No, I think it's better if we send down to her parents.</span> <span id="s443">You, you can go home along and we send down one of our employees here and he will talk to the parents and we write the letter.</span> <span id="s444">So that's what we did.</span> <span id="s445">I felt first very bad and, you know, conscious that I am just leaving my parents.</span> <span id="s446">But we are young, and I wanted so badly to live.</span> <span id="s447">And it was really a terrible thing maybe, but I just – I wanted to stay.</span> <span id="s448">And so this man went down and told my parents that what happened and my parents said, "Ah, that's wonderful."</span> <span id="s449">And they gave them the toothbrush and change of clothes and I for three weeks a guest of the Embassy.</span> <span id="s450">I had a wonderful little room overlooking the rose garden and I found out I wasn't the only guest in the place.</span> <span id="s451">First, there was that famous Nobel prize winning professor, Szent-Györgyi, who has found the vitamin.</span> <span id="s452">He wasn't Jewish, but he was a stout anti-Nazi and they had to put him there.</span> <span id="s453">But eventually the Germans were after him and so they gave him a new name like Swenson and a new lookout and they put him somewhere else and he left.</span> <span id="s454">But there was another wonderful young woman with two little boys and she was German, married to a Swede, and she got stuck with the children in Hungary.</span> <span id="s455">And she went away after on the very last train that could get back to Sweden.</span> <span id="s456">She left with the children.</span> <span id="s457">Later on we met in Sweden.</span> <span id="s458">So I wasn't alone there, you know, and found out there were other people.</span> <span id="s459">But three weeks I was there, and in the three weeks the big bombing started.</span> <span id="s460">And they really started and they were day and night, and the German artillery was right above us and we could see whole Budapest.</span> <span id="s461">We were in the Buda side.</span> <span id="s462">Have you ever been in Budapest?</span> <span id="s463">No.</span> <span id="s464">A beautiful city and it was a pity to see how everything was bombed out, but it had to be done and we were all hoping that the Americans come and then we be liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">01:36:35 But after three weeks we knew nothing.</span> <span id="s466">My dear friend arrived back with his Mercedes and demanded my return immediately.</span> <span id="s467">And the Minister said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s468">He said, "Well, maybe you don't know, but the Hungarian Nazi Party made every second house in Budapest now a Jewish house.</span> <span id="s469">Every second house has a big yellow star out because they think that the Americans will not bomb because they don't want to bomb the Jews."</span> <span id="s470">Of course, that wasn't true.</span> <span id="s471">They bombed the Jews.</span> <span id="s472">They bombed the headquarters, but the Christian – from the Christian houses like where we were on with my parents, that became a Christian house, so my parents had to get out.</span> <span id="s473">And thank God, my grandmother had a big apartment where my – my grandmother wasn't alive, but my aunt was there and her best friend who was also married to a Christian but he wanted to be with them, so he moved in.</span> <span id="s474">And Steven came every day, so we had two Christians helping us.</span> <span id="s475">And that house became a Jewish house and he said, "I have to come back because the Arrow Cross comes every day and reading the list of people in that house and if I am not there, and my name is still on, then they would kill my parents."</span> <span id="s476">So they had a little argument and the Minister said, "No, because we are responsible."</span> <span id="s477">And he said, "Well, she's responsible for her parents."</span> <span id="s478">I just spoke I said, "I'm going home."</span> <span id="s479">So then they said, "Not with him.”</span> <span id="s480">I should go down in the streetcar and I should have one of the employees will go and sit on the other side because they want to know exactly where I'm going.</span> <span id="s481">So I went down with the promise that everyday when they allow us out – we were allowed one hour a day to go out shopping or whatever – that I call and, thank God, the phones were still working.</span> <span id="s482">Bombing or no bombing, we were lucky.</span> <span id="s483">The phones were working.</span> <span id="s484">And I did call up every day.</span> <span id="s485">So I went down with this young man and when I got to the house I looked at him and he did like this and he wrote a little note and he left.</span> <span id="s486">And of course, my welcome home was not so good.</span> <span id="s487">I felt very guilty and the family didn't really like that I had three weeks of heaven, but I can't blame them.</span> <span id="s488">I mean, maybe I shouldn't have done it, but as I said I wanted to live.</span> <span id="s489">I mean you have only one life.</span> <span id="s490">But I was back home.</span> <span id="s491">And I called up every day and I think I wasn't down longer than a weeks and a half and I called and a Hungarian secretary came Mezey and said, "Agnes, you have to get up here at once.</span> <span id="s492">Something new happened."</span> <span id="s493">And I said, "I'll try, but I don't know how."</span> <span id="s494">He said, "Well, maybe you're friend will bring you up.</span> <span id="s495">Tell him we will not keeping you here."</span> <span id="s496">So when he came I said, "Could you just take me up once more?"</span> <span id="s497">He said, But you're not going to stay there and jeopardize the family?"</span> <span id="s498">I says, "No, I'll come back."</span> <span id="s499">And I went up and there was Raoul Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">01:39:56</span></p> <p><span id="s501">Q: At this point I want to stop.</span> <span id="s502">I want to change tapes.</span> <span id="s503">I don't want to stop at this point.</span> <span id="s504">Bonnie, can we stop the tapes please?</span> <span id="s505">Do we really have that much?</span> <span id="s506">Alright.</span> <span id="s507">Okay, let's keep on going.</span> <span id="s508">We have 20 minutes.</span> <span id="s509">Tell us about Raoul.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Alright.</span> <span id="s511">So Danielsson and Mezey introduced him to me, and he spoke English and German, and I think he spoke German that time because I couldn't speak Swedish yet, and his first question was, "Agnes, would you work with me?"</span> <span id="s512">And I said, "I'd be delighted Sir, but I still have a Star."</span> <span id="s513">And they all started laughing.</span> <span id="s514">And I said, "Why you laughing?</span> <span id="s515">I can't run around in the streets."</span> <span id="s516">He said, "You won't.</span> <span id="s517">We already have prepared papers for you."</span> <span id="s518">And the same day they send me all alone with the Star, but somebody followed me from the Swedish Embassy to the police station where the police chief cut off my Star.</span> <span id="s519">I don't know what – how they bribed him.</span> <span id="s520">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s521">He never told me, but they must have bribed the Hungarian especially because the war was probably almost over in ‘44, and they wanted to be in good foot with the Americans.</span> <span id="s522">Right?</span> <span id="s523">They didn't know that the Russians are coming.</span> <span id="s524">So we all didn't know that that we are sold out, the whole Balkan, right?</span> <span id="s525">To the Soviets.</span> <span id="s526">Well, anyways he cried and I thought I was in Heaven already.</span> <span id="s527">I must be dead if this police chief is crying while he cuts off my star and I walked right back to the Embassy and I said, "Here I am."</span> <span id="s528">He said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s529">Second, go get your parents' apartment back."</span> <span id="s530">And I said, "I beg your pardon, Sir."</span> <span id="s531">And they laughed again.</span> <span id="s532">I said, "You're laughing, but I have to do it."</span> <span id="s533">He said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s534">That we can't do it, but there is a new housing commission."</span> <span id="s535">You should have seen Budapest.</span> <span id="s536">I mean there were maids who used to work in houses.</span> <span id="s537">They walked in and they took the former employers fur coats and everything and they walked for breakfast with big furs and all that.</span> <span id="s538">They had no idea, you know.</span> <span id="s539">And they took all the apartments from everybody.</span> <span id="s540">Yeah?</span> <span id="s541">So he said, "Get to that place and get your apartment back."</span></p> <p><span id="s542">01:42:10 What I didn't even remember, the apartment was written on my father's name, but I looked at him by that time and I got – you saw right away my, my identification from them.</span> <span id="s543">Actually, everybody in that time in Hungary needed an identification, even a shoe cleaner on the street, because otherwise you couldn't walk around.</span> <span id="s544">This was wartime.</span> <span id="s545">And so I got mine.</span> <span id="s546">You have them I think or you will have them.</span> <span id="s547">And I walked in with my head absolutely high because now I was a Wallenberg girl.</span> <span id="s548">Okay?</span> <span id="s549">And I walked in and I sort of threw my paper to, to the head.</span> <span id="s550">I said, "What can happen?</span> <span id="s551">Either he shoots me or not."</span> <span id="s552">And he looked at me awfully ugly and without a word he signed and gave it back to me.</span> <span id="s553">I said, "Oh, oh.</span> <span id="s554">Raoul, whom did you bribe again?"</span> <span id="s555">Something must have happened.</span> <span id="s556">But I got out.</span> <span id="s557">Somebody I heard yelling, "There is a bloody Jew going," but I just went with my head up right to my house.</span> <span id="s558">And I walk in and there is a – that was an apartment building and the superintendent is there and I walk in and he was so stunned that I am alive.</span> <span id="s559">You know they had no idea what happened to us.</span> <span id="s560">And I said, "Hello," and his wife started to cry because I loved her very much, but he was a leech.</span> <span id="s561">He lived on us for years and he looks at me and he said, "What do you want?"</span> <span id="s562">I said, "Here.</span> <span id="s563">My apartment back!"</span> <span id="s564">He said, "My daughter already has that apartment."</span> <span id="s565">Whereby the wife says, "No, our daughter has already another apartment."</span> <span id="s566">So I don't know what he did to his wife after, but I said, "I like to have the receipt official."</span> <span id="s567">So he said, "Well, you have to go to our lawyer and he should give it back to you."</span> <span id="s568">I said, "Look, where is the lawyer living?"</span> <span id="s569">I went to the lawyer and as soon as I walked in, the lawyer looked at the paper and he saw it was official so not much he could do and he said, "Yes, but that has a price."</span> <span id="s570">And I thought, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s571">If I have to give him money, I don't have."</span> <span id="s572">And I said, "Well, what's the price?"</span> <span id="s573">And he said, "You will have to testify that I was so good to the Jewish people."</span> <span id="s574">They all wanted that by that time, of course, because whoever comes in, they would have hanged them because they killed thousands of them on the streets.</span> <span id="s575">I saw it myself one day this green shirt.</span> <span id="s576">There was a little boy of two years old with a star, and he just – “bang” and killed him.</span> <span id="s577">No reason to kill a child of two years.</span> <span id="s578">But he had a yellow star on, why not kill?</span> <span id="s579">So in any case, I promised him anything and in the meantime my finger was like this [interviewee gestures] in the back.</span> <span id="s580">I, “The hell with you all, just give it to me.”</span> <span id="s581">So I walked back to the house.</span> <span id="s582">Now he couldn't say anything, because the lawyer signed.</span> <span id="s583">So we go upstairs and I had a very horrible feeling, “What will I find?”</span></p> <p><span id="s584">01:45:15 I found an empty apartment except we had a maid's room and the maid's room was locked, and all that and we opened.</span> <span id="s585">All our stuff was in there, the paintings, the books, the furniture, and for a moment I thought to myself, "Gee, He isn't as bad as I thought," until he opened his mouth and he said, "I'll get even with you yet."</span> <span id="s586">But I figured the – in this ball game, the ball is now in my park.</span> <span id="s587">And I got my telephone back within a day and I had our apartment back and I had a telephone, so I was in constant contact with Raoul and everybody else.</span> <span id="s588">Now I wanted my parents badly to get out of that house.</span> <span id="s589">And I went to the house – to the Jewish house, and I screamed up.</span> <span id="s590">I shouldn't have done it, but I was so excited.</span> <span id="s591">I said, "We got the apartment back again, the apartment back."</span> <span id="s592">In the meantime, Raoul, as he promised, he got my parents some papers.</span> <span id="s593">They're not supposed to come out of that house, but I said, "Out!</span> <span id="s594">Out!</span> <span id="s595">Home!"</span> <span id="s596">And I took them out.</span> <span id="s597">I missed them and also my cousins.</span> <span id="s598">Her mother couldn't come then.</span> <span id="s599">I don't know where she was.</span> <span id="s600">And I took them all out.</span> <span id="s601">My cousin had papers from Salvadorian papers and the Swiss family helped her so we all went home.</span> <span id="s602">And then we started the big work with Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s603">That time I was–</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Excuse me, won't you?</span> <span id="s605">Would you pause a minute?</span> <span id="s606">Tell me you, when you said when you met Raoul Wallenberg, you seemed to know all about him.</span> <span id="s607">Did you know about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">A: Nothing!</span> <span id="s609">All I knew is that there is a young man and I said to myself, "What is he doing?"</span> <span id="s610">And first I think and that was the feeling that he thought it was an adventure.</span> <span id="s611">But he found out in one day, half a day, that this wasn't an adventure.</span> <span id="s612">This is something that you need.</span> <span id="s613">And he was a most fantastic organizer.</span> <span id="s614">A quick thinker!</span> <span id="s615">His first question was from – he had one friend and that was Per Anger, whom I don't know if you interviewed yet, but Per Anger was then the First Secretary of the Embassy.</span> <span id="s616">And he was an old friend of Raoul and he asked him the first moment, “What have you done for the people here?”</span> <span id="s617">Because it was not only Jews, but it was also anti-Nazi, aristocrats, and Christians, whom he had to help.</span> <span id="s618">It was not just the Jews, but mostly.</span> <span id="s619">And they said, "We have given out 800 real passports."</span> <span id="s620">Now that was what I had, too.</span> <span id="s621">And Raoul was beside himself.</span> <span id="s622">“Two hundred – two – 2,8000 – no, 280,000 people, you give 800 pass-passports?</span> <span id="s623">Well, that's nothing.”</span> <span id="s624">And from the first day on, he actually took over the whole embassy.</span> <span id="s625">The Minister didn't like it very much because after all, he was a diplomat and he was nothing.</span> <span id="s626">And when he asked him – he came as a third secretary – he had to have a diplomatic passport because otherwise, he couldn't travel.</span> <span id="s627">And he said, "Mr. Danielsson, you'll have to understand that when you go and argue with the people, you speak as a diplomat.</span> <span id="s628">I don't."</span> <span id="s629">And that's how he wanted.</span> <span id="s630">He was like a devil.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">01:48:40 You know to us, he spoke like the greatest brother, like a little child, and he was full of jokes all the time.</span> <span id="s632">And when we were a little bit down, then he would come up with jokes or he would imitate Mussolini or he would imitate Hitler or Eichmann.</span> <span id="s633">Whatever he could make us laugh, he made us hysterically laugh because that was his whole nature.</span> <span id="s634">What he felt inside, we don't know because he never showed.</span> <span id="s635">The only thing I knew that he was deathly afraid and that was the bombs because that he couldn't hide.</span> <span id="s636">But we all were afraid from that and he said now, "Whatever happens," because when the Americans come, when they bombed, it went all the way through to the basements.</span> <span id="s637">When the Russians came the two floors upstairs disappeared.</span> <span id="s638">One was our apartment.</span> <span id="s639">It's not all bombed out you know, but with the Americans it went, and it didn't matter whether it was the Jewish house or the Christians houses.</span> <span id="s640">Bombed!</span> <span id="s641">And that was it, and the British too.</span> <span id="s642">But Raoul took over immediately.</span> <span id="s643">And Budapest is a small town and it was like a wildfire that there is some “angel” who is here to help.</span> <span id="s644">So the Jewish Community and those of anti-Nazi Christians, they all came and Raoul – in two days we had 350 people helping.</span> <span id="s645">And we didn't get paid as you always hear, "He's a paid employee."</span> <span id="s646">Nobody was paid.</span> <span id="s647">We were paid because we had our wonderful identification, but quite a lot from our 350 people died and were taken and were killed, so those who were – we were lucky.</span> <span id="s648">Some of them didn't kill.</span> <span id="s649">Not because that they all say that that was saved their lives.</span> <span id="s650">It did not save our lives.</span> <span id="s651">It was a part of our work with him.</span> <span id="s652">We belonged to the embassy.</span> <span id="s653">And it was funny because the embassy only had 12 employees and Raoul had 350 in days, but he needed it.</span> <span id="s654">And in no time, he opened a hospital and he was looking.</span> <span id="s655">There was lots of doctors who were hiding.</span> <span id="s656">He found them, and they worked for him and the Red Cross nurses and the other nurses, and many of them died and many of them lived and helped him ‘til the last moment.</span> <span id="s657">But he was, he was never for a moment without thinking, “what can I do next?”</span></p> <p><span id="s658">01:51:10 And he was like a machine, you know “Go!</span> <span id="s659">Go!</span> <span id="s660">Go!”</span> <span id="s661">And so all of us became like this.</span> <span id="s662">I also slept sometimes one or two hours a night because there was no time.</span> <span id="s663">We always had to do something because there were always something new what Eichmann was thinking of and especially the Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s664">So not only that we had these helpers but we had quite a few very rich people and they offered Raoul their houses.</span> <span id="s665">So we did in two weeks – we had about 60 houses on the two sides of the Danube, Buda and Pest, where the Swedish flag went on and we had Nazi-clad, Nazi-clad Hungarian, Jewish boys standing outside taking care of the houses and nobody could step in because it was a Swedish territory.</span> <span id="s666">And Per Anger writes it in his book and he says that at that time – because in Hungary, they always made jokes whether there was a war or not – that the Swedish government was the greatest landlord in Hungary at that time.</span> <span id="s667">And we had those houses and it was good because our offices had to move every day because they were after us.</span> <span id="s668">Eichmann was after Raoul all the time, but he was not afraid from Eichmann.</span> <span id="s669">He invited him for dinner, and then he forgot about it, and he had to call the Swiss Embassy – a Swedish guy, and he said, "Do you have any wine and food?</span> <span id="s670">I forgot I invited Eichmann for dinner."</span> <span id="s671">But he not only invited Eichmann for dinner.</span> <span id="s672">He asked one of the Jewish helpers to serve him so it would be fun to see how he reacts to somebody with the yellow star.</span> <span id="s673">And we did it because it was fun.</span> <span id="s674">Raoul wanted it.</span> <span id="s675">But at that time we were already bombed heavily, and Raoul had shirt open, and this guy here arrived with all the guns around him, but he couldn't kill Raoul on the Swedish territory you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s676">Q: Let's stop here.</span> <span id="s677">Let's back up.</span> <span id="s678">What do you mean?</span> <span id="s679">Which guy arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s680">A: Eichmann.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s682">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">01:53:18</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: With, with a soldier and all that.</span> <span id="s685">And Raoul – it was already no light, we had only candlelights – and Raoul opened the windows and it was the whole Budapest was burning.</span> <span id="s686">And he said, "Eichmann, look out.</span> <span id="s687">Look what you're doing?"</span> <span id="s688">And Eichmann said, "They deserve it."</span> <span id="s689">He said, "Stop talking and stop killing the people.</span> <span id="s690">You didn't win.</span> <span id="s691">The Germans lost, so give up."</span> <span id="s692">And Eichmann said, "No, I will not give up and my only thing is that you are in my way."</span> <span id="s693">And Raoul very quietly said, "But I am not enough in your way."</span> <span id="s694">He just didn't take it seriously.</span> <span id="s695">And then Eichmann left.</span> <span id="s696">But he had to have his say and he had to show it to him, you know.</span> <span id="s697">I wish he would be there when Eichmann had to be hanged or whatever they did to him.</span> <span id="s698">Unfortunately, he probably doesn't even know about it.</span> <span id="s699">So any case, it was wild because I was for awhile – I was just hostessing, you know, because thousands of people came up to us for the Schutz-pass what was also his design.</span> <span id="s700">He designed – first, he went to the Hungarian and said, "Are there still trains going between here and Sweden.</span> <span id="s701">I'd like to take the Jews off your hand," he said.</span> <span id="s702">And they said, "Yes, Mr. Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s703">You can take 5,000 people."</span> <span id="s704">So he came back to the Embassy.</span> <span id="s705">He says, "5,000 and they will never allow me another one."</span> <span id="s706">So that's no good.</span> <span id="s707">So then he designed this Schutz-pass.</span> <span id="s708">And, of course, with 350 people we had millions of families and friends who collected the pictures, signed, and Danielsson, the Minister sat and signed each of them.</span> <span id="s709">Now I am afraid you will hear many times they said they were fake papers.</span> <span id="s710">Not one of them were ever fake.</span> <span id="s711">If they say it was too many, yes, because then eventually we were allowed to make 10,000 of it, but we probably made 50,000 of it.</span> <span id="s712">Alright?</span> <span id="s713">But they were not fake because everyone of them is signed by the Swedish Minister.</span> <span id="s714">What was fake was the Polish gentlemen who already did his three years Underground in Poland and he had a little printing machine and he figured he will come to Hungary and see what he can help there.</span> <span id="s715">And there he had Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s716">And he found one of his passes and he duplicated it and he signed “Danielsson” and some people found it.</span> <span id="s717">And they called Raoul, and Raoul met him and first very angry.</span> <span id="s718">He said, "You can't do that."</span> <span id="s719">But then as typical Raoul, he looked at him, he said, "But if you can save one single life, go ahead and do it."</span></p> <p><span id="s720">01:56:16 So very many people got away with the fake papers because they looked so much like Raoul's, and some of them died with the real one and died with the fake one.</span> <span id="s721">But it was not Raoul's papers.</span> <span id="s722">They were not fake, you see.</span> <span id="s723">And these people just don't understand.</span> <span id="s724">He did.</span> <span id="s725">Also, they say he gave us passports.</span> <span id="s726">He never gave passports.</span> <span id="s727">It was a pass, and the pass and if you will read my book, you will see it.</span> <span id="s728">I have it translated.</span> <span id="s729">The picture of the person is on there, with the signature, and it says, "The above, the bearer of this paper is protected by the Swedish Government and all his belongings.”</span> <span id="s730">And if and when we collectively can go to Sweden, then they will be going and then in Sweden in 14 days this paper will be invalid.</span> <span id="s731">It doesn't say anywhere it's a passport.</span> <span id="s732">It doesn't say anywhere that he can take his star off.</span> <span id="s733">It just says he's protected by the Swedish government.</span> <span id="s734">And then when these people had to be shifted out of their houses, then Raoul just picked them up and in these 60 houses we put them in.</span> <span id="s735">These were our safe houses and it was not comfortable, but they had food and they had medicine and they had Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s736">Raoul came there every day and visited everybody when he had time because he had to go in the meantime on the road.</span> <span id="s737">Now, on the road he didn't take us girls.</span> <span id="s738">He took the Red Cross and he took some of the diplomats.</span> <span id="s739">And by that time he called up the Swiss diplomat and said, "Help me.</span> <span id="s740">We need some help.</span> <span id="s741">We need you people doing this."</span> <span id="s742">So then we got the Swiss involved.</span> <span id="s743">We got the Portuguese involved.</span> <span id="s744">We got the Papal Nuncio involved very nicely.</span> <span id="s745">And so he had enough men to go with him including Thomas Veres, who was always with him.</span> <span id="s746">He was a young boy with a camera hidden and he made all these pictures.</span> <span id="s747">And he also saved the life of Raoul a couple of times because they were sitting and he's photographing and suddenly he sees a German aiming at Raoul and he would shout, "Raoul, jump.</span> <span id="s748">They're killing you."</span> <span id="s749">And Raoul jumped into the car and they left.</span> <span id="s750">But he went out after the people all the way to the Austrian border to get the people back.</span> <span id="s751">With lies, with complete lies, because they heard about it.</span> <span id="s752">As I said, it was the coldest winter and they marched the people and I don't know – and you said, you've never been in Budapest.</span> <span id="s753">Between Vienna – the border and Budapest, that was then a five hour car ride, and they were walking these people in the snow without shoes.</span> <span id="s754">Children, sick people, old people, and they died, and people trampled over them.</span> <span id="s755">And Raoul was beside himself.</span> <span id="s756">So he went on the road and one day Per Anger had met him and Raoul had – have we finished?</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s758">I want to stop.</span> <span id="s759">We'll change tapes and then I want to pick up with this march.</span> <span id="s760">It's important.</span></p> <p><span id="s761">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Okay Bonnie.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">01:59:50</span></p> <p><span id="s764">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s765">02:00:23</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s767">We're back on camera.</span> <span id="s768">You were–</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s770">I was telling that Raoul went after these people all the way to the Austrian border.</span> <span id="s771">But one of these occasions he had Per Anger with him too, and he had a big black book and on the way to the railway station, he stopped and screamed at the Nazis in German.</span> <span id="s772">He spoke perfect German.</span> <span id="s773">"How dare you are taking our people.</span> <span id="s774">They're all our protected people.</span> <span id="s775">And all of those people, who have my papers turn around.”</span> <span id="s776">And one of my very good girlfriends from here now, she said, "Well, what can happen?</span> <span id="s777">They'll kill her anyhow."</span> <span id="s778">She turned around.</span> <span id="s779">She didn't have any paper – and her sister and her mother.</span> <span id="s780">And "Get on the truck."</span> <span id="s781">Okay?</span> <span id="s782">And then he started to open his black book and started to read names like a machine gun.</span> <span id="s783">And people caught on, those who could still walk and they walked up whether that was their name or not, and he brought about thousand people back to Budapest to these safe houses.</span> <span id="s784">And on the way home, Per Anger said to him, "Raoul, I didn't know we have a black book and you have names?</span> <span id="s785">When did you do that?"</span> <span id="s786">And Raoul started hysterically laughing and he said, "I'll show it to you when I done it.”</span> <span id="s787">And he opens it up and not one single name.</span> <span id="s788">Nothing!</span> <span id="s789">But that was his idea.</span> <span id="s790">He had to do something.</span> <span id="s791">He had to save people.</span> <span id="s792">And the same thing, he had drivers licenses and insurance papers, whatever he could find in Hungarian, what the Germans couldn't read.</span> <span id="s793">And he took it all the way to the train and he demanded to open the doors and he yelled to the people, "I have your papers here.</span> <span id="s794">Get out, Mr. So and So."</span> <span id="s795">And there to some people, you know, "Aw, maybe we can get away."</span> <span id="s796">And he handed them – some of them got the Schutz-pass, not with their name, but who cares, you know.</span> <span id="s797">And insurance papers and tax papers.</span> <span id="s798">You name it.</span> <span id="s799">He brought them back.</span> <span id="s800">But I don't know if you saw the film.</span> <span id="s801">There was one and that was the truth that he took home thousands and in the meantime they killed another thousand and you could hear it, but you can't save everybody.</span> <span id="s802">He always played with his own life because he can be killed any moment, but he didn't care.</span> <span id="s803">He just wanted the people.</span> <span id="s804">Once he was about 250 young men was taken and they were told that they will clean up Budapest from the bombing and he knew exactly that's not true.</span> <span id="s805">So he went after them, again just with two of his colleagues, and again a lot of paper and this Nazi looks at him and he knew who he was and he said, "Wallenberg, if there is one man who doesn't have a paper, I kill him on the spot."</span> <span id="s806">And Raoul looks at him and said, "That's fine.</span> <span id="s807">You can kill him."</span> <span id="s808">And from the 250, 249 already down, everybody had the paper and one give him eye contact with Raoul.</span> <span id="s809">Was a doctor, and he is in this country today.</span> <span id="s810">And Raoul understand immediately.</span> <span id="s811">He had no idea what the man's name is and he says, "Johnny, you left your paper at my desk again."</span> <span id="s812">And he handed him a paper and off they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">02:03:36 Yeah?</span> <span id="s814">But he always – he came up with stories that, that you wouldn't believe that anyone can do.</span> <span id="s815">Now we had this hospital already.</span> <span id="s816">And also it was full of patients and also full of doctors and nurses, and it was cold.</span> <span id="s817">It was already a very, very snowy day in the beginning of December, or end of November, and Raoul had one wonderful thing what I could never learn.</span> <span id="s818">He remembered names, and once he had your name he would never forget.</span> <span id="s819">I forget it in five minutes.</span> <span id="s820">He never made a mistake, to call me Ava and somebody else Aggie.</span> <span id="s821">He knew who was Aggie and he knew who was Ava.</span> <span id="s822">No mistakes.</span> <span id="s823">So what he wanted to do – the Hungarian Nazi party, this horrible Arrow Cross, they had offices in every section of the city.</span> <span id="s824">And he send out some little spy to learn every officer's name to be sure that he gets the right people.</span> <span id="s825">And he never forgot those names, and he knew which one in which section.</span> <span id="s826">One day he comes to the hospital in this horrible snow and he was unshaven and probably hungry.</span> <span id="s827">Who knows where he was, saving people.</span> <span id="s828">And he comes in and he finds three little Hungarian punks.</span> <span id="s829">I mean punks because they were 12 and 13 year old analphabets, but they gave them the gun and they said, "Kill."</span> <span id="s830">If you tell that to a 12 year old, “Kill, then you won't get punished for it.”</span> <span id="s831">Why not?</span> <span id="s832">So here they stand with the gun and the doctor's hand is up and the patients are shaking and Raoul – I was there, it so happened on that day – and Raoul had to think very fast, and he hit these three kids.</span> <span id="s833">I've never seen anybody hitting so strong.</span> <span id="s834">Then he doesn't speak Hungarian.</span> <span id="s835">Only a few words, and somehow he managed to tell them in half German and half Hungarian, "Get out of here.</span> <span id="s836">You are in a Swedish territory."</span> <span id="s837">And, of course, the guns fell to the floor.</span> <span id="s838">So we had three guns in no time.</span> <span id="s839">And he said, "Get your officers in here."</span> <span id="s840">These three boys ran out.</span> <span id="s841">I mean, they were little kids and they were frightened because he was just powerful.</span> <span id="s842">In three minutes, an officer walks in, a Hungarian, and they all spoke some German.</span> <span id="s843">And our Raoul as quiet as nothing happened, looked at his watch and says, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?"</span> <span id="s844">And the guy looks up and says, "How'd you know my name, Mr. Wallenberg?"</span> <span id="s845">He knew.</span> <span id="s846">And Raoul pushed up his shoulders and he said, "I know everybody's name and besides you are in big trouble."</span> <span id="s847">He says, "I am not in trouble.</span> <span id="s848">You are."</span> <span id="s849">He says, "No, you are because by mistake you killed a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you."</span> <span id="s850">"No, I never killed anyone."</span> <span id="s851">"Yes, you did.</span> <span id="s852">He died here in our hospital.</span> <span id="s853">And before he died, he asked us to call the headquarters and your name is up at the headquarters.</span> <span id="s854">They're killing you.</span> <span id="s855">So get out and bring me what I ask you.</span> <span id="s856">Medication!</span> <span id="s857">And maybe I will help you."</span> <span id="s858">Without a word the guy ran out.</span> <span id="s859">And all of us looked at Raoul, you know, and the doctor start laughing.</span> <span id="s860">He says, "Raoul, what the hell did you just do?"</span> <span id="s861">And Raoul says, "Nothing.</span> <span id="s862">Nothing."</span> <span id="s863">He said, "How did you know it was Simon."</span> <span id="s864">He said, "I didn't know he was Simon, but that's the name of the officer there and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s865">It was Simon."</span> <span id="s866">And then the doctor looked at him again and he says, "Raoul, I never had a Gestapo officer here dying."</span> <span id="s867">He said, "Naturally not, but he killed so many people one of them could have been."</span> <span id="s868">You see, now that was the way he saved.</span> <span id="s869">It could have been a trouble for him at all times.</span> <span id="s870">He did the same thing when he saved 70,000 people.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">02:07:34 We had a ghetto.</span> <span id="s872">A real ghetto.</span> <span id="s873">And that was just about on the end when the Russians were already outside the outskirts of Budapest and Eichmann laughed many times, "Kill everybody," and they put up the guns.</span> <span id="s874">Now by that time, we had quite a few Nazis who wanted to save their life and the Hungarian Arrow Cross and they helped Raoul and one of them came to him one day and he said, "Go immediately.</span> <span id="s875">Eichmann put up the bombs, and they're going to kill the 70,000 people."</span> <span id="s876">And Raoul says very quietly, "Oh, gosh and just our two Red Cross girls are in there delivering medicine and food."</span> <span id="s877">He says, "Get back to your headquarters and tell them that the Germans called off the killing."</span> <span id="s878">And now it's not like in the film.</span> <span id="s879">In the film, he went himself to them.</span> <span id="s880">But it's not so.</span> <span id="s881">We were all in the office and like a little child he says, "Now, listen to what I'm going to do."</span> <span id="s882">He picks up the phone and with his gorgeous German, he calls the headquarters, and he said, "This is Lieutenant Krauss(ph)."</span> <span id="s883">Okay?</span> <span id="s884">"I want to talk to” –I think Veesenmayer was the General's name.</span> <span id="s885">I can't remember it.</span> <span id="s886">And in the meantime, he constantly looks at us, you know, and we all started laughing because he just made a joke.</span> <span id="s887">And when the General came to the phone, he said, "This is Wallenberg."</span> <span id="s888">Of course, he couldn't hang up on him.</span> <span id="s889">And he said, "I really astonished what you are doing.</span> <span id="s890">I understand you are a very highly decorated First World Officer.</span> <span id="s891">How can you take it on your conscious to kill 70,000 innocent people, plus my two Swedish girls who are in there now?"</span> <span id="s892">Whereby he must have answered, "Eichmann ordered," because our Raoul said, "Eichmann?</span> <span id="s893">Didn't you know he left town?</span> <span id="s894">I had lunch with him yesterday."</span> <span id="s895">That was a complete lie.</span> <span id="s896">Now you can imagine.</span> <span id="s897">Eichmann could have stood right beside that general, but he has to risk it because there were 70,000 people’s lives on the line.</span> <span id="s898">Whereby he answered, "I didn't know."</span> <span id="s899">He said, "Alright.</span> <span id="s900">Then, I order you to call off the killing, because if not then I as a diplomat promise you that you will be hanged before your officers."</span> <span id="s901">He hung up.</span> <span id="s902">In two minutes, he called off the killing.</span> <span id="s903">And we have quite a few old people today like that who came to this country.</span> <span id="s904">They didn't know until today who saved them.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">02:10:03 So you see, his life was all – what he was there.</span> <span id="s906">He was lying.</span> <span id="s907">He was cheating.</span> <span id="s908">He was bribing.</span> <span id="s909">But that was the only way.</span> <span id="s910">He did millions of things.</span> <span id="s911">I mean by that time we had our guns too and he dressed his boys up.</span> <span id="s912">They took – the Arrow Cross came in and took people out of our safe houses through the basement and they went.</span> <span id="s913">So Raoul turned to our young boys and he said, "You have the Nazi uniforms."</span> <span id="s914">"Yeah."</span> <span id="s915">"Get dressed.</span> <span id="s916">Get dressed."</span> <span id="s917">"Where we going?"</span> <span id="s918">He said, "You're going after them and bring them back."</span> <span id="s919">Three or four boys went screaming at the German.</span> <span id="s920">They all spoke German, and they said, "We have to take them to the Headquarters."</span> <span id="s921">"No, we have to take them.</span> <span id="s922">You have phony papers."</span> <span id="s923">And the Germans said, "No, I don't have."</span> <span id="s924">"Yes, that's a phony papers."</span> <span id="s925">Took it from him.</span> <span id="s926">"Turn around.</span> <span id="s927">We go."</span> <span id="s928">So these poor people, they didn't know where they going and then finally, one of these little Hungarian came up to somebody and says, "Don't worry.</span> <span id="s929">We are the Wallenberg people."</span> <span id="s930">And they took them all back.</span> <span id="s931">Now we had phony papers.</span> <span id="s932">We had real papers, too.</span> <span id="s933">But you see this – you have to do everything so fast.</span> <span id="s934">Now, it was not always easy.</span> <span id="s935">His big, big heartbreak was when he had an orphanage.</span> <span id="s936">He had two orphanages but in the one, we had 79 children.</span> <span id="s937">And, of course, Raoul visits there bombing time and he picked up those crying kids and he would start making animal noises and telling them stories just to calm them down.</span> <span id="s938">And the kids were talking, laughing and forgot that the bombs were falling like crazy because that was Raoul.</span> <span id="s939">And he visited them as much as he could.</span> <span id="s940">Not every day because he had to go out to the Austrian border and who knows where.</span> <span id="s941">But he came to the children as much as he could, always with candies in his pockets and with just to make the kids happy.</span> <span id="s942">He was a clown without the nose and everything, you know.</span> <span id="s943">And one day he arrived and found the children all dead.</span> <span id="s944">We found out from the guard – was a young boy, who was also shot, but thank God it went in his shoulder, so he could tell the story.</span> <span id="s945">They came in.</span> <span id="s946">Young, young, young, 13, 14 year old kids and started to just shoot the kids.</span> <span id="s947">One little boy went under a chair because his mother taught him before they parted and he thought his mother was dead and Raoul found the little boy walking on the street and said to him, "Whenever you get in trouble, get under a chair."</span> <span id="s948">And these damn Hungarians were so busy shooting, they didn't even look under the chair.</span> <span id="s949">Just kill the kids.</span> <span id="s950">And one more was saved, because she had scarlet fever and Raoul got her some Christian papers and she was in a hospital.</span> <span id="s951">So those two kids were saved.</span> <span id="s952">The rest of it were all dead.</span> <span id="s953">They just killed them for fun!</span> <span id="s954">And this was the only time I ever seen Raoul Wallenberg down on his knees crying, bitterly crying.</span> <span id="s955">For about 10 minutes, he couldn't get to himself because killing children, that was more than he could take.</span> <span id="s956">And then suddenly he got up, and he was again like seven foot tall, and said, "We're not going to stop fighting.</span> <span id="s957">I want to save this nation.</span> <span id="s958">I want the children to make peace in this world."</span> <span id="s959">And he went on fighting.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">02:13:35 And it must have hurt him so badly.</span> <span id="s961">And I do hope you will have a chance once to invite that wonderful young lady who has been saved because of scarlet fever.</span> <span id="s962">Twice she was saved by Raoul, and she is now teaching in Mercer College.</span> <span id="s963">She's teaching humanities and languages.</span> <span id="s964">And you should have her.</span> <span id="s965">I will give you the address after.</span> <span id="s966">She's a marvelous person.</span> <span id="s967">So in any case this was the two people.</span> <span id="s968">And then Raoul was out again, when we heard that they shooting people into the Danube River.</span> <span id="s969">And it was December, just before Christmas.</span> <span id="s970">And what the Hungarians did – it was no snow – it was a no stars, only heavy snowing and the Danube, the first time in 40 years was really frozen with huge icicles.</span> <span id="s971">And they thought this is the best time to kill people because nobody will look for them and in the dark and they were cowards these, these Hungarian Nazi men.</span> <span id="s972">But Eichmann said, "Do it."</span> <span id="s973">So what they did, they roped three people together and then they shot the middle one and, of course, all three of them fell in and died.</span> <span id="s974">Some of them, I understand, swam out somehow and survived.</span> <span id="s975">But Raoul arrived home the third day to hear about that from wherever he was, and he was beside himself.</span> <span id="s976">"What will Eichmann do next?</span> <span id="s977">How can they do that to human beings?"</span> <span id="s978">And this was the first time he turned to us and asked, “How many of you can swim?”</span> <span id="s979">I was the only one with three other diplomats, men, who put up my hand.</span> <span id="s980">I said, "I was taught swimming in school.</span> <span id="s981">Let's go."</span> <span id="s982">I had no idea where we're going.</span> <span id="s983">So we went with our trucks on the other side.</span> <span id="s984">We knew where they were shooting on the right, and on the left.</span> <span id="s985">We turned off the motors.</span> <span id="s986">We had hot soup and change of clothes and we were standing at the cave, and every time we had to synchronize.</span> <span id="s987">When they shot we had to fall in too, so that the splash goes at the same time.</span> <span id="s988">Not that the Hungarians had time to listen because they were so busy.</span> <span id="s989">They were afraid they would be caught.</span> <span id="s990">So we – when they fell we jumped and thanks to the icicles the rope hang on to the ice, and we knew where there is a rope, there is a body.</span> <span id="s991">And we started to pull them out and then the nurses and the doctors were there, put them in, changed them.</span> <span id="s992">Fifty people we saved – what is nothing.</span> <span id="s993">But it's more than if we had no Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s994">We couldn't do more because we were all frozen so stiff that we couldn't move anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s995">02:16:12 And then that was over and then we had one more big thing.</span> <span id="s996">When they advertised – the “lovely” Germans – that all the women between the age of 15 and 25 should go to such and such a palace next morning to clean up Budapest, we knew again that they will take them right out of the country.</span> <span id="s997">So Raoul again turned to his 350 people and he said, "You all have young friends and sisters and so on, so we got the pictures and we were working in the Buda side in a beautiful villa because as I told you we always had to move our offices and Danielsson was sitting there, the Minister, signed each one of these passes.</span> <span id="s998">And there was a curfew.</span> <span id="s999">No one, no Jews, no Christians, nobody was allowed out on the street.</span> <span id="s1000">But what was so amazing that it was a most beautiful, moonlit night, cold like ice, but moonlit.</span> <span id="s1001">Why they didn't bomb us, nobody knows.</span> <span id="s1002">Why they didn't come on that night.</span> <span id="s1003">Maybe they knew about this stuff, and they didn't.</span> <span id="s1004">We don't know.</span> <span id="s1005">The CIA must have been very good and the Scotland Yard.</span> <span id="s1006">They didn't come.</span> <span id="s1007">And suddenly Raoul arrived around midnight.</span> <span id="s1008">Again, he looked hungry and tired and unshaven, but he said, "Are you all finished because by two o'clock we have to deliver all these passes?"</span> <span id="s1009">And so we said, "Yeah."</span> <span id="s1010">And then he told us quickly a joke.</span> <span id="s1011">He said, "I don't want you to look up, but I want you to know that we have new neighbors in the next villa."</span> <span id="s1012">And naturally we all looked up.</span> <span id="s1013">He says, "Don't look up.</span> <span id="s1014">Just work.</span> <span id="s1015">It's only the German Headquarters."</span> <span id="s1016">And he did like he didn't care.</span> <span id="s1017">If Raoul doesn't care if the German has headquarters, why should we, you know?</span> <span id="s1018">I mean it was crazy.</span> <span id="s1019">We were taken over by his strength.</span> <span id="s1020">And it was really a feeling, “If he can do it, then we should help him with everything.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">02:18:10 So I was the lucky one who was first ready with about 500 of his papers and I – he embarrass – embraced me and he said, "Be careful."</span> <span id="s1022">And I said, "Yes Sir, I will."</span> <span id="s1023">And I left.</span> <span id="s1024">And I remember there was no one around.</span> <span id="s1025">I went with the curfew.</span> <span id="s1026">And I walked across the bridge to Pest because all my people were on the Pest side.</span> <span id="s1027">And it was a very emotional going because I had to ring some door bells and some friends of mine came to the door and they said, "Aggie, what you doing out?"</span> <span id="s1028">I said, "Please don't ask.</span> <span id="s1029">Don't ask.</span> <span id="s1030">Just take this.</span> <span id="s1031">An angel sent it to you."</span> <span id="s1032">And we kissed and cried and I went on delivering all 500.</span> <span id="s1033">All I heard is my footstep on the snow.</span> <span id="s1034">But no bombing.</span> <span id="s1035">Nobody.</span> <span id="s1036">So I went home and finally I sit down on my bed and then it dawned to me what I just done.</span> <span id="s1037">And I said to myself, "Are you crazy?</span> <span id="s1038">You could have been killed."</span> <span id="s1039">Then like Raoul Wallenberg would say, "Get killed?</span> <span id="s1040">No way.</span> <span id="s1041">Because the Hungarians and the Germans, they're cowards.</span> <span id="s1042">They wouldn't be daring to be outside in a curfew."</span> <span id="s1043">And I went to sleep with nothing.</span> <span id="s1044">I woke up at six o'clock in the morning that my two girlfriends were thrown out of the camp because of the pass.</span> <span id="s1045">And they ran all the way to our house because they – actually they spoke more German than Hungarian because they were from Berlin.</span> <span id="s1046">But the German officer picked up their German and said something very ugly to them in German what they can do with the paper.</span> <span id="s1047">But the kids made one look at him and they turned around and started to run and he never shot after them.</span> <span id="s1048">He let them run.</span> <span id="s1049">So the paper had a big “something.”</span> <span id="s1050">We don't know what Raoul did really.</span> <span id="s1051">If you read a few books now, you can put it together what really happened and what he did.</span> <span id="s1052">But it was amazing.</span> <span id="s1053">So my two girls friend are actually in this country.</span> <span id="s1054">They are grandmothers, both of them.</span> <span id="s1055">But they lived.</span> <span id="s1056">Okay?</span> <span id="s1057">So it is incredible the things he has done.</span> <span id="s1058">And then that was already Christmastime.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">02:20:21 I have never seen him again, because I got sick.</span> <span id="s1060">Maybe it was partly the Danube, a little bit cold, but it was worthwhile.</span> <span id="s1061">And we only found out after that evidently I had a nervous breakdown.</span> <span id="s1062">But it didn't come out only in the afternoon when I got a bit excited.</span> <span id="s1063">I ran a big fever and there were no doctors to get.</span> <span id="s1064">They were either hiding or being out on the front or they were Nazis.</span> <span id="s1065">But my super said he will find me one.</span> <span id="s1066">And he came to the house and he said, "Ach, just a little cold."</span> <span id="s1067">And that is not funny.</span> <span id="s1068">It was a needle what you give for animals, but neither my mother or me knew to, and he said, "I give her sulfa."</span> <span id="s1069">And very smilingly, he gave me the sulfa, and five minutes after he left, I was in a deep coma.</span> <span id="s1070">And my mother was in a panic and the phones still worked, so she called there.</span> <span id="s1071">The super promised me that one of these days he'd get rid of me, but it didn't work yet.</span> <span id="s1072">He tried it once more.</span> <span id="s1073">Anyway, Mother called a friend and the friend found a doctor.</span> <span id="s1074">And the doctor came and he asked my mother what happened and Mommy said, "He left – I don't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1075">He left a needle there."</span> <span id="s1076">And he says, "Oh, my God.</span> <span id="s1077">He poisoned that child.</span> <span id="s1078">This is for an animal.</span> <span id="s1079">You don't give that to people."</span> <span id="s1080">Somehow they found an anti-whatever.</span> <span id="s1081">So it took a – I got back.</span> <span id="s1082">My mind stayed alright except I had jaundice.</span> <span id="s1083">So I was incapacitated.</span> <span id="s1084">I couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1085">I never saw Raoul again, unfortunately.</span> <span id="s1086">That was my end.</span> <span id="s1087">And then the bombing really became so big and the bridges disappeared so we could not go.</span> <span id="s1088">And that was “part one” of this little life there – very exciting life.</span> <span id="s1089">And then the Soviet arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">02:27:27 And it wasn't better at all than the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1091">If it's possible, it was even worse.</span> <span id="s1092">Because they just picked people up from the streets – never mind who it was – and shipped them right off to Siberia.</span> <span id="s1093">The officers arrived in American tanks and American boots.</span> <span id="s1094">The soldiers came all the way from Siberia barefoot.</span> <span id="s1095">They were hungry.</span> <span id="s1096">They attacked old women, young women.</span> <span id="s1097">They only ones they saved were children.</span> <span id="s1098">They loved children.</span> <span id="s1099">They washed their face in the toilet, and they made their business in the bathtub.</span> <span id="s1100">We couldn't believe it that they were that primitive.</span> <span id="s1101">Some of them stole the watches.</span> <span id="s1102">They had watches from here to here, and they came up to you and say, “tick tock, tick tock.”</span> <span id="s1103">It was incredible.</span> <span id="s1104">So it was not much better as what it was.</span> <span id="s1105">And I had no idea what happened on the other side, what happened to the legation until one day on a boat over came one of our lawyers who was a Czechoslovakian who worked with Raoul and he didn't tell me that Raoul disappeared by himself.</span> <span id="s1106">He didn't say anything.</span> <span id="s1107">He just said that the whole legation has been taken.</span> <span id="s1108">And I assumed that Raoul was with them.</span> <span id="s1109">I knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1110">And I said, "Where did they take them."</span> <span id="s1111">And he said, "Debrecen."</span> <span id="s1112">Debrecen was the headquarters of the Russians.</span> <span id="s1113">And he said, "Do you want to help them?"</span> <span id="s1114">And I looked at him and I said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s1115">How could I help?"</span> <span id="s1116">You know I was all excited.</span> <span id="s1117">And he said, "Well, you have to go to Rumania."</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">02:24:19 And my parents right away, “No, she's not going anywhere."</span> <span id="s1119">I said, "Wait, Mommy.</span> <span id="s1120">Let Paul tell me what he wants."</span> <span id="s1121">I said, "Why Rumania?"</span> <span id="s1122">He said, "Because Rumania is already occupied by French, British, Russian, and Hungarian, and that is the only available embassy, Swedish embassy in the whole Balkan, and somebody has to go there and ask that Ambassador to help this one."</span> <span id="s1123">And I said, "Can I go?</span> <span id="s1124">How?"</span> <span id="s1125">He said, "Well, it's very easy because the Rumanians are now allowed to repatriate.</span> <span id="s1126">So if you became a Swede legally, now you can become an illegal Rumanian.</span> <span id="s1127">Just don't open your mouth because you don't speak Rumanian."</span> <span id="s1128">I said, "Well, that's great."</span> <span id="s1129">So my parents were very much, "No.</span> <span id="s1130">No.</span> <span id="s1131">No."</span> <span id="s1132">I said, "Mommy and Poppy, the Swedish government saved us.</span> <span id="s1133">At least what I can do, save them and Raoul.</span> <span id="s1134">I mean what they have done for all of us."</span> <span id="s1135">So they knew that I have a hard neck and anything they will tell me, I will say, “No.”</span> <span id="s1136">So they – Paul said, "I'll come back in a couple of days, bring you the papers."</span> <span id="s1137">Now how you get there?</span> <span id="s1138">We had the same wagons as we had to deport the Jews.</span> <span id="s1139">And we were – I was told by a few people that some people are disappearing middle of the trip by the Russians.</span> <span id="s1140">They take them to Siberia or they're ship back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s1141">"Do you still want to do it?"</span> <span id="s1142">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1143">What else can you say?</span> <span id="s1144">You have to try.</span> <span id="s1145">So I had a knapsack, and I had a fur coat, what was my only warm stuff I had.</span> <span id="s1146">And I had slacks and we had ski shoes what was on me for four months because it was so cold and we always went down to the basement.</span> <span id="s1147">And it took us 12 hours before we even left the station.</span> <span id="s1148">And you didn't know who the other people were.</span> <span id="s1149">You knew nothing.</span> <span id="s1150">But in a little while everybody warmed up.</span> <span id="s1151">Everybody was hungry, so everybody came out with a little food so at least we had eaten.</span> <span id="s1152">But after six hours of trip they suddenly stopped.</span> <span id="s1153">They said, "Something wrong with the train.</span> <span id="s1154">Get out."</span> <span id="s1155">We didn't know where we were and again this feeling, "Oops, we can be picked up by the Soviets now.</span> <span id="s1156">What happened?"</span> <span id="s1157">But we were taken to a school and we slept in that school.</span> <span id="s1158">There was room on the floor.</span> <span id="s1159">It was cold, but somehow when 30, 40 people sleep in one room, you don't even feel the cold anymore.</span> <span id="s1160">You were all dressed.</span> <span id="s1161">And we were waken up in the morning that we're going on to Rumania.</span> <span id="s1162">And there were very lovely Rumanian soldiers up there and they spoke a little Hungarian and German.</span> <span id="s1163">And they explained to us that when we come to the front – frontier that Russian soldiers will come.</span> <span id="s1164">And we were in a wagon with a lot of hay.</span> <span id="s1165">He says, “I would like you to all go under the hay somehow and not a word.</span> <span id="s1166">Please try not to cough.</span> <span id="s1167">Try not to sneeze.</span> <span id="s1168">Usually the Russians are drunk, but they will come in with the spotlight.</span> <span id="s1169">And Good luck.</span> <span id="s1170">We have to leave you on your own.</span> <span id="s1171">And let's hope that you all make it in to Rumania."</span> <span id="s1172">So we did that and sure enough, we could hear them coming.</span> <span id="s1173">singing along.</span> <span id="s1174">And they opened this heavy door and they skimmed through and nobody coughed.</span> <span id="s1175">Thank God!</span> <span id="s1176">And they closed the door and we started to move and we couldn't believe we were in Rumania.</span></p> <p><span id="s1177">02:28:01 Now, we arrived in a very small town where I had two wonderful girlfriends.</span> <span id="s1178">One of them was a baroness who was a great philanthropist, and I was hoping that she lived through all this and she did.</span> <span id="s1179">And the other one was a girl who went to our famous Liszt Academy of Music and she lived in our house and then she went back.</span> <span id="s1180">“Maybe in Rumania there won't be any war,” so she goes home.</span> <span id="s1181">She lived too.</span> <span id="s1182">And that's a long story I don't want to get in.</span> <span id="s1183">Anyhow, I met each of them, and then I told my friend, Marika, that I have to go to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1184">And she said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1185">I said, "I can't tell you."</span> <span id="s1186">She said, "Well, I know you well enough.</span> <span id="s1187">If you can't tell me, there must be a good reason."</span> <span id="s1188">But nobody's allowed to go on, only in official capacity on these trains.</span> <span id="s1189">I said, "Could you find some official reason?"</span> <span id="s1190">She said, "I will."</span> <span id="s1191">The next day I got my police whatever it was, to get to Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1192">First class.</span> <span id="s1193">Two Russian officers.</span> <span id="s1194">And my stomach went down.</span> <span id="s1195">Both of them looking at me.</span> <span id="s1196">One of them picks up the vodka, says in Russian to me, "Drink."</span> <span id="s1197">And I said, "No."</span> <span id="s1198">And he looks at me again, "Drink!"</span> <span id="s1199">He took it to my mouth and I let it run.</span> <span id="s1200">I was scared.</span> <span id="s1201">I said, "Now, for that I came out.</span> <span id="s1202">Now I'm going to be raped or who knows?"</span> <span id="s1203">I was frightened.</span> <span id="s1204">So the one suddenly started to – "You speak German."</span> <span id="s1205">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1206">I said, “Uh-oh, now inquisition.</span> <span id="s1207">Maybe he's thinking I'm a Nazi or something.”</span> <span id="s1208">So they asked questions here and there in German.</span> <span id="s1209">And he said, "Are you Romanian?"</span> <span id="s1210">I said, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s1211">But I lived in Hungary."</span> <span id="s1212">He said, "What you going to do."</span> <span id="s1213">"I'm going to teach."</span> <span id="s1214">Come out of my mind you know.</span> <span id="s1215">In the meantime, the other one is still looking at me.</span> <span id="s1216">Finally, we come to Sinaia.</span> <span id="s1217">That was a stop.</span> <span id="s1218">And I said, "I have to get off for fresh air."</span> <span id="s1219">They let me go.</span> <span id="s1220">And I come back, they were not there.</span> <span id="s1221">The two coats were there.</span> <span id="s1222">No officers.</span> <span id="s1223">So we were already moving and they still were not there.</span> <span id="s1224">Suddenly, I see them coming, looking around and jumping in, closed the door.</span> <span id="s1225">So inside, something told me that these are not just bad Russian officers.</span> <span id="s1226">There must be something, but I didn't ask.</span> <span id="s1227">I didn't talk.</span> <span id="s1228">Suddenly, the one in German started to talk to me again.</span> <span id="s1229">Said, "Are you Jewish?"</span> <span id="s1230">I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1231">He said, "So am I." And, you know, I look at him again.</span> <span id="s1232">I said, "What you doing?"</span> <span id="s1233">He said, "We are dissidents."</span> <span id="s1234">So but I still didn't tell them who I really was.</span> <span id="s1235">And he said, "We are trying to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1236">My friend doesn't speak a word other.</span> <span id="s1237">He's Christian.</span> <span id="s1238">He's from, from Stalingrad” – or I don't know where – no, from Kiev and he was from Odessa, and they are friends.</span> <span id="s1239">And he's a writer, the other one and this is a doctor.</span> <span id="s1240">And he said, "We are trying to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s1241">And we are going to Rumania now.</span> <span id="s1242">We don't know now, how, – what.</span> <span id="s1243">Can we help you something there?"</span> <span id="s1244">I said, "Yes, I will need a job.</span> <span id="s1245">He said, "We know everybody at the Joint."</span> <span id="s1246">So I – you know, I mean, it was incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">02:31:38 So we arrived there and they helped my parents a lot.</span> <span id="s1248">They went back to Hungary and helped my parents and then when my parents finally came out, they helped them through Czechoslovakia and my two girlfriends' mother.</span> <span id="s1249">So they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s1250">I don't know what happened to them.</span> <span id="s1251">I have no idea if they ever found them or if they ever made it to Israel.</span> <span id="s1252">I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1253">But it was a very interesting meeting and a couple of times we met in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1254">And they knew by that time that – but they didn't know who Raoul Wallenberg was.</span> <span id="s1255">I told them the whole story why I'm there.</span> <span id="s1256">And the one of them – they said that "We have written a book and I wish you could take it with you."</span> <span id="s1257">And I was very excited and I thought that was a fantastic thing because finally the outside world will know because they have written exactly how bad the life is during Communism and that only the top Communists had everything.</span> <span id="s1258">They can go on travels and they have food and the people just dying around them from hunger.</span> <span id="s1259">So it would have been a terrific book to take with me.</span> <span id="s1260">But we hadn't left Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1261">That's why.</span> <span id="s1262">Finally, I was in Bucharest and they helped me to get a very small job that I am enjoying, but they got me a room.</span> <span id="s1263">And next day I hailed a cab to go to the embassy.</span> <span id="s1264">And the taxi driver also spoke German and Hungarian and he asked me why I am there.</span> <span id="s1265">"Are you Jewish?</span> <span id="s1266">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1267">"So am I." And so we were talking for a little while and he said, "It's a very dangerous place where we're going."</span> <span id="s1268">I said, "Why?"</span> <span id="s1269">He said, "Because the Russian Embassy is just beside the Swedish one."</span> <span id="s1270">It's a gorgeous, gorgeous avenue.</span> <span id="s1271">Beautiful, with all very rich people who used to live there.</span> <span id="s1272">And I said, "Thank you."</span> <span id="s1273">He said, "I'll pick you up again."</span> <span id="s1274">I said, "No, that's not necessary.</span> <span id="s1275">I'll get home."</span> <span id="s1276">"No.</span> <span id="s1277">No.</span> <span id="s1278">I will come."</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">02:33:36 Alright.</span> <span id="s1280">So anyway, I walk in and there's a secretary and she says, "Why – what do you want from the Ambassador."</span> <span id="s1281">And I said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1282">I can't tell you."</span> <span id="s1283">And she wouldn't let me in and I sat there ‘til four o’clock and so in the end she got so tired of me.</span> <span id="s1284">She says, "Look, I think you can go in now."</span> <span id="s1285">So when I went in and he looks at me and he says, "Why did you sit there all day and you didn't come in?"</span> <span id="s1286">And I said, "Could I have told her why I came?"</span> <span id="s1287">And he said, "No."</span> <span id="s1288">I said, "Well, now I'm here."</span> <span id="s1289">So it was so exciting because he had his teletype machine and they were looking for all the people that Paul gave me.</span> <span id="s1290">There was eight Swedes and all their families were looking for them and I could tell them, "Yes, they are alive."</span> <span id="s1291">And my fiancé also was looking for me and I could tell him, "Here I am sitting with you."</span> <span id="s1292">"How did you get here?"</span> <span id="s1293">So I told him my wonderful trip.</span> <span id="s1294">He says, "Oh, boy.</span> <span id="s1295">You really made it.</span> <span id="s1296">Now, promise me one thing.</span> <span id="s1297">Don't carry Hungarian papers.</span> <span id="s1298">Don't carry Rumanian papers.</span> <span id="s1299">Carry nothing but your Swedish paper with you."</span> <span id="s1300">And he gave me a new this is what you have now is a new one, because the other one I don't even know what happened.</span> <span id="s1301">So that's all I carried with me.</span> <span id="s1302">And he said they want me to go with them when they out and I told him exactly where it is.</span> <span id="s1303">And in eight days the whole embassy, minus Raoul Wallenberg was in Bucharest.</span> <span id="s1304">He helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">02:35:03</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Explain.</span> <span id="s1307">I lost something in there.</span> <span id="s1308">You – how did you get the Embassy people into Bucharest.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">A: I didn't.</span> <span id="s1310">That was the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s1311">But I told him where they are.</span> <span id="s1312">So that's why Paul, that lawyer said, "Go, and you're the only one who could help.</span> <span id="s1313">You have to talk to the Ambassador."</span> <span id="s1314">And what the Ambassador did I don't know.</span> <span id="s1315">But as soon as they arrived, of course, it was a big crying and laughing.</span> <span id="s1316">What else can you do you know.</span> <span id="s1317">We all asked, "Where is Raoul," and Per Anger said, "Don't worry about him.</span> <span id="s1318">You know he will come back."</span> <span id="s1319">He never did.</span> <span id="s1320">And then in about – yeah, and they were very nice.</span> <span id="s1321">They said they're going to give me money every week.</span> <span id="s1322">Something to help me out.</span> <span id="s1323">But when I marry my fiancé, then he will have to repay the whole thing to the government.</span> <span id="s1324">And I understood that.</span> <span id="s1325">I mean after all, they will take me with them.</span> <span id="s1326">So there were seven Swedes and I – so eight of us, and they were the 12 Embassy people.</span> <span id="s1327">Finally, we got a call.</span> <span id="s1328">We can leave and it was great excitement.</span> <span id="s1329">And we all went out.</span> <span id="s1330">The railway station is in Ploesti, the famous place where they bombed it.</span> <span id="s1331">And we were all there, and we were about to get on.</span> <span id="s1332">The Embassy people were already on and suddenly the Russian said, “Nyet,” for the other eight and we couldn't go.</span> <span id="s1333">So we were let down you know.</span> <span id="s1334">Thank God, my room was not yet rented.</span> <span id="s1335">So I went back and we stayed together as much as we could and also I was told to be very careful because with the British and the French and the Russian and the Hungarians, I can be any day taken to a prison and asked questions.</span> <span id="s1336">And sure enough, one day up comes a Rumanian.</span> <span id="s1337">And he says, "Papers."</span> <span id="s1338">And I smiled like I don't know what he's talking about.</span> <span id="s1339">He tried every language and I keep on smiling.</span> <span id="s1340">You know I didn't know what to do.</span> <span id="s1341">You know I said, “Now, should I get in trouble?”</span> <span id="s1342">So finally, he motioned me to get into the police station and in the police station, they also talk Rumanian only.</span> <span id="s1343">I gave the Swedish paper.</span> <span id="s1344">He didn't know what that was.</span> <span id="s1345">And then suddenly I asked for a pencil.</span> <span id="s1346">You know, I showed him and he gives me and I put down the Embassy's phone number.</span> <span id="s1347">In about half an hour, the Ambassador arrived.</span> <span id="s1348">He was gray in his face.</span> <span id="s1349">He was so frightened, you know?</span> <span id="s1350">And I was as quick thinking as Raoul.</span> <span id="s1351">I knew a few words of Swedish.</span> <span id="s1352">One was milk, that’s “mjölk.”</span> <span id="s1353">“Tack så mycket” means “thank-you,” and “bröd” is “bread.”</span> <span id="s1354">And as he walked in, I started to throw these out at him, “Mjölk, tack så mycket.</span> <span id="s1355">Bröd, bröd.”</span> <span id="s1356">And I went over and over and I could see how his face started to relax, and he almost started to laugh.</span> <span id="s1357">And, of course, these Rumanians – and he talked something in Swedish to me and I talked back again.</span> <span id="s1358">“Tack så mycket,” this and that.</span> <span id="s1359">So they just let me go.</span> <span id="s1360">And then we going out to the car and he says, "How did you come to that idea?"</span> <span id="s1361">I said, "I'm a Wallenberg girl.</span> <span id="s1362">Remember?"</span> <span id="s1363">I had to think fast.</span> <span id="s1364">You would have never been....” He was laughing all the way back you know.</span> <span id="s1365">He said, "This is most incredible."</span> <span id="s1366">I said, “What else could I have done?</span> <span id="s1367">They would have pushed me either to Siberia or back to Budapest.”</span> <span id="s1368">So that was my whole knowledge of Swedish at that time.</span> <span id="s1369">“Thank you, milk, and bread.”</span> <span id="s1370">But I got out from the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">02:38:43 And then we were called again that now we can leave and that we be careful, because we will have a very, very great security and everything will be taken from us.</span> <span id="s1372">So my two Russian friends came, "Take the book," and I cowardly said, “I don't dare because I understand they're going to do it."</span> <span id="s1373">Said, "Well, we understand."</span> <span id="s1374">Not one thing was looked through.</span> <span id="s1375">We just went by.</span> <span id="s1376">But how do you know that before hand?</span> <span id="s1377">You don't.</span> <span id="s1378">And we went on a – that was very interesting.</span> <span id="s1379">We went on a South American – not South American – South African military plane.</span> <span id="s1380">And the side – we could only sit side – this was the first time in my life I sat in an airplane, you know.</span> <span id="s1381">And we sat on the sides where the bombs used to be there.</span> <span id="s1382">And we had to fly to Bari, what was the headquarters of the British and the French and the Americans and the Indians and everybody.</span> <span id="s1383">And we were the eight Swedes, there was two Frenchmen, not my friends, but other two and there was two British.</span> <span id="s1384">One was a big fat man with a [inaudible] case and he was holding on to them and he looked at us so ugly because one of the ladies – she was German, but she was the wife of a Swedish consul who died, she was a widow – and she and me, we spoke German.</span> <span id="s1385">And what we didn't know that this man was from the Scotland Yard.</span> <span id="s1386">No idea.</span> <span id="s1387">But he didn't like the German talking you know.</span> <span id="s1388">He thought this was Germans who were running away.</span> <span id="s1389">But we didn't know all this.</span> <span id="s1390">And we were in – there was one young man who also, only after–</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">02:40:29</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">Q: We need to, we need to condense this a little bit.</span> <span id="s1393">Could you, could you just tell us when the plane arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1394">A: The plane arrived.</span> <span id="s1395">Okay.</span> <span id="s1396">The plane arrived.</span> <span id="s1397">You're right.</span> <span id="s1398">I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1399">I open my big mouth.</span> <span id="s1400">We arrived to Bari.</span> <span id="s1401">That was the military base for the Americans and the British.</span> <span id="s1402">And we went first to the British headquarters and they invited us to tea and they said that we are going into a hotel because the Swedes are paid for it.</span> <span id="s1403">And we did not go in a hotel.</span> <span id="s1404">We went to a transit camp.</span> <span id="s1405">“Number One,” what was before for the Jews.</span> <span id="s1406">From there they took them to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s1407">Now it was for German prisoners, and for people whom they didn't know what to do with.</span> <span id="s1408">And it turns out that this man was from Scotland Yard and when he heard us talking German, he made up his mind that we were Nazis running away.</span> <span id="s1409">We were four weeks in that place until they found us.</span> <span id="s1410">But, as you said, we have to condense.</span> <span id="s1411">I can't tell you.</span> <span id="s1412">We were there four weeks and it was most interesting, fascinating, all the things what happened.</span> <span id="s1413">Then we got word that we can go up to Rome, and we got an American, wonderful American, young sergeant, who had a truck and he drove us through Monte Cassino, and this I don't want to go in either.</span> <span id="s1414">And he was singing all the way, like Paul Robeson, you know, in a gorgeous voice.</span> <span id="s1415">He didn't sing in Monte Cassino.</span> <span id="s1416">None of us could.</span> <span id="s1417">It was tragic there.</span> <span id="s1418">But anyhow, he took us to Rome.</span> <span id="s1419">In Rome, we were another month, and from Rome we went, finally, to Switzerland.</span> <span id="s1420">And from Switzerland, the old ladies were taken on an airplane and the Ambassador's girlfriend who was a Hungarian Countess, she was flying there.</span> <span id="s1421">And almost everybody except the lady who spoke German and this one Hungarian I think it would be the inner-minister’s son, whom we only found out after that he worked for the Scotland Yard.</span> <span id="s1422">Didn't even know that.</span> <span id="s1423">Just he left to – so only one man, another man whose wife was Swedish, and this lady and I we stayed.</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">02:42:43</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Q: What happened to you at this point again very briefly.</span> <span id="s1426">What – where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: Well, at this point, it was very exciting because I have a huge family there.</span> <span id="s1428">And all I wanted to tell them this marvelous story about Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s1429">First of all, they didn't want to hear anything – not about Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1430">They weren't interested.</span> <span id="s1431">And I kept on saying, "But this is such a wonderful story."</span> <span id="s1432">"I told you we are not interested.</span> <span id="s1433">And don't think so much about it.</span> <span id="s1434">We don't have it.”</span> <span id="s1435">Switzerland had everything, but they didn't want it.</span> <span id="s1436">So it was a very unpleasant four weeks when we got our marching orders that we can go with the Norwegian Red Cross through Germany into Denmark and then from Denmark to Sweden.</span> <span id="s1437">Well, the Swiss knew exactly that we had no food in Germany at all, and they took everybody's food and everybody's money away.</span> <span id="s1438">And I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s1439">Again, I was all the way in the back.</span> <span id="s1440">I went into the toilet and I took all my money and I put it in my shoe and I went back.</span> <span id="s1441">So at least I had money.</span> <span id="s1442">Food, they took away.</span> <span id="s1443">So we went three days and we didn't eat because there was no food in Germany no where.</span> <span id="s1444">We went through Nuremberg.</span> <span id="s1445">We went through whole lot of things, and then we arrived in this small town of Denmark and it's incredible.</span> <span id="s1446">There was a whole village made up with maybe millions of showers with hot water and food.</span> <span id="s1447">You have never seen so much food in your life.</span> <span id="s1448">We all got sick because we didn't – we couldn't eat that much, but the Danes just didn't know what to do because there were Norwegians who were stuck.</span> <span id="s1449">And there were Danes and there were Swedes and there were us, you know.</span> <span id="s1450">They were incredible.</span> <span id="s1451">Our drivers on the car – on the trucks by the way were Nazi prisoners, and I will never forget that, that nobody – all the Norwegians, the Danes, they spoke German.</span> <span id="s1452">None of them wanted – but they decided it is dangerous because all the signs through Germany now in English and there are places where there are no bridge.</span> <span id="s1453">Somebody has to do it, so I used to be the youngest.</span> <span id="s1454">So they said, "Will you speak to them in German?"</span> <span id="s1455">So I said, "Do I have to?"</span> <span id="s1456">"Yeah."</span> <span id="s1457">So I sat with the driver and he still had the Swastika hanging there.</span> <span id="s1458">Today, I'm laughing about it.</span> <span id="s1459">If he would have known that a Jew is giving him the directions and the orders what to do, I think he would have killed us all.</span> <span id="s1460">But it was fun.</span> <span id="s1461">And we made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">02:45:17</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: We need to – excuse me, we need to condense.</span> <span id="s1464">Could you now tell us when you got into Sweden?</span> <span id="s1465">Just very briefly.</span> <span id="s1466">How long you were there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1467">A: Sweden, I got in, in October.</span> <span id="s1468">October four or five.</span> <span id="s1469">And I first went to my fiancé's mother.</span> <span id="s1470">First, they wouldn't let me in and that's a long story.</span> <span id="s1471">I'll tell you another day.</span> <span id="s1472">And then we went up for a weekend to Stockholm already together with his mother.</span> <span id="s1473">And there was two gentlemen.</span> <span id="s1474">He and another gentleman who met me, and they were greeting me with a fist like this and I said, "What's that?"</span> <span id="s1475">And he said, "Oh, don't you know?</span> <span id="s1476">That's the Communist's greetings."</span> <span id="s1477">And my stomach went down again and I said, "Huh?"</span> <span id="s1478">Tells me his greetings, but I thought it was just stupid joke.</span> <span id="s1479">Anyhow, next day, that was Sunday.</span> <span id="s1480">Monday, I got in contact with everybody from the Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s1481">My first question was, "Where is Raoul?"</span> <span id="s1482">"We don't know," was the answer.</span> <span id="s1483">And then I told them about my fiancé whom I have to marry, and I told them that I am very disturbed because he greet me like that and you will have to understand that I cannot marry a Communist.</span> <span id="s1484">And they say, "Well, we understand that, but after all, he…."</span> <span id="s1485">I said, "Yes, I know."</span> <span id="s1486">They found out he was one of the top Communists.</span> <span id="s1487">And what happened is that in Switzerland, I was interviewed by a friend who's a newspaper man.</span> <span id="s1488">And, as usual, with newspaper people, they go after their own head.</span> <span id="s1489">I said, "I'm going to Sweden."</span> <span id="s1490">What he put down that I'm going in Hungarian government business to Oslo.</span> <span id="s1491">And even when the Embassy saw it, "Is she crazy?</span> <span id="s1492">Well, what is this?"</span> <span id="s1493">So that wasn't true and so this fiancé of mine thought that I am going from Communist business so he brought the chief of Communist's party.</span> <span id="s1494">Anyways, everything turned out.</span> <span id="s1495">I didn't have to marry him.</span> <span id="s1496">And that was wonderful, you know.</span> <span id="s1497">But in the meantime, it also turned out that he really wanted to save me and he was in love with someone else.</span> <span id="s1498">So it turned out alright that far.</span> <span id="s1499">But I was there and I very fast got a wonderful job with Count Bernadotte who brought in from all the camps the people they needed – people who go out and can speak France and German and Hungarian and tell them stories about Swedish literature and culture.</span> <span id="s1500">And that was a very wonderful thing to do because I had a key to the Royal Library because they had the books were translated from Swedish to German so I could read Selma Lagerlöf and all that.</span> <span id="s1501">And I went and spoke for six months in all the camps.</span> <span id="s1502">I was very well paid, and it was also very wonderful.</span> <span id="s1503">The people I met in these camps who came out so sick, and the Swedes took care so beautifully of them.</span> <span id="s1504">So that was the – I was three years in Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1505">02:48:33 After this job, I worked for a Scandinavian bank and then I got frightened from the Soviets because everybody thought the Soviet going to overrun Sweden.</span> <span id="s1506">Everybody was learning Russian in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1507">Children were – when they were naughty, they said, “We give you to the Russians.”</span> <span id="s1508">And I got frightened.</span> <span id="s1509">I just wanted freedom, and it was wonderful and I loved Sweden.</span> <span id="s1510">And Raoul wasn't home yet, and we didn't know what happened.</span> <span id="s1511">Nothing we knew about it.</span> <span id="s1512">And in the meantime, I brought my parents out.</span> <span id="s1513">And I wanted to come to America and they wouldn't let me.</span> <span id="s1514">They said American was closed 12 years for Hungarians.</span> <span id="s1515">So Australia let me, and I went all alone all the way to Australia and left my parents behind in Sweden.</span> <span id="s1516">And Raoul was still not back.</span> <span id="s1517">And we couldn't find him.</span> <span id="s1518">We still didn't hear too much and still nobody was looking for him.</span> <span id="s1519">Actually, nobody cared.</span> <span id="s1520">You never heard that word, “Raoul Wallenberg.”</span> <span id="s1521">Then I came to the States, and when I arrived to the States my parents went to Argentina.</span> <span id="s1522">They lived there for three years, and when I became a citizen, then they finally came here.</span> <span id="s1523">And in 1960, I got married and the first person ever listened and believed the Wallenberg story was my husband.</span> <span id="s1524">Three weeks on our honeymoon, I told him the story and he was crying for three weeks.</span> <span id="s1525">We want that man back, but we still didn't do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">02:50:20 And then as you know, in the late 70s, Congressman Lantos and his wife started to look for him.</span> <span id="s1527">And that's how it all started.</span> <span id="s1528">And now my job is strictly to let the whole world know, especially children, that there is a hero outside.</span> <span id="s1529">Because we don't have any heroes.</span> <span id="s1530">And we don't teach our children.</span> <span id="s1531">And the Holocaust is important.</span> <span id="s1532">Not just because the 6,000,000 Jews, because you know that Hitler killed 3,000,000 people who were priests, nuns, gypsies, blacks, and children in wheelchairs.</span> <span id="s1533">Three million, that's Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1534">Twenty three million young Russians.</span> <span id="s1535">That's Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1536">What's going on in South Africa is Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1537">We don't teach it to our children.</span> <span id="s1538">We can't live like that.</span> <span id="s1539">Children have to know what to fight for as Raoul Wallenberg did, because only the children without prejudice holding their hands, can make peace in the world.</span> <span id="s1540">And this is the only way, and that's what I am teaching.</span> <span id="s1541">I cannot bring Raoul out.</span> <span id="s1542">I have no authority for that.</span> <span id="s1543">I let that let the diplomats handle it.</span> <span id="s1544">But he's teaching us to go on, ‘cause he taught me too.</span> <span id="s1545">Alright, I was in a family where nobody was ever prejudiced, but I learned that, like Raoul, always that there are no colors.</span> <span id="s1546">There are no religions.</span> <span id="s1547">There are two kind of people, the good and the bad.</span> <span id="s1548">And if you're good, try to make the bad better.</span> <span id="s1549">And that's what children – and children listen.</span> <span id="s1550">You'd be surprised how wonderful they are in the schools.</span> <span id="s1551">And if I only reach three or four children in every school, in every college, then we will have some wonderful people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">02:52:23</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">Q: You had told me before the interview about Raoul and being with people.</span> <span id="s1556">Could we go back to the war?</span> <span id="s1557">And go back to your early working with Raoul.</span> <span id="s1558">I know he went to the Yellow Star houses.</span> <span id="s1559">Can you tell us about, about – alright, can you tell us about your going with Raoul to help people?</span> <span id="s1560">You had told me several stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1561">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1562">Not to Yellow houses.</span> <span id="s1563">He never went to the Yellow Star houses.</span> <span id="s1564">He went to the houses what he set up with the Swedish flag.</span></p> <p><span id="s1565">Q: I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1566">You're right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1567">A: Alright?</span> <span id="s1568">I actually didn't go with him in this.</span> <span id="s1569">I was in the hospital many times with him because that he needed help there, the nurses and the sick people.</span> <span id="s1570">And I was a hostess at the Embassy when these people came up to the door to ask, "Please help."</span> <span id="s1571">And then I took their picture and I went to the Ambassador and he would sign.</span> <span id="s1572">And the Danube, as you know, and mostly I helped up in the Embassy.</span> <span id="s1573">Whatever I could do.</span> <span id="s1574">I was not a secretary, I was a gofer – “go for this” and “go for that.”</span> <span id="s1575">And it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s1576">But we always knew what Raoul did, and then on my own, I also collected some people and said, "Do you want to be saved?</span> <span id="s1577">Give me a picture."</span> <span id="s1578">And then I took it back.</span> <span id="s1579">And sometime it come out very embarrassing because you don't remember the people you help, but they remember you.</span> <span id="s1580">And this happened to me when I arrived.</span> <span id="s1581">If you are interested, I arrived to this country, and I had something wrong with my tonsils, and I found a Hungarian doctor of all places up and near West End Avenue in New York.</span> <span id="s1582">And one day, I'm sitting in his living room.</span> <span id="s1583">His living room was his waiting room, and people come up from his bedroom, his family.</span> <span id="s1584">And I'm sitting there reading a book, and suddenly a fat gentlemen walked by and start screaming, "You saved my life.</span> <span id="s1585">You saved my life."</span> <span id="s1586">And I looked around.</span> <span id="s1587">I forgot the war you know.</span> <span id="s1588">Who thinks of the war?</span> <span id="s1589">But he comes suddenly, and he sits down and starts kissing my hand, and talks Hungarian, and I said, "Uncle, what are you doing?</span> <span id="s1590">Who are you?"</span> <span id="s1591">You know, and looking frightened.</span> <span id="s1592">And then he told me the story you see.</span> <span id="s1593">The Embassies are – whether there's a war or not, they close at three o'clock.</span> <span id="s1594">Okay?</span> <span id="s1595">Three o'clock, a knock at the door, and there stands this gentleman with four pictures and he said, "Please.</span> <span id="s1596">Please.</span> <span id="s1597">Would you give us the paper."</span> <span id="s1598">And I said, "I'm sorry.</span> <span id="s1599">We are closed."</span> <span id="s1600">And he started to cry.</span> <span id="s1601">I said, "Okay.</span> <span id="s1602">Okay.</span> <span id="s1603">Uncle.</span> <span id="s1604">Just a minute."</span> <span id="s1605">And I went over to the Ambassador and I said, "Ambassador, just these four more."</span> <span id="s1606">And he said, "No.</span> <span id="s1607">No.</span> <span id="s1608">No.</span> <span id="s1609">I have a date."</span> <span id="s1610">I said, "Please.</span> <span id="s1611">Just sign your name."</span> <span id="s1612">He did.</span> <span id="s1613">And I handed it back to the man.</span> <span id="s1614">It happened to be the son the, the brother-in-law of the doctor.</span> <span id="s1615">Okay?</span> <span id="s1616">And I was so embarrassed.</span> <span id="s1617">And it was him.</span> <span id="s1618">They all survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">02:55:35 Per Anger had the same thing happening to him years after in Vienna in 1956 when the uprising in Hungary happened during the Russians.</span> <span id="s1620">Well, in this uprising the only people who run away, was some Nazis who were left over and some Jews.</span> <span id="s1621">And he was then already Vice Consul in Vienna, and the people came on the boats.</span> <span id="s1622">So he thought, "Well, if Raoul could do it then, maybe I should go down to the riverside and help these people out."</span> <span id="s1623">And he goes in with this little light, and suddenly a lady comes off a boat and starts running.</span> <span id="s1624">"Mr. Anger, you saved me from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1625">Now you're saving me from the Russians."</span> <span id="s1626">And he still – he was – you know, it was, it was a terrible – it's a beautiful feeling.</span> <span id="s1627">To Raoul it happened once.</span> <span id="s1628">When the Russians took him, and it's also you not like to hear that, he right away went.</span> <span id="s1629">He came back once with two Russian officers behind him and the only person who saw him was our electoral in Budapest.</span> <span id="s1630">And he came back and he said, "I don't know whether I'm ordered back to the Russian headquarters, but I don't know if I am going as a guest or as a prisoner."</span> <span id="s1631">This was his last words.</span> <span id="s1632">But he said, "I have to tell you a story.</span> <span id="s1633">On the way here now, we saw a little old lady with still the yellow star that she was carrying bread in her bag.</span> <span id="s1634">And I got out and I said to her, "Do you speak German?"</span> <span id="s1635">And she said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1636">And I said, "I am Raoul Wallenberg."</span> <span id="s1637">And she said, "I know," and she pulled out the pass.</span> <span id="s1638">And he said, "I started to cry."</span> <span id="s1639">He said, "At least one person I know is alive."</span> <span id="s1640">So I'm glad that it happened to him at least once that he found someone who lived because of him.</span> <span id="s1641">And you know, and it happened a few – a year ago, I think, I spoke to a big group grownups in a synagogue, I believe, in Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s1642">And I was telling them the Danube business, and suddenly an old gentleman got up and he says, "Stop."</span> <span id="s1643">And he looked around to the people.</span> <span id="s1644">He said, "Everybody can see this little scratch here?"</span> <span id="s1645">And the people said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s1646">He said, "Well, I was lucky.</span> <span id="s1647">The bullet hit me there, and that's the girl who pulled me out and I froze.</span> <span id="s1648">I said, "No, I didn't."</span> <span id="s1649">He said, "Yes, you did."</span> <span id="s1650">Because you know, after awhile you don't believe it yourself because years going by and I was sick and it was frozen.</span> <span id="s1651">But I was the only woman.</span> <span id="s1652">So and that is a life.</span> <span id="s1653">And I thought it was a wonderful life and I am glad I lived through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span

<p><span id="s1659">A: Well, you see, we worked for Raoul, 350 of us, and we all got working papers, and this is mine.</span> <span id="s1660">And the working paper is written in two languages, in Hungarian and German, and thanks God, everything is signed by Raoul, himself.</span> <span id="s1661">In Hungarian up there he signed and in the German, too.</span> <span id="s1662">It says exactly that we are working under Department B or some of them work for Department A, plus the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s1663">And this we always carried with us the all time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1664">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s1665">03:00:13</span></p> <p><span id="s1666">A: Well, this is before Raoul arrived to Hungary.</span> <span id="s1667">The Swedish Government, itself, gave out 800 of these passports.</span> <span id="s1668">They are real Swedish passports.</span> <span id="s1669">When the house doesn’t have the hard cover, they give you this.</span> <span id="s1670">And I was one of the lucky girls to get one, because I was evidently engaged to a Swedish gentleman and he said if the war wouldn’t have come, I would be his wife.</span> <span id="s1671">So I am Swedish and that’s my paper.</span> <span id="s1672">And I traveled along.</span> <span id="s1673">All the visas on the back, you can see.</span> <span id="s1674">I traveled with this passport until I arrived to Sweden and then – “makuleras” means “void.”</span> <span id="s1675">But I didn’t need it anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s1676">[Schutz-pass for Arnold Mandl is
