NUNBERG</span></p> <p><span id="s11">December 18, 1989</span></p> <p><span id="s12">HW: Where were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">AN: In Wolbrom, Poland.</span> <span id="s14">It’s in Western Poland on the water, close to Germany.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in 1913.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">HW: And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">BN: I grew up in Sosnowicz and was born in 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">AN: My parents were traditional.</span> <span id="s19">I went to the Nevardok Yeshiva from the age of 9 to the age of 17.</span> <span id="s20">I was a good student and went because I wanted to.</span> <span id="s21">We were eight children but I was the only one who went to the yeshiva.</span> <span id="s22">My parents were killed and three of us survived.</span> <span id="s23">Later on I became involved with the Bund.</span> <span id="s24">During the war I was in hiding, in Plaszow, and in other camps.</span> <span id="s25">Towards the end I was in Ravensbruck, where I stayed until liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">HW: Tell me a little about yourself.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">BN: My parents were also traditional and I was one of four children.</span> <span id="s28">During the war I was in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s29">I was liberated from Bergen-Belsen.</span> <span id="s30">I was the only one in my family to survive.</span> <span id="s31">My sister went straight to the ovens.</span> <span id="s32">My brothers were in Skarscysko.</span> <span id="s33">One was hanged for stealing something and the other was taken away during one of the selections they made.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">HW: How did the two of you meet?</span></p> <p><span id="s35">BN: I was a Bundist too and we met through the organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">HW: Where did you stay when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">BN: The Jewish Labor Committee gave out a notice asking whoever had a room, to contact them.</span> <span id="s38">I lived with a widow for a while.</span> <span id="s39">And already in October of 1946 we organized the first organization of survivors.</span> <span id="s40">It was called United Jewish Survivors of Concentration Camps.</span> <span id="s41">We had New Year’s Eve balls, we helped people register for reparations.</span> <span id="s42">We organized our own branch within the Workmen’s Circle named after Zieglebaum who was the Bund representative of the Polish Bund organization in exile and who eventually committed suicide out of frustration.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">HW: What kind of work did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">AN: I worked in the garment district.</span> <span id="s45">I went to F.I.T.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">HW: Where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">BN: In the first years we lived in Brownsville, on Saratoga Ave. Then, in 1954, we moved to the Bronx because we had friends who lived there who were active in the Bund.</span> <span id="s48">They lived on Pelham Parkway.</span> <span id="s49">[labor unions had built projects there before the war]</span></p> <p><span id="s50">HW: How many children do you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">AN: Two.</span> <span id="s52">They went to public school and to the Yiddishe school.</span> <span id="s53">My son went to Cornell and my daughter to Bennington.</span> <span id="s54">They had gone to Bronx Science.</span> <span id="s55">Then my son went to Stanford in biophysics.</span> <span id="s56">My daughter is a doctor in Santa Cruz and she is married.</span> <span id="s57">She started in Chicago and finished in Mount Sinai.</span> <span id="s58">The both have children.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">HW: What do you do with your time now?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">AN: I’m still very active in the Bund organization.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">HW: Have you ever been to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">AN: Yes.</span> <span id="s63">Maybe ten times.</span> <span id="s64">We have family there.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">HW: What do you think of the politics there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">AN: We don’t like what Shamir is doing.</span> <span id="s67">We want peace with the Arabs and without compromise you can’t achieve anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">HW: How do you feel about the situation in America?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">AN: We saw the changes.</span> <span id="s70">We’re opposed to racism and antisemitism.</span> <span id="s71">We feel the downfall of the blacks is their loose family connections.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">HW: Did you experience antisemitism here?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">AN: We have very little contact with non-Jews.</span> <span id="s74">Our neighbors in Pelham Parkway were not Jewish but we were on very good terms with them.</span> <span id="s75">But we didn’t socialize with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">HW: What is your biggest achievement in life?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">AN: The grandchildren.</span> <span id="s78">Because surviving was certainly not in our hands.</span> <span id="s79">We came so close to dying so many times, but we were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">HW: Tell me more about your organizational involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">AN: I was involved with the Workmen’s Circle before I became an American citizen.</span> <span id="s82">I had a very high executive position in the group and traveled all over the U.S. for them --- Chicago, Detroit, Kansas City, and Canada; New Jersey, Pennsylvania.</span> <span id="s83">I did this while I was working as an operator.</span> <span id="s84">I went mostly on weekends and I was basically an organizer.</span> <span id="s85">My wife was home with the children.</span> <span id="s86">At first I didn’t get paid but by the 1960s I was paid by them as a professional.</span> <span id="s87">I gave up my shop and worked for them.</span> <span id="s88">And I can say I would have made much more in my shop.</span> <span id="s89">Basically I was organizing survivors into branches.</span> <span id="s90">I was also very close with the English-speaking members of the Workmen’s Circle.</span> <span id="s91">They wanted to get me in the “American” board of the organization, but it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s92">I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s93">It didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s94">And they were willing.</span> <span id="s95">So what I mean is, it’s not always from their side.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">HW: Why?</span> <span id="s97">What’s the difference?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">BN: We have a summer home in a community of 39 houses, in Highland Mills.</span> <span id="s99">It’s called Raanana and was organized by the Zionist Labor Movement.</span> <span id="s100">There are people in this colony who are our age but are the children of immigrants.</span> <span id="s101">We get along well with them but . . . there’s always a “but”; we are newcomers with a different mentality.</span> <span id="s102">We are very friendly and close with them and we socialize with them, but we are marked by our experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">HW: Did your children go there?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">BN: No.</span> <span id="s105">Actually there was a camp next door owned by the Labor Zionists, but our children went to Camp Hemshech, from the Bund.</span> <span id="s106">It was a Yiddish/Socialist camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">HW: Do you think a Holocaust could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">AN: No.</span> <span id="s109">You have too many different minorities, too many different types.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">BN: Even though we suffered and saw terrible things, I think most of us came out intact in the sense that we still have a belief in the basic humanity of other people.</span> <span id="s111">We don’t condemn the whole German nation or the whole Polish nation.</span> <span id="s112">I don’t look for antisemites in every corner and I don’t say that because someone says something that the Jews don’t like he’s an antisemite.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">HW: It’s very interesting that you feel this way.</span> <span id="s114">Did you ever see a social worker or psychologist since you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s115">BN: No.</span> <span id="s116">I came to this idea myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">AN: I don’t think Jackson is an antisemite.</span> <span id="s118">The problem is if someone says anything against Jews, he’s an antisemite.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">HW: Are your children socialists?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">AN: My son is a scientist and my daughter is not a political type although she is a liberal and was active in the sixties and worked for Eugene McCarthy.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">HW: Would you say then that despite your experiences your outlook remained the same as it always was?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">AN: Yes it did.</span> <span id="s123">Why should we become different just because this happened?</span> <span id="s124">If we become inhuman, then we have lost the argument in which we accuse them of being inhuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">HW: Do you keep any Jewish traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">AN: We have a seder but I never go to synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">BN: We are secular Jews.</span> <span id="s128">We don’t go to shul on Yom Kippur.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">AN: I wouldn’t go to make it look good to someone else.</span> <span id="s130">I’m more religious than the religious Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">HW: Explain that.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">AN: A religious Jew has his religion from thousands of years back.</span> <span id="s133">I have my culture from the renaissance of modern Jewish culture, which is not what happened to people 2,000 years ago, but what happened in the last 1,000 years and that’s more relevant.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">BN: We had socialist schools, we had Jewish life, we participated in the happenings of Jewish life.</span> <span id="s135">We had camps in Europe from the Bund.</span> <span id="s136">I remember that here we wanted to keep the Jewish-secular heritage and our friends were against it.</span> <span id="s137">They said: “Why do you need a secular Jewish school here?</span> <span id="s138">We have good public schools in America; America is not Poland.</span> <span id="s139">Here there is separation of church and state.”</span></p> <p><span id="s140">HW: Well, let me ask you --- did their children marry Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">BN: Our children didn’t marry Jews.</span> <span id="s142">So it taught us a lesson and we were very upset.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">AN: I fought against it with the first one, with our daughter.</span> <span id="s144">I fought very strongly against it.</span> <span id="s145">She went out with Jewish men too in medical school but she said: “I can’t stand them.</span> <span id="s146">They talk only about a boat, a house, and Long Island.”</span> <span id="s147">She couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">BN: It wasn’t because I was against nationalities mixing.</span> <span id="s149">It was a reaction to going through the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s150">This was an emotional, not an intellectual attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">HW: How are the grandchildren being raised?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">BN: Eh . . . .</span> <span id="s153">secularly.</span> <span id="s154">They call us Baba and Zayde.</span> <span id="s155">Our daughter and her husband Raul are active in a Jewish group.</span> <span id="s156">He’s from California with a Puerto Rican background.</span> <span id="s157">They’re with The New Agenda.</span> <span id="s158">Their group is called Koleinu.</span> <span id="s159">They celebrate all the Jewish holidays in their nusach, or style.</span> <span id="s160">We always attend them when we are there.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">HW: Do you think their children will see themselves as Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">AN: Absolutely.</span> <span id="s163">My daughter brings her Jewishness home and her husband likes our way better than his family’s.</span> <span id="s164">His family is not religious.</span> <span id="s165">She organizes every year a memorial for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising.</span> <span id="s166">When my daughter married we were not at the wedding because we were so much against it.</span> <span id="s167">It happened we were in Africa at the time, so we had a good excuse.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">HW: Tell me about you son’s marriage.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">BN: Our son’s marriage we attended.</span> <span id="s170">His wife is Italian-American.</span> <span id="s171">The parents aren’t practicing and neither is the daughter.</span> <span id="s172">They had a secular wedding where God was not mentioned.</span> <span id="s173">Mostly they talked about love.</span> <span id="s174">They’re now married four years.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">HW: And how will they raise the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">BN: Without any religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">HW: Where do they live?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">BN: In Philadelphia.</span> <span id="s179">And I’ll tell you.</span> <span id="s180">We live in a terrible world.</span> <span id="s181">Maybe this mixing is the only way, in the long run, to stop all the hatred.</span> <span id="s182">We’re definitely fortunate in that our children do have a Jewish cultural heritage that they still have.</span> <span id="s183">Of course, maybe I’m rationalizing because I want it to be this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s185">PAGE</span></p> <p><span id="s186">PAGE 5</span></p> <p><span id="s187">USHMM
