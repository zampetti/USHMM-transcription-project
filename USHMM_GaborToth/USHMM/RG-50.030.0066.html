<p><span id="s13">Q: We're on.</span> <span id="s14">We're about to start.</span> <span id="s15">Would you tell me your full name please?</span> <span id="s16">A: Chaim Engel.</span> <span id="s17">C - H - A - I - M.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Where and when were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: I born in January 1916 in -- I born in a small place really, Brudzew, B - R - U - D - Z - E - W, but when I was five years old my father moved to Lódz.</span> <span id="s20">I remember when he lived in this place, they had a textile store -- they called him "the millionaire."</span> <span id="s21">He probably made a living, that's all.</span> <span id="s22">But wasn't, not -- one of the not many Jews there.</span> <span id="s23">He had a store, so automatically he called a "millionaire."</span> <span id="s24">And that's the reason my father left, was just afraid.</span> <span id="s25">It's the antisemitisms for Jews, so he left.</span> <span id="s26">He left, he went, moved to Lódz.</span> <span id="s27">It was when I was around five years old.</span> <span id="s28">And he started different thing.</span> <span id="s29">My father was really not a businessman.</span> <span id="s30">He was really a scholar.</span> <span id="s31">He studied for rabbi.</span> <span id="s32">He never practiced it, but a very Talmudistic -- he was really a -- let me call a scholar.</span> <span id="s33">That's probably the right word.</span> <span id="s34">But he had to make a living, so he had this textile and then he came to Lódz to live and he started different kind of business; and, we, we were not poor but we made it all the years, we made a living, nice living.</span> <span id="s35">And my youth was, in a big city.</span> <span id="s36">I went to schools, to a Jewish school which also had, from the government, you had to go to school to make, regular school.</span> <span id="s37">How do you call it?</span> <span id="s38">The...</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: Public schools.</span> <span id="s41">So while you -- there were schools, Jewish schools, what they had it connected together.</span> <span id="s42">That covered that, too.</span> <span id="s43">So you had both things in the same.</span> <span id="s44">And that's the kind of school I went.</span> <span id="s45">And I finished, the middle school, called middle school, maybe till around 14 years or 15 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">01:03:00 And then I started to work.</span> <span id="s47">My uncle had, a factory, a textile – stockings, they made stockings there, also textile.</span> <span id="s48">And I worked with him there for a year and then I--</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: What, what was life like for a teenager at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, well, we always felt that we are Jews.</span> <span id="s51">We were sections in Lódz I wouldn't go as a Jew, because you were a Jew.</span> <span id="s52">I don't know -- discrimination of, it was so much against Jews I assume I didn't really felt it so much because I lived more in the area of Jews and I maybe didn't have so much contact with not-Jews, but the -- you always were aware that you are a Jew.</span> <span id="s53">You didn't go in certain sections which was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s54">You felt that you are a Jew because the laws which were there or the surroundings what not-Jews, how they acted and reacted to your being a Jew.</span> <span id="s55">So that was really what was as far as I can remember as a as a as a teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you join clubs?</span> <span id="s57">Were you part of a group?</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: not really.</span> <span id="s59">Not really, not really.</span> <span id="s60">We were more -- Jews, my friends who are Jewish, mostly, and we not really lived in an area where were just Jews living.</span> <span id="s61">We were also in an area what lived other people, but your contact mostly you had with the Jewish, because you were resented very much from the not-Jewish.</span> <span id="s62">Very seldom that you had a not-Jewish friend.</span> <span id="s63">And my time was that I worked, I worked till, when, we are 20, 20, you had to go to the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">When you are 20 you went to army for one and a half year.</span> <span id="s65">And that was in 1938.</span> <span id="s66">And, but my mother died in 1936.</span> <span id="s67">She was sick, I don't know exactly what, I think bronchitis or whatever.</span> <span id="s68">Anyway she died and I was about 20 and there come the time I had to go in the army and my father remarried after a short time, married, and I resented this.</span> <span id="s69">So as it came I had to go to the army and I served in the Polish army, for almost one and a half year.</span> <span id="s70">My time expired.</span> <span id="s71">You -- after one and a half year would have been on September the 15th, 1939, and the war broke out on 1st, September the 1st, so I ended up being a soldier while the war broke out, so I was in the war as a soldier, Polish army, against the Germans.</span> <span id="s72">Now talking about the reaction of non-Jews to the Jews, when I was in the army I went in the war.</span> <span id="s73">I was just as afraid from my comrades and from my sergeant as much as, as I was from the Germans.</span> <span id="s74">I didn't trust them.</span> <span id="s75">They mentioned, "You are a Jew," and things like that.</span> <span id="s76">So I was really afraid in a time like that can happen anything with you.</span> <span id="s77">So, we fought till the 25th, seventh, whatever the two weeks, three weeks; and I ended up, I became a prisoner of war.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">And the first reaction I had on the front with that soldier, the German soldier what took me said, "Are you a Jew?"</span></p> <p><span id="s79">01:07:00 I just said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s80">But he didn't react.</span> <span id="s81">He could shoot me or whatever.</span> <span id="s82">He didn't -- said, "Go, go, go."</span> <span id="s83">And they didn't do anything to me.</span> <span id="s84">So, but anyway they took us as prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s85">They kept us for two days outside in the field and it was cold already and they sent us to Germany as, as prisoner of war.</span> <span id="s86">And as prisoner of war we worked; it was very bad.</span> <span id="s87">I got sick and they did hardly fed you.</span> <span id="s88">They didn't get hardly any food, and you know any -- may, maybe I need some medication or whatever.</span> <span id="s89">I didn't get anything.</span> <span id="s90">And most of all was our work.</span> <span id="s91">We went cleaning the streets in Leipzig.</span> <span id="s92">It was -- must have been near to Leipzig, I remember that.</span> <span id="s93">And there we cleaned the street and, and -- till the one day came that all the Jewish prisoners of war from Pole had to be sent back to Pole.</span> <span id="s94">That was in March of 1940, and they sent us back to the place, to Pole, because they figured for the Jewish prisoners of war still has some more privileges than a Jew in Poland and they wanted to get rid of the Jews.</span> <span id="s95">That's the reason they send us back.</span> <span id="s96">And I came and I thought I go back to the place where my father lived.</span> <span id="s97">When I came there I found out that in '39 already, in December, they already took all the Jews out.</span> <span id="s98">There was a big apartment house, so all the Jews took out and sent them away to Lublin.</span> <span id="s99">So I followed them.</span> <span id="s100">I didn't know exactly where, but somehow -- I don't remember how I found him.</span> <span id="s101">I found him where he is, and I came there and he had a hard time because they took only with them whatever they had on their shoulder and they had on them.</span> <span id="s102">They didn't, could take -- you couldn't take anything with them.</span> <span id="s103">So that was a hard time.</span> <span id="s104">Didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s105">So was very, a very hard time.</span> <span id="s106">So when I came back and I looked down what's going on, so I figured -- I went, I went to a farmer and asked if I can be a help there, as farmer's help.</span> <span id="s107">And he agreed to it, and he kept me there as a farm's worker, and I just did farm work.</span> <span id="s108">Was a Ukraine family and, he paid me.</span> <span id="s109">They gave me food and shelter and I think he paid me by the year with so much bags of corn or whatever, what I could sell and that I could help my family with that.</span> <span id="s110">And I was there for one and a half year, and then my brother what was nine years old, younger, was in the age that he could -- he was about 18 or something -- so he could -- 17, 18, that he -- I found for him a job too.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">01:10:10</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: What was it like on the farm for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Now they were, they were nice people and they took me like a farm's help, and probably I was cheaper than anybody else, but they were nice people.</span> <span id="s114">They were pretty good to me.</span> <span id="s115">They were not really to mistreat me or something like that.</span> <span id="s116">And, I had to do all the work.</span> <span id="s117">They were very nice people.</span> <span id="s118">I cannot, say they mistreated me; but my father lived in a place not in the village where I work on the farm.</span> <span id="s119">It was a small place, not far from the farm, about five miles away, things like that.</span> <span id="s120">So sometimes when I had a day off I could go back there and I walked.</span> <span id="s121">A matter of fact back then there was not any transportation there, and there was very hard for the people, for the Jews.</span> <span id="s122">Very hard.</span> <span id="s123">Very restricted, curfew.</span> <span id="s124">They couldn't do things much, but the mostly what they lived is they went to Lublin, brought some merchandise and sold it and that's the way they could live, 'cause it was not that -- they probably they didn't much trade and there was not any industry whatever.</span> <span id="s125">So they had really a hard time and, and the Germans mistreated the Jews.</span> <span id="s126">If he saw one on the street and he didn't like him, he could shoot him like that and they buried him in a place where he stood where he shot him.</span> <span id="s127">So we had places where you have to watch just not to go on these places because there's somebody buried there, so this really was a sad time.</span> <span id="s128">It was also very dangerous to go from my village to the place where I, where my father lived because if a German saw you on the road and he didn't like you for whatever reason, he shot you and no, was no recourse.</span> <span id="s129">He couldn't tell anybody, nobody will listen.</span> <span id="s130">He was king, as far as a Jew concerned.</span> <span id="s131">He didn't need any laws to ever, to adhere to it.</span> <span id="s132">He just, just did whatever he liked, he felt like.</span> <span id="s133">So that was really -- you got used to live with it.</span> <span id="s134">You took it already for normal the way it is.</span> <span id="s135">You just watched out that you are not around what get shot or whatever, so we worked there and the restrictions for the Jews became every time more restrictions and more restrictions till, one day the only things what Jews could do is working at a farm as a farmer's help.</span> <span id="s136">So we were still safe for a little time because in meantime they sent all these Jews, sent away to all these concentration camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">01:13:00 And in June of 1942 when they, they sent a transport of Jews away from the place, and my father was in this group with the second wife, with my step-mother.</span> <span id="s138">They were in this transport.</span> <span id="s139">Later when being in, in Sobibór I found out that this transport went to Sobibór because I met people, younger ones, what went with this transport and they worked there, so they knew about it.</span> <span id="s140">So, to come back to about my story, when I -- so I, as I say we still were able to work at the farmer, till one day all they came the restrictions Jews couldn't work at farmers.</span> <span id="s141">Everybody has to concentrate in the next place, nearest place, bigger place -- all the Jews around what work for the farmers, so in other words it was strict, no, no Jews anymore.</span> <span id="s142">So we know what's going on, so we didn't go, so my brother and my friend were -- all three we worked at the farmer's.</span> <span id="s143">So we decided not to go to this place.</span> <span id="s144">We thought, "Let's go in the woods.</span> <span id="s145">Maybe we'll find some, some partisans, or something like that."</span> <span id="s146">So we went in the woods instead to go to the place, and we walked around in the woods.</span> <span id="s147">We didn't have any food.</span> <span id="s148">It was cold and no shelter, nothing, so we had to come, find our way out of it because we didn't find any partisans and you couldn't live that and the people, the Polish people, wouldn't help you.</span> <span id="s149">They didn't.</span> <span id="s150">First of all we were afraid to show our face and if we did even they were very reluctant have anything to do with you.</span> <span id="s151">You were afraid they might go to tell the Germans that you are there.</span> <span id="s152">So we heard somehow that in Izbica--was a city about maybe 10, 15 miles away, 20 miles, whatever--that there are still some Jews in this place, so we walked till we came there.</span> <span id="s153">We came there in the evening.</span> <span id="s154">And we came, there were still Jews there and we talked with the other Jews what lived still there and surely everybody was helpful to do.</span> <span id="s155">We told them where we come from and what -- sure -- they took us in.</span> <span id="s156">Every stranger, they took us in, in the house and there was full with Jews, you know, on the floor and everybody just took care of a shelter; and the same night the Germans came at night and drove all the people out of the houses to collect them in the center of the city and to go to send them away to the camps.</span> <span id="s157">Now we were still -- there was this old houses, you had this attics and things like that, so we tried to hide there in the building not to come out, but they didn't do any effort to get you out because they figured eventually you will have to come out.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">01:16:10 No food, no shelter, no facilities, you have to come out, and that is what happened.</span> <span id="s159">After three nights hiding and not having food, whoever was hiding came out of this place and the others went already what they collected, they went already sent them back to a camp and we were the ones what were hiding, so they later they took us to the trains, to the freight trains; and, whatever people they collected, they pushed us in, in this freight trains, as many people as they could squeeze in and we were standing, no moving, nothing and the whole night we traveled in this train.</span> <span id="s160">Now there was people fell down.</span> <span id="s161">People had to go to the bathroom and there was, there was a mess -- you cannot imagine.</span> <span id="s162">But you had no, any choice, nothing.</span> <span id="s163">So that after the morning -- in the morning we ended up arriving in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s164">That is the way we arrived in Sobibór.</span> <span id="s165">So I was with my brother and myself and my friend; and we all meet the other rest of the people, about seven, 800 people and they took us out from the trains and they put us in two lines and they start collecting -- picking out people.</span> <span id="s166">I didn't know what the picking out means, so one German asked me, "Where are you from?"</span> <span id="s167">I said, "From Lódz."</span> <span id="s168">"Out."</span> <span id="s169">And then they went further.</span> <span id="s170">"What are you?"</span> <span id="s171">"A carpenter."</span> <span id="s172">"Out."</span> <span id="s173">Things like that, so they picked about 18 to 20 people.</span> <span id="s174">Well, let me maybe say that we hear in Poland that that happens with the Jews.</span> <span id="s175">They kill Jews and they gas Jews and things like that; but we really, as young people, we really didn't believe that something like that is possible.</span> <span id="s176">We thought, “Maybe the younger people will take to work.</span> <span id="s177">Maybe only the older people….”</span> <span id="s178">You just didn't want to be -- wan-- wanted to believe, because it was so incomprehensible, so unbelievable that something like that can happen that you just -- even if you had the intelligence you didn't believe it, so when they picked us out in the camp, I really didn't know what means the picking out means, whether life or death.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">01:18:35 So they took us -- the 20 people -- they took us in one side and the others went to the camp, to the gas chambers -- what we found out later.</span> <span id="s180">So we worked in there.</span> <span id="s181">Went -- in the afternoon, in the afternoon, they took us with all the other people to separate the clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s182">That started to be our work and I started to separate my clothes -- that was the clothes from people who just arrived with the transport what we came with, and while I did that I found the clothes of my brother, the pictures from the family, so I knew already -- they already told me what's going on, so I knew already what happened, that he went to the gas chamber with my friend and I am here separating his clothes.</span> <span id="s183">So you can imagine what went through my mind when that happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: What did you do?</span> <span id="s185">How did you handle that?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Well, I really don't know.</span> <span id="s187">I, I -- everything stopped on me, like I stopped functioning.</span> <span id="s188">I just -- also I heard all the stories before that didn't penetrate in me, I didn't accepted it, but that made it already accepting.</span> <span id="s189">That is the truth.</span> <span id="s190">That's what happened, because I saw what happened.</span> <span id="s191">So it's hard to tell the feelings.</span> <span id="s192">It's -- it is just -- you stop thinking.</span> <span id="s193">You stop functioning.</span> <span id="s194">It is just like somebody hits you with a hammer in your head, something like that, so -- but you had to do your work.</span> <span id="s195">You were not your own.</span> <span id="s196">You had to function just to function, to move, to go, to do things like that, so we finished our work and surely constantly in my mind what happened and, and, and that was really our work, what we do, day in, day out and, and then we went back and then after the work they always kept us around five o'clock, before it gets dark, back to the barracks, where we, we slept.</span> <span id="s197">Selma told the work about it was divided.</span> <span id="s198">It was a section where the Germans lived, and that was really fixed up nicely with gardens and things like that.</span> <span id="s199">And then was barracks where we lived, mostly where, we slept in other words.</span> <span id="s200">And there was a few places in the park or call it camp or whatever -- there were also places where they had a shoemaker, a goldsmith, a tailor, a regular smith, things like that, but that was mostly not for the camp.</span> <span id="s201">That was mostly work done for the Germans in the camp.</span> <span id="s202">What they need some work, they did it; like the goldsmith that did for them good different things, made for them up rings.</span> <span id="s203">You see, the camp really was -- that was one of many camps, of about four or five camps what was really a death camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">01:22:00 It was not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s205">The distinction is the death camp, people came there, they were directed to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s206">They -- the small group what worked, like us, was just to keep the things going; in other words separating the clothes, cleaning out....</span> <span id="s207">Before we came, before I came, about a few months before, they start, it was different.</span> <span id="s208">When a transport came, they picked out about 50, 60 people from this transport and when all the people were already in, gone to the gas chamber, they cleaned up after them and then these people were shot in the gas chamber, often in the camp, Camp Three.</span> <span id="s209">later they found out it's more efficient for them to have the same people do always the same work, so they start to have permanent people doing the cleaning up, the separating all the kind of thing, and that what started to be a permanent group in this camp what worked there.</span> <span id="s210">And we were the ones what, what did this kind of work.</span> <span id="s211">So it was, as I have to explain maybe, the camp was so as I say we lived apart where the Germans lived.</span> <span id="s212">We lived, the place where we worked and there was Lager Three, or Camp Three, where the people went to the gas chambers and there, there were in the beginning was as burying and later….</span> <span id="s213">Is that the right word?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Buried.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: Buried them.</span> <span id="s216">And later, they came they burned.</span> <span id="s217">They had a big roaster thing that they burned the people.</span> <span id="s218">Now, also, we had hard times.</span> <span id="s219">Everyday, almost, they beat you, they, they mistreated you.</span> <span id="s220">They made you working, day and night and all the kind of thing, but you were young and you could take it as much as you could take it.</span> <span id="s221">Whoever couldn't take it was taken to the camp, to Camp Three and was shot and a lot of people couldn't make and they fell, just fell from the from the kind of work and the food you have and things like there was a change of people.</span> <span id="s222">Very often a lot of people were changed because they just couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s223">They couldn't, physically they couldn't have it.</span> <span id="s224">Now the people what work in Lager Three was often a change of it, because the people worked directly with the bodies and having to work on that, it -- most people, mentally, they just couldn't have it; and they were changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">They had to change the group.</span> <span id="s226">They killed, they killed them and they picked out another group of people and they took them, or they took some of ours or things like that.</span> <span id="s227">They took; and if you once came there, you never came out of it because that was the real end, the real end.</span> <span id="s228">Nobody could come out from that.</span> <span id="s229">So, in camp itself the food what they gave you really was -- we called it a straw soup.</span> <span id="s230">That was something you couldn't even swallow.</span> <span id="s231">You had to spit out and in the morning, black water and a slice of bread for the 24 hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">01:25:30 Now if you had to live on that, you couldn't really live there; but because we work with this, clothes, separating the clothes and the people came -- they always brought with them -- you saw -- they couldn't take much with them, the people what got sent on the transport.</span> <span id="s233">They just took them from the houses and say, "Go," so they took with them -- usually what you take, you take with you the valuables what you can in small things like diamonds, rings and things like that.</span> <span id="s234">They figure, "They'll let me take something.</span> <span id="s235">You never know what happen."</span> <span id="s236">And also some food.</span> <span id="s237">They took cans of food, things like that, so we were the ones what really worked with that, so knowing that we don't have much to, to eat, so we took the risk to steal this food and we brought it back and we ate it.</span> <span id="s238">Now if they caught you, you were shot on the place.</span> <span id="s239">You had a piece, a can, or whatever, they shot you.</span> <span id="s240">They didn't even question, ask you nothing.</span> <span id="s241">Just shot you.</span> <span id="s242">Now lot of times they did it, they caught somebody, they took us out to show what happens if somebody steals, but we still kept doing it, regardless; and so we really had -- sometimes we had food to eat.</span> <span id="s243">So even the time when we didn't have the food one evened out with the other, so we were not -- as far as that's concerned, not they fed us but we fed ourself.</span> <span id="s244">We took the food, we stole the food and so we had sometimes from the transport, we had the food.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">01:27:00 And also, as for clothes, what I mentioned -- people ask you, “In the camp you look not so bad dressed,” and things like that.</span> <span id="s246">Now we work with these clothes, so if, if we had a ripped jacket and we saw another one, we took another jacket and we didn't have special camp clothes.</span> <span id="s247">We had our regular clothes what we came in, so there as far as that, but there was always the -- if you didn't look right or the German maybe had just a drink and he didn't like your look, he took you out and shot you.</span> <span id="s248">There was nothing.</span> <span id="s249">He didn't have to give any account to anybody what he is doing.</span> <span id="s250">He just did whatever he felt like.</span> <span id="s251">Now we had some what we had to be very careful, because they always were suspicious.</span> <span id="s252">And if they had any suspicion, justified or not justified, you could be a target of it.</span> <span id="s253">What they did, sometimes they took us out from the bed and they, they took us and shot people and things like that, you didn't look right, you didn't walk right.</span> <span id="s254">And also when they took us out on Appelland you didn't stay right, he decided, gives you 25 whips -- they had whips -- 25 whips on the, on the on, on, on your bare, bare bottom.</span> <span id="s255">So, I had it a few times.</span> <span id="s256">I got beaten, so, so I took when I was on my work I saw some other pants, so I took two pair of pants.</span> <span id="s257">I figured if they beat me it wouldn't be so bad.</span> <span id="s258">So they found out that, so I got beaten and I had to take off both my pants.</span> <span id="s259">And so you got beaten on 25 whips and if you, you had to count it.</span> <span id="s260">If you didn't -- stopped counting in the middle, you had to start from the beginning and he gave you another 25.</span> <span id="s261">So that was really one of the minor things.</span> <span id="s262">The main thing was we always were living with that people seeing what we -- the transports that came and they went to these gas chambers -- men, women, children, and that was always a heart-breaking thing to see and, and that was really.</span> <span id="s263">… Ours is beating alright, the next day you were better, but that is not so important.</span> <span id="s264">But that what we saw what happens, and that what really always touched us.</span> <span id="s265">But, but it is strange that even, even, if you were young and even if you see what happen and you know it's no way out of here, even if you think, "It's just a fantasy," that you think, "I will come out of here all right."</span> <span id="s266">It just -- you hope, your hope is justified hope -- not justified hope, but you think because your will for life is so -- you think, "Ah, one day I will come out of it."</span> <span id="s267">There was really not any reason to believe it will happen, because it was, it was around with barbed wires, mines around, in the woods, guards around, dogs around, and even if you get out you wouldn't know where to go even.</span> <span id="s268">So there was not really any, any real hope whatever, not any spark of hope there that you would can come out ever.</span> <span id="s269">But still, you know, 1 roll call (German).</span></p> <p><span id="s270">as I say, you're young.</span> <span id="s271">You think -- a matter of fact sometimes being in a camp and you're not fully alert, you were not -- you couldn't believe that what happened happens here because it was so far from reality really, thinking that -- how can you imagine -- they burn people -- they, they kill people, young people, children.</span> <span id="s272">You couldn't believe that.</span> <span id="s273">So if you're not really fully aware you thought that is not true, you just dream.</span> <span id="s274">But really that was, was what happened.</span> <span id="s275">So, in general to say that really what, what was the situation in camp.</span> <span id="s276">So there are different, cases that happened that people -- it is in the movie, is it about -- there was a group what worked outside the camp, about 10 people, 15 people, whatever; and they went out with two Ukrainians to work there.</span> <span id="s277">Now and there was in this group -- one day, they and were in this, in this Ukraines, the guards -- and they killed one and, and they start to run away, so a few got away and the rest were caught and brought back to the camp.</span> <span id="s278">And when that happened, they -- we had to go on Appell and they took us to show how they shot all these people and we had to see it as a lesson when you ran away.</span> <span id="s279">That was one accident.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">There was another one, a similar story happened something -- somebody ran away so this time they took different.</span> <span id="s281">They took each 10th -- they put us on an Appell and every 10th of the line they picked out; and every 10th, the group what they collected from that they took them with them and they shot them together with the other ones.</span> <span id="s282">Now I happened to be number nine in a line where they picked the 10th of it, so luck was with me somehow I guess.</span> <span id="s283">So they, they shot this group; so things like that happened very, very often.</span> <span id="s284">I really couldn't recall how many times -- probably Selma told about this -- 72 Dutch people, there was a rumor that they want to ran away so they took the whole 72 to Camp Three and they shot them all.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">01:33:00 Things like that happened very often.</span> <span id="s286">Somebody -- I told you about the -- we were on this trial in Germany and I testified that Frenzelone of the Germans, he shot a dentist for no reason.</span> <span id="s287">We had to see how he put him down and turned around and shot him in his back, in the neck here and he fell down, and I testified for that.</span> <span id="s288">Now that's one of the few cases that I remember things that they did, things like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Can you tell us a little more about Frenzel and the kinds of things he did?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: Well, the -- each German was really an, an individual by himself.</span> <span id="s291">Although they all had -- they came for one purpose, just to treat the Jews there, but each one had reacted to his character.</span> <span id="s292">As I mentioned once, there was one what was there for some whatever reason, but he was not the worst one.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">01:34:00 He could give a Jew another piece of bread; but the other one like Frenzel, he looked for trouble not for him, for the Jews.</span> <span id="s294">He didn't like somebody, he shot them.</span> <span id="s295">He would -- people 2 Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel would -- sometimes you couldn't go to work.</span> <span id="s296">They were in the barrack for a day.</span> <span id="s297">He didn't like you are so long there for a day.</span> <span id="s298">He took them out and took them to Camp Three and they shot all of them, so each individual really was what he was by himself.</span> <span id="s299">It was not a command they had to do that.</span> <span id="s300">Like we had another one, Wagnerwhat was -- that was the worst one of all of them.</span> <span id="s301">The worst thing about him is he was very sharp and very suspicious.</span> <span id="s302">If he has his eye and his intuition and his feeling for so he could smell out something there will be trouble tomorrow, so we were always careful.</span> <span id="s303">When he was around - - we had a name for him, "VaYikru".</span> <span id="s304">Now that means -- we called him "VaYikru," because we didn't want any name, popular name, that you don't recognize it, so we knew when we said -- when he came near to the camp we said "VaYikru," so everybody knew to be alert and out of his way because it always happened with him something.</span> <span id="s305">He always took somebody.</span> <span id="s306">He killed him or he beat him or whatever, so we always were very careful as far as that.</span> <span id="s307">So what I want to point out, the claim that these guards say they had to do the things, are definitely not true.</span> <span id="s308">First of all, a lot of time they asked for volunteers because they didn't want to work they went there, but they were not commanded to particularly shoot this one or do this one.</span> <span id="s309">Their function was to go there and to see that if work functions, that the people go, come from the train, go to the gas chamber and do the things, but each individual showed his character there and when he was one what he wanted to hurt personally something, he did it there; and he didn't have to give any, any account of it, what he is doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">01:36:00 So the Frenzel was really one of the bad ones.</span> <span id="s311">He, he really -- if he could kill people, he did.</span> <span id="s312">we had one, for example, what worked in Lager Three and he used to be a boxer, Gomerski and for him they made a special whip what was heavier and one day he came back from Lager Three and we were on Appell and he came -- this Frenzel was with us -- and he was bragging to Frenzel -- we understood, we speak German -- so he says to him that he just killed a Jew with 12 hits with his whip.</span> <span id="s313">So, so they chose that each character lived out his character there.</span> <span id="s314">It was not that he had to do that; they did it, so the excuse that they had to that is nonsense.</span> <span id="s315">So, there's -- well, also my work was separating clothes when transport came at night.</span> <span id="s316">Sometimes they took people out any time, anybody to do different kind of works.</span> <span id="s317">What they did, they cut the hair of the women.</span> <span id="s318">The women went to the gas chamber after the men and then they stopped, about one or two barracks before the gas chamber was a barrack where they left their luggage and they had to undress; and there was a barrack the next to the gas chamber where they cut at randomly, they cut the hair of the women.</span> <span id="s319">They utilized it.</span> <span id="s320">They send it back to Germany; they did for brushes, for everything.</span> <span id="s321">So we were sometimes picked out at night to cut the hair, and it happens once I happened to be one of this group.</span> <span id="s322">I had to go also to cut the hair.</span> <span id="s323">Now we were about 10 feet from the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s324">There was -- the gas chamber was here and there was like the barrack like I say next to it so and they came.</span> <span id="s325">If the Polish transports were-- the Polish Jews knew more what's going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">They knew they're going to death and also they were more religious and the women came in 3 Oberscharführer Gustav Wagner 4 Oberscharführer Hubert Gomerski and we were young boys, 20, 22, five, and we were standing there.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">01:38:30 They came naked in, and we had to cut their hair.</span> <span id="s328">There was a horrible yelling and screaming for all these, from knowing, from feeling they go to the gas chamber.</span> <span id="s329">On top of that, they're ashamed to put it in.</span> <span id="s330">But with the Dutch transport, was quieter.</span> <span id="s331">They didn't know really -- they didn't realize really that they're going to the camp, to death, so I have I happened to cut somebody's hair and they started to talk to me.</span> <span id="s332">Say, "How, how is it here and what...?"</span> <span id="s333">They still didn't believe already, and the Germans around the small room but a little bigger than that.</span> <span id="s334">So they around so we couldn't, we couldn't talk to them so I didn't say a word.</span> <span id="s335">I couldn't, because they didn't want us we talk to them.</span> <span id="s336">They were afraid we tell them or things like that, so we couldn't say anything, but that was a horrible thing to see these women with children and all ages and things like that.</span> <span id="s337">I mean know -- we knew where would they go.</span> <span id="s338">So as I say hard to, to tell this picture.</span> <span id="s339">They cut randomly the hair, something like they chopped up down here and send away those people, so to the lowest point these people were brought down when they went to the....</span> <span id="s340">It's, it's unbelievable how takes it to tell that.</span> <span id="s341">Whoever didn't see it cannot describe it how that really looks or feeling it.</span> <span id="s342">We were always were sick from it when we came back from that, but as I say that was random.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Sometimes they took us to this kind of work.</span> <span id="s344">And, we had other things.</span> <span id="s345">Like for example we had one times we had, on a Sunday was that and they locked us up in the barracks.</span> <span id="s346">We were not allowed to go out and a train arrived and there came some, some people came in this camp.</span> <span id="s347">And there was full with guards and all the guards were in, all the Germans and everything, and they took them further down where they usually people arrive and they go and take their luggage and we heard a lot of shooting.</span> <span id="s348">So much shooting and shooting, we didn't know what's going on.</span> <span id="s349">The next day they took us to work to separate the clothes, and we're separating the clothes from these people what were shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">01:41:00 They're full with blood -- terrible, and, and while we are separating the clothes we -- I found in a pocket of one of these of one of these trousers -- I found a little note written in Yiddish and it says, "We come from Belzec," what was another camp like that and where the people that did the kind of work that we do; and to liquidate the Belzec, they brought them to Sobibór.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">And the people knew where they go, so they put a resentment, so they shot them.</span> <span id="s352">They just shot them in the train, so all these people, and they say, and the note says, "We are from there, we know where we go.</span> <span id="s353">Take revenge for us."</span> <span id="s354">So that was -- we knew the people or so.</span> <span id="s355">So our hopes for coming out was really no hopes whatever, no hopes whatever.</span> <span id="s356">We knew what the end is.</span> <span id="s357">It's just if the transport are finished, we are finished and we go and we will be shot, all of us.</span> <span id="s358">I don't remember, there's so many de-- so many accidents -- incidents that happened in camp what so horrible I really don't come to fresh in my mind to tell what it is, but stories like that happened almost every other day.</span> <span id="s359">Almost every other day.</span> <span id="s360">It was if we lived through a day -- if we made it through the day, if you make it to the evening you know you lived today.</span> <span id="s361">Otherwise you didn't know what tomorrow is, because tomorrow morning if he didn't like what you looked like, you could be dead.</span> <span id="s362">Constantly like that.</span> <span id="s363">So we lived with this.</span> <span id="s364">It is hard to say how you live a life like that.</span> <span id="s365">You just live with the minute.</span> <span id="s366">You don't make plans.</span> <span id="s367">You don't think far.</span> <span id="s368">You don't -- you concentrate, you just concentrate on the minute, "I want to make the, the first 10 minutes, the next minute, the next minute," and that is the way we really lived because, it's really impossible to explain what it means to live in a situation like that.</span> <span id="s369">And nobody -- if somebody tries to say something about -- it's impossible to say.</span> <span id="s370">Even the one what lived it through couldn't explain really how that was, to live like that.</span> <span id="s371">So -- but -- and there was a group what, was thinking of, of running away.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">01:43:37</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Let's hold it for a minute.</span> <span id="s374">Before we get to the uprising, we -- would you tell me, um, how you met your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: I guess by at work.</span> <span id="s376">By at work.</span> <span id="s377">Because we worked in with separating the clothes and in the evening we came back to barracks.</span> <span id="s378">The men and women lived in the same compartments, or big -- the camp was circled round with barbed wire and woven with branches from the green -- evergreen trees, and -- but there was many barracks was in that.</span> <span id="s379">There was a section where the women slept and we slept in another.</span> <span id="s380">The kitchen was there and the work places were they set, so in the evening when we arrived they gave us to eat something and, and then we have about nine o'clock or eight-thirty depending when it was dark, we had to go and sleep in our barracks, so the few hours between eating and sleeping so we could see each other, walk around in this half of this, court, court round and we could talk with each other; and I, and I met Selma.</span> <span id="s381">She probably knows the details better than I do, but anyway we met and we stayed always together.</span> <span id="s382">So I think that also was really a -- that makes it also easier, subconsciously, easier for us to endure in this camp because we had each other.</span> <span id="s383">We liked each other, and we could, communicate together and we were young, so I think it's a normal reaction to it.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: How did you see -- keep seeing her, given the camp and the way it was set up?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s386">Well, we tried to be as much as we can together.</span> <span id="s387">In other words when we went on Appell, we tried to be together and, when -- after work we were together.</span> <span id="s388">So we worked, we went separating the clothes, if possible, we were together, so we were pretty often and pretty – very -- and very often together as far as the work didn't interfere with -- if the work wasn't the same location, the same thing, we could be together with.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: You had started before to tell us about some of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s390">Can you tell us about Wagner?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Can you tell me the story about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s393">well, Wagner, as I said, was really somebody the most we had to be careful with.</span> <span id="s394">He was the most brutal one and a vicious one.</span> <span id="s395">He was really -- he looked for the occasion to murder somebody, to do some something bad to him.</span> <span id="s396">He was, he was himself and he had the occasion to do things like that, so he very often he sneaked in at night, you know, or in the evening when we are just walking around in this lot, in the place where we lived, just to, to, to sneak out, to suspicious, to see something.</span> <span id="s397">Maybe he's stalking to somebody.</span> <span id="s398">I know he went in once to the barrack, one of -- there was a young fellow, he was a Kapo and he slept, and he went in, in his room, he start to wake him and he wasn't reacting quick enough so he took him out with a -- he killed him.</span> <span id="s399">He killed him because he didn't react rightly on it.</span> <span id="s400">A matter of fact, the uprising later maybe I will tell -- we geared it so -- they went every three months they went on vacation, so we all -- we planned it to have anything -- when we planned the uprising we planned it so that he is not in that time there.</span> <span id="s401">He is on vacation in that time.</span> <span id="s402">Now, while I'm talking about reminds me, the Germans went every, as I say, every three months they went to vacation.</span> <span id="s403">Now when they do that, when they went there, they always prepared them to go on vacation.</span> <span id="s404">What that mean is, they took all the best clothes what they could find, they -- some of the valuables what the people had with them -- that they had the biggest suitcase and they filled up all these things.</span> <span id="s405">They filled it up till they couldn't even carry it, it was so heavy.</span> <span id="s406">And each, each one of them took home these big suitcases and with especially the Dutch people brought really nice things with them, and they took all these things.</span> <span id="s407">They took them home for themselves, so that was really for them a big holiday.</span> <span id="s408">To go home, they took with them valuables what never more could -- they probably in their private life could never afford this kind of things, so, that was really what they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">So, that that really was for them, that was the purpose of being there, so they could steal and take the things.</span> <span id="s410">On top of that what they murdered, that they could steal and take the things with them.</span> <span id="s411">Now Wagner, the end of Wagner was after the war, he ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">01:49:00 He ended up in Argentina and one of the survivors, Szmajzner, what he recently died -- he was in Argentina, too; and when it was Hitler's birthday, they, all these Germans make a coming together and he happens to be there and this Szmajzner, Szmajzner, he, he somehow found out that he saw that -- he went looking for these people.</span> <span id="s413">He saw him there and he recognized him, and he said, "You are Wagner."</span> <span id="s414">He said, "No, no, no."</span> <span id="s415">Anyway, it ended up that they took him to jail, and while he was in jail he hanged himself.</span> <span id="s416">So that was the story with Wagner.</span> <span id="s417">But while being in a camp, we were really -- if we were afraid to the most it was for him.</span> <span id="s418">So really that was really a beast.</span> <span id="s419">He, he was so vicious.</span> <span id="s420">He was looking already that he can murder somebody, kill somebody.</span> <span id="s421">I never saw a person like that.</span> <span id="s422">Some of them still had sometimes, human feelings, you know.</span> <span id="s423">You could caught them, and catch them in a lighter moment, but this one was really just vicious.</span> <span id="s424">You couldn't afford even to look in his face.</span> <span id="s425">He didn't like you look at him and things like that, so there were -- before me were there even also were others what I didn't -- StanglI think, but I, I didn't -- I was not in the time when Stangl was.</span> <span id="s426">I don't know anything.</span> <span id="s427">I only from I heard from the others telling -- he had a dog and he martyred people with the dog and things like that.</span> <span id="s428">Now I, I was not my time.</span> <span id="s429">I came in, in – no – yeah, I came I think in September 1942.</span> <span id="s430">So I was 11 months I was in camp because the uprising was in October, so that was not my time.</span> <span id="s431">there was transport</span></p> <p><span id="s432">5 Stanislaw Szmajzner 6 SS-Hauptsturmführer Franz Stangl came really -- sometimes they came -- I remember just talking about -- I remember there came a transport.</span> <span id="s433">There was a big transport and there was a lot of people, half-dead, dead, no clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">01:51:30 Terrible, I never saw something like that.</span> <span id="s435">It's just unbelievable -- half-skeletons.</span> <span id="s436">The people looked just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s437">They must have had a big trip, no food, muddled up before that, so they want to get it over as quick as possible, so we had these trolleys, like the wagons what you have in the coal mines, what you swing back and forth, you might have seen them.</span> <span id="s438">So they said all the bodies we had to throw on, on this to take it to the Camp Three.</span> <span id="s439">And there were half-live people.</span> <span id="s440">We just had to throw them together with the, with the live people -- with the dead people together, so I see an old lady, a gentle face and things like that and it was on top of all these bodies.</span> <span id="s441">She couldn't hardly talk, and they all went just like that.</span> <span id="s442">Put half-life on, whatever lived still, on the fire there.</span> <span id="s443">So things like that really -- I couldn't -- I, I couldn't bring up everything.</span> <span id="s444">It was so many of them I couldn't really remember everyone of them.</span> <span id="s445">It was horrible, horrible.</span> <span id="s446">I just don't have words for it.</span> <span id="s447">You cannot, you cannot, you cannot tell a story like that.</span> <span id="s448">You can tell a story, the words have not the same meaning to the listener that it has to me, because I saw it and I see the picture before me.</span> <span id="s449">And it's different telling a story -- no matter how good words you find for it, it still cannot give you the right picture what it is.</span> <span id="s450">So that is to say the most horrible thing imaginable, that what it was.</span> <span id="s451">If you, you cannot imagine, but, but if you could have a horrible picture of the worst of a picture, the picture, even if I were to tell it, because so bad was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">01:53:30</span></p> <p><span id="s453">Q: What kind of food and living conditions did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s454">A: Well, as I said, we all got -- the food was -- you had in the -- we got -- well in the morning we got our slice of bread, a heavy slice of bread, black bread and black water.</span> <span id="s455">It was not to drink but that's all you get, and in the evenings we had a soup.</span> <span id="s456">As I said, we called it the straw soup.</span> <span id="s457">It was from corn, I don't know exactly the name of it, it's with the peels, the corn with the peels, so you couldn't really swallow that and we called that the "spit soup."</span> <span id="s458">Now some people couldn't eat it and they just didn't eat and die.</span> <span id="s459">They couldn't eat it.</span> <span id="s460">Especially the Dutch people, what were used to a little bit better life, so they couldn't, and if you had to live on that you couldn't make it long.</span> <span id="s461">You couldn't make it long, and they -- a lot of people didn't.</span> <span id="s462">But we were the ones who were next to the food and we stole it.</span> <span id="s463">That's the reason we had more people.</span> <span id="s464">It was illegal, dangerous.</span> <span id="s465">They would have shot you if they catch you, but we nevertheless we did it, so the -- as far as food concerns, that was really the situation, but if you think about how they fed you -- forget about it.</span> <span id="s466">You couldn't make it at all.</span> <span id="s467">You couldn't make it.</span> <span id="s468">And, clothes -- as I said, we came with different clothes and we just changed.</span> <span id="s469">If, if it was ripped or whatever, we changed to another clothes.</span> <span id="s470">Just that what kind of thing, but they didn't supply you anything.</span> <span id="s471">They gave you -- they treated you like a commodity, not like a, a human being, not at all.</span> <span id="s472">You were not a human being.</span> <span id="s473">You just had to listen the order what you got and to do it, just like the robot.</span> <span id="s474">You had to do things what you are told and if you didn't do it right, they did away with you.</span> <span id="s475">No fooling around.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">01:55:30 And then was, a punishment for whatever reason, the whole evening instead after eating we could go and be in the barracks.</span> <span id="s477">They didn't bring you to eat and they take you around, running around, put down -- as a punishment; they let you ran, ran, and ran, fell down and get up, fell down and get up for hour, two hours, till you got so exhausted and tired, some people died on the place.</span> <span id="s478">They couldn't make it, and some, the younger ones, they, they did it, so there was a punishment.</span> <span id="s479">Things like that happen.</span> <span id="s480">As I say, they tried to martyr you.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">They tried to take away any thinking of you, that you don't -- you're not on a human being, you're not functioning as a human being.</span> <span id="s482">Just you have to be a robot and to kill you, any thinking, any initiative, anything -- just to do what you're told and to keep you as long as they need you.</span> <span id="s483">So we really were not human beings in their thinking and their functioning and in regard to us, so they didn't come for that.</span> <span id="s484">So they exploit us as much as they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: At this point I want to stop and pause and we're going to change tapes.</span> <span id="s486">01:56:40</span></p> <p><span id="s487">[Technical Conversation] End of Tape 1</span></p> <p><span id="s488">TAPE #2</span></p> <p><span id="s489">02:00:00</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: OK.</span> <span id="s491">We're on.</span> <span id="s492">Let's pick up now.</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: Well, we were always knowing what's going on.</span> <span id="s494">We were talking about an uprising.</span> <span id="s495">In other words, we talking about running away somehow, organized.</span> <span id="s496">There was a small group.</span> <span id="s497">I was not involved in this group.</span> <span id="s498">And there was a lot of talking about how to run away.</span> <span id="s499">Now there were many plans how to do it.</span> <span id="s500">It was not an easy task.</span> <span id="s501">There were always mines around, guards around, and there were about a 150, 200 Ukrainian guards in the camp on top of the Germans, so that was really a very difficult task to find somehow a way to get out.</span> <span id="s502">And -- till one day came a transport of Jewish Russian prisoners of war from Minsk.</span> <span id="s503">That was about -- on -- not far from the Russian border where the Germans caught them, the prisoners of war, so they took out the Jewish prisoners of war and send them to Sobibór.</span> <span id="s504">From this group they picked out around 30 people to work in the camp and these people when they came in and they heard what's going on.</span> <span id="s505">They're all soldiers so, and a different spirit, said they want to run away the first day.</span> <span id="s506">So we tried to explain to them that it is not so easy.</span> <span id="s507">“Where do you run?</span> <span id="s508">You don't have the cooperation from the people outside even if you make it already outside, and, it's not so easy.”</span> <span id="s509">And we told them also that we have our own plans and we wanted to do the same thing.</span> <span id="s510">Maybe we can talk together and come up with a common things, and we all can do the same thing together, what made sense, and they agreed on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s511">And after many secretive meetings in the evening, we, after work, we came together and we talk with them and we talked on different plans, different possibilities, so -- till one day we came upon a plan that we make an uprising on this way.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">02:03:00 We worked till it was the time of October, what about five o'clock they brought us back already to the living quarters because they want us always bring back before dark, so we decided at four o'clock we start to make an uprising in this way.</span> <span id="s513">In each group what worked like we, for example, with separating the clothes; we had two three Germans what were supervision over us.</span> <span id="s514">They supervised us and each group what worked in different ways had two or three Germans what they were there to watch them, how they work.</span> <span id="s515">So we decided in each group to assign two people and these people with some pretext, they will have to get them to a warehouse or somewhere and quietly kill them with a knife or an axe or whatever and just do it like nothing happened and in, in the meantime also to cut the, the wires and as I said, as I said before, we tried to gear to do it in the time when Wagner was on vacation; so that was really not safe, but safer.</span> <span id="s516">And that was -- and so as I say, we was assigned people in each group to do this kind of work.</span> <span id="s517">Now there were in the barracks where we lived, there was a goldsmith, a tailor, a shoemaker and that they made for them clothes, shoes, these people there; so they made, they had to come to fit, so they told them, "In this day I will have the fit for you.</span> <span id="s518">Come then, and I will have the fit for you your shoes or your clothes."</span></p> <p><span id="s519">02:05:00 And when they came there they were already people with this axe of knives.</span> <span id="s520">They were hiding behind a, a curtain or something, and they killed them on the spot.</span> <span id="s521">When they came in to fit, they overwhelmed them and they killed them, and shoved them in under the, under somewhere that nobody sees, and, and the work went through like nothing happened.</span> <span id="s522">And so I was not assigned to anything because, you see, I went with Selma and Selma didn't speak Polish and the whole plan was very secretive.</span> <span id="s523">Although it was planned for all of people in the camp, because everybody could run away, but not many people were told were about -- be afraid it might come out, leak out and then we all gone, so whoever was, didn't speak the language, didn't know somebody, so it was secretive.</span> <span id="s524">So I had my friends there and I knew everything that's going on; but I was not assigned to anything because of that, because I was with, with Selma, because she didn't speak Polish.</span> <span id="s525">So where I worked there, there were some people assigned to kill by the clothes where I worked, the separating the clothes.</span> <span id="s526">And then there were two people what assigned to go to kill somebody in the office, a German in the office, and the last minute one of them got scared and he didn't want to go.</span> <span id="s527">And I was there and I heard the story and I knew already that there's 10 to 12 Germans were already killed, so I know -- the ordeal I know already.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">02:07:00 We are already -- unless we get out, otherwise we are dead.</span> <span id="s529">So, Selma brought me a knife with a point, knife.</span> <span id="s530">I said I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s531">You see, from all these people what people brought from the transport, utensils and all the things, there were a warehouse for it, and we're not far from this warehouse, so she went there in and she picked a knife, a pointed knife.</span> <span id="s532">She gave me a knife, and I went with the other fellow.</span> <span id="s533">I don't think I was a big hero or a big, courageous man, but I figured it's self-defense and survival.</span> <span id="s534">If I don't do it, it might spoil the whole thing.</span> <span id="s535">So I, I instinctively -- is not decision.</span> <span id="s536">It's not a decision.</span> <span id="s537">You just react, instinctively you react to that, and I figured, "Let us to do, and go and do it."</span> <span id="s538">And I went.</span> <span id="s539">I went with the man in the office, and we killed this German.</span> <span id="s540">With every jab, I said, "That is for my father, for my mother, for all these people, all the Jews you killed;" and I -- my knife slipped out, slid out from my hand and I cut myself and I was full with blood and when he was dead we ran out of the office and we were lucky.</span> <span id="s541">Just came a big truck came with Germans on it, but I somehow -- there was -- the, the idea was when at this comes five o'clock that we all go back to from work to the living quarters like nothing happened, and that was just in that time and Selma went with this group and she saw me and she took a, a nap-- napkin or whatever she had with them, she tied me up there, wiped off the blood from me and I went with this group till the main quarters where we where we came in and all the groups in all the places came in, because it was five o'clock.</span> <span id="s542">Then we all start to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Everybody ran in different directions.</span> <span id="s544">I tell it so quick, but, it, it was more tension because it was a whole hour was going on, so we were very tense.</span> <span id="s545">We knew there were already Germans killed.</span> <span id="s546">We knew already it's going on, so we just hoped that nobody unexpectedly comes a place where he doesn't supposed to come and finds out what happened.</span> <span id="s547">If that is, then we all killed and lost, so somehow we are lucky with that.</span> <span id="s548">We killed these Germans wherever we worked and everything went accordingly to the plan, till we came to the main gate.</span> <span id="s549">Now we could -- people ran, ran all over, so the whole camp knew already what's going on by then, so some ran on the mines, got killed.</span> <span id="s550">Some people didn't ran at all.</span> <span id="s551">They gave up.</span> <span id="s552">They didn't want to run.</span> <span id="s553">They just gave up.</span> <span id="s554">They, they just waited till they get killed.</span> <span id="s555">But the younger people, most of them, and whoever was courageous enough to run, they ran away and then a lot ran on the main gate.</span> <span id="s556">Now we started to run and we were next to a barrack and then I saw Frenzel with a machine gun, and he started to shoot and more people were running and I, I wanted to hold back because afraid for the machine gun, and I figured, "Here is dead.</span> <span id="s557">Here is maybe something."</span> <span id="s558">So I pulled Selma's hand and we ran through and somehow, some fell and we made it through the through the gate.</span> <span id="s559">So we were lucky we came through.</span> <span id="s560">So that is really, I think some luck was with us.</span> <span id="s561">So we came through that and then we ended up -- it started to be dark, and Sobibór was in the woods, so when we came out from the camp we ended up in the woods, and it was rainy and it was wet and she had some boots on and somehow the boots didn't right, so she pulled it off and she couldn't get it on, so she ran with one boot, half on the foot and on the, on the heel like that, you know, she ran.</span> <span id="s562">We ran the whole night and we didn't know where we ran; and till it started to get light, dawn.</span> <span id="s563">And what I forgot to tell you is when we knew when we go away, we took money from the people.</span> <span id="s564">The money what we should have given to the Germans or sabotage, we took with us some because we figured if we go out, we probably will need it if we have any chance to survive.</span> <span id="s565">So we took some with us, so when we came -- we figured -- the first night we came next to a village and we saw a house and I figured, "Let me go and ask if they can keep us over the day," because they were searching there all over.</span> <span id="s566">So, and I told them I -- whatever the figure was -- I had dollars, gold, things like that, so I told them I would give them so much money.</span> <span id="s567">He probably never heard so much money what I gave him, so he agreed to hold us over the day.</span> <span id="s568">They took us in.</span> <span id="s569">And it happened we were six miles from the camp.</span> <span id="s570">And later we heard that in the same village they were searching the whole day.</span> <span id="s571">They found a lot of people.</span> <span id="s572">I don't know if all of them -- they found of them and took them back to camp and shot them.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">02:12:35 And it happened we were lucky, they didn't, didn't find us.</span> <span id="s574">So, and then we, we, we ran, we - - no -- when it got dark, we left this farmer and he told us a little direction.</span> <span id="s575">Now I was thinking because I didn't know where to go, what to go, so I was thinking I worked at the farmer before I went to Sobibór, I figured, "Let me try.</span> <span id="s576">Maybe, you never know, maybe -- he was a nice person as I said, he was a nice person.</span> <span id="s577">Maybe he might do something."</span> <span id="s578">Now I didn't know direction.</span> <span id="s579">We couldn't go on the roads.</span> <span id="s580">We went in the field always, because we are afraid they will catch us and not to be found, so we went in the woods.</span> <span id="s581">We didn't -- what we looked is on the, on the Big Wagenon Der NipperNipper.</span> <span id="s582">I don't know I went the right direction.</span> <span id="s583">Anyway, that was our guide to where to go where to go, so we ended up at 7 wagon (German); “Der Große Wagen” or “The Big Wagon” is a colloquial German term for the constellation Ursula Major.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">8 the sipper (German) night, we walked in dark, and during the day we tried to hide.</span> <span id="s585">Either, we tried to go into a farmer in the morning, very early in the morning, give him money; or sometimes we were not so lucky so we were hiding in sometimes in the woods during the day or on an open field or we went in a hoykh bargor something.</span> <span id="s586">And one day we couldn't find a farmer, we couldn't find anybody, and we ended up on a top of a high bargand it happened during the day some children came there to play and there was a sport to go on this and they found us, and they started right, "Jews, Jews, Jews."</span> <span id="s587">I said, "Selma, let's quick run away," and we ran away.</span> <span id="s588">They couldn't find anyone, so we ran away.</span> <span id="s589">I don't know, we got out and while we were running there were two wagons haul-- wooden wagons with farmers.</span> <span id="s590">They didn't know that I speak Polish, and he said, "Come, we will take you.</span> <span id="s591">Come, we'll take you."</span> <span id="s592">And I was on one wagon and Selma was on the other one, and I hear in Polish they say, "Let them take it -- we will, we will do something for them," whatever -- not, not good, so I screamed to Selma, "Jump!</span> <span id="s593">Jump!"</span> <span id="s594">And I jumped and she jumped, and I let them go and we went away, so we ran away.</span></p> <p><span id="s595">02:15:00 So for about two weeks we ran, sometimes coming to a farmer, sometimes not, but every time when we were at a farmer, we tried to tell them that we have some money.</span> <span id="s596">We want to give them this money, and if he wants to keep us over the war.</span> <span id="s597">It was already in the end of '43 and, the Russians moved back and forth, so, so maybe they figured that maybe it wouldn't take so long and they might willing to do it, till one day we came to a farmer and we asked him that.</span> <span id="s598">And he said, "Listen.</span> <span id="s599">I am too near to my neighbors and I am not able to do it for you, but I have a brother of mine what lives about 10 miles away or 10 kilometers away.</span> <span id="s600">Let me bring you there to him and maybe -- he lives a little isolated.</span> <span id="s601">He might be willing to do it."</span> <span id="s602">And that what he did.</span> <span id="s603">So he put Selma, dressed up some as an old lady, and me he put on a wagon, the long wagons what they had, covered me with branches and he drove on the road.</span> <span id="s604">Now I don't think he realized the danger of what he imposed on himself.</span> <span id="s605">If they caught us, if the Germans on the road caught us, we all had been dead and all his family dead.</span> <span id="s606">Of course, really very dangerous.</span> <span id="s607">I assume he didn't realize what he is doing, because that was so dangerous and they were all over, the Germans.</span> <span id="s608">And especially they were look-- we were not too far from the camp anyway, so they were looking for everything.</span> <span id="s609">So anyway we were lucky.</span> <span id="s610">He brought us to his brother, and his brother said, "Yes, I can keep you."</span> <span id="s611">So there we end up -- we gave him what we had.</span> <span id="s612">Don't ask me what it was, was -- gold pieces, diamonds, things like that, I don't know.</span> <span id="s613">Anyway, we gave him all these things and he decided to keep us, and he put us on top of the cows on the straw -- made a -- more straw put on and, and then, a bucket for your toilet and once a day he brought us some food, and he kept us there for -- that was in October -- he kept us till June 1944.</span> <span id="s614">That was, when the Russians came, till the Bug, till, till the Weichsel.</span> <span id="s615">The war was -- the Russian came already in '44 till the Weichsel -- there was six months no fi-- no fighting in this side.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s617">What was it like?</span> <span id="s618">You said he kept you.</span> <span id="s619">Describe where he kept you and how 9 high mountain (Yiddish)</span></p> <p><span id="s620">10 mountain(Yiddish) you were given and all of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s621">02:18:00</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Well, as I say, we were where the cows were downstairs it was full with flies on the top and we could never get straight.</span> <span id="s623">Once in a while he took us down for -- to wash ourselves, and the food -- we had once a day food.</span> <span id="s624">It was not enough but at least we could live.</span> <span id="s625">Selma had sca-- scab-- the right word, is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: Scabies?</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Scabies.</span> <span id="s628">She had scabies, and we knew with -- we knew….</span> <span id="s629">What is the material you use on matches?</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Sulfur.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: Sulfur.</span> <span id="s632">Sulfur.</span> <span id="s633">And with that you could get rid of it, so we didn't have any money more.</span> <span id="s634">I remember I had a gold-filled, a gold, pen, a fountain pen, and I gave him.</span> <span id="s635">I said, "Why don't you sell that and buy us this sulfur," so -- and then he had to drive to the city because in the village they had nothing.</span> <span id="s636">So I think that what he did once, but it was not enough.</span> <span id="s637">So we ended up she had sulfur all the time.</span> <span id="s638">So, she -- we lived with that.</span> <span id="s639">I had it too, so we had it both.</span> <span id="s640">We had to -- so I was not so, contagious to it.</span> <span id="s641">I didn't have it so bad, but she had it very bad.</span> <span id="s642">They, they treated us well.</span> <span id="s643">This how you want to think about: we were lucky and happy that they kept us alive and they gave us whatever food they gave us; and also no matter what condition, because we knew, we knew somehow a friend of ours what also was asking a farmer to keep him, and he said, "Keep me."</span> <span id="s644">And at night he came with the hay fork and killed him and took all the money from him, so knowing all this kind of things, we were, we thought--</span></p> <p><span id="s645">[Beeping noise]</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s647">Can we stop the tape please?</span> <span id="s648">02:20:00</span></p> <p><span id="s649">[Technical conversation]</span></p> <p><span id="s650">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s651">We're back on tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: So, knowing that, that what can happen, so we really felt very lucky that we find people that they kept us, no matter what conditions.</span> <span id="s653">So that's the way always we look at it, because they saved our life.</span> <span id="s654">Now, when the Russian -- no.</span> <span id="s655">A few days before the Russian came, somehow a family child came from-- eight years, 10 years or whatever years old--he came to this uncle.</span> <span id="s656">That was his uncle, and he came to, to the barn.</span> <span id="s657">Now a bird happens to fly up there where we were, and he climbed up and he saw us, and he was....</span> <span id="s658">That was a secret for the family, because nobody knew what's going -- they had young children, one or two, so nobody knew and when they saw that so that was really dangerous.</span> <span id="s659">We had to do something.</span> <span id="s660">But two days later the Russian came, so we came down.</span> <span id="s661">We came down and the Russians, saw -- we saw the Russians.</span> <span id="s662">We all -- before we heard already the Germans leaving and the shooting of the big guns came nearer and nearer till the Ger-- Russian came, so then we were safe.</span> <span id="s663">So when we came out from there, so he brought us to Chelm, what is about 10 kilometers from where we were hidden.</span> <span id="s664">And then we found more Jews there and so, you know, there was from all different places came different Jews were hidden or whatever, or were with the partisans.</span> <span id="s665">Somehow, I don't know what happened exactly in that time but, after a short time we moved away.</span> <span id="s666">We went away, whatever.</span> <span id="s667">And, and then we ended up in a small place in Parczew, the name of the place.</span> <span id="s668">Now, Selma was pregnant at that time and when we came out, she went, she had a child in Parczew, in a hospital, and then we move already with the child.</span> <span id="s669">And in Parczew what I started to do to make a living is where the Germans left, was there to buy things to bring to the area where we lived, because there was -- where we lived was nothing, and where the Germans were there was more, so I tried to hitchhike and travel some and bring home different things.</span> <span id="s670">It tooks me one time a week or two weeks till I came to a certain place and I bought things and I brought it back and I sold it, so that's the way we make our living, right.</span> <span id="s671">When I sold the things, I went for a new trip.</span> <span id="s672">But Selma was always alone, not speaking the language, with a child.</span> <span id="s673">So there was her friend, what she mentioned before, her friend -- there was also a Dutch girl, this, Ula Stern, and she was a good friend for her before.</span> <span id="s674">So I decided that she come -- she came from the partisans and she had a hard time and she couldn't go by herself, so I said, "Why don't she come and live with us," so Selma has company and not alone for all the time I am away.</span> <span id="s675">And that is the way we kept her for a time.</span> <span id="s676">She was with us, and I was traveling back and forth.</span> <span id="s677">till one day they say they go to kill all the Jews at night in Parczew.</span> <span id="s678">The partisans go to kill all the Jews.</span> <span id="s679">So, I said to Selma, "Now we go."</span> <span id="s680">We tooks, took some -- I had some freight, a truck or something like that, somehow; somebody took us to Lublin.</span> <span id="s681">And we went to Lublin to some Jews what was other survivor from Sobibór, and he was one of the two what ran away in camp when they outside, what I told you, they had the two Ukrainian guards.</span> <span id="s682">They killed one and they ran away.</span> <span id="s683">He was one of the two what survived, so he had there -- he was already longer there.</span> <span id="s684">He was -- some business did, whatever, and he took in Jews and they took us also in.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: What was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: PodchlebnikPodchlebnik.</span> <span id="s687">He died in the meantime.</span> <span id="s688">He, he lived in Vineland not far from, Esther.</span> <span id="s689">He died a few years ago, some years ago.</span> <span id="s690">So anyway, and so we were with him for a little time and I did the same thing.</span> <span id="s691">I bought whatever I could and sell that we could make a living.</span> <span id="s692">till one day, one day we heard there was also in Lublin -- it was a bigger place -- there was also a lot of Dutch prisoners of war what were freed by the Germans, so there was some more Dutch people in Lublin and somehow, either through the Red Cross or</span></p> <p><span id="s693">11 Shlomo Podchlebnik whatever, they organized into bring them back to Holland, bring them back from the Russian -- I don't know from where, but it went out.</span> <span id="s694">So they start to concentrate all these Dutch people together.</span> <span id="s695">Now Selma was Dutch, but I was not Dutch and I didn't speak the language, so it was a little of problem, so I tried to talk as much -- as little as I talk I talked less, and so I didn't talk at all.</span> <span id="s696">I tried to be like I'm also Dutch but I don't talk too much and we happened to have -- Selma got acquainted -- there was a Dutch officer what he happened to be a nice man and she told him about me, so he tried to help us.</span> <span id="s697">He helped me that I don't have to come and to tell things like that, so and I went through as a Dutch person.</span> <span id="s698">I went through as a Dutch person, not much exposed you know.</span> <span id="s699">That was always my policy.</span> <span id="s700">Keep away as much as possible.</span> <span id="s701">In camp, too.</span> <span id="s702">If I could avoid seeing or talking to any of the Germans, things like that, I was always on the side.</span> <span id="s703">I tried to be not around 'less I had no choice, so I figured the less that I am exposed, the, the less chances I have to be hurt, so here the same thing.</span> <span id="s704">I kept like as much as I could I avoid everything.</span> <span id="s705">I just went, went with the masses.</span></p> <p><span id="s706">02:27:00 Now I'm not -- to don't know me.</span> <span id="s707">And that probably helped, and then they took us, because the war was still going on, to the other side of the Weichsel.</span> <span id="s708">In other words from Poland Weichsel till that was still a front, so they brought us through Russia, through Odessa, the Black Sea, if you can picture it, through Odessa, the Black Sea to the Mediterranean to Marseille, to France.</span> <span id="s709">But to come so far they took us -- we had to go with -- they brought us to Odessa with a freight train.</span> <span id="s710">there was -- the train was split in half, with -- they maked a ceiling of, a division, so half that more people can go -- there was an up and down in the freight trains, you know, a freight train.</span> <span id="s711">They make a division that people lived downstairs upstairs and slowly the train went.</span> <span id="s712">For three months we make it till Odessa.</span> <span id="s713">They must have given us some food because we got some food from them and, sometimes the train stopped so we could go, to facilities or washing something quick because we had the baby and so -- but, we made it till Odessa and then they kept us in Odessa till our boat was ready.</span> <span id="s714">They kept us there.</span> <span id="s715">What we got I think from the Red Cross, we got some packages.</span> <span id="s716">The Red Cross supplied some packages and so that was in Odessa, and then came, one day came the boat.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">The boat supposed us to take to Holland.</span> <span id="s718">Now there was really a strict control on that, because I came on the boat.</span> <span id="s719">And there was one girl, she said she is Dutch; they found out she is not Dutch, so the whole boat left and this one girl -- still seeing stand there -- she couldn't go with.</span> <span id="s720">So we were on the boat and crossed my fingers that everything, already we go.</span> <span id="s721">And on the sea the child -- probably Selma told the story -- the child got sick from food poisoning.</span> <span id="s722">They gave it -- this, this was the powdered milk or whatever, was too strong or whatever, and then the stomach and there was no medication, nothing.</span> <span id="s723">So the child died on the boat and it was in the sea during -- the Aegean Sea, next to Nexon-- Náxos Island, was the child was buried there in the sea, and we arrived later in Odessa.</span> <span id="s724">And, in Odessa they kept us for a day or two till we arrived in Holland.</span> <span id="s725">Now the part of Holland, probably Selma told more pri-- more about than I, so that's basically the way we ended up in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: How long did you stay in Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">02:30:00</span></p> <p><span id="s728">A: Now, in Holland I stayed till -- we arrived in '45 and, we left '51.</span> <span id="s729">About six and a half year.</span> <span id="s730">Q: And you came to the United States then?</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: No.</span> <span id="s732">No, no.</span> <span id="s733">We came -- Selma didn't like Holland and also it was for me hard.</span> <span id="s734">In Holland, if you wanted to start a business, you have to have some special permit and you cannot just start a business like here: you go out, you open four walls and put in merchandise, you have a business.</span> <span id="s735">So it was a hard time for me.</span> <span id="s736">Now I had also from Selma's family was a permit like that what I could get and I got and I got apartment and we started in the textile business, and we didn't begin -- we did very well, and later my partner just, cheated me out and I, we lost all the money and I had -- I couldn't start another business so I was decided to go away.</span> <span id="s737">So Selma always wanted to go to Israel and I liked to go America; so to America was a Polish quota and it was very hard and -- but to Israel we could go easier, so I decided, "Let's go to Israel."</span> <span id="s738">So we sold everything we had and we -- in the meantime we bought, built a new house and we had, a whole and everything and in the house, so we sold that everything, and we went to Israel in, like a kibbutz, Moshav Shittufi, what we lived on our own but we worked together.</span> <span id="s739">But I was not I think made for this kind of life.</span> <span id="s740">I, I, I couldn't -- from the first day on I said to Selma, "How do we go back?"</span></p> <p><span id="s741">02:32:00 I, I couldn't have it.</span> <span id="s742">I was in the age about 40– what was I?</span> <span id="s743">Forty-two?</span> <span id="s744">Forty-four?</span> <span id="s745">And I had to go every so often to the military for, to the army for six weeks and I had enough with the camp, with all the kind of things, and I didn't feel like that, so from the first day on my mind starts to work how to get away from it, how to go America.</span> <span id="s746">And, I worked -- I couldn't be in this Moshav Shittufi.</span> <span id="s747">I couldn't live there.</span> <span id="s748">I was really mentally sick.</span> <span id="s749">I went -- I worked specially two weeks together that I can have two days to go away for the weekend.</span> <span id="s750">We got a free day, so I went to an uncle's of her in the Carmel for the two days to look for something else, so when I came there and Selma told him that I am sick there, she couldn't believe it, because I came there.</span> <span id="s751">I was in another world.</span> <span id="s752">I didn't have this problem, so I really -- my mind went already to come out, at least from that, because that was a dead-end for me.</span> <span id="s753">I knew where I'll be buried.</span> <span id="s754">I knew, what tomorrow will lead me.</span> <span id="s755">You know, you live in Moshav Shittufi, is taking care of you, everything.</span> <span id="s756">They know what you eat today and what you get tomorrow and where you'll be buried and if you are sick, instead.</span> <span id="s757">They know everything about you and I couldn't live this life.</span> <span id="s758">It was -- I had -- and all my private initiative went and I just couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s759">I couldn't stand it.</span> <span id="s760">So I ended up, I ended up -- we brought with us a lot of things where we came from Holland.</span> <span id="s761">We brought with us Frigidaire, what was in that time was in very scarce in Israel, and 'frigerator, a washing machine and all the things; so we had something we could sell what had a value.</span> <span id="s762">So I decided we'd go.</span> <span id="s763">We ended up in a place where Dutch families lived there and the people said, "Oh, why don't you come here.</span> <span id="s764">You find a some job and you do something," and things like that, so I went out for it and I looked and I found someplace in Netanya.</span> <span id="s765">I, I started to be -- I, I said, "What can I do?"</span> <span id="s766">I have no special trade and I don't money to start a business, so I ended up I wanted to go as a waiter, I work as a waiter.</span> <span id="s767">I worked there for two months, the summer season or things like that; and in the meantime we moved to Beth Yitzhak, next to these people and it happened in the same Beth Yitzhak was there a woman what had a vegetable store.</span> <span id="s768">And, and these Dutch people we met, he said, "You know, you should buy this store," he said.</span> <span id="s769">"It's really a -- you, you will make money.</span> <span id="s770">If you don't have enough I will give you some money and you borrow some money and start this business," and what I did.</span> <span id="s771">And I took this -- I said first, "How can you have, in a village where everybody grows everything, how can you sell vegetables?"</span> <span id="s772">Anyway, it worked out good and I opened in two villages, two more business; what I went one or twice I went there, and we made a good living and made good money with it, and, so I got a little money and I start to think how do I come to the United States 'cause I didn't want to stay there.</span> <span id="s773">So through different -- talking with people, things like that, I could find out that there's a way of doing it.</span> <span id="s774">I was very desperate.</span> <span id="s775">I wanted to do anything just to go, till I came one day and through the uncle I got an affidavit here in America and, and so I went it up and we went, we went in '57, we went, we came to the United States.</span> <span id="s776">we went by boat.</span> <span id="s777">I don't know what the reason, had with me two children.</span> <span id="s778">and we were through the way we stopped in Italy because the boat, that's the way the schedule went and then we came here.</span> <span id="s779">Now, our plan was to go -- Selma had a brother in Canada, and we thought we can go to Canada just being a little while with him, and then we start whatever starting and we can go to the States.</span> <span id="s780">Well, we couldn't do that because if you have a permit to come here, you have to come here first, so were in a dilemma.</span> <span id="s781">We didn't know what to do, so it happens in Westport, excuse me, in Westport was a family what came from the same place where we were living, came to a sister of hers in Westport, and so we had written to them that, so they said, "No problem.</span> <span id="s782">Come to us."</span> <span id="s783">So we came to these people.</span> <span id="s784">They live in a small house.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">One, two children.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">02:37:00 Two bedrooms and they said, "Come, just live with us," so we went there for a week and we rented a house and he worked at Gristede's, as like a clerk at Gristede's, so he got me a job there for taking orders on the phone.</span> <span id="s787">I didn't understand the language.</span> <span id="s788">I didn't know even what the material what they told me.</span> <span id="s789">Anyway I hold out there for five weeks, for five months, hold out.</span> <span id="s790">As I said, we had a little money with us, and, saved a little bit.</span> <span id="s791">With the little bit I made I saved and we bought something else and we started to do our own business.</span> <span id="s792">And we built it up and we ended up having another business and then, we ended up having a jewelry store.</span> <span id="s793">That is, briefly told, my story.</span> <span id="s794">So--</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">A: Well, we always say when I talk to the children in the high school, we always tell them that they should be always alert when something happen.</span> <span id="s797">You shouldn't minimize if you see something like you see the Ku Klux Klan or the skin-heads or the others.</span> <span id="s798">You said, "Ah," you minimize it.</span> <span id="s799">They said, "What is -- it's nothing.</span> <span id="s800">Forget about them."</span> <span id="s801">Don't minimize it, because Hitler also started very small.</span> <span id="s802">You never know how it can grew, whether I believed that here is it not the same situation, that is too many minorities here to be able to have something like that, but it is not an impossibility, so I think we always can think about it is possible.</span> <span id="s803">Don't minimize it.</span> <span id="s804">If you see something, react to it.</span> <span id="s805">Don't say it is nothing.</span> <span id="s806">It is nothing in the moment, so that's the reason if you get a reminder or if you get to the B'nai Brith or everything, they warn you, they tell you.</span> <span id="s807">You think, "Ah, they always come up with the new story."</span> <span id="s808">It is very important because we cannot prevent it.</span> <span id="s809">Eventually it might happen again.</span> <span id="s810">I hope not in our generation, not our children's generation.</span> <span id="s811">We were scapegoat all the years, and we have to be very alert.</span> <span id="s812">We still, we still went through the whole story so we know more about.</span> <span id="s813">Surely our children will know less about, so, so we still -- the survivors or the people what generation what went through or were part of it, should really understand that don't, you don't minimize things like that.</span> <span id="s814">They can grow.</span> <span id="s815">From a small seeds can grow a big tree.</span> <span id="s816">I think that is what I wanted to add, unless you have questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Chaim, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s818">A: You're welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s819">Q: That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">02:40:00</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Conclusion of interview</span></p></body></html>
