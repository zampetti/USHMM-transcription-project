I hum Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s57">I know that.</span> <span id="s58">My kids are not Jewish in that sense and it doesn’t bother me at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: Why are they like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s60">ST: Because I wasn’t observing Jewish things at all when they were growing up.</span> <span id="s61">They also didn’t have that close a relationship with my parents.</span> <span id="s62">I care that my children identify themselves as Jewish but it doesn’t matter to me if they marry non-Jews.</span> <span id="s63">My wife, Laura, doesn’t go unless I drag her there.</span> <span id="s64">She’s a German Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">WH: What were your first impressions of America?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">ST: I remember staying in the Uptown Hotel in San Francisco for a few days.</span> <span id="s67">I think it was on Sutter Ave. People from the Joint came to greet me there.</span> <span id="s68">I remember gorging myself on grapes.</span> <span id="s69">They were so cheap and I would buy two or three pounds of them and take them to my room and eat them.</span> <span id="s70">The hotel was seven stories high, perhaps, with one elevator.</span> <span id="s71">I remember being amazed by the multiplicity of newspapers.</span> <span id="s72">I was buying several copies of the same paper in different editions before I realized it.</span> <span id="s73">In Shanghai we were starved for news.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">WH: How many days did the journey take?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">ST: Fourteen days.</span> <span id="s76">There were about 100 people in the room.</span> <span id="s77">They took the immigration people along in Honolulu so that by the time we arrived in San Francisco the entire immigration process had been completed.</span> <span id="s78">It took about three or four days from Honolulu to San Francisco.</span> <span id="s79">I remember seeing the bridge in the daytime and being very impressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">WH: What were your impressions of the cross-country train ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">ST: I had a very moving incident in Albuquerque.</span> <span id="s82">We were sitting in a compartment and one of the people was a black man.</span> <span id="s83">I got off and went into the station where I saw, for the first time, “White” and “Colored” signs for the rest rooms.</span> <span id="s84">I reacted as if I had been slapped in the face.</span> <span id="s85">And I am not a super-Democrat.</span> <span id="s86">I had lived for ten years among colored people, Chinese people, and seeing this was insulting to me for his sake.</span> <span id="s87">And when I returned to the compartment I couldn’t face the black man; he obviously knew and that was why he hadn’t gotten off.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">WH: Did you meet survivors in the beginning when you came to New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">ST: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">I would meet them on Sundays when I would go with my relatives to Brighton Beach.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">WH: How do you see yourself in relation to other survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s92">ST: It’s interesting because I don’t actually see myself as a survivor.</span> <span id="s93">I shy away from that term because my experience was really much more benevolent.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">WH: Do your friends from Shanghai feel that same way?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">ST: Yes, pretty much.</span> <span id="s96">It was a different experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">WH: Yes, but on the other hand, both groups were born in Europe, suffered dislocation, and came here about the same time.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">ST: Yes, that’s true and it’s why I was attracted to a young woman who survived the war in Europe.</span> <span id="s99">There was a common background.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">WH: Where did you go to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">ST: I went to City ad eventually got a Ph.D. from Columbia.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: Do you think, as an educator, that education can prevent another Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">ST: That’s a very difficult question to answer because when you see the enormity of some of the social forces that contribute to prejudice, it’s not clear that making kids cognitively cognizant is the way to go.</span> <span id="s104">I certainly hope so.,</span></p> <p><span id="s105">WH: How do you feel about Germans and other Europeans?</span></p> <p><span id="s106">ST: I willingly approach Germans younger than me but not those older than me.</span> <span id="s107">As far as Poles go, I believe they are intrinsically more antisemitic than Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">WH: Do you think a Holocaust could happen here?</span></p> <p><span id="s109">ST: No.</span> <span id="s110">There’s brutality here too, but there’s an underlying sense of fairness that wouldn’t let that happen here.</span> <span id="s111">It seems to violate the American sense of fairness.</span> <span id="s112">Look at the lack of antisemitism when there was the Arab oil boycott.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">WH: Do you have any friends today from the Shanghai days?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">ST: Yes.</span> <span id="s115">I have one especially close friend, Siegfried Loebel, who has become deeply religious and lives in Boro Park.</span> <span id="s116">All of my close friends are Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Conclusion of Interview</span></p> <p><span id="s118">PAGE USHMM Archives RG-50.165*0119 PAGE 4</span></p> <p><span id="s119">PAGE</span></p></body></html>
