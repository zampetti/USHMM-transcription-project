2008</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Sonja DuBois, conducted by Ina Navazelskis, on November 10th, 2008, in Washington, D.C., at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</span> <span id="s12">First of all, thank you Sonja for agreeing to talk with us today.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: My pleasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: And as we do with all of our interviews, we’re going to begin at the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: We’d like to hear – we’d like to lay the groundwork, and that means where you were born, when you were born, your family, who was your family.</span> <span id="s17">So, short descriptions of your father and your mother, if you had any siblings, their names.</span> <span id="s18">And before we start with that, there’s something I see that’s very unusual, with mo – from most of the interviews that we’ve conducted, in that today you are Sonja DuBois, and on the day you were born you were Clara van Tyne(ph).</span> <span id="s19">That’s quite a different name.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: So, ex –</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: And I’ve had a name in between.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: So, it’s all a – you know, here it is –</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: All right.</span> <span id="s27">Yes, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s28">Q: Explain it to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">A: Yes, I was born October 1994 – ’90 – 1940, of course, in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, or Holland, whichever way you want to put that, to a young Jewish couple named Moshe and Sophie van Tyne(ph).</span> <span id="s30">They were – had been married in 1939, and I was born in 1940, and their lives ended in 1942, and I was their only child.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Is van Tyne(ph) a – a Dutch Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: Yes, it’s a –</span></p> <p><span id="s35">Q: So you –</span></p> <p><span id="s36">A: – it’s a dut – Dutch Jewish name, but I never knew what my name was until quite a few – few years later.</span> <span id="s37">To get to the en – to the initial part of the story, which will – you will want to – will want to come back to, is in 1938, a cousin got out of The Netherlands on the last ship, Hospel(ph).</span> <span id="s38">Her name – her – her new husband and her, and her baby girl, went to Australia, cause United States wasn’t accepting any more refugees.</span> <span id="s39">And these people figured back into my life much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What are their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: Oh boy.</span> <span id="s42">Bev Schulster(ph) is the daughter of Aunt Alice.</span> <span id="s43">Aunt Alice van Hilder(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s44">Q: Van Hilder(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s45">A: Yeah, g-e-l, yeah.</span> <span id="s46">She and her young husband; he used to travel abroad, and kind of saw the handwriting on the wall.</span> <span id="s47">And he and his wife and little baby girl, and his parents came over.</span> <span id="s48">Who turned back up in life way later.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s50">So, when you were born in 1940, where were you born – were you still with – yeah, of course you were with your mother, but were your parents in their own home?</span> <span id="s51">Were they both –</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: You know, I th – I think I might have been born right after their initial home was bombed.</span> <span id="s53">They lived in the old city in Rotterdam and I understand that was bombed early on by the Nazi.</span> <span id="s54">So, they either lived there or another place in Rotterdam, and I know – I know that address.</span> <span id="s55">The initial address is, you know, no longer.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: Did you ever see photos of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: I have one precious photo of them.</span> <span id="s58">And I didn’t get that until I was 60 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: Which is a long time ago, too, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">A: But I’ll tell you how it –</span></p> <p><span id="s63">Q: It’s a long time –</span></p> <p><span id="s64">A: Yeah, it’s a long time to wonder what your mother looked like, what she smelled like, you know, the intimacy that you – that surely kids –</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: – I presume.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: You know, all this I presume they develop with their mother, because I was 21 months old when they were deported to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s69">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: By that time you were in hiding?</span> <span id="s71">That mo – by that time you had been taken away from them, or they had –</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: No, the day they got on the – on the train, on the transport to Westerbork, I was handed over, they handed me over to a friend of theirs.</span> <span id="s73">And, you know, I will never know if – if this was a – of course it was agonizing – if it was a decision that they had made prior to that, or if it was just because, as I heard it later, Daddy’s friend said, you don’t want to take this child with you.</span> <span id="s74">I sort of think of the earlier, you know, that they had agonized over it and decided that they didn’t really know where they were going yet in ’42, except, you know, you haven’t worked in awhile, and they promised people jobs, too, so –</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Well, what – what – do you know what he had been doing, what his job had been?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, after the war, I have a few precious papers, and one of these was his dismissal letter, which was typed in 1941, just a paragraph.</span> <span id="s77">And it said that they were very sorry, due to circumstances, they had to let him go, but would recommend him to anyone.</span> <span id="s78">So when I – and he – he worked in a – he chaired a linguist department like – it was an export company, so I guess he knew languages.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Oh, so it was an export company that had a department of – of – of many multilingual people.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Probably, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q: And he was the head of that department.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: And so he, you know, he hadn’t worked at – in awhile, and I tried to look up that company many years later when I si – finally started researching and found out they were a Jewish company too, and of course, had been bought for pennies on the dollar, or guilden.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">A: Long time before that.</span> <span id="s85">So he –</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: At 21 – at 21 months old, I would be very surprised to think that you’d have any memories of that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: No, I’m –</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: What are your earliest memories?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: It’s really strange.</span> <span id="s90">An earl – earliest memory that I have didn’t flash in – see, my life’s floating puzzle pieces, didn't flash in until maybe a dozen years ago, when my husband and I were in Saint Thomas and they have these little boats that go between hotels and port.</span> <span id="s91">And there was this – they look like little Thomas the train trains.</span> <span id="s92">And I said to Ron, I said, I’ve been on one of those before.</span> <span id="s93">And smells are always the strongest memory for me.</span> <span id="s94">And I smell that I’ve been on that boat before.</span> <span id="s95">Well, the person I was given to, after we went [indecipherable] and that was a temporary situation, when Mom came to pick me up, she tells me, she went one way, like my tram probably, and came back another way, which was across the Mass river, you know, not to be traced.</span> <span id="s96">And I remember sitting down on a little bench, smelling that smoke go over me, and oh, it’s so strange that, you know, things like that still happen.</span> <span id="s97">And put –</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: The little flashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yeah, they just – they’re just little flashes.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: So, what happened to y – what happened to you before your earliest memories kick in, that you were told later, of your road?</span> <span id="s101">Your parents are there until they’re deported to Westerbork.</span> <span id="s102">At the time of their deportation, they hand you to somebody.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Right, to Mr. Dolf Henkes, who became quite a well known artist in Europe.</span> <span id="s104">And that’s an important connection, cause until like the 80s, I couldn’t figure out why I was given to one person and not to another.</span> <span id="s105">He was a friend of Daddy’s, and I did find out later that they were both artists.</span> <span id="s106">Daddy’s an art – was an artist.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">Q: Your father in – when you say daddy, you mean your birth father?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: Yeah, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: There are Mother and Daddy, and Mom and Pop.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s112">That’s how they’re distinguished.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s115">And Mom and Pop are the people who raised you?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: So, I was given to Mr. Henkes, he was a single man, always was, and had – took me home – well, first he took me to farm country, where a lot of kids were hidden, but he found – the conditions he’d found were atrocious.</span> <span id="s119">It was behind a chicken coup, there was a family there.</span> <span id="s120">And I think it was a mutual decision, they didn’t want me, cause I cried a lot, you know, I would have given them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: You’re a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: You’re a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I’m probably missing my mommy.</span> <span id="s125">So he took me home, and then through the underground, nobody’ll ever know where, who, what, because I’ve tried to find out.</span> <span id="s126">Just within the last two years I was rejected to have them named as Righteous Gentiles, cause we couldn’t find – one of the reasons was we couldn’t find enough witnesses.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: We can talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s128">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: We can talk about that later.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Yeah, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Fine.</span> <span id="s133">Enough witnesses.</span> <span id="s134">So he took me home, Mom and Pop are – Mom came to pick me up.</span> <span id="s135">And I think the reason my birthday was celebrated in August, nobody knew a thing about me, was that they got me in August, you know.</span> <span id="s136">I know when Mother and Daddy went to Westerbork, that was like the 27th or something, July.</span> <span id="s137">Figure they futzed around a little bit, finally found somebody.</span> <span id="s138">So in August, it was, you know, a new beginning for me.</span> <span id="s139">And they couldn’t have children, so you know, I was an answer to their prayers as well.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: And where did – where were they – who are – what are their names, and where were they from?</span></p> <p><span id="s141">A: They’re – were Elizabeth and wille – William van der Kaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Van der Kagan(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Kaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">Q: Kaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">A: Which is of the dike, in Holland.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Okay, van der Kaden.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: And they had always lived in Scheidam, which is a city right next to Rotterdam.</span> <span id="s148">And he – he was active, Pop was active in the underground, and Mom used to volunteer the Red Cross, so it’s – you know.</span> <span id="s149">I’m sure they had –</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: How old were they?</span> <span id="s151">Were they older than your own parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: No, they were – Mom was born in the same year, 1913, just like Mother and Daddy were, and Pop was maybe about five years older.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: So – but I didn’t look like anybody, you know, when – it’s amazing how many people – it really did take a village to bring up this child, because they weren’t the only – you know, they took the biggest risk, but there was the pediatrician they found to examine me, who guessed at my age.</span> <span id="s155">Yeah, August sounds good, you know.</span> <span id="s156">Two years old, fine.</span> <span id="s157">You know, it’s two or three months.</span> <span id="s158">There was the food stamp office that gave me a s – a stamp so I could eat.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Eat.</span> <span id="s160">So you’d have food rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Yeah, I had food rations.</span> <span id="s162">Let’s see, what else?</span> <span id="s163">Oh, there were people that Mom knew – oh, one friend of theirs was a policeman, and from an old coat of his, I got this wonderful navy cape that she sewed.</span> <span id="s164">I must have look – you know, and it had a lining, I remember a plaid lining.</span> <span id="s165">So I must have, you know, worn.</span> <span id="s166">And the – the first picture I had was with a little knitted dress that was pulled – you know, it was warm.</span> <span id="s167">Nobody else had anything either.</span> <span id="s168">So, they pull that thing on and started over, and made this pretty dress for this little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: And you – you had no brothers and sisters in that family, or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: None.</span> <span id="s171">No, I had – you know, I was first child of my natural family and they never had children either.</span> <span id="s172">So, as Mom used to call me when she aged, and could remember my name, she’d say, oh, here comes my only one.</span> <span id="s173">So, you know, we all – always meant a lot to each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Then let’s go back to your – your – you’ve been – you end up with them, and your earliest memories then, with them.</span> <span id="s175">Do you ha – can you pull those –</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Oh yes, yes, yes.</span> <span id="s177">As a matter of fact, I wrote a story about this, because it keeps flashing in front of my eyes.</span> <span id="s178">And that is the first time I saw a parade, or I thought I saw a parade.</span> <span id="s179">We u – we lived three different places during four years, by the way.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: You were with them for four years?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: No, I was with them all my life, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s182">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">A: – you know, communication was much slower than it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: – so when people in one end of town started making – posing questions that they couldn’t or wouldn’t answer, we’d just move across town.</span> <span id="s186">Well, you know, that doesn’t make any sense now, but it did then.</span></p> <p><span id="s187">Q: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">A: So, the second place we lived was on the second floor, and in Holland you had these little spy windows at – at the front of the window, so you could see who was at the front door.</span> <span id="s189">Well, I was not – never ne – knew why, I was never allowed near the window anyhow.</span> <span id="s190">Strange rule, I thought, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: You weren’t allowed, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Not allowed near the window.</span> <span id="s193">Well, what do you do when you’re told you’re not – told you’re not allowed?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Go to the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Well, you go to the window.</span></p> <p><span id="s196">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">A: So, I don’t know how old I was, but I know it was at dusk.</span> <span id="s198">It was a rainy – it was that nasty rain they have in Holland, just kind of slithers down and co –</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Cold and clammy.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s201">And there is a – a parade of men, and I could count, I could count to 10, I think.</span> <span id="s202">And there were five men across, and then a row back, and I don’t know how many there were.</span> <span id="s203">And they were – there was a drum in front of them, one drummer.</span> <span id="s204">And these people had strange costumes, to a child’s eye.</span> <span id="s205">They were all kind of brown and gray and black.</span> <span id="s206">But it wasn’t a happy parade.</span> <span id="s207">Just kind of strange, but I thought it was a parade, because I had never seen a parade, probably.</span> <span id="s208">And some wore hats, and some that – I can remember the glistening of their hair, those that weren't – weren’t wearing hats.</span> <span id="s209">They all had carried a roll of some sort, which later on I figured out were blankets.</span> <span id="s210">Where we lived, just around the block was a train station.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">A: And so, they were having their last walk in their city, because you know, when they went to the train station and the door closed –</span></p> <p><span id="s213">Q: So these were not soldiers, these were just ordinary people?</span></p> <p><span id="s214">A: These were – these were men that were found, they’re being deported.</span> <span id="s215">And of course, you know, I was being protected from whatever nasty was going on.</span> <span id="s216">I didn’t know it was nasty.</span> <span id="s217">I couldn’t figure it out.</span> <span id="s218">Why would you have a parade on a rainy day, why didn't they cancel it?</span> <span id="s219">I knew that much.</span> <span id="s220">And there wasn’t any happy music.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: And there was a drummer.</span> <span id="s222">That’s so strange.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah, it was just a – a single drummer.</span> <span id="s224">And then of course, it was much later when I figured out that their fate was probably sealed when –</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: They were found.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: – they sealed the doors of the train.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: And – but, you know, Mom and Pop always, always worked hard at protecting me from – from my other life.</span> <span id="s229">I – my life kind of became a conspiracy of silence.</span> <span id="s230">There is good and there is bad in that, I’m afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">Q: Did you play with other kids during the war years?</span></p> <p><span id="s232">A: No, I belonged to – they tried to make life as normal as possible for me.</span> <span id="s233">I remember going to a pre-school or kindergarten, or something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Did they look very different than you?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Your parents – I mean, your – your adopted parents?</span> <span id="s237">They did?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s239">Pop was red haired, kind of bald already, and Mom was a dark blonde.</span> <span id="s240">So – but there were questions all the time, and – and in another group of people who – who could have – who became part of the – the extended family were the teachers and the parents that used to pick the kids up.</span> <span id="s241">Where’d this little girl come from?</span> <span id="s242">How come, you know, she doesn’t look like any of us?</span> <span id="s243">I have a picture, you know, class picture, of me.</span> <span id="s244">I was short, I was sitting on the bench in the front row, and there’s like a row behind me and a teacher on each side.</span> <span id="s245">It’s one redhead, all towheads and me, you know, so you know, my hair is still black.</span> <span id="s246">And that had to be very telling, and it was years, years, years later that my girlfriend Welly(ph), who I still correspond with in Holland, told me, we were all sworn to silence.</span> <span id="s247">The reason was given that it would just hurt me.</span> <span id="s248">It would, you know, upset me to know that I didn’t belong [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s249">Well, of course, kids have that instinct where they know that, or I did, anyhow.</span> <span id="s250">By the time I was about five years old I figured out that –</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: Something’s different.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How’d you figure that out?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: Well, it’s hard to tell.</span> <span id="s255">There again, snippets.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: Well, let’s have them, snippets.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: The most obvious was that towards the end of the war, we used to – you know, people walk there all the time.</span> <span id="s258">I used to walk around the city and meet acquaintances and friends.</span> <span id="s259">And I’d be standing here holding [indecipherable], and the conversation was always the same.</span> <span id="s260">Well, who have you heard from, did anybody come back?</span> <span id="s261">When – when’s anybody coming back?</span> <span id="s262">That – and the answer was always negative, no, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s263">And I’m standing right there.</span> <span id="s264">So eventually I figure out, they’re talking about Mother and Daddy.</span> <span id="s265">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: Did you always know –</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: – I felt – I felt – I felt – I think I felt cheated, cause nobody ever told me anything.</span> <span id="s268">I was spoken about – it’s like, even when I was older, but I was never spoken to.</span> <span id="s269">I wasn’t given the fact that I had an intelligence, that I had ears, you know, that I could hear.</span> <span id="s270">People don’t adopt kids that way, not that I was ever adopted, but they don’t handle situations like that.</span> <span id="s271">Course, during the war they didn’t have much choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s273">Were you tol – do you remember ever being – did you – when you came to them, were they your mother and father?</span> <span id="s274">For all intents and purposes, you had no – no other mother and father, or did you always know that you had another one, another set of parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">A: At that point where we’re putting things together, I knew.</span> <span id="s276">I wasn’t told until six years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s277">Q: So you were only told when you were like 11 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">A: Almost 12, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: Almost 12.</span> <span id="s280">But at that point is when you started suspecting that you had a – there was something –</span></p> <p><span id="s281">A: M-More.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s283">Because of that conversation, always the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s285">You know, I was –</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Q: Did you ask them, and they just deflected your answers?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: No, I didn’t – you know, I didn’t begin to ask until after to – they told me, because instinctively I think I knew it would hurt their feelings, or I wouldn’t be a good girl, and we were all trying to be very good, and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: And –</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Did you have –</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: – it was kind of cowardly, I guess, you look at it now, but I was a little girl, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Oh, it’s not cowardly at all, it’s normal.</span> <span id="s293">And it’s also – what a – what we’ve found in – is that there’s a lot of people who had silences in their lives, in their early lives.</span> <span id="s294">And most of the reasons – and sometimes they don’t know those reasons, you can only kind of assume, but those who i-impose the silences, let’s say your – your – your –</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: Mom and Pop.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: – adopted parents –</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s299">Didn’t want to traumatize the child.</span> <span id="s300">They – they – they didn’t know –</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: I think they didn’t know how to begin.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s303">They didn’t know what to – how would they handle this, and they didn't know what effect it could have on you.</span> <span id="s304">Or – I mean, I’m assuming too.</span> <span id="s305">I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: And on them.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">A: Later on you find, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: – you – well.</span> <span id="s311">Let’s talk a little bit how I was kept alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: Yes, please.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: These – these people – you know, everybody in Holland was hungry, too.</span> <span id="s314">It was the land of, you know, butter and milk and cows, and you know, the – the soldiers were getting it all, you know, they had to keep the troops alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: So how were you kept alive?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: There one – one day – one meal a day, a hot meal, was the meal of the day.</span> <span id="s317">I used to go – in Holland we have a lot of aunts and uncles, just everybody’s an aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s318">They found an aunt and uncle for me who gave me hot meal a day.</span> <span id="s319">Nobody asked where they got the food, or you know, that type of thing.</span> <span id="s320">But I went to these folks, my little cape on.</span> <span id="s321">And it must have been just a couple of blocks, cause I went by myself.</span> <span id="s322">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Why didn’t you eat at home?</span> <span id="s324">Didn’t they have the food?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: Well, they were getting to the s – going to the soup kitchen and getting this, you know, two slices of bread and this thin soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: No, no, I’m – what I – where my curiosity comes from is that you had a ration card; somebody had colluded and given you a ration card.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: Yeah, but that food was pretty yuk for a three year old.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">Q: Oh, I see, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: All right, yeah, yeah, it was –</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: So –</span></p> <p><span id="s331">A: – it wasn’t nourishing.</span> <span id="s332">Couldn’t get any milk.</span> <span id="s333">I have another story about how I got milk.</span> <span id="s334">But, you know, to get a regular, substantial meal, I was told I was a little waif already by the time I came to them.</span> <span id="s335">Which is likely because I wasn’t getting enough to eat, you know, at Mother and – and Daddy’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: And so you went to this aunt and uncle who were probably not their relations either, but just –</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: No, no, they weren’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And, you know, it was sort of shady, I’m sure, as to where they got their food.</span> <span id="s340">And – but I had a nice, hot meal, and it was so sweet.</span> <span id="s341">I would come home and I remember this distinctly, I don’t know why it didn’t – you know, some things just come to me, and – and Pop would have the – they have these little tins, like I think probably Laura Ingalls carried to her – to lunch for school.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: And the soup would be in there, and he would ask me if I was still hungry.</span> <span id="s344">And I’m told that nine out of times – 10 times, I ate it, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: Well</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: [indecipherable] you – you know, I didn’t know, but I didn’t need it, you know, and he – he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">Q: You – maybe you were hungry.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">Q: Your – you’re a child and they know that, and they know that, and they loved you.</span></p> <p><span id="s350">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: That’s what it sounds like because they were – there could have been a situation – you were with a family which would not have fed you more than they needed to.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">A: Right, right.</span> <span id="s353">Yeah, it was – it was fine.</span> <span id="s354">So, you know.</span> <span id="s355">And Pop used to cook sugar beets.</span> <span id="s356">And every – they c – they cut them in strips, and then they simmer them, and it makes some sort of syrup.</span> <span id="s357">And he would cut them, and he was always hungry.</span> <span id="s358">And he would give me a si – a little piece of – half of that, and he says, don’t tell Momma.</span> <span id="s359">You know, but he wa – he was my buddy.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: Did you – did you ever feel, during the – during the war times, that you were in danger?</span> <span id="s361">Did you ever remember such a feeling?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s363">Yeah, I do.</span> <span id="s364">I remember – you know, in Holland the bathrooms are not the way they – ours are.</span> <span id="s365">They call them WCs and they were water closets, they really are.</span> <span id="s366">And Mom and I, I – I do remember sitting there, not knowing why, being held on her lap, and hearing these high pitched sounds, and those were, of course, the bombs, or the bombers flying near, or whatever.</span> <span id="s367">But we used to sit in the –</span></p> <p><span id="s368">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">A: – in the – in the toilet there.</span> <span id="s370">And another time there was a – a man raid, and somebody had warned us.</span> <span id="s371">Pop had already hidden out with a friend of his, and we were to go there as well.</span> <span id="s372">And it was a – must have been summer, because I remember the cobbles – I had bare feet, and so it was at night and the cobblestones were slick, but not ice cold – because Mom was carrying a – a pot of soup or something like that, and her – she said to the soldier that she had to go to krankenhaus.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: To the hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">A: Right.</span> <span id="s375">And I guess in those days, whatever you had, you brought.</span> <span id="s376">And she told me to, you know, go ahead and run ahead.</span> <span id="s377">And it’s the black boots that frightened me.</span> <span id="s378">I don’t own a pair of black boots.</span> <span id="s379">There will never be any in my closet.</span> <span id="s380">Because, you know, Nazis boots came up, probably to my eye level.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">A: And that is, you know, that’s just one of those quirks that still exists in my life, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: Did you – the dane – the first danger that you mentioned is the kind that would be indiscriminate.</span> <span id="s384">It – you know, a bomb falls, it doesn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: – care who it falls on.</span> <span id="s387">Was there danger about you?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: I don’t think there – I was eve – Mom and Pop were ever personally, or myself, attacked, to – where we ha – where we felt – where I felt I’m safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: So, the only thing was is that occasionally someone would say something, ask too many questions about where you came from, and you moved.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: But not to the p –</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Oh, and what I remember, the man I was given to, Mr. Henkes, I – to a – the earlier address we lived in, came – and I think he tried to come and see me.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: It’s okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: Okay, all right then.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Yeah, the earlier man, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">A: We lived, again, second story, and I remember that someone said that Mr. Henkes tried to come see me.</span> <span id="s397">I guess to see if I was all right.</span> <span id="s398">And I remember, you know, Mom and Pop being very upset about that.</span> <span id="s399">And he got a picture of me, and I know the day it was passed to him.</span> <span id="s400">I don’t know why I knew that.</span> <span id="s401">I was about four years old, and there’s this picture of me holding a doll carriage.</span> <span id="s402">And one of the teachers handed something over the fence.</span> <span id="s403">I don’t know why I knew it was my picture, and I didn’t think of it again until much later, 1987, but we’re not there yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: We’ll get – we’ll get there.</span> <span id="s405">We’ll get there.</span> <span id="s406">But, do you think that he came to visit you close to the end of the war?</span> <span id="s407">Is that – if you were four years old, and it was 19 – you were born in 1940, so that would take it, you know, half a year a –</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: – yeah, half a year away from, you know, liberation.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Liberation.</span> <span id="s411">No, it must have been earlier than that, because we didn’t live near that railroad yet.</span> <span id="s412">The address I came to was the one where I remember – because across the street, on the ground level, was a – I guess he was an invalid, he was an old man who used to sit in the window and wave at me.</span> <span id="s413">I call him Opa, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s414">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s415">Oh, I just had a thought, what was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Jot it down.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">Q: Went in one ear and out the other.</span> <span id="s418">Let me see if I can rece – recover it.</span> <span id="s419">But in the meantime, are there any other memories from the ti – yes, I remember now what it was.</span> <span id="s420">Your Pop, what was his job, what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Carpenter.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: He was a carpent –</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: Carpenter cabinetmaker, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s425">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: And that was – cause he didn’t have a job over the fren – over the – during the war, either, you know, nobody was working doing any construction.</span> <span id="s427">And he couldn’t get one after the war in that trade, because all the wood was gone.</span> <span id="s428">You know, people chopped down little trees, they used their furniture to burn their f –</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: To heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: – you know, to get so – to heat, yeah, or you know, there – there were no jobs.</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: Did they come from large families, your adoptive parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: Pop was one of six, and Mom was one of three.</span> <span id="s433">No, I think Pop was one of seven, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: And did you meet the aunts and uncles?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s436">Yeah, I became part of the – the family.</span> <span id="s437">As a ma – ma – my favorite cousin was on – on Pop’s side, a little boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: Did you ever feel like you were different, family-wise, that there was something different about you, the way you felt, you know, in the general life?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Not when I was with them, no.</span> <span id="s440">No, I would – I felt – as a matter of fact, probably I was the happiest when I was with them, because it was a lonely life being an only child and kind of not knowing how to act.</span> <span id="s441">Was – I –</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: What do you mean by that?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: I never knew if I was being good or not.</span> <span id="s444">Not that I ever made any gross mistakes, I don’t think, but it’s all part of trying to please, I think.</span> <span id="s445">And Mom and Pop were never dismonstrative, so I didn’t know by touch, or by hug or by atta girl, whether I was measuring up.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: But when you were in the larger family you felt –</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Yeah, I’m just one of the kids, I’m fine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Did you feel that they loved you?</span></p> <p><span id="s449">A: Mom and Pop?</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: So, even if they weren't demonstrative, it wasn’t because there – there was coldness in the home?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s454">That is really hard to say.</span> <span id="s455">I think I became their possession.</span> <span id="s456">I don’t ever feel like – like I was nurtured a lot as a child, as a little human who was fulfilling – this is a terrible thing, this – it’s gonna sound awful – that was fulfilling their dreams.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: It’s a big burden.</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: And I don’t know if it was the – the age of – you know, the time, or whether it was a European philosophy, but kids definitely were to be seen and not heard.</span> <span id="s459">And I always tried to measure up to that.</span> <span id="s460">But I don’t ever remember sitting on Mom’s lap.</span> <span id="s461">I would have remembered, because my Opa, her dad, used to come over and I loved sitting on his lap, and we used to listen to the radio programs, and he was just my favorite person in the world, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s462">Q: What were their dreams that you were fulfilling?</span></p> <p><span id="s463">A: Well see, I never really knew.</span> <span id="s464">I never knew when – I knew when I was doing wrong, but I guess I never got – I don’t know, it was kind of cold, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: So it was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: It was cold.</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: An-And I don’t mean to si – you know, negate –</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: What they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: – what they did.</span> <span id="s471">And it becomes more obvious later on in life when I did start asking questions, and I was rebuffed, you know, not to ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s472">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s473">A: So.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s475">Hang on just a second.</span></p> <p><span id="s476">A: And I was – I was – you know, I was trying to be loyal to their – their wishes.</span> <span id="s477">You know, they had wanted a child so badly, they wanted a good child, and where would I have been without them?</span> <span id="s478">So I certainly had to be grateful.</span> <span id="s479">And it sure –</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Those are huge burdens though.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: For a little – for a child, those are burdens –</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s484">Q: – to be goo – you know.</span> <span id="s485">Because the no –</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: We didn’t analyze that until much later, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s487">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: – I don’t – you know, when people say, was – did you have a happy childhood?</span> <span id="s489">I’ll say, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s490">I had a comfortable childhood.</span> <span id="s491">I had food, I was dressed well.</span> <span id="s492">Pop and I used to walk by windows, you know, shopping.</span> <span id="s493">And I guess I was very clever, because I never asked for anything outright, I – I knew that wasn’t the thing to do, but I’ll si – he says – I used to say, that’s all [indecipherable] this is what we’ll buy someday, right?</span> <span id="s494">And, you know, likely it showed up, but I knew – I was polite enough to know that you didn’t ask for things.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">Q: Did they get along with one another?</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: So it wasn’t that –</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: Cause I – cause, well, you know, and this comes in later on.</span> <span id="s499">They would – they made an agreement not to tell – ever tell me anything.</span> <span id="s500">And I think Pop would have broken that, hadn’t it been for Mom.</span> <span id="s501">She was definitely the more dominant person.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Were they religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Protestant [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Yeah, Protestant.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did you go to church with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I went to chur – after the war, we started – you know, when you could worship freely again, I went to church with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: Oh, I didn’t realize that Christians wouldn’t have been able to worship during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: N-No, it’s – I don’t know.</span> <span id="s510">Maybe they didn't want to take me out in the street any more than normal.</span> <span id="s511">But I remember a minister friend of theirs, their minister, I guess, coming to the house and – and visiting.</span> <span id="s512">But I don’t remember going to church until after the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: Do you remember how – when the war ended?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">Q: What was that like?</span></p> <p><span id="s516">A: I remember some flashes, and then later on I was, you know, as I’m listening to the after dinner stories, I’m saying, oh that’s what we’re – that’s what I saw.</span> <span id="s517">May fifth, it was in the evening, I think, when they finally heard that they’d been liberated.</span> <span id="s518">And I was taken from bed.</span> <span id="s519">I don’t remember being asleep, but I know I was groggy, and they were dancing around the street with me, with all these – I saw all these flags, you know?</span> <span id="s520">That was another thing that was confiscated besides bikes and radios, you know, also, they had to – had to give up their flags.</span> <span id="s521">Well, you know, you might give up one flag, but they rolled the other one up and hid it in the attic.</span> <span id="s522">And there was lots of dancing and – and music, and I remember feeling really out of it, you know.</span> <span id="s523">But – but that was –</span></p> <p><span id="s524">Q: It was a good mood.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: – that was liberation, yeah –</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: – that was – yeah.</span> <span id="s528">And I don’t know why it was such a big moment until later on.</span> <span id="s529">I knew it was an odd time for me to be out, and we – you know, people being riotous in the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: Did your life change much after liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: I had a visitor.</span> <span id="s532">The aunt – did I tell that one of the – Daddy’s sisters – grandfa – his grandfather’s level, his younger sister was married to a Christian who was very well-to-do?</span></p> <p><span id="s533">Q: No, you didn't tell me about this.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">A: Okay, well, Tante Sinke(ph) was married to this man who was a Christian, so she was safe.</span> <span id="s535">You know, they didn’t make an issue out of her being a Jew.</span> <span id="s536">But they came – she came to visit, sometime.</span> <span id="s537">I don’t know how they found me, but there was –</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: I was just going to say, yeah, they came to this – so she was your –</span></p> <p><span id="s539">A: Here we go again with the underground.</span> <span id="s540">You know, underground was underground.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: Yeah, exactly.</span> <span id="s542">They didn’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s543">A: Did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: That’s right, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: And I remember as if it were yesterday.</span> <span id="s546">I had – I was still taking naps in the afternoon some, and Mom’s getting me up, and there’s this lady in this long cart – coat with the fur collar, and the hat with the feather, that came to us and – and visited with us.</span> <span id="s547">And I’m look – and we look out the window and she’s – it looks like this big, black car is down there.</span> <span id="s548">Well, it probably wasn’t, but you know, in a child’s eye.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: And that’s when my life became a conspiracy of silence.</span> <span id="s551">I think that – you know, her children are grown, the youngest one was maybe 17 - 18.</span> <span id="s552">And so, an agreement must have been made that Mom and Pop would keep me, cause they had a right to take me.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: There were a lot – there were a lot of court issues about that in – in – in every country, I guess.</span> <span id="s555">But they probably came to an agreement that I would stay with them, and perhaps never – nothing would ever be said.</span> <span id="s556">Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Did she – did she say that she’s your aunt?</span> <span id="s558">Did she say – introduce herself?</span> <span id="s559">How was she introduced to you?</span> <span id="s560">Or was she?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Tante.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Tante.</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Another – another aunt and uncle.</span> <span id="s564">Look I told you, you have a lot of aunts and uncles that aren’t.</span> <span id="s565">It’s like the south has mizz and mister.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s567">A: We have aunts and uncles, you know, so they could be first cousins, you know, for all – for all I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: Or they could be somebody who, they just liked –</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Right, there’s a neighbor down the street –</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: – you go and stay with Aunt Ann when you come from school, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s572">Q: And yet, she stood out in your mind, because she was so well dressed, because she was from a – a wealthier milieu.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">A: Yeah, I think that’s – that’s what – and we used to visit them regularly.</span> <span id="s574">In Holland kids don’t go to school on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons.</span> <span id="s575">And to me it seemed like every other week we were getting on the train – tram after I came home from school and go to Tante Sinke(ph) [indecipherable] and – and visit with them, and stay until we had dinner, stay will – until it got dark and come home, yeah.</span> <span id="s576">And I think the 17 year old was probably the only one still living there.</span> <span id="s577">And can you imagine a s-seven year old – six year, seven year old little girl following around a –</span></p> <p><span id="s578">Q: Sounds like –</span></p> <p><span id="s579">A: – a teenager, it was – you know, heroin.</span></p> <p><span id="s580">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s582">It was fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: But they never told you then.</span> <span id="s584">Your aunt and your – your aunt – your real aunt never said, you know, hey, there is a different life, there was a different identity.</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: Oh no, oh no.</span> <span id="s586">As a matter of fact, several years later, must have been about seven, cause they took a picture and I had a tooth missing, so that was kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: – how I gauged things.</span> <span id="s589">We went to this young woman’s engagement party at Tante Sinke’s(ph) house.</span> <span id="s590">And somebody took me aside, or I was in the garden, and talked to me, and – and said what I already had developed in my mind, that these people you live with aren’t your mother and father, you know.</span> <span id="s591">And somebody found out about that, and that person was permanently uninvited to the house.</span> <span id="s592">So you can imagine how upset they were, and I felt –</span></p> <p><span id="s593">Q: Why the –</span></p> <p><span id="s594">A: – the same way as the day that Mom and Pop told me who I was.</span> <span id="s595">It was this tremor went through – went through my body.</span> <span id="s596">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: It was another one of those where I had a question –</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Fleeting moment?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">Q: Fleeting moment.</span> <span id="s600">Your name, that’s what it was.</span> <span id="s601">What was your name?</span> <span id="s602">You said –</span></p> <p><span id="s603">A: Clara.</span> <span id="s604">Clara van Tyne(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: That’s right.</span> <span id="s606">But when you were with Mom and Pop, what was your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Sonja van der Kaden(ph).</span> <span id="s608">I – they renamed me the minute I – I got there.</span> <span id="s609">Well, nobody knew what my name was until Tante Sinke(ph) showed up.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">Q: That’s what I was after, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">A: Right.</span> <span id="s612">She’s the one who, you know</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: So they – when they – when they got you, they didn’t even know that you were Clara van Tyne(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: Oh no, no, they –</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: They just named you Sonja.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: Yeah, she liked Sonja, and that was – you know, that was fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s618">A: Later on she told me what it meant, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: What does it mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Supposedly it’s – it’s from – in Sweden they use it and it means sunshine, so – and I also found out what my Jewish name was.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: What was your Jewish name?</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: Shifra.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: Shifra.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">A: And whenever I write, you know, like I’ve been at the conference and I write to friends I’ve made there or friends I have, I sign off as Shifra and they know who I am.</span> <span id="s625">So that’s – and – and the way I found that out was through Tante Sinke(ph), she left for a – I guess Mom and Pop got some papers which I eventually ended up with, and it has this wonderful acknowledgement, you know, I wouldn’t – Daddy must have known things were going to get worse, because there’s a letter dated January ’42, I think, that said, pertaining to our telephone conversation this morning, your daughter’s name is listed as Shifra.</span> <span id="s626">So I kept thinking, I was born in 1940, why didn’t they name me til 1942?</span> <span id="s627">Well, they did, it was in the records, but I would have never known without that document.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: Do you think your aunt and her family ended up paying Mom and Pop any money for your upkeep later?</span> <span id="s629">A: No, I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s630">No, I don’t – I don’t think so at all.</span> <span id="s631">I always wonder where the piano came from.</span> <span id="s632">I –</span></p> <p><span id="s633">Q: You got a piano as you were growing up?</span></p> <p><span id="s634">A: Yeah, we had a piano, I guess I took lessons for probably about three years.</span> <span id="s635">The picture that they had made before we left to s – you know, to let everybody know I was well and healthy and – was sitting at that piano with Jossy’s dress, and she’s in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s636">Q: Is there anything else that you think between those a – those years, between liberation and – I want to get to the point where you have that conversation with them.</span> <span id="s637">In those first po-post-war years, when you’re five and six years old and you’re starting to go to school, anything else of your memories that stands out, that kind of works for –</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: Well, that was the other side of the family.</span> <span id="s639">We used to go visit three aunts, and they really were aunts.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">Q: Whose?</span> <span id="s641">Yours?</span> <span id="s642">Or – or –</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: Yeah, mine, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: So your mother’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: It was my mother’s side of the family.</span> <span id="s646">There were three maiden ladies.</span> <span id="s647">And when they went to talk about me, they’d say, send het kind, that’s me.</span> <span id="s648">If I ever write a book, that’s the title, het kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Het kind.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: That child.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: The child, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Send her to play with the maid, you know, or – or go do something, or – one of them, one of those aunts had a – some sort of a lab upstairs, and we would go up to the lab.</span> <span id="s653">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: Well, how did you feel about knowing – now – knowing that you – your mother and your father did not come back.</span> <span id="s655">But, you had rela –</span></p> <p><span id="s656">A: I had relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You had relatives.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: But I would – never found out that they were until it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s660">But now it’s too – you find out about it.</span> <span id="s661">I’m not talking about your feelings in 1940s when you’re introduced to their lives, I’m talking later.</span> <span id="s662">When you realized this – these are my relatives, and that you live with one and not with another may be one thing, but that they never told you the beginnings.</span> <span id="s663">How do you – you have that – those very complicated feelings with Mom and Pop, how do you explain them to yourself?</span> <span id="s664">The three maiden aunts, the aunt who was married to the wealthy Christian?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Who eventually came to the United States, and I saw very regularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: I feel s – I feel such a loss, that I didn’t get to know them.</span> <span id="s668">And selfishly that I never got to talk to them about my fam – my parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: That’s not selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: Because there’s only one person in the world that I’ve ever spoken to, that actually knew the person, Daddy.</span> <span id="s671">Now, these people are images for – well, images that I can’t visualize until I’m 60 years old when I saw a picture.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">Q: That’s not selfish.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: It’s a floating puzzle piece.</span> <span id="s674">I’m – I’m just – you know.</span> <span id="s675">And you ha – I – I feel a real loss [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s676">And we traveled back and forth to Holland probably a couple of times while I was a teenager, and they were st-still alive.</span> <span id="s677">I don’t remember if we went to see them.</span> <span id="s678">But –</span></p> <p><span id="s679">Q: Well, let’s go on then.</span> <span id="s680">Let’s go – u-unless you –</span></p> <p><span id="s681">A: Yeah – no, go on.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: – there’s a [indecipherable], let’s go on to the time when they do talk to you.</span> <span id="s683">Ho – do you remember the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s684">A: Absolutely.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Tell me about it, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: It was a couple of days before we were going for a passport.</span> <span id="s687">I knew we were emigrating –</span></p> <p><span id="s688">Q: Oh, you were emigrating?</span></p> <p><span id="s689">A: Yeah, from Schiedam to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">Q: Oh, really?</span> <span id="s691">So they had to</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: [indecipherable] the three of us, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">Q: So they decided to – they decided to leave Holland?</span></p> <p><span id="s694">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: And wa – the reason for that was?</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: There are a couple of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s697">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s698">A: But anyhow, to get back to –</span></p> <p><span id="s699">Q: Right, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s700">A: – they – they told me in – probably in five minutes time, that M-Mother and Dad had been killed by the Germans in the war, but I was too young to know them, so they didn’t want me to worry about it, or ever think about it, because I belonged to them.</span> <span id="s701">And on this piece of paper practice writing this word, cause this is your name.</span> <span id="s702">So, as an eleven –</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: Clara van Tyne(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s705">So as an eleven year – and a half year old, I’m practicing writing this cause I’m gonna – this is gonna be an official document, and I’m – I’m signing.</span> <span id="s706">So I left the country as Clara van Tyne(ph).</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: So they did know your real na – real name eventually?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Oh yeah, Tante Sinke(ph) brought all that, remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: Yeah, she brought –</span></p> <p><span id="s711">Q: All the documentation.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">A: – bunch of stuff.</span> <span id="s713">Yeah, some documentation, couple of pieces of jewelry – two pieces of jewelry.</span> <span id="s714">No, three.</span> <span id="s715">One had a sad ending.</span> <span id="s716">Anyhow, so we left a few days later.</span> <span id="s717">I was sick as a dog all the way over.</span> <span id="s718">And we went to Hoboken, and were met by our sponsor, who was a family member.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Your family member?</span> <span id="s720">Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Another one I never knew until 2000.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Oh my gosh.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: He was the grandfather to that little baby, and the couple that left in 1938.</span> <span id="s724">Okay, they – they show back up.</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: So in some ways your adopted parents had closer ties to your blood relatives than you did?</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: Oh yeah.</span> <span id="s727">Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: And this was kept from you?</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: Oh yeah, they were – you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">Q: [indecipherable] It’s just – it’s just, you know, kind of –</span></p> <p><span id="s731">A: Kind of out of there, isn’t it?</span></p> <p><span id="s732">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">A: One of my Holland foster cousins, don’t say adopted –</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: – foster cousins, told me several years ago when we visited, he says, oh we all knew why they were leaving.</span> <span id="s736">It was to keep you from ever connecting with your, you know, other self.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s738">A: That I don’t know.</span> <span id="s739">I’m thinking – the only realizati – a lot of people say, well, they didn’t want to hurt you, da, da, da.</span> <span id="s740">But by the time that age comes around, you know –</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: If you never know –</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: – you have a right to the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: And I was always discouraged – more than discouraged, from asking about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Yes, at some point it becomes no longer I want to protect you, towar – to something else.</span> <span id="s746">And I want to pick up on something else.</span> <span id="s747">You say, why not – not – never say adopted, say foster?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: I wasn’t adopted.</span> <span id="s749">I went out on what name?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Clara van Tyne(ph)?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s752">But I didn’t know I was so – Clara van Tyne(ph), I was Sonja van der Kaden.</span> <span id="s753">And it wasn’t until – and I don’t know how this happened either – when you come in at a certain age, you don’t automatically become a citizen, you have to do your own.</span> <span id="s754">So, when I was 16, I became a naturalized citizen, and officially had a name change.</span> <span id="s755">The back of my naturalization papers say that this is a name change to Sonja Elizabeth van der Kaden from, legally I was still Clara van Tyne(ph).</span> <span id="s756">I – at that point I should have been asked if that’s what I wanted to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">Q: Of all the names that you’ve had, which one are you closest to?</span></p> <p><span id="s758">A: Shifra.</span> <span id="s759">You know, I – I – I think it’s lovely, because in the Jewish tradition, had my grandmothers been deceased, I would have automatically been named after her.</span> <span id="s760">But Shifra in the Old Testament was one of the midwives that went against the rules when the – was it Herod, said kill all the little boys?</span> <span id="s761">And she was one of two in – midwives who s – who made up all sorts of stories and said no, he – you know, these such strong women, they deliver their own, and you know, there’s no – there are no – no use for us.</span> <span id="s762">And so, you know, that’s not a common name, although it is more common in Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s763">Q: It’s known.</span> <span id="s764">It’s a known name.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">A: But I sort of hope that Dad was a Bible scholar, and he –</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: When da – was the first time that you said to yourself and felt free to say to yourself, I am a Jew?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: After 2000.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Oh, my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: And I practiced the Christian religion and will, but I do both now.</span> <span id="s772">And I, you know, burn candles – not Friday nights, but I – but I burn Hanukkah candles and I go to Yom HaShoah.</span> <span id="s773">And that’s sort of a liberating feeling that I can –</span></p> <p><span id="s774">Q: But still –</span></p> <p><span id="s775">A: And I’m not cheating on anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s777">Do you feel like you owe something to Christianity?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s780">Do you feel like you owe something to Judaism?</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s782">Not owe, I just want to feel like I understand what my family believed in, and what they died for.</span> <span id="s783">Why they died.</span> <span id="s784">You know, I’m – I’m now want to be more enveloped in – in their tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: Did you have an alienation from your foster parents after you came to the United States, or even before?</span></p> <p><span id="s786">A: I’ve, I guess, been more emotionally distant than an only child ought to be.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: What should an only child ought to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Well, you know, people who loved you and cared for you all your life, I owe them –</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: It sounds as –</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: – real loyalty.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Well, it sounds like that’s one of the thing – the real strong threads that has run through, is that you owe them gratitude.</span> <span id="s792">And in the normal sense of, when a child is born, you don’t ask to be born.</span> <span id="s793">So, even though you’re given life, to your natural parents you would never say I – I owe you my life because you gave me life.</span></p> <p><span id="s794">A: I know, but they took me of free will, endangering their lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">Q: I know.</span> <span id="s796">I – I know.</span> <span id="s797">I know.</span> <span id="s798">We know the historical circumstances, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">A: And that’s – and that – and that’s where this is.</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: And I never had a chance to love my Mother and Daddy.</span> <span id="s802">And I don’t know that – I really don’t know that no – that completely trusting feeling that I think kids have with their parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Well, I’m not adopted, and I am an only child.</span> <span id="s804">And I have a very fraught relationship sometimes with my parents.</span> <span id="s805">I wouldn’t say it’s completely trusting.</span> <span id="s806">I love them dearly, I know they love me dearly.</span> <span id="s807">We’ve had our issues, you know?</span> <span id="s808">But I’ve never had to – I’ve never had that feeling that I n – I need –</span></p> <p><span id="s809">A: Owe them.</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: – I – I owe them a deep gratitude.</span> <span id="s811">Of course I do.</span> <span id="s812">Of course I do because without them I would be nothing, but do you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s813">That sort of thing that I wouldn't be able to say the truth about what I needed to quite – to such an extent.</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: Well – enough, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s816">Did you ever after – after you came to the United States, did you ever have any follow up conversations, or try to have follow up conversations with them about who am I, and who – who am I, where did I come from, what were the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Right.</span> <span id="s818">We ha – I have – you know what, I would do that every few years for awhile, and I was always rebuffed.</span> <span id="s819">You’re too young, you don’t need to know that, you know.</span> <span id="s820">You belong to us, and – almost like, well, if you’re asking questions like that, then we’re not meeting your needs, and I certainly wanted them t-to think –</span></p> <p><span id="s821">Q: That you were meeting –</span></p> <p><span id="s822">A: – that they were meeting my needs, because they were doing, physically, all they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s823">Q: Did you end up living in Hoben – Hoboken, New Jersey, or did you move anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s824">A: Oh no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s825">Q: What happened after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s826">A: We lived in Park Ridge, New Jersey, because that’s where my sponsor – our sponsor lived.</span> <span id="s827">Well, come to find out in – not until 2000, that he was a distant relative, sor – so my biological family, distant as they were, did still care for me, and did still, you know, help to establish me an-and keep me safe, and knew where I was – where I was at, for awhile any – anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Did you – and you had that feeling from them, even if there was at a distance, there was this concern –</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: No.</span> <span id="s830">No, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: I – that’s my reaction later, knowing what they did, and they did it for this little girl that was the only survivor of that generation.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Did more – did more of the family die than your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Yeah, both sets of grandparents, Mother was one of four, their families.</span> <span id="s835">I had three little cousins that – you know, they did the normal thing.</span> <span id="s836">What happens when a thunderstorm, the kid comes running to you, you know, you –</span></p> <p><span id="s837">Q: You hold them.</span></p> <p><span id="s838">A: – you hold them, and you, when there’s danger, you all go through it together.</span> <span id="s839">Mother and Daddy were very unusual in that unselfish act that they –</span></p> <p><span id="s840">Q: To give you up.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">A: [indecipherable] to give me up.</span> <span id="s842">It took me a lot of years to forgive them for not taking a chance on life.</span> <span id="s843">See, when I first beg – got to thinking about it, gosh, they were young people, they have just been married, and first child, why aren’t they going to hiding?</span> <span id="s844">You know, they – why did they go –</span></p> <p><span id="s845">Q: And you never knew the answer.</span> <span id="s846">Or did you?</span></p> <p><span id="s847">A: No, I didn't get the answer, but the more I read, and I ki – I read Holocaust memoirs, you know, 10 to one to a novel, that I realize they wouldn’t have had a chance.</span> <span id="s848">You know, there were so many people that were picked up, and you know, that was the end of them, and you know, you read, they didn’t even – even bother using bullets on little kids.</span> <span id="s849">You know, to think that I was spared from that.</span> <span id="s850">That I’m the matriarch of a new family, you know.</span> <span id="s851">We have [indecipherable] and five grandchildren and it’s amazing, you know, that – that that was made possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s852">Q: Through that one gesture.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">A: And the gesture of that whole unique unit that kept me safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: The last sense I have, and we’re going chronologically is that you’re now in the United States, you’re in New Jersey, in another town.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s856">Q: What did your foster father do?</span> <span id="s857">What did –</span></p> <p><span id="s858">A: Okay, he went back into cabinetmaking.</span> <span id="s859">He worked – it was really funny – Mom became lingual much faster than he did.</span> <span id="s860">I became lingual in three months, I’m told.</span> <span id="s861">But he worked with some Swedes, and guess what they talked [indecipherable] you know.</span> <span id="s862">And Mom just threw herself in there, she was good, you know.</span> <span id="s863">She start the sentence in English and end up in Dutch.</span> <span id="s864">And this is the first time in her life that she worked, you know.</span> <span id="s865">At that time Dutch women [indecipherable] were housewives.</span> <span id="s866">So, she ended up becoming a dietician.</span> <span id="s867">Yeah, she worked in school, and even with her half English they sent her to – to dietician school, and she was a great cook.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: How long did you live at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: Until I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: Okay, and so that was when?</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: At 22, I guess.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: Did you go to university?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: I went to business college in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">A: When I graduated high school I used to commute into Manhattan, and from there I met Ron at the si – at the place where I worked.</span> <span id="s876">He worked as an outside person, engineer, and I worked inside, and we used to talk on the phone, and that’s how we got together, and got married in ’62.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s878">Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yeah, 46 years ago.</span> <span id="s880">My baby just turned 40, can you imagine?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yeah, Elise(ph) turned 40 this year.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: And how did your life change after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s884">A: Well, my own – my – my Clara, my Shifra life really was moved to the back burner.</span> <span id="s885">I had family [indecipherable] I had things to do.</span> <span id="s886">Thought about it, but had no time to do anything.</span> <span id="s887">I did one time follow up some through – through the mail.</span> <span id="s888">But just like before when I used to ask Mom and Pop and got no answer, that would set me way back to try to do that again.</span> <span id="s889">So it –</span></p> <p><span id="s890">Q: Did you share this?</span></p> <p><span id="s891">A: – took awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s892">Q: Did you share these kinds of pains with anybody else, that you wanted to know more and –</span></p> <p><span id="s893">A: Ron.</span> <span id="s894">Ron knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s895">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s897">Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s898">That’s – you know, he’s – he’s my friend as well as my husband, he’s –</span></p> <p><span id="s899">Q: That’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s900">A: – been very – yeah, he’s been very understanding.</span> <span id="s901">But no, there wasn’t – I’ve never been to a professional or anything like that, just – I’ve never been to a professional or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s902">Q: When did – when – it sounds like at some point there was a breakthrough, where you found out more information, where you found out more.</span> <span id="s903">So let’s bring that story to that point.</span> <span id="s904">Can you tell us about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s905">A: Well, first we need to talk about 1987.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">Q: Okay, let’s talk about –</span></p> <p><span id="s907">A: That’s when I received a front page of a newspaper from Holland, from my girlfriend Willy(ph) who I’d been corresponding with all these years.</span> <span id="s908">It was a big picture of me with that doll carriage.</span> <span id="s909">And it had been all over the newspapers in Holland.</span> <span id="s910">Mr. Henkes had – had [indecipherable] saying, what happened to Clara?</span> <span id="s911">He knew that I went to the States, but didn’t know anything else.</span> <span id="s912">Was I happy, was – did I have a family?</span> <span id="s913">He was well into his 80s then, and his doctor suggested that, you know, bec – if he’s mental about it, would he get an answer?</span> <span id="s914">And sure enough, I understand that he, in the follow up article that they have, it says the phone rang off the wall for days.</span> <span id="s915">And –</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: You mean there were lots of Claras?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: No, lots of people who knew about me.</span> <span id="s918">Yeah, because van der Kaden’s name was in there.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: And so Willy(ph) sent it to me, but other people sent these articles to Mom and Pop, they didn’t know my address, to pass on.</span> <span id="s921">Which, of course, didn’t happen.</span> <span id="s922">But my girlfriend Willy(ph) did.</span> <span id="s923">And at that time she said, you know, I’ve known your situation from since you were a little girl, but we were sworn to se – all of us – whoever that means – were sworn to secrecy, so we never said anything, but we think – I think this is important enough for you to – for me to break that vow.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">Q: And her – and she broke the vo – in – in sending you that article, and in giving you his name, that’s the vow she was breaking?</span></p> <p><span id="s925">A: Right.</span> <span id="s926">And so it was within a year that I went to Holland.</span> <span id="s927">It happened to be our 25th we-wedding anniversary, so I didn’t need an excuse.</span> <span id="s928">But Pop knew.</span> <span id="s929">He said, you know, you will never get to the bottom of this.</span> <span id="s930">And I don’t know what that meant, but it was part of their thinking, you know, the less you know, the better.</span> <span id="s931">You start digging, you’re never gonna be satisfied.</span> <span id="s932">Which I am not, but I’m more satisfied than I was, you know.</span> <span id="s933">I always used to call it my other self.</span> <span id="s934">That’s not my other self, it’s me.</span> <span id="s935">It’s also me.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: So I went to see him, and Willy(ph) arranged that.</span> <span id="s938">And at that time his sister gave me a precious gift.</span> <span id="s939">It was a necklace, they were Jerusalem beads, like an every day kind of necklace, not the precious jewels that – not the garnets I have.</span> <span id="s940">And she said, your mother took this from around her neck when she got on the train.</span> <span id="s941">Well, I can’t even wear it any more, I’m so scared it will break.</span> <span id="s942">I had a picture taken over there, just red and black painted beads.</span> <span id="s943">And, you know, it is – it’s just a treasure.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s946">Q: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">Q: And what could he – what did he tell you?</span> <span id="s949">What gaps did he start filling in?</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: I didn’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: What did you talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: I was under the cloud of do not ask.</span> <span id="s953">I was not there – and of course I could kick myself, he died about four years later.</span> <span id="s954">I never – we had – was a very superficial visit.</span> <span id="s955">He took me – my daughter Elise(ph) has a fit over this.</span> <span id="s956">He took me up to his studio at – lined up three paintings, and said choose one.</span> <span id="s957">I turned him down.</span> <span id="s958">I did, he’s famous.</span> <span id="s959">Becau – I wasn’t thinking.</span> <span id="s960">I didn't want to show up – they knew he was – Mom and Pop knew he was a painter.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: You didn’t want to look –</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: I was still cover – I was still covering.</span> <span id="s963">I didn’t want to look like I had visited him.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s965">You didn’t want them to know that you had seen him.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: You know, I think of myself as pretty cowardly now when I – when I think back, and say –</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: I wouldn’t – I wouldn’t call it cowardly.</span> <span id="s968">I – I’d call it like you had been put in chains, and you were – and you had been put in such invisible chains, and you were trying to break free from them, but being invisible, you never know when they’re locked up again.</span> <span id="s969">I wouldn’t blame yourself for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s970">A: Well, there is a lot that, you know, as I said, Aunt Alice is the only person I ever met that knew Daddy.</span> <span id="s971">It turns out that Dolf Henkes and Daddy were close friends because they both painted.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: But you didn’t know that they were close friends at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: Oh no, I didn’t find that out until I – 2002 I put it together.</span> <span id="s974">I’ll get to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: All right, so I went back to Holland, and with no painting, but Willy(ph) and I then had a more open communication, because I could ask her questions, she – she did quite a bit of research for me initially then.</span> <span id="s977">Like, I didn't know who else died, and that all, you know, [indecipherable] opened up.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: So she fu – so she did some of the research into the family?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s980">Q: Did she re-contact those maiden aunts?</span> <span id="s981">Did she talk to –</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: No.</span> <span id="s985">And it’s mainly because it was – Daddy’s side was more visible, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: Did he cli – but no – the Aunt S-Sinke(ph), what was her name, that you used to visit?</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well, she came – they came to live in the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">Q: Oh, that’s right, that’s right, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s989">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s990">Q: I’m sorry, I forgot about that part.</span></p> <p><span id="s991">A: But I never n – I could never tell her, or I never knew until after she died.</span> <span id="s992">So, yeah, all this is –</span></p> <p><span id="s993">Q: So how do you take it forward?</span> <span id="s994">So you’ve got – you’re in Holland, you meet him, but you don’t –</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: You go home and you leave it on the back burner again, cause you’re very busy and you have children to bring up, and this was an episode that you don’t deal with, and I didn’t deal with it until 2000.</span> <span id="s996">I had a –</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: What happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s998">A: I had a telephone call – thank God for answering machines.</span> <span id="s999">We weren’t home, second time we weren’t home, third time was a charm.</span> <span id="s1000">Telephone call said, my name is Bev, I think we may be cousins.</span> <span id="s1001">One of those tremors went through me again.</span> <span id="s1002">And when we connected, yes we are cousins.</span> <span id="s1003">She is the younger daughter of the family that left in ’38.</span> <span id="s1004">And of course she came over the following weekend and we sat up and talked, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: And did they live in New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: They live in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: They live in Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1009">Q: So how did you con –</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">A: So the next year we went to Israel, and it was so funny.</span> <span id="s1011">I see Jocelyn, whose oh, that’s the one who’s been wearing my clothes.</span> <span id="s1012">Because they used to – after the war, I got all these wonderful care packages, I was the best dressed kid in elementary school because they used to send Jossy’s(ph) outgrown, hardly worn dresses to Sonja.</span> <span id="s1013">And they used to hear, let’s put this in the box for Sonja.</span> <span id="s1014">Who’s Sonja, you know.</span> <span id="s1015">But Mom was keeping in touch with them, they were writing letters back and forth.</span> <span id="s1016">So the package comes and I’m wearing these pretty clothes from my cousin.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: And you never knew what –</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">Q: And you never knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: Never knew it until, you know, until Bev tells me all – all this stuff that’s going on.</span> <span id="s1021">And that her grandfather van Helger(ph) was our sponsor.</span> <span id="s1022">And it’s – is it confusing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1023">Q: Well, it’s perplexing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1024">A: Okay, may –</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: It’s extraordinarily – no, no, no, not confusing as far as who was who –</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: Who fits where.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: But it is perplexing in its intensity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: It’s a good job, and –</span></p> <p><span id="s1029">Q: To keeping this from you, in the name of protecting you, and it certainly doesn’t sound like that.</span> <span id="s1030">I mean, I can only imagine – I don’t – as I’ve mentioned before, our job is to kind of be neutral and let you [indecipherable] talk –</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: – and – and so, but the feeling that I get is if it had been me, I would have been livid to the sky that somebody –</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">A: Good girls don’t get mad.</span> <span id="s1034">They don’t slam doors, they don’t say anything rude.</span> <span id="s1035">They don’t even go to their rooms to sulk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: When did Mom and Pop die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: Mom died last August two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">Q: So, very recently?</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1040">And Pop died about seven years before that.</span> <span id="s1041">And I brought her to an – a nursing home close to where we lived so I could go see her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: Be with her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1044">But it’s something we could never talk about, and she went to her grave thinking that I didn’t care about my birth family, because by the time 2000 - 2002 came around, she wasn’t all that cognizant, so I didn’t have to answer for my actions.</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">Q: But it’s all so – how could someone not know that that’s important to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1047">M-May – you know, early psychology didn’t think that kids had – you know, when I’ve been to the – the hidden children conference, and we all say the same thing, we heard, oh, you were too young to know anything.</span> <span id="s1048">So it didn’t happen?</span> <span id="s1049">They didn’t believe in the subconscious at the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1050">Q: Well, it sounds – even if you don’t have memories of the time, you do have memories of feeling different.</span> <span id="s1051">And of hearing these voi – these conversations, over-overhearing them when you’re walking down the street and they say to you, or you hear the grownups talking, did they come back, no they didn’t come back.</span> <span id="s1052">Or that you’re different at school.</span> <span id="s1053">I mean, that’s conscious.</span> <span id="s1054">That’s where questions could start arising, and a child would want to know, why are these quest – why is this situation there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Well, they were very – they were suppressed, yeah, very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">Q: When you – when you got that call from Bev, and she said I think we’re cousins, to me it sounds like these – you know, the past has broken through, finally.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">A: Right.</span> <span id="s1058">And it’s amazing that she got my telephone number, cause she got it from Mom.</span> <span id="s1059">Now, Mom didn't know who was calling, I don’t imagine, because that’s when the yarn started to unwind.</span> <span id="s1060">We went to Israel, and I spoke to Aunt Alice, her mother, who is the only person I’ve spoken to who knew Daddy as a person.</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">Q: So what did she tell you about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">A: Well, she used to tell me what they used to do, they used to go on bike trips together.</span> <span id="s1063">And I – again, put a little piece of the puzzle together, rightly or wrongly, they used to go to Seders together at Grandpa Abe’s.</span> <span id="s1064">You know, they had the common grandfather.</span> <span id="s1065">And she said, we were so bored, we didn’t understand a word they were saying.</span> <span id="s1066">Was a large family, we kids used to sit on the end.</span> <span id="s1067">Well, he was conducting it in Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1068">He wore a hat over his yarmulke.</span> <span id="s1069">That also is either Conservative – probably Conservative.</span> <span id="s1070">So, makes you wonder how far did the apple fall from the tree?</span> <span id="s1071">When Daddy picked Shifra as my name, did he just like it, or did he know the Bible, the Old Testament?</span> <span id="s1072">Did he attend Torah readings?</span> <span id="s1073">You know, was he part of a minyan?</span> <span id="s1074">All those things that I don’t think she would have known, but the – but all the other people that crossed my path could have asked me questions that I didn’t know I had until I was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Q: It sounds like also, and forgive me, I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but you had mentioned something about this before, is that you regained a part of who you are.</span> <span id="s1076">You talked before about having different selves.</span> <span id="s1077">Is that what happened in 2000?</span> <span id="s1078">Is that some –</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">A: Oh definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Q: – moral you have integrated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: I allowed integration.</span> <span id="s1082">There’s not much of it.</span> <span id="s1083">You know, every year or so I learn some – I come to the hidden children conference, I might find another distant cousin.</span> <span id="s1084">I did the last – two years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s1086">A: When we were in Detroit, and Elise(ph), our youngest daughter came – came with me, I asked her to attend as a second generation.</span> <span id="s1087">And she went to a workshop and explained why she as there, and she said, you know, this is – I’m the daughter of – and she mentioned my name and the man in the corner there jumped out of a chair, ran up to her and said, oh, yeah, I have that name in my family, you know, a-and so, you know, he’s another distant, distant cousin.</span> <span id="s1088">But we see – we saw each other this weekend [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">Q: I’ve come to the point in the interview where I ask, is there anything that we haven’t talked about that you think is important?</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">A: I’m very intent on seeing that my grandchildren have a much smoother – become knowledgeable about the Holocaust through me, about the family, not necessarily the horrors of the Holocaust, in a much more gradual and open way.</span> <span id="s1093">And – and I’ve started that with my – our 16 year old granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1094">Emily is doing a school project where she’s using –</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: – my story as an example, and I’ve – Elise(ph) has been very active in getting me involved in the school system where she is.</span> <span id="s1097">And the first time I spoke to class, where my eldest grandson is, those chills went through me again.</span> <span id="s1098">And there I am speaking to children.</span> <span id="s1099">The kid who shouldn’t be there and his younger brother Seth is the one I really – it suddenly happened.</span> <span id="s1100">I used to go and take care of him while his mom worked.</span> <span id="s1101">I’d see him every now and again.</span> <span id="s1102">And even by the time he was two years old, he was such a clinger.</span> <span id="s1103">He just loved his mommy and he – she used to have to sneak out the door for me to take care of him.</span> <span id="s1104">And I suddenly realized what – what a sacrifice that must have been.</span> <span id="s1105">I didn’t get it until I was a grandparent.</span> <span id="s1106">What a sacrifice that must have been to turn your child and give – and give it life that way.</span> <span id="s1107">Cause [indecipherable] to that extent, but –</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">Q: But yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: – yeah, she tried to –</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: She took it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: Yeah, but she took it.</span> <span id="s1112">I mean, that’s amazing.</span> <span id="s1113">And so now, you know, I speak to schools not just to tell my story, but to say that everybody can take a stand, and they need to take it for the good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Did you talk – did you share with your daughters, as you were going through the [indecipherable] steps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: I had Mom and Pop tell them.</span> <span id="s1116">They knew nothing until they were about 10 and 13 years old, and I said to Mom, giving them another opportunity to open up, actually, and it was pretty much the same way, a very – a snippet – you know, well, we took care of your mommy, she’s our daughter, during the war – her parents didn’t come back from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1117">That was about it.</span> <span id="s1118">So when Elise(ph) and I went to Detroit and we went to the – to the Holocaust museum at the end of the – the session, I went for a book.</span> <span id="s1119">I said, I’m gonna – will you be all right if I got this for Riley(ph)?</span> <span id="s1120">And she was – her oldest son – and she was rightly very concerned, and said, you mean you’re gonna hand him a book and tell him about his heritage?</span> <span id="s1121">I said, oh no, this is to help me mature him into it.</span> <span id="s1122">An – and I’ve been to the gift shop at the museum and I’m continuing that with – as the children grow older, so they can take pride in their –</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Yes, of course.</span> <span id="s1124">I’m – I’m speechless.</span> <span id="s1125">Thank you.</span> <span id="s1126">Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1127">I think you’ve had such a tough row to hoe, because the shadows that you have were so invisible.</span> <span id="s1128">You know, when you talk through the Holocaust, you know that there’s a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1129">You know that there’s a horror.</span> <span id="s1130">You know that there’s – but all of these other things were invisible, to try and pull away those veils.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: You know, in th – and the Jewish community does not recognize that hidden children have this emotional invisible burden, that most of us are carrying for one reason or the other.</span> <span id="s1132">If you don’t have a number on your arm, you’re in a different classification.</span> <span id="s1133">And I think that’s probably going to change as the older folks, you know, pass away, it’s the hidden children that are going to carry on, and perhaps our children will carry on the tradition of – of teaching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: Well Shifra, thank you very, very much.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">A: Well, you’re welcome.</span> <span id="s1136">You were easy to talk to, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Thank you, but not a very easy topic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: No, no it isn’t, and it doesn’t get easier sometimes.</span> <span id="s1139">Sometimes I don’t lose it, like today.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: This concludes the United States
