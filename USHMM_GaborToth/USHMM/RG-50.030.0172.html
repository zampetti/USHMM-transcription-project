<span id="s497">She said oh my God, Frieda is here.</span> <span id="s498">First...first she looked at I don't have my hair and she says oh you poor thing.</span> <span id="s499">(Crying) The oldest sister got up...Marianne.</span> <span id="s500">She also the same thing.</span> <span id="s501">My mom said are you hungry.</span> <span id="s502">I said no.</span> <span id="s503">She said well go to sleep and go to rest.</span> <span id="s504">Tomorrow we'll talk.</span> <span id="s505">And next day my father was the worst problem.</span> <span id="s506">I was scared of my father.</span> <span id="s507">He said oh my God, what you did to us.</span> <span id="s508">I said yes, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: Did anything else happen that next day that you remember?</span></p>

answer.</span> <span id="s517">I know it cost him a lot of money and a lot of whatever to get me out because it was a miracle.</span> <span id="s518">My hair grew back.</span> <span id="s519">I was ashamed to go some place, naturally, you know that some outside people don't see me and then one day my mom said well, your hair getting a little longer now.</span> <span id="s520">You should have a permanent now, you know...the permanent came out but I couldn't go to the town where I come from.</span> <span id="s521">I was so embarrassed, so my mom sent me to Wels so</span></p> <p><span id="s522">01:44:00 Mom said take some... at that time, you know, there was food shortage and things like that...take some butter and some meat with you and give it to the some kind of strange, you know, whatever lady to tell her to do your hair.</span> <span id="s523">(Crying) That's what I did.</span> <span id="s524">And I looked a little better already.</span> <span id="s525">(Crying) And then I put myself together at home...kept busy working.</span> <span id="s526">My sisters were nice.</span> <span id="s527">They accept me again, but the outside people...some outside people were bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: What did they do?</span> <span id="s529">What did they do?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: Well, they just do angry...actually they do nothing to me.</span> <span id="s531">They just...when they saw me, oh...there she is, there she is.</span> <span id="s532">She was...she was in a concentration camp because of a Pole, you know.</span> <span id="s533">You know, it was like a big, awful big thing, you know, and it was just...I put just my life in from one day to the next, you know, because it seemed so empty, so worthless.</span> <span id="s534">I didn't know what happened to Julian.</span> <span id="s535">I don't know, so...I didn't know what's going to happen so I just leave it up to God.</span> <span id="s536">Then one day that other Pole, Franz, he told me he got a card from Julian.</span> <span id="s537">I said oh my God, where is he?</span> <span id="s538">He says here, here's the card and it was written in German.</span> <span id="s539">I said Flossenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s540">01:46:40 Flossenberg?</span> <span id="s541">I don't even know such a concentration camp is Flossenberg.</span> <span id="s542">And then I thought my God, I wonder, you know, how he is there.</span> <span id="s543">My God, you know, to help him or something.</span> <span id="s544">So in time being, I I put myself together and I thought I'm going to send him a package, but I had to talk to Franz first.</span> <span id="s545">Franz, you help me?</span> <span id="s546">He said yes.</span> <span id="s547">But uh you no can...I I going to make a package but I have to take everything on my own.</span> <span id="s548">That time we we had...on the farm we had over six hundred trees...apple trees in that time was...pick pears and apples, you know...everything fresh picked.</span> <span id="s549">I though my God a package like that would get there that they no rot, you know, whatever...how long they get it...everything fresh picked.</span> <span id="s550">And uh I smuggled in my room a huge box and I..</span> <span id="s551">.</span> <span id="s552">the the apples were there and the huge pears, the sugar pears.</span> <span id="s553">I wrapped every apple and every pear in a in a piece of newspaper and put it in a box, one after the other, and there was a big pail of onions in the room also to dry out and garlic.</span> <span id="s554">I put everything...filled every little hole, til it was full.</span> <span id="s555">(Crying) I put it together, carried it downstairs at night for Franz to take it in his room and the next day I..</span> <span id="s556">.</span> <span id="s557">there was a a a non-working day.</span> <span id="s558">I told him that he got to take this package to Wiesenkirchen...that's very far away.</span> <span id="s559">It's about ten</span></p> <p><span id="s560">01:49:00 miles from there, maybe even more, on the post office because the other post office might know what something fishy going on, you know, some somebody send a package to to to Flossenberg, but I put on uh front this friend Franz name to go for the address, for the...you know, for who sent the package.</span> <span id="s561">And uh Franz said I not going to do that for nothing.</span> <span id="s562">What you give me for that?</span> <span id="s563">What do you want?</span> <span id="s564">He liked to drink schnapps, so had to give him...Franz...a pitcher and fill it up with schnapps and give it to him.</span> <span id="s565">He was a good guy, but he used to like to drink and he did.</span> <span id="s566">Took that schnapps that he carried this package to the post office and sent it to Julian.</span> <span id="s567">After the war, after when Julian got out, he told me he received this package.</span> <span id="s568">You know, I was wondering if he received it or not.</span> <span id="s569">If</span></p> <p><span id="s570">01:50:00 they found out that I did it, because they were saying when I left the concentration camp, if you stay in contact with Julian that you...any...make any move...you going to be black and blue and a head shorter, and I always remembered that, you know, but I did put this package together for Julian, you know, so it was a a big chance to take.</span> <span id="s571">My sisters didn't know.</span> <span id="s572">Nobody knew.</span> <span id="s573">Just Franz and me knew it, that I sent this package.</span> <span id="s574">And uh when it come to the time when the war got worse and worse during the end, a lot of time I was...I I almost didn't hope that he...Julian is still alive.</span> <span id="s575">But I keep praying and hoping that he is alive.</span> <span id="s576">(Crying) And all of a sudden the war was over.</span> <span id="s577">God...how we start...how I find out, how can I find out if he make it.</span> <span id="s578">I know his mother was from Tarnow somewhere.</span> <span id="s579">I got...I got to find
