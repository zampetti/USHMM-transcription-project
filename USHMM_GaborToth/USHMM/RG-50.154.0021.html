<html><body><p><span id="s1">Interviewer: We are at the home of Mr. Nathanson, Frank Nathanson.</span> <span id="s2">And I am Rena Rothlein and Mr. Nathanson is a liberator.</span> <span id="s3">And we are going to interview him this afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">F.N.: No, I am not a liberator.</span></p> <p><span id="s5">Q: “What do you consider yourself to be?”</span></p> <p><span id="s6">A: Well, when you say liberator, do you mean a liberator of camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s8">A: We did not liberate a camp, not a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s9">But I went to one.</span></p> <p><span id="s10">Q: Let’s start from the beginning.</span></p> <p><span id="s11">A: I was from the 76th Infantry Division, 304th Infantry Battalion, F-Company.</span> <span id="s12">And the reason that I called Muriel was that I think there was something in the article that asked information if anybody knew anything about people who had helped Jews during the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">-Stop in Tape- Alright, as we approached the Rhine River, we stopped in a town and when we would do that, we would put German people out of their homes, it was “Mein en soldaten schlafen en diesen hausen, alles wohen en diesen hausen…”</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Translate that please.</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: All the people in this house…My soldiers are going to sleep in this house.</span> <span id="s16">All the people in this house must get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: What date was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s18">A: Oh God.</span> <span id="s19">I may be able to pick it up in my battalion book.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s22">When did we cross the Rhine River?</span> <span id="s23">I would say March…</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Of 1940?</span> <span id="s25">...</span></p> <p><span id="s26">1945, the year the war ended.</span> <span id="s27">At any rate, we put these people out and we took over the house.</span> <span id="s28">And that was just my own little squad.</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What was your position?</span></p> <p><span id="s30">A: I was just a PFC. And I was the battalion runner at that time, assistant gunner on a light 30 machine gun.</span> <span id="s31">There was…to make sure that these people stayed out of trouble and off the streets.</span> <span id="s32">They could only come out once in the morning for an hour and come back to their homes to get pots, pans, clothes whatever they wanted and once again in the evening just before sundown.</span> <span id="s33">Other than that, if they were seen on the street, they’d be shot.</span> <span id="s34">So two men came back up to this house.</span> <span id="s35">Now from the interior of the house it was evident that this was the home of a Catholic family, with all icons around, the… Mary, Crucifixes…</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What town was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: I’ll have to really try and find that out.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: It was in the Rhine area?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: It was very close to the Rhine River.</span> <span id="s40">And the whole town was apparently Catholic, we didn’t know it.</span> <span id="s41">But small town.</span> <span id="s42">In any rate, in the morning two men came back up to this town.</span> <span id="s43">There was a picture of a young man in a German Navy uniform.</span> <span id="s44">They came in and they asked me my name.</span> <span id="s45">And I could understand a bit of German then, if they would talk slowly.</span> <span id="s46">I gave them my name and they looked at me funny.</span> <span id="s47">They stated to get a bit excited and they looked at me again and I said, “Ich bein Jude,” “I am a Jew.”</span> <span id="s48">They got very excited and they wanted me to come with them.</span> <span id="s49">And we walked down dome streets and went to this house, they went in and they jabbered very excitedly to the women in the house.</span> <span id="s50">And they dragged me up to the attic, moved furniture, rolled back some rug on the floor, pulled up floor boards, almost like in the movies, and reached down and pulled out Torah, prayer shawls, all the stuff of their religion.</span> <span id="s51">And they were talking so fast, I couldn’t follow anything.</span> <span id="s52">But it was obvious what had happened.</span> <span id="s53">So I took them up to my commanding officer, a man named Sidney Rider, a captain and he spoke German like a native.</span> <span id="s54">And he said, the man says they’ve been hidden through the war by the Catholic people in this town.</span> <span id="s55">The picture that I saw…</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: These two people?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: They were two couples.</span> <span id="s58">The whole town was in on it though, they had to be because they had escaped the war.</span> <span id="s59">The boy was there.</span> <span id="s60">He was serving in the German Submarine Corp and that’s a ruse that they had to carry out unless they gave themselves away.</span> <span id="s61">So there…</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: But they were a Jewish couple?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: They were a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s64">Two Jewish families being hidden by the town, this Catholic town.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: Now wait, the people who came to you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Were Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: It was two Jewish couples, four people?</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s70">(I thought they had just hidden the Jewish symbols.)</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: No.</span> <span id="s72">No, they actually hid the couples.</span> <span id="s73">They had not turned them in.</span> <span id="s74">They had not…they had gone out of their way to protect these people.</span> <span id="s75">And they had given them all the effects in this house to make it look like another Catholic home.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: (Remarkable)</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: So, throughout the war…and their son had been, I don’t know if he was drafted or signed up or what…but obviously all young men that were capable in their country were in service.</span> <span id="s78">So their son…</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: That was one couple’s son.</span> <span id="s80">There was one offspring out of both couples?</span></p> <p><span id="s81">A: As far as I know.</span> <span id="s82">We didn’t stay long enough to get a lot of information, by the next day we were gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">Q: Had they been natives of this town?</span> <span id="s84">Or how did they get there?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: I don’t know that.</span> <span id="s86">But I think they were natives of the town.</span> <span id="s87">If I could contact Sidney Rider, he may have remembered more because he talked to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Was Sidney rider also Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s90">He had been a first lieutenant in the town of Shpicer, we lost all of our officers.</span> <span id="s91">In the midst of a fire fight, he was sent over from B-Company to take over my company, F-Company.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">Q: What else were these people able to tell Sidney Rider that he was able to later tell you?</span></p> <p><span id="s93">A: Well, I don’t know the detail.</span> <span id="s94">All that I can tell you was that just by sheer accident I had picked that house for us to stay in.</span> <span id="s95">And I threw these people out and when they came back in the morning, they looked at me and they asked my name.</span> <span id="s96">And when I gave it to them, they must have been pretty sure I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s97">And so…they didn’t ask, but I told them that I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s98">That used to scare most of them half to death, they didn’t know what to make of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Why would it scare them?</span></p> <p><span id="s100">A: If you were a German in World War II and you know what had gone on in Germany, wouldn’t you be frightened.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: They were Germans</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: Oh yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">Q: Oh, Chemitz is in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">A: Chemitz is in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: I see.</span> <span id="s106">And the children…</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: It’s now East Germany.</span> <span id="s108">But this was all over Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">Q: And the children that they took in could have been from all over the rest of Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">A: Any place that they picked them up.</span> <span id="s111">In their invasion through Poland, Russia…remember the Russians…I mean the Germans got to the outskirts of Stalingrad, to the outskirts of Moscow, Leningrad…</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: Were these children forced upon theses families?</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Oh no.</span> <span id="s114">No.</span> <span id="s115">no.</span> <span id="s116">Their sons and able bodied men were in the service.</span> <span id="s117">This was replacement labor only it came free and you could treat it like an animal.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Was this mostly farm labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: They worked in factories, they worked in farms, they worked anywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: What became of those children?</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: Well, that’s my next story.</span> <span id="s122">As I say about two weeks after the end of the war, somebody from battalion headquarters came and told our company commander they wanted four guys from each infantry company to go down to the Chemnitz and go to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s123">Total message.</span> <span id="s124">Go down to the railroad station.</span> <span id="s125">So we hopped on a jeep, they took us down the Chemnitz.</span> <span id="s126">That was a pretty big city…and we had a big fight for it.</span> <span id="s127">When we got there, there was a hell of a long freight train.</span> <span id="s128">As a matter of fact there were two of them.</span> <span id="s129">And there were…it seemed like thousands of people, milling around...civilians.</span> <span id="s130">These were Poles, Russians, Slovenians…all the displaced people.</span> <span id="s131">Slave labor again.</span> <span id="s132">And they were going to be repatriated to their own countries.</span> <span id="s133">This was a move by Allied Military Government, but Allied Military Government was so disorganized, I don’t think they knew much about what they were doing.</span> <span id="s134">So we said, “What are we supposed to do?”</span> <span id="s135">And they said, “We want one man for every two box cars.”</span> <span id="s136">And they’re going to put the…they threw some straw in the box cars.</span> <span id="s137">They issued them some rations from a German army warehouse that they had taken…black bread, some cheese, Ersatz coffee.</span> <span id="s138">And we said, “Are we going to be gone overnight?”</span> <span id="s139">And they said, “Yea.”</span> <span id="s140">Nobody had told us.</span> <span id="s141">So I hopped up to our battalion headquarters and got a case of K-rations and brought it back down to the train.</span> <span id="s142">The train…I’ll show you on a map where we went…from Chemnitz we were headed…we didn’t know where we were headed…but we ended up that night in Weimar.</span> <span id="s143">The end of the…what…the 2nd Right.</span> <span id="s144">And stopped in the freight yards there…the marshalling yards.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: Let me interrupt for a minute…How many freight trains?</span> <span id="s146">...there were just two of you?</span> <span id="s147">And you were…</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Two of us…there was…two from my company, two from rifle company…</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Okay, right…there were others…you each had one box car?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: There was one American solider for every other box car…</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: Every other box car…</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: Each one of us had two we were supposed to be in charge of.</span> <span id="s153">What we were supposed to do, nobody had the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s154">We only had one or two lieutenants with us and they didn’t have the slightest idea.</span> <span id="s155">But they said, “These people are being repatriated to their countries and you’re going to go with them to their overnight stop off.”</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Were they already in the cars when you arrived?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: No, they were just milling around.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: And so they went into the cars haphazardly?</span> <span id="s159">They weren’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Pretty well…so many to a car.</span> <span id="s161">They just opened up the…the doors were opened, food was shoved in.</span> <span id="s162">And they told them so many to a car.</span> <span id="s163">I would guess there were about 20 or 30 to a car.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: So there was room to sit down and lie down?</span></p> <p><span id="s165">A: You could sit down.</span> <span id="s166">You could lie in the straw.</span> <span id="s167">But the train, when it progressed down the tracks…everything had been shot up and bombed out, so we would go, God knows how many miles and then the train would stop because the bridge would be out.</span> <span id="s168">Then it would backup and try another route.</span> <span id="s169">So it was three steps forward, two steps back, three steps forward.</span> <span id="s170">These people were told that if they had to relieve themselves don’t get more than a few yards from the train because they would never give them any signal or anything.</span> <span id="s171">As soon as the guy was ready to move, he would move.</span> <span id="s172">So, women, men, whatever…they’d just run out in these fields, relieve themselves and come running back…like a bunch of animals.</span> <span id="s173">We stopped over night and when we finally got there at apparently a large city with a big marshalling yard…a railroad marshalling yard.</span> <span id="s174">We slept in the box car overnight.</span> <span id="s175">They watched us eat K-Rations, we shared our K-Rations with them, which was amazing to them.</span> <span id="s176">In the morning, my buddy and I decided…stupid as it may sound…we went up and hauled the German out who was the engineer on the train and told him that if he left while we were gone, we’d catch him and we’d shoot him.</span> <span id="s177">We were still in our combat gear, dirty uniforms, we each had a 45 stuck in our belts and we went into town.</span> <span id="s178">Weimar had been turned into Allied Military Headquarters.</span> <span id="s179">So we saw the hotels they’d say, First 3-grade, non-coms, officers quarters, field grade officers only, correspondence, press, and we were like “Willy and Joe” so we snuck in the back of this place and they were cooking breakfast for them…eggs, fresh biscuits, sweet rolls…We emptied our canteens, stole some coffee, stole a big tray of these rolls and told the cooks, “You say anything and we’ll shoot you.”</span> <span id="s180">Went back to the marshalling yards.</span> <span id="s181">When the train started, we were no more than half hour away from Weimar.</span> <span id="s182">And we pulled up in a big long siding, along a big, long shed, a wooden shed.</span> <span id="s183">And we were told that’s where all these people would be…that was where they’re going to keep them to process them to wherever they were going.</span> <span id="s184">And as we started to get off the train, a young Polish 2nd lieutenant jumped up on the roof of one of the box cars…you know, with the cape and the little square hat with the tassel…and he was yelling, in German telling them, “Get back in, get back in.”</span></p> <p><span id="s185">Q: Why was he yelling?</span></p> <p><span id="s186">A: Trying to get them out, this argument was going on and finally one of the lieutenants pointed a 45 at him and said, “Get off the box car or we’ll shoot you off.”</span> <span id="s187">And then he came down and told us why, “Wait until you walk through the shed to the other side.”</span> <span id="s188">So we walked through…on the other…we were at Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s189">On the other side of the shed were the pictures that you see there.</span> <span id="s190">Long lines of bodies…a hundred yards long, stacked as high as your head, slicked down with lime.</span> <span id="s191">Special little stacks of babies bodies.</span> <span id="s192">Stacks of eye glasses.</span> <span id="s193">It was just a horror sight and by that time there were Allied Military Government people there.</span> <span id="s194">There were correspondents there.</span> <span id="s195">There were some civilians…that I couldn’t tell you what they were…some Germans, some not.</span> <span id="s196">Of course, the Germans all denied that they even knew this thing had existed.</span> <span id="s197">You could have smelled it from Weimar.</span> <span id="s198">They cremated the bodies there.</span> <span id="s199">You see one of them, sitting in an oven, he’s still in human form.</span> <span id="s200">But that was where…(In reference to some pictures the interviewer an interviewee are looking at: your top picture, that’s and incinerated body but not quite gone, that’s in an oven.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What was your reaction to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Horror.</span> <span id="s203">It was so terrible, you just couldn’t believe and you…it was almost beyond belief.</span> <span id="s204">You couldn’t…</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: And this was two weeks after the war ended and they were still…)</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Only they had them slicked down with lime by then… they were getting ready to cart them away…what was left.</span> <span id="s207">There were a few prisoners still there… in their prison garb, which was purple and white stripe.</span> <span id="s208">And one of them followed me around saying, pointing at himself, and saying, “cigar.”</span> <span id="s209">And I said, “I don’t have any cigars.”</span> <span id="s210">And I offered him cigarettes.</span> <span id="s211">And he said, “No, no Cigar.”</span> <span id="s212">And I said, “I smoke a pipe, see.”</span> <span id="s213">I showed him my pipe.</span> <span id="s214">He said, shook his head, “Cigar.”</span> <span id="s215">And at that time some correspondent cam by me and he laughed and he said, “He’s trying to tell you, he’s a gypsy.”</span> <span id="s216">Then it cam to me, cygonier is the female, cigar is a male gypsy.</span> <span id="s217">So once the camp was liberated, he was willing to stay and beg or do whatever.</span> <span id="s218">I don’t know what he wanted from me, but I thought he was trying to get a cigar.</span> <span id="s219">I was getting mad at him because he wouldn’t take the cigarettes and I didn’t offer him my pipe.</span></p> <p><span id="s220">Q: Before you got to Buchenwald, had you already heard about these type of situations?</span></p> <p><span id="s221">A: Yes…but, I’d never been to one.</span> <span id="s222">Now we…when you say liberators, yes we went through many small towns where there were mass burials, including some of our pilots that had been shot down.</span> <span id="s223">They’d just been thrown into mass graves.</span> <span id="s224">And others, where they had some time or the burgomeister of a town was smart enough to know we were on our way very shortly, they’d dig up these bodies, give them individual graves and put flowers down.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: The pilots?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s227">But it was strictly a lie.</span> <span id="s228">And others…we made the burgomeister, the officials of the town, the men… old, most of the were…get down in those graves and dig up those bodies.</span> <span id="s229">And they wanted to put gloves and rubber aprons on and we said, “Uh, uh, no way.</span> <span id="s230">You get in and you touch them.</span> <span id="s231">You put them there.”</span> <span id="s232">They were slime.</span> <span id="s233">That’s the beast of Buchenwald…that’s the German guard…that female…who would cut tattooed skin from human bodies to make lampshades.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: I thought it was a woman who did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s235">A: That is a woman.</span> <span id="s236">(Referring to pictures Interviewee had).</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: What happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s238">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s239">They kept pet lions there…they would cut up bodies and feed the lions the human meat.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: These people were still there when you took these pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: I haven’t the slightest idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: This isn’t your picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: I bought these from some guy at the camp.</span> <span id="s244">I didn’t have a camera or anything.</span> <span id="s245">Somebody had taken pictures and made some copies and that’s the original paper he had them folded up in.</span> <span id="s246">He was peddling them and I bought some.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: And this is one of the prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: This is one of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s249">This is what they looked like.</span> <span id="s250">They were alive but they looked dead.</span> <span id="s251">And some of them died when they fed them.</span> <span id="s252">Their systems couldn’t take it.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Poor heart.</span> <span id="s254">How long was the train trip?</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: For us, it was a full day, from morning to night before we got to Weimar.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: How many miles did you cover?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: 50 or 100 miles…Maybe there’s some scale on this thing (Referring to a map he is looking at.)</span> <span id="s258">When you’re a low life…</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: How old were you at this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: 21, 22 something like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Here’s where we were.</span> <span id="s262">That’s the city of Chemitz and there’s Weimar.</span> <span id="s263">It’s not a great distance.</span> <span id="s264">At Altenberg we had taken one of the last big German airports…all their fighters, bombers.</span> <span id="s265">There’s Leipzig, there’s Dresden.</span> <span id="s266">Chemnitz is south of it and half the distance between.</span> <span id="s267">We me the Russians at Mittweide.</span> <span id="s268">That’s as far as we could go.</span> <span id="s269">We were driving for Dresden and from there they said no more advance.</span> <span id="s270">And from here on in you start firing green and white flares back and forth so you’re not shooting at Russians and they at you.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Is this where the line was essentially?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: No, we met right there.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I think it’s called…I can’t remember the name of the river.</span> <span id="s275">It goes right through it and that’s where we met them.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: And they brought the people being repatriated into Buchenwald under the conditions described?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: That was what our Allied Military Government chose as a transfer point.</span> <span id="s278">Can you imagine…the sensitivity.</span> <span id="s279">They took these people, with all these hotels in town…enough so that they could designate them for field grade officers, captains only, lower officers, first three grade non-coms, all the press…all these were living in the hotels with Germans cooking for them.</span> <span id="s280">The whole hotels staff was still in tack.</span> <span id="s281">But these people…who had been slave laborers, and were being sent back to their countries…the best place they could think of to barrack them for the night…because most of the prisoners were out now…was on the things you saw (again, referring to the pictures), those shelves.</span> <span id="s282">That’s where they were going to have them sleep.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">Q: Is that where they actually did sleep?</span></p> <p><span id="s284">A: That’s where they stayed as far as we know.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: They really did.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">Then after you delivered them to their destination, then you went back…?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">A: I don’t have the slightest idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">Q: You went back to your company?</span></p> <p><span id="s289">A: They put us back on the trains, and we rode back.</span></p> <p><span id="s290">Q: Did the train go to the other side before disembarking the passengers.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: So they had to get off and go whole through that…</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: There was nothing we could see except the long, single-story…like a warehouse.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Where if you pulled up a train and unloaded it, you see nothing but this big concrete deal.</span> <span id="s295">But when you walked out of the other side of that building.</span> <span id="s296">The building was no more than 20 or 30 feet wide…you came out the other side.</span> <span id="s297">Now there were rail sidings there and along that siding were all these bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">Q: And they had to go past that?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: That’s what happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Q: Did you witness their reaction to this?</span></p> <p><span id="s301">A: No.</span> <span id="s302">Once we got off, we went through…and I just started wandering around the camp.</span> <span id="s303">They were still arguing about whether they were going to unload them or not when I left.</span></p> <p><span id="s304">Q: So you don’t really know what happened at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, we didn’t take them back.</span> <span id="s306">And no other trains came.</span> <span id="s307">So as far as I know…though our lieutenant and all the GI’s that were there…but we had no authority or anything.</span> <span id="s308">We apologized to the Polish lieutenant and told him he was right.</span> <span id="s309">That we never should have let the people get off the train.</span> <span id="s310">But I suppose somebody would have forced them off.</span> <span id="s311">So that’s my story…two sides of German people.</span> <span id="s312">Ones that were absolute bastards, and it happened all through Germany whether it was big cities, small towns or anything else.</span> <span id="s313">We had our fun.</span> <span id="s314">We crossed the river by assault moves at Vern Castle which is across the Mossell.</span> <span id="s315">And we took the city in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s316">During the prior day we’d seen German troops there.</span> <span id="s317">We were on one side of the river, they were on the other.</span> <span id="s318">For three days we looked at each other.</span> <span id="s319">We crossed that night, scared to death because dogs would start barking and up into the town with cobble stones and we heard this very funny sound.</span> <span id="s320">The Germans had little flashlights with little generators in them.</span> <span id="s321">You’d squeeze the handle.</span> <span id="s322">The nearest thing I can tell you is…do you remember the children’s toys that you squeezed and it spun a wheel and made sparkles.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: Zip, zip, zip, zip.</span> <span id="s325">Little geared things.</span> <span id="s326">Well they had ones with little generators in it and the light would flare and die as they would squeeze it, because they didn’t have batteries.</span> <span id="s327">Not enough batteries.</span> <span id="s328">And we saw…heard this sound, that you’re familiar with, and saw this light coming down the road.</span> <span id="s329">And we backed into the doorways.</span> <span id="s330">In Vern Castle, the buildings were built around 1620 and most of the apartment houses were about six stories high.</span> <span id="s331">Cobble stone streets and they go up a story and they move up and they go up a story and they move up.</span> <span id="s332">By the time they’re on the six floor they can almost reach across the street and shake hands.</span> <span id="s333">And people have lived in those apartments and in those homes continuously from the early 1600s.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Do they modernize them as the time goes on?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Electricity was added, but you could see a piece of pipe…</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What about plumbing?</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I supposed they’d been plumbed.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Well in the 1600s they threw their sewage out of the windows into the gutters.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: They had indoor plumbing, some of them outdoor…the older places.</span> <span id="s340">But at any rate, we would back into the doorways and this light came down and somebody reached out grabbed this character and ground him out and scared the hell out of him.</span> <span id="s341">It was a doctor, he was on his way to deliver a baby.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: They let him go?</span></p> <p><span id="s343">A: They sent someone with him.</span> <span id="s344">We also… when I told you that they could come out twice a day… one girl came with us… don’t ask me the name of the town…but she was pregnant and was ready to deliver obviously.</span> <span id="s345">And what she wanted was permission for a midwife to come attend her.</span> <span id="s346">And we had a fellow who had been born and raised in Germany in our company… I don’t know when he had come over…and he looked at her with a dead serious face and he said that was forbidden.</span> <span id="s347">You can only have the baby during the hours that you’re allowed to have somebody come out.</span> <span id="s348">And I thought she was going to faint before someone said, he’s just kidding.</span></p> <p><span id="s349">They were rotten.</span> <span id="s350">It’s very, very hard to believe that so called civilized, cultured people could turn like that, but it can happen.</span> <span id="s351">It can happen here.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: And it was intellegencia who sparked the whole bit?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: No, it wasn’t really.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: It wasn’t?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: No, they may have used it.</span> <span id="s356">But they weren’t the ones that sparked it.</span> <span id="s357">They were low life’s.</span> <span id="s358">The original Storm Troopers that backed up Hitler and all of that were really scum.</span> <span id="s359">Even he couldn’t stand that scum so the original Brown Shirts, he wiped out.</span> <span id="s360">But look at… look at what the super men were, the pure Aryan race.</span> <span id="s361">Recall them, what they physically looked like… goebels, a little tiny dried up, club footed runt.</span> <span id="s362">All he could do was make kids, and he finally shot them, or no he poisoned… he and his wife poisoned their children and then shot themselves down in the bunker.</span> <span id="s363">Herman Goering, big fat pig on drugs.</span> <span id="s364">Himmler with his terrible eyesight, cut off black hair, looked like a stupid ox.</span> <span id="s365">None of them were the picture that they liked to portray of a fair-haired, blue-eyed try Aryan race.</span> <span id="s366">There wasn’t one among them.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: You forgot Hitler</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Hitler?</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: When you described atypical…</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: There wasn’t one of them.</span> <span id="s371">But it could happen.</span> <span id="s372">And it could happen in this country, too.</span> <span id="s373">The same kind of prejudice and hatreds could come to the surface very readily.</span> <span id="s374">Look what happens with the KKK.</span> <span id="s375">Civilization is a very thin veneer.</span></p> <p><span id="s376">Q: I’m sorry that I have to agree with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">A: Well, that’s my story.</span> <span id="s378">The pictures, Muriel said you’d like to have them unless you’ve already had this sort of thing to reproduce.</span> <span id="s379">I don’t want to give that set up but I’ll let you take them to have copies made, if you want to do that.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">Q: We want to take a picture of you too.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">A: What for?</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: We’re hoping to put together…edit, put together and present about an hour tape to the schools and try and bring the Holocaust and what it was to the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: It’s necessary.</span> <span id="s384">I have a 24 year old daughter and I told her you folks were coming… she’s seen these pictures before.</span> <span id="s385">And we were out to dinner last night at a neighbors and they asked her, “What did you know about this?</span> <span id="s386">What did you… children your age… when you were in school…high school, what did you know about this…or college.”</span> <span id="s387">And she said, “Well, from my dad, I knew the story.”</span> <span id="s388">But she said, “I had a roommate one year younger than me and she knew absolutely nothing.”</span> <span id="s389">Her parents were much younger.</span> <span id="s390">Father had not been in the service.</span> <span id="s391">She had no idea of what had gone on.</span> <span id="s392">And what she had heard, she was willing to accept the propaganda, the story that it wasn’t really so, it never existed.</span> <span id="s393">But for the most part, children now… that are in their twenties… young people… don’t really know these things.</span> <span id="s394">And I have to think back to the fact… my Dad was also an infantry man in World War I. And when I was a little kid I lived in Baltimore and he still had his World War I uniform and I used to play with the things… you know… the cap, the German hats, the souvenirs that he’d brought home.</span> <span id="s395">But it was like ancient history to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: That’s the same thing our children are going through.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: I was born in 1923; the war ended in 1917, but to me it may as well have been like the Civil War.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">Q: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">But our schools have been remiss that they have not taught this generation of young people about World War II and the conditions that prevailed and the situations that existed over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: They don’t teach history anymore, really.</span> <span id="s401">They don’t teach geography anymore.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">They have some other names… combine these things.</span> <span id="s403">They don’t dwell on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">It’s too nasty.</span> <span id="s405">And look at the teachers.</span> <span id="s406">Who are the teachers?</span> <span id="s407">For the most part now, they’re youngsters when they’re teaching subjects like history and stuff and they don’t really know it.</span> <span id="s408">They were little kids when it went on.</span> <span id="s409">So its… you got a generation… that unless this is passed on somehow, they wouldn’t believe this stuff.</span> <span id="s410">It’s just too horrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: This is where the Weisenthal foundation is so important in making sure it remains alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">A: But now we’re reaching really the end of the trail for the generation that experienced it.</span> <span id="s413">And it will fade away.</span> <span id="s414">I’m not sure if it should… stay forever… in other words don’t punish the children for the sins of their parents.</span> <span id="s415">But to know what was done, to understand what an atrocity, what a horrible thing… that is what I think is necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">Q: Well this is why we’re making these tapes.</span> <span id="s417">We want the story form the words of the survivors because as you point out they are a dying generation and we need to have a record of this so hopefully it will not happen again.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Have you ever been back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: Yes, I went back to Germany, back in 1967.</span> <span id="s420">I ran the export division of a large corporation, Parker-Hanna, Incorporation … hydraulics and pneumatics, and we have operations all over the free world.</span> <span id="s421">And many of our plants are in Germany.</span> <span id="s422">I was in Cologne.</span> <span id="s423">And I was in Frankfort, Bonn… they’re modern cities, and it’s a different time… what are you going to do?</span> <span id="s424">You can’t keep fighting the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">Q: What was your reaction as a Jew going back there?</span></p> <p><span id="s426">A: I’ll be honest with you.</span> <span id="s427">I hate the Goddamn German people.</span> <span id="s428">As an individual… I can meet them, and associate with them… but if I think of them collectively, I hate their guts.</span> <span id="s429">They were liars, they were boot lickers.</span> <span id="s430">When the war ended, and when it became obvious that it ended, everyone of them would tell you, “Eir nicht Nazi.”</span> <span id="s431">That wasn’t good enough to just say, “I wasn’t a Nazi.”</span> <span id="s432">What they had to do was finger someone, so they would say, “Eir nicht Nazi, but the guy over here,” and they’d point out a neighbor’s home or something, “he was a big Nazi.”</span> <span id="s433">Now if you talk to him, he’s pointing at the other guy.</span> <span id="s434">The other deal was, we were being split into areas of occupation and it was… if you were in the American zone, “We have no argument with the Americans, we love the Americans… but the English, those bastards… those Frenchmen, they’re terrible… and the Russians are swine.”</span> <span id="s435">But if you were in the French zone, they were telling the French, “Americans had no place over here.</span> <span id="s436">The French and Germans should be friends.</span> <span id="s437">The English are no good, and the Russians are swine.”</span> <span id="s438">So, they were trying the split… do things… oh, I don’t trust them.</span> <span id="s439">I don’t trust them, and I don’t like the Japanese either.</span> <span id="s440">Well, that’s it.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">A: Thank you very much.</span></p></body></html>
