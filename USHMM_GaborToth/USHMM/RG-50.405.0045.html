Strauss (We are here to visit you and we are going to discuss your life and what you can remember about your parents, or your grandparents, as far back as possible, and to get the feeling of how it really was for you, all the way up to today.)</span> <span id="s13">(We know you were born in Kiev, is that correct?)</span> <span id="s14">Yes.</span> <span id="s15">I was born in 1948, in Kiev.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">(How far back can you remember?</span> <span id="s17">Do you remember anything from before you went to school?</span> <span id="s18">Do you remember where you lived?)</span> <span id="s19">Yes.</span> <span id="s20">I lived in different places.</span> <span id="s21">At first it was in a house, and then we lived - three families in one apartment.</span> <span id="s22">It was a building with four apartments, and in each apartment there were three families.</span> <span id="s23">It didn't have bathrooms, we went outside.</span> <span id="s24">This was in Kiev, and it had gas heating, first it was coal heating and then it was gas.</span> <span id="s25">But most of the time it was gas, it was far different than the coal.</span> <span id="s26">We would boil water - it was a different stove for cooking than for heat.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">I had a sister.</span> <span id="s28">Her name is Nellie, she is seven years older than I.</span> <span id="s29">In the apartment there was my mother and father, Nellie, myself, and two more families - not related to us.</span> <span id="s30">One of the families was Jewish, the other was not.</span> <span id="s31">(Did this make any problems because two families were Jewish and one was not?)</span> <span id="s32">I don't remember about this, I was too young.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">My mother took care of the cooking and cleaning for our family.</span> <span id="s34">She worked outside the home.</span> <span id="s35">I had a babysitter, sometimes, when I was small.</span> <span id="s36">A lady.</span> <span id="s37">When I was born, she was there already.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">(Do you remember anything about what the day was like when you were with the babysitter?)</span> <span id="s39">I would have said "no", but now I remember this.</span> <span id="s40">I was just very little and the babysitter wrapped me around and around to keep me warm.</span> <span id="s41">I was about a year old and it was very uncomfortable!</span> <span id="s42">I don't remember this myself but my mother told me that the sitter almost suffocated me!</span></p> <p><span id="s43">(Did she tell you other things about when you were little?</span> <span id="s44">Were your grandparents still alive when you were little?)</span> <span id="s45">I did not meet my grandparents then, they were both lost during those years, during the war.</span> <span id="s46">We don't know if they died or were just lost.</span> <span id="s47">My mother was living with relatives after the War, not with her parents, her parents had died.</span> <span id="s48">My father's father disappeared too, we knew he was a long time dead, but we did not know where or how he died.</span> <span id="s49">This happened because of the War, not because of politics.</span> <span id="s50">They were plain people.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">I know that my grandfather on my mother's side died from tuberculosis.</span> <span id="s52">I don't know the cause of death of the others.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">My mother is alive.</span> <span id="s54">She lives in Kiev.</span> <span id="s55">She would like to leave Russia, but whether for the United States, or Israel, she doesn't know because my sister lives in Israel and my mother is undecided.</span> <span id="s56">She is about to apply for her visa, but it is harder to get for the United States, at the present time.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">My father had a brother and a sister.</span> <span id="s58">The sister is in Kiev now and his brother is in Sverdlosk, it is a city in Northern Europe, in the Urals.</span> <span id="s59">My uncle is dead now, and when he was alive he wrote regularly to us.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">My mother had a sister in Dnepropetrovsk, which is in the Ukraine.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">(Once you started school, did you stay in the same apartment, or did you move?)</span> <span id="s62">I lived in the same apartment except for seven years.</span> <span id="s63">Then I finished seven years of school and I applied to a technical school.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">(Can you describe the neighborhood where you lived?</span> <span id="s65">Was it mainly Jewish, what did it look like?</span> <span id="s66">Where did you walk to?</span> <span id="s67">Where did you play, that type of thing.)</span> <span id="s68">The neighborhood wasn't Jewish, but there were some Jewish people.</span> <span id="s69">In our block there were about ten Jewish families.</span> <span id="s70">There were about thirty, thirty-five children.</span> <span id="s71">And they were all in the top ranks for learning, they were better than the others at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">(Did you celebrate anything Jewish in the house?</span> <span id="s73">I know that you talked about Hamantaschen at Purim, was there religion, or not?)</span> <span id="s74">No.</span> <span id="s75">I knew, of course, that I was a Jew.</span> <span id="s76">I knew it too early.</span> <span id="s77">Because the atmosphere about Jewish people was very negative and children knew this from an early age, from when they were four or five years old.</span> <span id="s78">There were bad, or mean, Russian children who made a point to tell them they were Jewish and therefore bad people.</span> <span id="s79">This was everywhere, everywhere.</span> <span id="s80">So we didn't have to get religion - we were Jewish!</span></p> <p><span id="s81">(When you played, did you play with Russian children and Jewish children?)</span> <span id="s82">At my children's ages, I played with all different kinds of children.</span> <span id="s83">But later, when I was about thirteen or fourteen years old, I was with only Jewish friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">(Did anything happen that --?)</span> <span id="s85">It happens with everybody, all the time.</span> <span id="s86">(I know.)</span> <span id="s87">I cannot tell you what happened but nothing in particular.</span> <span id="s88">It happened so often that I cannot think of anything unusual.</span> <span id="s89">It was the way we lived in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">(Did your parents tell you anything about how it felt to be Jewish?</span> <span id="s91">It sounds very unpleasant, How did you make peace with it?)</span> <span id="s92">I am very different now, than I was then!</span> <span id="s93">When they baited me I decided to give in and not to fight it.</span> <span id="s94">I always told my nationality, every time.</span> <span id="s95">I never hid it.</span> <span id="s96">I had some fights, of course.</span> <span id="s97">It was very common, nothing special.</span> <span id="s98">I don't know what to tell you.</span> <span id="s99">(You must have had feelings.)</span> <span id="s100">I felt very frustrated and envious of the others, because it seemed only the Jews were hated by everybody.</span> <span id="s101">I could not take it peaceably, I could not live with (?)</span> <span id="s102">(Do you remember any incidents in school?</span> <span id="s103">Anything that happened that was very unpleasant or unfair?)</span> <span id="s104">Yes, you know, at school children have the subject of Literature and Russian and Ukrainian writers were very often anti-Jewish, especially in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s105">So you can picture how I would feel reading aloud from the text and everybody listening and what I was reading was very unpleasant about the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">(What did your parents say to you if you came home and you said, look what we have to read in school, it is very difficult to deal with.</span> <span id="s107">Was there any advice that you got from your parents that helped you deal with this?)</span> <span id="s108">They told me what I could see for myself, that all the people who were around us - the Jewish people were very good and not bad - so I knew that what was written was not true.</span> <span id="s109">But this is what was taught and we could do nothing about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">(How about the teachers?</span> <span id="s111">Were they unfair, or do you think that you had a definite disadvantage, did you like them, or not?)</span> <span id="s112">Yes, I felt I was at a disadvantage.</span> <span id="s113">Sometimes my Jewish religion was a case for unfairness, an act against you (/ ?)</span> <span id="s114">.</span> <span id="s115">But teachers were all different people, they acted differently.</span> <span id="s116">You know, in general, every non-Jew is exposed to many of the same things, but each person has their differences and their families are different.</span> <span id="s117">Some of them fought it, or they were ashamed of it, but most allowed them to talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">(In your home, what did you celebrate?</span> <span id="s119">Did you celebrate birthdays, the national holidays?</span> <span id="s120">How did you celebrate?)</span> <span id="s121">Usually when we celebrated something, people came to the house, family and friends, and national holidays were just a day without work so, it was just like that.</span> <span id="s122">Sometimes we would go to a park, or something like that.</span> <span id="s123">But, as to meanings that was not my experience, after I had these holidays, very early, I began to hate them.</span> <span id="s124">After I was eighteen years old I was against Communism, and I never was a member of the young people's group, the one after the Pioneers group.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">(Your father and your mother worked?</span> <span id="s126">What did they do?)</span> <span id="s127">My father was a dispatcher for truck, to deliver things.</span> <span id="s128">And my mother was a cashier at a store.</span> <span id="s129">In Russia, all the stores were owned by the government so she worked for the government not for private people.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">(Did your mother cook foods that you knew were Jewish or not?)</span> <span id="s131">Yes, she did, she made gefilte fish, and strudel and, you know, sweet beef meat?</span> <span id="s132">brisket with fruit.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">(Did you ever discuss politics with your parents at home?)</span> <span id="s134">My father hated Socialists, my mother was more moderate about this, so they never discussed politics at home.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">(Now, you were telling me about when you were young at school, they you went to the high school, and you made a statement that about the age of eighteen you knew you did not like Communism.</span> <span id="s136">What made you all of a sudden decide this?)</span> <span id="s137">Because I - it wasn't a slow process, because at that age I finished my school and I went to school for an education and I cannot get the type of professional education that I wanted.</span> <span id="s138">I always wanted to be an engineer, but I wanted to be in a different field, and I wanted to be a scientist, in Physics, that was my interest, but for Jewish people it is very hard to get into these schools, and I tried six times to get into the school that I wanted.</span> <span id="s139">But, even though I had all high marks, I was never even considered.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">(Because they would not take Jews in?)</span> <span id="s141">Yes.</span> <span id="s142">It seemed to me that way.</span> <span id="s143">I don't want to think about me, I know that all Jewish people find it very hard to get into the right college.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">(Where did you go to engineering school?</span> <span id="s145">in Kiev?</span> <span id="s146">or Moscow?)</span> <span id="s147">In Kiev, yes.</span> <span id="s148">They accept Jewish people there because nobody wanted to go there, except us.</span> <span id="s149">It was the education by mail, correspondence school.</span> <span id="s150">I worked at the same time I was studying.</span> <span id="s151">I worked -- in America, it is a draftsman, it Russia it was different.</span> <span id="s152">I was a drafter.</span> <span id="s153">But it is different than in the United States.</span> <span id="s154">In the United States, a draftsman is a very good profession, in the Soviet Union, drafter or engineers are a very low paid profession.</span> <span id="s155">That's why they let us go into this profession.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">(You were working as a draftsman while you were studying, before you finished the engineering school?)</span> <span id="s157">Yes, I learned how to draft in my work place, so it was nothing so difficult, because I had some drafting classes back in school.</span> <span id="s158">I worked as an engineer, also, before I finished the college degree.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">(Where you worked, was it a big factory of some kind?)</span> <span id="s160">It was like a large contracting company.</span> <span id="s161">It was a place where projects were developed.</span> <span id="s162">Buildings, electrical parts and it was the only available job for me or for other Jewish people.</span> <span id="s163">It was not like it is in this country.</span> <span id="s164">In Russia, it is not a good profession at all, people laugh at you if you are an engineer because they are very poorly paid.</span> <span id="s165">In Russia, everybody has -- everybody receives a poor amount of money, some people can manage, some people who work in factories, you know.</span> <span id="s166">Where they provide two meals a day, it is almost ?</span> <span id="s167">they laugh sick?</span> <span id="s168">every day they, you understand, and that is why the people who dealt with me were very rich people because of the jobs they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">So the engineering jobs were available for Jews, nobody else wants them.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">From 1968 to 1973 when I was working as a draftsman and taking the correspondence courses.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">(When did you meet Irina?)</span> <span id="s172">It was in 1976.</span> <span id="s173">No, in 1974, rather.</span> <span id="s174">Wrong date, that will give me trouble!</span> <span id="s175">My wife and I met because we worked at the same company.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">(Was it important to you to marry a Jewish girl?</span> <span id="s177">Did you look for one?)</span> <span id="s178">It was just natural.</span> <span id="s179">I never thought of getting married before I met her.</span> <span id="s180">I am not telling you this because there is not mixed marriage in Russia but, for me?</span> <span id="s181">For me it was important because it was natural.</span> <span id="s182">Our families did not know each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">In Russia, there is no such tradition to have a family decide about a marriage.</span> <span id="s184">They met each other when they came to the court for our marriage.</span> <span id="s185">They all met at Irina's home.</span> <span id="s186">(Was there anything Jewish about your wedding?)</span> <span id="s187">Nothing important.</span> <span id="s188">We were married at the Palace of Marriages.</span> <span id="s189">We celebrated at a restaurant afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">(Then, where did you live?)</span> <span id="s191">At that time I had my own room in my own family's apartment, again.</span> <span id="s192">It was in a flat with three families again, but not with our parents.</span> <span id="s193">It was a three-room apartment and in each room lived other families.</span> <span id="s194">They were not Jewish and our room was about half the size of this room.</span> <span id="s195">After that, we had Vladimir in the same room.</span> <span id="s196">But this time I had trouble with my Jewishness.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">(What happened?)</span> <span id="s198">We lived with very simple people.</span> <span id="s199">They did not hesitate to say things and especially at this time I had trouble with K.G.B.</span> <span id="s200">It happened that I was at one party, we were just talking, politics and everything else.</span> <span id="s201">The party was in my neighbor's street, I worked at another job.</span> <span id="s202">I was working as a field engineer and I was not paid much.</span> <span id="s203">This was in Kirovgrad, in the Ukraine.</span> <span id="s204">I was only there about a month.</span> <span id="s205">So it happened that the place that I went to, was a Jewish gentlemen.</span> <span id="s206">I lived in a hotel, and this man invited me to the party, and this party was one other and now I know that he worked for the K.G.B.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">He told them about me, that I said something, that I said this, that I borrowed some dollars -- (Do you remember what you said?)</span> <span id="s208">Yes, it was so long ago.</span> <span id="s209">At that time, this happened when the Korean jumbo jet liner that was shot down.</span> <span id="s210">It was in the time of Andropov, it was in 1984.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">(It is interesting for me to know.)</span> <span id="s212">From what he said, and from other things he said, -- I didn't know at that time, at all, that he had reported me.</span> <span id="s213">And, after a month, people from Kiev wrote to me and told me that some gentlemen from K.G.B. approached them and asked them about me.</span> <span id="s214">And told them to write down evidence about me, some were from where I worked, and it so happened that there were not high-spirited people, they were drunk and they did not like me too well anyway.</span> <span id="s215">They were afraid of the K.G.B., and the K.G.B. forced them to write so they gave evidence.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">They told everybody around me about me and they did it in such a way that it seemed I was infatuated, that I was wrong about this.</span> <span id="s217">That I was afraid about this.</span> <span id="s218">It was about a year after that, I was invited to K.G.B. Headquarters for an interview.</span> <span id="s219">Invited, yes, I refused to attend.</span> <span id="s220">This time two officers took me to their office and asked me questions, it was about five or six hours and my wife knew about it and she was very worried.</span> <span id="s221">They showed me all these papers and they told me, here - these go back and back, a year - and one even before that.</span> <span id="s222">You are anti-semitic, and you are "so-and-so" and they wanted me to sign papers about some evidence about this time when I was in that area.</span></p> <p><span id="s223">At this time they didn't allow Jewish people to learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s224">Hebrew was a very big - - it wasn't allowed at all.</span> <span id="s225">Then they did not allow anyone to learn Hebrew, at all.</span> <span id="s226">They were very strange about languages, you know.</span> <span id="s227">They were looking for some Hebrew teachers; and this is the way they did it.</span> <span id="s228">They frightened the people into giving evidence.</span> <span id="s229">They said they were going to put me into prison, but I said that I could not tell them anything.</span> <span id="s230">That the man in Kirovgrad was a nice person, and we went to theaters and mutual cultural interests and that was all.</span> <span id="s231">But they pushed and pushed me and the next thing they were saying that if you don't write a paper, we may tell all the people in your work place that everybody else who put this in writing are going to appear in a meeting and give evidence and tell everybody about you.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">It was easier for me to go - there wasn't any question of treason in the paper.</span> <span id="s233">So with such a meeting, I cannot survive on the job, probably.</span> <span id="s234">It is not so bad, a meeting, no, I never got this before in my life, to me it was stupid.</span> <span id="s235">And after all this, it was only a threat.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">I think they really did not intend to send me to prison, it was only to put pressure on me and make me afraid.</span> <span id="s237">But at the end they said that I could go, but if something else ever came out, this was the last time that they could let me off.</span> <span id="s238">But I wasn't sure, because sometimes they could tell me one thing but tell my friends something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">At the same time, they fought against anti-Jewish people, but they fought against Jewish culture and Jewish thought.</span> <span id="s240">They didn't like it, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">My neighbor, in my flat, he told them everything about me.</span> <span id="s242">He said that I listened to the "Voice of America" on the radio.</span> <span id="s243">I did, but - - and, by the way, he was an officer of the Soviet Army.</span> <span id="s244">He was a Captain, and after that, he went to prison.</span> <span id="s245">He took bribes, he took bribes for soldiers to stay in Kiev for their (tradaht?)</span> <span id="s246">(When you chose an apartment, when you chose where you were going to live, how did you get there?</span> <span id="s247">Could you live in an apartment where there were only Jews?)</span> <span id="s248">It might have been possible.</span> <span id="s249">I tell you how people get an apartment in Russia.</span> <span id="s250">In Russia, the government gives you an apartment, you cannot choose anything.</span> <span id="s251">My parents lived in this flat before they returned after the evacuation and they government gave it to them after that.</span> <span id="s252">This building was up for demolition because it was old and we got the next flat in a new house, and we didn't choose it or say anything.</span> <span id="s253">There is no question about, "Do you want to live with Jewish people?"</span> <span id="s254">No.</span> <span id="s255">We went where space was available.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">This apartment where we were living together, we changed two-bedroom apartment with me, my mother, my sister, her husband and their daughter.</span> <span id="s257">We traded this flat with other people.</span> <span id="s258">So they went to their apartment and I went to this other one.</span> <span id="s259">It is not by your own choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">(At your place of work, could you have ever gotten a higher job, with more money, or do you think that it would always have been the same?)</span> <span id="s261">It is not simple in general, but for Jewish people it is quite hard to get ahead but some can manage it.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">(When did you decide that you wanted to leave?)</span> <span id="s263">That was decided about fifteen years ago.</span> <span id="s264">(This was before the episode with the K.G.B.?)</span> <span id="s265">Yes.</span> <span id="s266">I had not applied to leave though.</span> <span id="s267">I applied in 1979.</span> <span id="s268">This was under Brezhnev.</span> <span id="s269">In their department there is not such strict order, I don't believe the ones who questioned me knew about my request to leave.</span> <span id="s270">I don't know for sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">When I applied to leave in 1979, it did affect my job.</span> <span id="s272">When I first applied, to leave Russia, I did not have a relative in Israel who sponsored me.</span> <span id="s273">It did not have to be a relative, just some one who would send me an invitation.</span> <span id="s274">Nothing happened, because at that time the emigration was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Everything was changed, the political situation had changed, Afghanistan had become a problem, and many other things had changed.</span> <span id="s276">The government took a whole different direction at this time and they didn't allow any more emigration.</span> <span id="s277">Because emigration was a toy for a short time between United States and Soviet Union, about the grain, about money, about a lot of different things.</span> <span id="s278">At this time the trade agreements were broken off and they broke off all relationships between these two countries.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">(So, how many years did it take?</span> <span id="s280">did you have to re-apply?)</span> <span id="s281">Yes, I had to re-apply again.</span> <span id="s282">I did that in November of 1988.</span> <span id="s283">Altogether, it took - we went from Russia in April of 1989.</span> <span id="s284">We asked permission to go to Israel, everyone did that.</span> <span id="s285">We flew from Moscow to Vienna.</span> <span id="s286">In Vienna, we stayed for ten days.</span> <span id="s287">Igor was eight months old at that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">We were met in Vienna by, not HIAS, it was another agency, I think it was Sackmut, an Israeli agency.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Because my wife had a cousin who lived in Chicago and in Israel we don't have anybody.</span> <span id="s290">So we decided to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s291">My sister went to Israel after I had already left Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">After Vienna, we went to Italy, to Rome.</span> <span id="s293">We were in Italy for two and a half months.</span> <span id="s294">We were given money from HIAS to use for living expenses.</span> <span id="s295">They didn't provide housing, they just provided the money.</span> <span id="s296">From Rome we came straight to Chicago, because our cousin was here.</span> <span id="s297">We arrived in Chicago on the sixth of July, 1989.</span></p> <p><span id="s298">(I want to go back a bit, there is something I forgot to ask.</span> <span id="s299">I wanted to know what experiences you had when the Chernobyl problem came.)</span> <span id="s300">After a while we knew that it was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s301">(Did you know right away?)</span> <span id="s302">We knew because we were an educated people, you know.</span> <span id="s303">It happened Friday, and Monday I was in my work place and somebody was discussing the situation with another person.</span> <span id="s304">There was a map and that's how I knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s305">(I was wondering, because you did say that you listened to the Voice of America, and they announced it as soon as they knew.)</span> <span id="s306">Yes, but this time I had not been listening.</span> <span id="s307">Chernobyl was the 26th of April.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">(About all we could do was pray, I prayed.</span> <span id="s309">- Irina) It was... it was terrible outside (?)</span> <span id="s310">(Did you go to work, did you have to go to work?)</span> <span id="s311">Yes.</span> <span id="s312">On the 8th of May, Irina went to Moscow, because we were afraid of what might happen with the children.</span> <span id="s313">After that, they were with my aunt in Dnepropetrovsk, and ?</span> <span id="s314">?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">(Where is Dnepropetrovsk?)</span> <span id="s316">If you have a map, I can show you.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">(As far as food or anything when the Russians told the people, did they do anything to help or protect you?)</span> <span id="s318">(Irina: we had a television program about Chernobyl and a radio program about Chernobyl and they said what we should do with food - ) and to boil things many hours to get rid of the effects (but they said that everything was all right and don't worry, don't worry, it is not dangerous and all will be all right.)</span> <span id="s319">(When you were in Russia and Gorbachev came into power, did you feel a tremendous change?</span> <span id="s320">Did you feel a change in the way things were going?</span> <span id="s321">Did you feel a little freer?</span> <span id="s322">Did you believe that anything might change?)</span> <span id="s323">I didn't believe like that, (I hoped.</span> <span id="s324">- Irina).</span> <span id="s325">We hoped, I did not believe that it was possible to change.</span> <span id="s326">Now?</span> <span id="s327">something has changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s328">but - it was only in this area because Gorbachev is worse (?)</span> <span id="s329">(When you wanted to leave, what was your main reason for getting out of Russia?)</span> <span id="s330">There were many reasons.</span> <span id="s331">All of them were mine.</span> <span id="s332">I didn't want to be hated; I was Jewish, and I wanted to be Jewish; and I want people around me to be tolerant about it.</span> <span id="s333">I want my children to be Jewish, to have a Jewish education, to be free and to choose for themselves a way of life and that I was afraid for their lives too, because I knew at that time that it was very dangerous, because of the past history of Russia - it is full of pogroms and if anything goes wrong at all, the Jewish people would suffer.</span> <span id="s334">I was afraid for my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">(When you got to Chicago, what feelings did you have?)</span> <span id="s336">I don't know.</span> <span id="s337">I think that after Vienna, I did not have such strong feelings.</span> <span id="s338">The fact of freedom came to me there.</span> <span id="s339">Vienna was so beautiful, we were there in Spring and after the North, it was so beautiful.</span> <span id="s340">America, it was hard to react to as strongly as the reactions to Vienna.</span> <span id="s341">I know I was happy to be in Chicago, too, but it was different.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">(What do your really like about America, and what do you not like, because there is such a difference in the two ways of life, so I would feel that you have feelings on both sides?)</span> <span id="s343">I had prepared very well, I had read many books about the United States and by American authors and I had read them in English and I learned the language by reading these books.</span> <span id="s344">I read Saul Bellow and Isaac Asimov, and Bela ???</span> <span id="s345">and many other American I knew myself.</span> <span id="s346">I don't tell you that I know everything, but I had a feeling that I imagine that Americans feel in Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s347">(There has to be some culture shock.</span> <span id="s348">Life is totally different, is it not?)</span> <span id="s349">It is different but in a good direction.</span> <span id="s350">I found out that Americans have some anti-Semitic people too.</span> <span id="s351">But I knew about it.</span> <span id="s352">But to know about something, and then to feel it; it is different.</span> <span id="s353">But I know that even if Austria felt like heaven after Moscow, I know that there is still anti-Semitism there.</span> <span id="s354">We have heard the statements about Waldheim, the stories about his being a Nazi, and the people there do not seem to mind, they seem to be happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s355">(After you arrived here, how long did it take you to find a job?)</span> <span id="s356">It took me about five months to find a job.</span> <span id="s357">Irina found a job too.</span> <span id="s358">Only she is working right now, I am without.</span> <span id="s359">I worked for about three months, on a contract, and the contract was over in May and I have been without a job for the three months since.</span> <span id="s360">It is difficult.</span> <span id="s361">I have to feel that there is nothing wrong with this, that this is the way it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Vladimir goes to school; and he goes to Sunday School at Arie Crown.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">(What are your hopes for the future?</span> <span id="s364">What is your goal?</span> <span id="s365">what would you like to do?)</span> <span id="s366">I wish to find work in my profession.</span> <span id="s367">And I want a good Jewish education for my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">(Is there anything about the future that concerns you?)</span> <span id="s369">I don't know.</span> <span id="s370">I cannot say right now.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">(Is there anything you miss about Russia?)</span> <span id="s372">Well, only our relatives, our friends but -- (Is there anything that we should have asked about your life, that we didn't?</span> <span id="s373">Is there anything you would like to add about your memories, about your family and your life in Russia?</span> <span id="s374">Anything like that.)</span> <span id="s375">We have been impressed by the help of other Jewish people when we arrived in the United States.</span> <span id="s376">And HIAS and how they helped them.</span> <span id="s377">It was very unusual because in Russia there is no tradition for helping people.</span> <span id="s378">Even in Russia, the Jewish people did not help and other people who live in Russia are also in a difficult situation.</span> <span id="s379">They are afraid to be seen with other Jewish people.</span> <span id="s380">I didn't blame them for this, it was just the situation was very hard.</span> <span id="s381">Even after seventy years, it was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">You have to be free of dangers, of hardships, to be able to help someone else openly.</span> <span id="s383">In Russia, we are Jewish by what it says on our passport, that is all.</span> <span id="s384">But Jewish tradition has disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">(If your mother still cooked some Jewish things, she must have remembered some things from her parents.</span> <span id="s386">Usually with the Russian family, if you can go back far enough, they were very Jewish!)</span> <span id="s387">Yes.</span> <span id="s388">We used to live in separate townships.</span> <span id="s389">I know that a lot of the American Jewish tradition came from Poland and Russia.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">(Do you have any pictures, or any documents, that we might possibly look at - you would get them back - only for a few days?)</span> <span id="s391">No, we did not take anything like that.</span></p></body></html>
