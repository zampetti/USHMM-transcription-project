this interview possible.</span> <span id="s16">This is tape number one, side A.</span> <span id="s17">So my first question to you is when were you born and where, and give us your full name again.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Answer: My full name is Blanka Irma Rothschild.</span> <span id="s19">I was born in Poland, in Lódz, and -- August 19th, 1922.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">Q: And I would like to start with the time just before liberation.</span> <span id="s21">If you could set for us the context a little bit, where were you, when was it, and what was your physical health and your state of mind at that time.</span> <span id="s22">It’s a pretty heavy question, but if you just --</span></p> <p><span id="s23">A: Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was in so-called [indecipherable] which means in English, a sick bay.</span> <span id="s24">I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the last beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the airplane factory in which I w -- slaved.</span> <span id="s25">And at that time the allied forces were closing on the -- around our city, Bittenberg.</span> <span id="s26">We were not really sure who were they, but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the barrack, and the -- the doors were locked and the windows were covered, and we were not let out to work, and as well with the sick bay.</span> <span id="s27">Since this came so rapidly, they did not have time to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the camp with the inmates.</span> <span id="s28">I was brought from the sick bay to the main barrack when they closed it.</span> <span id="s29">And the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the window, the -- the shutter, and she have seen that the towers where the German soldiers were usually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there.</span> <span id="s30">So they decided to break the door open and run.</span> <span id="s31">And the ones who could, ran to the kitchen.</span> <span id="s32">They brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of potatoes and we stayed for awhile there.</span> <span id="s33">We had very mixed emotions because we didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s34">However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to leave the camp, since it was abandoned by the Germans.</span> <span id="s35">This was the supposedly moment of the liberation, and we didn’t feel liberated yet.</span> <span id="s36">It was very strange feeling.</span> <span id="s37">We went across the street, my friends helped me.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: You couldn’t walk?</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: I am -- I -- I walked, because I -- the human need to survive is so great that you summon all your energy to -- to survive.</span> <span id="s40">So I lived with this pain, and they helped me.</span> <span id="s41">And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we will be free.</span> <span id="s42">And we crossed the street.</span> <span id="s43">There was the house in which the commandant lived from the camp, with a garden, lovely flowers which I envied when I passed by and saw it.</span> <span id="s44">We went inside, it was abandoned as well.</span> <span id="s45">And there were, I think, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet.</span> <span id="s46">And they brought the food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant came back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we were petrified, we thought that’s the end.</span> <span id="s47">And this big, strong man with the gun was afraid of us.</span> <span id="s48">And he backed out and disappeared.</span> <span id="s49">At that moment we thought the safest thing would be to leave his house and go towards the fire, because this indicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: How many of you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: I don’t know what happened, but we split.</span> <span id="s52">I was in a group of five.</span> <span id="s53">Two of the girls were helping me, and the five of us were running.</span> <span id="s54">We passed a field, it was street or a field, there were two young men there, and they joined us.</span> <span id="s55">These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the farms because Germany needed laborers, and they joined us.</span> <span id="s56">Since we were from Poland, we spoke Polish, so the seven of us reached the front line.</span> <span id="s57">Unbelievable, unbelievable sight.</span> <span id="s58">The first soldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol maybe, with the eyes that make seem that he’s Asiatic.</span> <span id="s59">And he was with the dirty uniform, filthy.</span> <span id="s60">And we kissed his boots.</span> <span id="s61">I remember that moment.</span> <span id="s62">And he motioned with his hands for us to go in the back.</span> <span id="s63">We went in the back, they told us that we can help ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings.</span> <span id="s64">We ate some of the herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs, rather, were empty.</span> <span id="s65">And there was no water because the pipes weren’t working.</span> <span id="s66">So -- but we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">Q: So they were salt herrings, or [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s68">A: Long herrings, long herrings.</span> <span id="s69">And then they -- they told us to leave.</span> <span id="s70">This was the front line after all, they were being shot and they shot back.</span> <span id="s71">So we reached a house -- this was a village, finally, and we reached the very first house, which had a slightly damaged roof, I believe, and we went in.</span> <span id="s72">And it -- since the fighting go -- was going on, we decided to go to the basement.</span> <span id="s73">They had the basement, which was very, very well appointed.</span> <span id="s74">They had two sort of cots to sleep, with -- with linen on them, and they were -- the walls were lined with shelves, and the shelves had all sorts of jars with conserves and meat and -- and fruit.</span> <span id="s75">And in the other part of the basement there were barrels.</span> <span id="s76">They were potatoes, carrots, and water.</span> <span id="s77">So, ever -- and -- and there were some candles.</span> <span id="s78">So they were really very well prepared.</span> <span id="s79">And of course we ate some of the stuff, and we lied down.</span> <span id="s80">And that basement was approachable by a swing door up and down, that’s all I remember, up and down.</span> <span id="s81">And at some point during the night, the door swang open and two Russians came, and they demanded girls.</span> <span id="s82">I believe that at least one of them was drunk, because he pulled up his gun and started to shoot at the jars.</span> <span id="s83">Now, I said to myself, when I survived the five years, or over five years of war, and I’m still alive, I’m not going to be subjected to that, I’d rather die.</span> <span id="s84">So I ask one of the Polish boys to save me, and I said to him, look, tell them that I’m -- pretend I’m your wife.</span> <span id="s85">I was lying on this cot, and he covered me, and he sat down on top of me.</span> <span id="s86">And the other girl did the same, and one went in the back room where the barrels were, and two girls were raped.</span> <span id="s87">Now the -- the Russian who was shooting at the jars, was laughing like a child.</span> <span id="s88">To him this was absolutely normal.</span> <span id="s89">Women and men were made to -- to mate.</span> <span id="s90">So there was nothing strange to him.</span> <span id="s91">He couldn’t understand that -- that we hated it, that we couldn't understand it.</span> <span id="s92">I remember that the pieces of the broken jars, the glass, embedded in my left leg, and I still have the scars.</span> <span id="s93">And I didn’t make a peep, not a sound, because I wanted to survive, so I was quiet.</span> <span id="s94">One of the girls became hysterical; her name was Blanka, I remember her, she was the youngest.</span> <span id="s95">She became hysterical and she started to scream, so the Russian took a candle, put the light on -- lit the candle and brought her some water.</span> <span id="s96">And he put the compress, cold compress on her forehead, he said, okay.</span> <span id="s97">When the morning finally arrived --</span></p> <p><span id="s98">Q: Had he rape -- had -- had he just raped -- I mean, after the --</span></p> <p><span id="s99">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: -- rape, or before, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: I he -- he raped -- one girl was raped on the floor, her name was Anya, she went to Israel, I don’t know too much about her now, and the other one was lying on the other cot, and it was dark, but we heard the sounds.</span> <span id="s102">And she was quiet.</span> <span id="s103">She was raped.</span> <span id="s104">She came from a very religious family, Jewish religious family, so in the morning she did not tell us that she was raped, but we knew she was raped, because you -- you could hear the sounds.</span> <span id="s105">Extraordinary.</span> <span id="s106">The next morning we decided to leave this place for something safer, and we walked through the village, found another house.</span> <span id="s107">They were -- all the houses were abandoned by the Germans who were running towards the American line, or English line.</span> <span id="s108">They did not want to be captured by the Russians.</span> <span id="s109">And the cows and the pigs were not fed so they were making sounds.</span> <span id="s110">We got into a house, we made ourselves comfortable, we ate.</span> <span id="s111">The two boys went to the garden and they chased some chickens, we cooked the chickens.</span> <span id="s112">After we finished eating we took the tablecloth with the china and threw it out of the window.</span> <span id="s113">That was -- this was the little revenge.</span> <span id="s114">We didn’t want to wash the dishes, we didn’t know what will happen.</span> <span id="s115">It didn’t feel like we are liberated.</span> <span id="s116">There was not the sense of freedom yet.</span> <span id="s117">Oh, first of all, the war was still going on.</span> <span id="s118">We were so-called liberated by the Russians, who became in our eyes, another oppressors.</span> <span id="s119">So I questioned myself, is -- was this worth it, all my suffering, to arrive at this moment?</span> <span id="s120">What’s going to be?</span> <span id="s121">What will happen later on?</span> <span id="s122">And there was a story about -- I believe that I had on media tape, that we were so scared of the Russians that at night we took a ladder and we went to the attic, and we slept in the attic, four of us.</span> <span id="s123">The two boys slept downstairs and one of the five girls, her name was Sarka, she found herself a r -- a Russian officer.</span> <span id="s124">She was a very enterprising young lady.</span> <span id="s125">The four of us were scared, four poor souls, so the four of us were upstairs, upstairs there was a bed, big, big bed, and the boys pulled the ladder down and we stayed up there at night.</span> <span id="s126">And the same night, we have heard German voices, and we thought that the Germans came back.</span> <span id="s127">The Polish boys jumped out of the window.</span> <span id="s128">The house faced a small forest, a young forest, and evidently some of the soldiers who ran away, they were hiding.</span> <span id="s129">They were hungry, so they broke to this kitchen to eat.</span> <span id="s130">So the Polish boys jumped from the window because they were downstairs, and they ran to the Russian commandantura to tell them that the ru -- there are Germans in the house.</span> <span id="s131">And we hear the Russians coming, and we understand them because the Russian and Polish are -- are Slavic languages, the -- the roots are sort of -- you could understand.</span> <span id="s132">They wanted to throw --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Hand grenades?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: Hand grenades, and -- to the house.</span> <span id="s135">So the Polish boys said don’t, don’t, there are Polish girls upstairs.</span> <span id="s136">And we, all four of us, crept underneath the big bed, we’re lying underneath the bed, and Blanka, the youngest one who -- who -- who was hysterical before, she wet herself and we were lying down there in the urine, not even thinking about it.</span> <span id="s137">Here we survived the Nazi camp, here we are so-called liberated, here are the Germans downstairs and the Russians want to kill us.</span> <span id="s138">The -- the situation was absolutely unbelievable.</span> <span id="s139">The Germans tried to escape through the kitchen door to the -- through the garden, and they were shot by the Russians, both of them.</span> <span id="s140">And the two bodies were for two days lying there.</span> <span id="s141">After that day, my fear was so intense, that I did not want to stay with the girls.</span> <span id="s142">The next house ha-had French prison -- ex-prisoners of war, and I moved with them, they said they would take care of me, and they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: Through all of this you had broken ribs --</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: -- and you were really ill, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">Q: -- did you get any kind of -- of medical supplies, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: No, the Russians gave me -- as we -- when we were there at first, when they gave us some food, they gave me some bandages to wrap myself, that’s all.</span> <span id="s149">I d -- I really don’t know how these people fought, because they were -- they didn’t change their uniforms, they were dirty, they had all sorts of food that was unthinkable, and they were fighting.</span> <span id="s150">They were very strong people, the -- the -- the stock.</span> <span id="s151">And the conditions were just tragic.</span> <span id="s152">I stayed with the French people, who took care of me.</span> <span id="s153">As a matter of fact, I have pictures.</span> <span id="s154">They -- they gave me some pictures.</span> <span id="s155">And one of them wanted me to go with him to France.</span> <span id="s156">He said, we will -- we will cure you there.</span> <span id="s157">And we stayed there for quite awhile, I don’t remember the dates and how long.</span> <span id="s158">But then the war was over on May sixth.</span> <span id="s159">We still stayed, because we didn’t know what to do and where to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">Q: How did you hear about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s161">A: Well, the Russians.</span> <span id="s162">Hitler kaput, Hitler kaput.</span> <span id="s163">It’s over.</span> <span id="s164">Sarka had this Russian lieutenant, or I don’t know what his rank was, she was very happy, and the three of them with the two Polish boys were still in that house.</span> <span id="s165">I was with the French people.</span> <span id="s166">I was absolutely scared out of my wits.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: [indecipherable] I will interrupt for just one second.</span> <span id="s168">So now we are continuing again.</span> <span id="s169">So you were really scared.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s171">After I don’t remember how many weeks, but few weeks, people started to think of going back to their native countries.</span> <span id="s172">Now at that point, I did not know that my family didn’t survive, that not one of them survived.</span> <span id="s173">So I thought that my ob -- first obligation was to go back to look for my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: We should -- I’m -- I’m sorry to interrupt.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: We should probably say for the listeners who have not seen the videotape that your father had already died before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">Q: But your mother and --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">A: Grandmother.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: -- your grandmother --</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, my grandmother was taken away.</span> <span id="s182">I did not know if people who were taken away were all dead.</span> <span id="s183">We thought maybe some of them survive.</span> <span id="s184">And my mother was -- you know, when they parted us, I thought maybe she survived.</span> <span id="s185">So I thought that I have to fulfill my -- my first obligation and go back.</span> <span id="s186">And there were people from Poland who walked with little carts and Polish flags, towards Poland.</span> <span id="s187">And I decided that I will join them.</span> <span id="s188">There were carts, so I had some rides for awhile.</span> <span id="s189">And after tearful good-byes with the French people, that I will never forget, I left.</span> <span id="s190">And we walked, and walked, and then they had the horse once.</span> <span id="s191">So the horse pull -- pulled the cart and I was in it.</span> <span id="s192">We reached a city called Lignitsa, which used to belong to German and became Polish, so I don’t remember what the name was previous to it.</span> <span id="s193">Lignitz?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">Q: Lignitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">A: Lignitz, probably.</span> <span id="s196">It was not too far from Breslau, and Breslau became Brotswow.</span> <span id="s197">And in Brotswow people already had apartments, people who survived.</span> <span id="s198">Now, I was never very enterprising, so I just depended on that man who was walking.</span> <span id="s199">And we stayed in Lignitz -- Lignitsa for a couple of days, then we continued, and then we had part of the trip was done by a train that the trucks still remained somewhere.</span> <span id="s200">And eventually I reached Warsaw.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: How did you eat, and where did you get clothes [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: Who needed clothes?</span> <span id="s203">Who thought of clothes?</span> <span id="s204">I had something from the German house.</span> <span id="s205">I -- I’m sorry to -- til today that I didn’t bring with me -- didn’t -- I didn’t think of preserving anything from the camp, I just want to get rid of it.</span> <span id="s206">So I went through -- through the closets with my friends, and I remember that I wore, I think it was a man’s shirt, blue, long-sleeve shirt, and some sort of a skirt.</span> <span id="s207">Some people were looking for watches, for thi -- I -- I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s208">I just wanted to see my family.</span> <span id="s209">When we reached Warsaw, which was bombed to rubble, and they left me there, I didn’t know what to do, how to reach my city, Lódz.</span> <span id="s210">I have no money, I have no possessions, I -- I’m -- you see me, that’s how I am.</span> <span id="s211">And there was a truck, a Polish man who had a sign he’s going to Lódz.</span> <span id="s212">So I ask him if he could take me.</span> <span id="s213">And I said I have no money.</span> <span id="s214">He said okay.</span> <span id="s215">These times were different.</span> <span id="s216">People had some sort of -- I don’t know, not obligation, but they felt like helping one another, because the survivors were streaming back.</span> <span id="s217">So this man ow -- took me to his truck, and the funny part of it is that he stopped in one city and he left the truck to go to eat, and he didn’t think that I -- of me, that I’m hungry.</span> <span id="s218">Which -- which was sil -- really silly.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">Q: So you didn’t eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s220">A: I didn’t eat.</span> <span id="s221">I don’t remember -- you see, certain things are faded in my memory because they are not of major importance.</span> <span id="s222">We eventually reached Lódz.</span> <span id="s223">We -- he let me out on a street, after all, this is my city, and Lódz was not really destroyed, because ra -- Lódz was occupied after few days.</span> <span id="s224">It’s not too far from the German border, so it was occupied pretty much untouched.</span> <span id="s225">Few buildings I think we lost, and I knew my way around.</span> <span id="s226">So I went to m -- he -- he dropped me off in my vicinity on the -- the house that I lived in, the Dineska, 31A, still stood, very nice house, four story house, a corner.</span> <span id="s227">And I went in and there was the superintendent who works for us, because the building belonged to my family.</span> <span id="s228">And he crossed himself when he saw me.</span> <span id="s229">His greeting to me was surprise, and why did I return, how did I survive, and why did I come back?</span> <span id="s230">He said, you can’t go upstairs because people live there, and the Germans took everything out of your place, everything.</span> <span id="s231">Carpets, and -- there is nothing left.</span> <span id="s232">But I said I w -- I still would like to go -- did somebody come back?</span> <span id="s233">Anybody came here?</span> <span id="s234">He said nobody did.</span> <span id="s235">But I still walked to my apartment and rang the bell, and they wouldn’t let me in, the people who lived there.</span> <span id="s236">You see, Polish people were not really very friendly, and this is mi -- putting mildly.</span> <span id="s237">I went downstairs and the st -- intendent -- the superintendent of the building told me that two blocks away, or three blocks away, there was a office by Jewish -- I don’t know if this was HIAS, Jewish committee set up an office, and there were lists of people who came back, or who inquired, or who survived, and that’s where I went.</span> <span id="s238">And when I s-scanned the list, I didn’t see any names from my family, any at all, but I saw a name of my school girlfriend, and her address, which was not too far.</span> <span id="s239">And I went to her apartment.</span> <span id="s240">She lived with her husband, she was very happy to see me.</span> <span id="s241">She survived with her husband, she got married in ghetto.</span> <span id="s242">And when ghetto was being liquidated completely, after the great liquidations, there were two groups left.</span> <span id="s243">One group that I was with my mother in the hospital in on Wargevnitska.</span> <span id="s244">And the second group of 500 people, I believe, on Iyakuba in hiding.</span> <span id="s245">This is the only group that did not leave fa -- Lódz, and survived in hiding because the Russians came to Poland just in time.</span> <span id="s246">We were taken at the last moment, in November.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: How did you -- how did you feel, though, when you see no names from your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: [indecipherable] The emptiness, and the futility of survival.</span> <span id="s249">The futility of the years of wishing and wanting and yearning to see somebody, to -- to live again, to -- the life was very bleak, that I had -- my feelings were that it wasn't worth survival.</span> <span id="s250">I didn’t know why I was chosen to survive.</span> <span id="s251">You must know that at that time I was not well, I had bandages on me, I had no money, I had no possessions.</span> <span id="s252">I went to my friend, I had some tapes put around me.</span> <span id="s253">You would be surprised how you can survive, how strong we are.</span> <span id="s254">The circumstances are just unbelievable.</span> <span id="s255">M-My friend at this time, with her husband, were already in a very nice apartment, and they lived some sort of normalized life.</span> <span id="s256">He was occupied with some enterprise, earning money, and I didn’t feel very much wanted, since I did not have any family left, and Polish people did not greet me very nicely.</span> <span id="s257">And I remember distinctly my bitterness that my Polish girlfriends did not come to see me when I went to ghetto, not one of them.</span> <span id="s258">My dear friends from school, of all these years.</span> <span id="s259">I decided to leave Poland.</span> <span id="s260">We have heard of displaced person camps in Germany, people who survived wi -- camps.</span> <span id="s261">And there was another girl who survived as well, and I knew her, and the two of us decided to leave Poland and go to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: This would probably be a good place to change, to stop --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: This concludes tape one, side A, interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span></p> <p><span id="s265">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span> <span id="s267">This is tape number one, side B. Before we go on to Germany then, let me ask you this, how -- what got you through all of this?</span> <span id="s268">How do you think you -- you survived?</span> <span id="s269">Was there anything in particular?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">A: I -- I ask myself that question many, many times, because it is -- it seems to me improbable now.</span> <span id="s271">How did I cope with the situation?</span> <span id="s272">How did I survive, and why it was me.</span> <span id="s273">It was combined with a sense of deep guilt that I was the one who survived.</span> <span id="s274">Why I?</span> <span id="s275">I didn’t feel worth it.</span> <span id="s276">There were people who were better in my family than I, and they didn’t survive.</span> <span id="s277">They were younger, and some older.</span> <span id="s278">How did I go -- how did I have this burst of energy to proceed to leave Poland, to think about it?</span> <span id="s279">Maybe it was the -- the deep sense of bitterness towards people that I knew before the war who betrayed me, because I thought this was betrayal.</span> <span id="s280">These were people who were coming to my home, sleeping and eating, and I was helping them with work.</span> <span id="s281">I was fairly good student.</span> <span id="s282">And they did not know me when the war started.</span> <span id="s283">So leaving Poland was not as traumatic because there was nothing that I was leaving behind.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: How did you leave, what [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s285">A: That’s -- th-th -- these are amazing stories.</span> <span id="s286">You know, my -- my -- my -- my life is a -- like a kaleidoscope of different moments that collectively saved me.</span> <span id="s287">And it -- they came in the -- just the right moment.</span> <span id="s288">When I decided to leave with my friend Irka, her name was Irka, and strangely enough we shared the last name.</span> <span id="s289">We were not -- we were not related, but we were both Fisher.</span> <span id="s290">We decided to leave Poland and my friend, in whose home I was staying, said to me, you know, I’ll give you a couple of zlotys, which was the Polish money, very little, and she gave me two bottle of vodka.</span> <span id="s291">She said, this is a very good trading mark with the Russians, if you need it.</span> <span id="s292">And it proved to be true.</span> <span id="s293">We were not bothered by any luggage because we had no possessions, neither one of us.</span> <span id="s294">Can you imagine this?</span> <span id="s295">I still wonder about it.</span> <span id="s296">The two of us went, we reached Posen -- Posinine -- Polish Posnine, Posen in German, a university city which was on -- near the border, and we wanted to board a train which was going to Germany.</span> <span id="s297">Now how do you board the train when you have no money or anything?</span> <span id="s298">Just so happened on this station, there -- there were -- the whole Russian contingent of soldiers were sitting around waiting for this train.</span> <span id="s299">And Irka and I decided to find one of the Russians, maybe he’s Jewish, so he would help us.</span> <span id="s300">So we said to -- how do you find the Jew?</span> <span id="s301">How does Jew look like?</span> <span id="s302">Wha -- wa -- how we can judge?</span> <span id="s303">We have to -- to chance.</span> <span id="s304">Or maybe we’ll find somebody who is decent enough to help us.</span> <span id="s305">And we still have these vodka, covered of course, because the Russians and vodka, it’s -- we walked -- they were making remarks as we were passing by, and we saw one tall individual in very long coat, reaching his ankles, with a very prominent nose.</span> <span id="s306">And we said, do you think he might be Jewish?</span> <span id="s307">He was an officer, he had some insignia.</span> <span id="s308">And we approached him, and we asked -- we knew the few words in Russian, Ve evrai means Jew in Russian.</span> <span id="s309">Ve evrai, and he said da.</span> <span id="s310">Oh, that was first relief.</span> <span id="s311">We are little Polish, little Russian, we are two girls that are Jewish, the families were killed.</span> <span id="s312">We have nobody.</span> <span id="s313">We want to leave Poland to go to displaced person camp.</span> <span id="s314">He offered to help us.</span> <span id="s315">He took us to his compartment, took his filthy coat, the dirty pea coat, put us in the corner, and covered us with this -- hanged this on a hook and covered us with this stinky coat, and he said, don’t make a sound.</span> <span id="s316">And when the train started, he gave us some bread.</span> <span id="s317">He was very ni -- he -- we gave him the vodka, we were so delighted.</span> <span id="s318">And he said he was a dentist, and he said to us, don’t go east, go west.</span> <span id="s319">And he said if he would have his wife, which was in one of the Russian cities [indecipherable] he wouldn’t go back either.</span> <span id="s320">It -- it’s unbelievable this -- the situations that I was involved with, the people that I met, the people that did help me, that -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- it’s a story after story after story.</span> <span id="s321">And we reached Berlin after -- after stopping th -- at the border where we heard screaming because some women were being raped.</span> <span id="s322">I suppose German woman were being raped by the Russians, and we were still under that coat, and we reached Berlin station, we got off, we thank him.</span> <span id="s323">We found two men that looked to us Jewish, and they were, and they gave -- put us on the bus, they paid the fare, they told us when to get off.</span> <span id="s324">Now, both of us spoke German.</span> <span id="s325">We got off and that was the first Schlactensee camp that we k -- arrived at.</span></p> <p><span id="s326">Q: And how did it go from there then, and so -- who -- who -- do you know who was ministering that camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s327">A: I have no idea who was in charge, because I -- I was not too long in that place.</span> <span id="s328">I don’t want to sound snobbish, but it was difficult for me to get used to it.</span> <span id="s329">They did give us a place to sleep and they did give us food, but we, both of us felt we would like to -- and they helped us to -- to get a room by a German family, the first one, Frau Beans, I think, I don’t remember, a war widow with a son and with her aunt.</span> <span id="s330">And we got a room there by her.</span> <span id="s331">It was not too far from Alexanderplatz in the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s332">We had some money, some ration cards.</span> <span id="s333">We lived like the Germans, on a ration card at that time.</span> <span id="s334">It was still unbelievable that we survived to this point.</span> <span id="s335">I did not have any joy of my freedom, because it was not the freedom that I was longing for.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: What would that freedom have been?</span> <span id="s337">Your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">A: My freedom would be, in my childish thinking, my freedom would be to be reunited with my family, and living a -- a normal life.</span> <span id="s339">Normal meant to me to be the cultural life.</span> <span id="s340">Something that I -- that I thirst for, I had hunger for it.</span> <span id="s341">That’s why Irka and I, when we have this room, decided to go to a movie one day, because we wanted to start some sort of normal life.</span> <span id="s342">And we went to the movie, which was German movie with Marie Carruk, I remember.</span> <span id="s343">I remember -- I don’t remember the name of it, but I remember Marie Carruk, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s344">And once it was dark and the movie was running, and we whispered to each other and all of a sudden we felt both us hands on our shoulders [indecipherable] and the Russians took us out of the o -- movie house.</span> <span id="s345">And we -- we couldn’t understand, we were absolutely stunned.</span> <span id="s346">Well, we spoke Polish to each other, so we were spies.</span> <span id="s347">Spiong.</span> <span id="s348">Crazy, crazy idea.</span> <span id="s349">Didn’t we go through enough?</span> <span id="s350">They took us to a si -- a station, Russian station commandantura, sort of, and they had so many people they were get -- catching on streets, people, Germans, that they opened that -- I remember a large wrought iron gates.</span> <span id="s351">They opened and they pushed us in and it was full of people that they caught from streets.</span> <span id="s352">You know, they were sending them to Siberia.</span> <span id="s353">And the two of us were there too.</span> <span id="s354">Just so happened that that very day, Irka had a very bad toothache, and we went to a dentist that the Jewish committee paid for, and he pulled her tooth.</span> <span id="s355">And it started to hurt her, and she started to cry.</span> <span id="s356">And she kept crying and they started to yell at her, they were annoyed that she was crying.</span> <span id="s357">And finally they were so annoyed that they opened the gate and threw us out.</span> <span id="s358">This is another moment that saved us, because we would have been sent with the rest of the people, God knows where.</span> <span id="s359">Once we were thrown out, and went back to our room, the very next day I said to her, I’m not going to st -- there were sectors, American, British, French and Russian.</span> <span id="s360">We were in the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s361">Schlactensee was in the Russian sector.</span> <span id="s362">I said, I’m going to go to American sector, or English, or -- anything but.</span> <span id="s363">Now, th-the -- the [indecipherable] that -- that train was going around Berlin to all the sectors.</span> <span id="s364">It -- at that time it was not close, you could get on and get off.</span> <span id="s365">So how do you go -- everybody had to be registered.</span> <span id="s366">You know, the German red tape, you have to be registered with polisi -- police.</span> <span id="s367">So what do we do?</span> <span id="s368">We were getting ration cards, certain rations from the American relief organization, Jewish.</span> <span id="s369">There was a rabbi, with a --</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Joint?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Joint -- Joint Distribution, that’s it, Joint Distribution.</span> <span id="s372">So we had some coffee and cigarettes.</span> <span id="s373">Now, to have coffee in Germany, you don’t need diamonds after the war, coffee was it.</span> <span id="s374">So our brains started to work, with this coffee, maybe they can register us in American sector.</span> <span id="s375">I can get rid of the coffee, anything just to get out from this terrible situation.</span> <span id="s376">And we left, we went to a police station in the American sector -- unbelievable, is -- isn’t it?</span> <span id="s377">It -- it’s -- it -- it’s like -- like make- up story.</span> <span id="s378">And we talked to the German who was in charge, and I said, if you put our names there, here is the coffee, we just want to be in American sector.</span> <span id="s379">He understood because he also liked to be in American sector.</span> <span id="s380">He took the coffee, he put two -- two cards with our names and registered us, and we never put a foot in the Russian sector again.</span> <span id="s381">We -- no, Irka got herself some friend.</span> <span id="s382">Irka was a flirt, she was very pretty.</span> <span id="s383">I was always scared.</span> <span id="s384">I was always scared.</span> <span id="s385">So I applied and asked, and -- I don’t remember this was this was this German [indecipherable] of police that assigned me that -- to that room.</span> <span id="s386">No, there was another camp, I was in another camp.</span> <span id="s387">That was Schlactensee, defin -- I -- I’m mixing up.</span> <span id="s388">The first camp that I was was on Oranienbergerstrasse in the ru -- Russian sector.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: That was the Russian sector.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: That was the rush --</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: Schlactensee was the American --</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: Schlacten -- Schlactensee -- you see, I mix -- I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s393">Oranienbergerstrasse was the first one, that was Russian sector.</span> <span id="s394">Then we went to Schlactensee, which was in American sector.</span> <span id="s395">I’m sorry, it’s so many years.</span> <span id="s396">And we were in Schlactensee, and we were assigned places of course, and -- and I was there for awhile, and I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s397">I just didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s398">I don’t want to go into details, I just wanted to leave.</span> <span id="s399">I wanted to live a little bit more normal.</span> <span id="s400">People were occupied doing things, going pl -- pl -- driving, making money.</span> <span id="s401">I-I was a lost soul, I didn't want to have --</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: Sort of black market activity [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Sort of, yes.</span> <span id="s404">The exchanging stuff.</span> <span id="s405">They were going to Breslau and back, to Brotswow.</span> <span id="s406">I was never that enterprising.</span> <span id="s407">So all I wanted is to have a -- a private room somewhere and -- and be left alone.</span> <span id="s408">And I went to the American Jewish chaplain and there was some sergeant there who ask me if I have relatives in the United States.</span> <span id="s409">So I said, all I know is that my maternal grandmother had a sister and half a brother.</span> <span id="s410">And the sister lived in Detroit.</span> <span id="s411">So I gave him the name that I remembered, because I had really nothing to do with them, and their name was Polsonsky, that’s all I knew.</span> <span id="s412">And we received the ration cards and Irka got herself a -- a -- a gentleman.</span> <span id="s413">And I was given the room by Frau Pegello on Tanaustrasseactsane.</span> <span id="s414">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: You still remember that.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: I still remember that.</span> <span id="s417">And there was a nice room, and I stayed there, and from time to time I was going to this Joint Distribution, getting my ration there.</span> <span id="s418">I still had tough times.</span> <span id="s419">I still didn’t feel that this is the freedom that I longed for, and I said what -- what life holds for me again?</span> <span id="s420">Wh-What I’m gonna do?</span> <span id="s421">I didn’t want to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s422">I didn’t want to stay in a country that I suffered, and that killed my family.</span> <span id="s423">I didn’t want to live in Poland because this was a country that I grew up, country that I loved, country that -- whose language and literature and music I loved, and where people with whom I grew up didn’t want me, so I didn’t want them.</span> <span id="s424">The idea of going -- at this time there was no Israel or Palestine, wouldn’t apply to me because I was too sick, I was not capable of any work.</span> <span id="s425">And America was the only solution.</span> <span id="s426">About six months later I received a letter from the Joint Distribution, they located my family in Detroit.</span> <span id="s427">Family that changed the name, from Polsonsky to Souls.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: That’s amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: It’s amazing.</span> <span id="s430">You see, as I said collectively, all these little things, like beads in the necklace, one was next and next and next.</span> <span id="s431">Evidently, when I have bad times, and doubts, why -- why did I survive, and all this [indecipherable] they say, well you were meant to survive and there was a purpose to -- to keep you alive.</span> <span id="s432">You propagate, you have a lovely daughter, and you have a wonderful grandchild.</span> <span id="s433">You have now small family, but it’s your own.</span> <span id="s434">I carved myself a niche in this liv -- living here.</span> <span id="s435">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s436">Q: We’ll talk about that some more, in more detail a little later.</span> <span id="s437">So how did you get to America then?</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: Well, they -- I had to wait for my turn for the visa to -- to this family.</span> <span id="s439">And the family, the half-brother of my grandmother lived in New Jersey.</span> <span id="s440">And his s-sons-in-law were attorneys.</span> <span id="s441">One was even prominent in Republican party.</span> <span id="s442">A water commissioner from New Jersey.</span> <span id="s443">So they speeded up the process of -- to obtain visa for me.</span> <span id="s444">And I was awaiting that result in this apartment, Frau Pegello, who after awhile warmed up to me, and wasn’t afraid of me any more, and Frau Pegello always told me, Fraulein Fisher, Miss Fisher, I am an old lady, I’m over 90, I have seen a lot.</span> <span id="s445">I was a Nazi and all my neighbors were Nazis.</span> <span id="s446">And now nobody was Nazi, only I. Well -- well, we ended up as sort of friends.</span> <span id="s447">I said, I want you to learn about me, who I am, and -- and we -- we parted on friendly terms.</span> <span id="s448">And I awaited that visa and the visa came through, and I arrived -- well, before I arrived, I went to -- wh-which port was it that I sailed from?</span> <span id="s449">Not Hamburg, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Bremerhaven?</span> <span id="s451">Bremer --</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Bremerhaven, I think.</span> <span id="s453">I think Bremerhaven.</span> <span id="s454">On Marine Marlin, which was an army transporter, used to transport the army back and forth.</span> <span id="s455">And this was another piece of injustice that I suffered, because we, the people who were -- some survivors that were booked on this line were put in the very bottom of the boat, and the top were reserved for the German war brides.</span> <span id="s456">So we were again nothing down there.</span> <span id="s457">To top this off, we s -- we sailed in December of ’46, and we encounter a horrible storm.</span> <span id="s458">We lost part of the bow, and we were 16 days on the ocean.</span> <span id="s459">Everybody, including the crew, was deathly sick.</span> <span id="s460">We were throwing up our guts, nobody could eat.</span> <span id="s461">And we were wondering if -- why did we survive to die in the middle of the ocean?</span> <span id="s462">And that was the trip.</span> <span id="s463">So -- and it was a gehanah.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: And then you saw New York, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: I arrived in New York, and we were pointed to benches, long benches, above which there were alphabet na -- letters, A, B, C, your last name.</span> <span id="s466">Mine was F, Fisher, so I was directed to F to sit, and I was sitting there.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Was that Ellis Island, or was that [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: No, no pier.</span> <span id="s469">No Ellis Island, pier.</span> <span id="s470">I don’t remember which one, but pier.</span> <span id="s471">And I was sitting there, and people were coming and picking up the -- the newcomers.</span> <span id="s472">Nobody was coming for me, and I know that my family sponsored me and knew that I was coming.</span> <span id="s473">I was sitting there, almost the last one, and finally I saw a gentleman walking by waving a photo.</span> <span id="s474">And the photo was of my grandmother.</span> <span id="s475">And I said to him, my grand -- in Polish, and he didn’t speak Polish.</span> <span id="s476">I said, speak German?</span> <span id="s477">No, he doesn’t speak, he only speaks English, American [indecipherable] only English.</span> <span id="s478">No Polish, no German, no Russian, no French, English.</span> <span id="s479">But he picked me out by hand and we walked out and there at the outside door stood an elderly gentleman with gray hair -- white, snow white hair with pink cheeks and blue eyes and I knew that’s my family because he looked like my grandmother, and that was her half brother.</span> <span id="s480">And this was his son-in-law who picked me up, he -- this was the lawyer.</span> <span id="s481">Now the story was that I was supposed to go to my grandmother’s sister in Detroit.</span> <span id="s482">What happened was that it took our ship to sail for so many days that the elderly lady who so anxiously awaited my arrival, died just prior to the boat docking in New York.</span> <span id="s483">And the family from Detroit let know the family in New Jersey that I am arriving on this ship and somebody should pick me up because they are her funeral.</span> <span id="s484">Story.</span> <span id="s485">And they took me to their place in New Jersey, and m-my great-uncle’s wife spoke Polish and German, and was -- this was the first moment that I had some warmth, that -- this older lady, whom I loved.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Did you see your mother again?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I have seen my mother after the war.</span> <span id="s488">In Germany.</span> <span id="s489">When I survived and I went back to Poland, and I went back to Germany, my -- I don’t remember these things.</span> <span id="s490">I was trying to locate my mother because when they parted us, they said that she was going to -- not [indecipherable] some place, different place, that there was a group of -- from our group was taken there.</span> <span id="s491">And I was supposed to be with them, but the -- the young ones like myself were taken to this Bittenburg to work in Arando, and they separated us.</span> <span id="s492">And my mother was in Strussen, so she went there, where we were supposed to be, by this German, I think his name was Zifer, who said you will be my group.</span> <span id="s493">Sort of like a Schindler.</span> <span id="s494">And I -- when I came -- l-left Poland, a-and came to Germany first, I was s-searching for her.</span> <span id="s495">And she was in Oranienberg -- Oranienberg-Sachsenhausen hospit -- but she died.</span> <span id="s496">She was completely --</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: But you saw her one last time?</span></p> <p><span id="s498">A: I -- I saw her.</span> <span id="s499">I don’t even want to think about it because th-that’s a terrible memory, so I -- certain things I try to erase from my memory.</span> <span id="s500">Subconsciously I’m erasing things from my memory.</span> <span id="s501">I don’t want to see -- I don’t remember the face of my tormentor who crippled me.</span> <span id="s502">I don’t remember the face of the SS offzeering for whom I knitted the sweater.</span> <span id="s503">I don’t -- don’t want to remember the face of th-the people who, on our appelleplatz, the man who sends the dog to rip me apart.</span> <span id="s504">You know the story?</span> <span id="s505">That’s amazing, this story, with this dog.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Yeah, you -- you told that story in the videotaped interview, the dog did not --</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: The dog did --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: -- harm you, he licked your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">A: -- he licks my face.</span> <span id="s510">The dog brought me to my consciousness, and the German let me live because the dog, the dog had some sort of understanding that I’m a dog lover, you know, there is some connection there.</span> <span id="s511">And something human woke up in him.</span> <span id="s512">He said, the dog let her live, I will let her live.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: So some memories are safer buried for you than --</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Some memories are -- I pushed away.</span> <span id="s515">Sometimes I don’t remember I’ve seen my mother, I don’t remember her face or anything, I don’t, I don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">Q: Let’s go ahead --</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A: It’s the guilt, the guilt that I survived.</span> <span id="s518">I just thought I wasn’t worth it.</span> <span id="s519">I had a cousin i -- my family was very modern, everybody had one or two children, period.</span> <span id="s520">And my cousin who was the only child, his name was Nicoden Pishen.</span> <span id="s521">He left the ghetto, smuggled himself.</span> <span id="s522">Spoke German -- all of us spoke German.</span> <span id="s523">And he decided he’s not going to stay, he’s young, he’s strong, and he speaks the language, he wanted to survive.</span> <span id="s524">He smuggled himself out the yudas -- the -- the -- the --</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s526">A: -- stars -- the stars, and he went through Germany, and my aunt received -- you see how strange of the German -- the order, they killed, and yet they were orderly in keeping the data.</span> <span id="s527">They sent her a postcard to ghetto.</span> <span id="s528">Your son Nicoden died of longensindong, of --</span></p> <p><span id="s529">Q: Pneumonia?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">A: -- of pneumonia.</span> <span id="s531">He was 16, I think, struck on the Swiss border.</span> <span id="s532">The Swiss must have turned him back or -- or he was caught just prior to -- I -- I pretty much think that they turned him back, and he was killed.</span> <span id="s533">So here they were killing people, and here they sent her a postcard, which maybe she would have lived for the hope that he survived.</span> <span id="s534">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s535">Q: We should -- we should stop here, this is the end of tape one, side B, interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s538">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span> <span id="s539">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s540">So now you have arrived in New Jersey?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s542">Q: And how was -- I mean, where did you stay -- I guess, where did you stay, where did you live, but also how was it to be in America?</span> <span id="s543">What did you st -- was it strange?</span> <span id="s544">You didn’t speak an -- no -- any English yet?</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: Well, I arrived in New Jersey because the family to whom I was supposed to go in Detroit, there the lady who was my grandmother’s sister passed away, and they let the New Jersey part of the family know of my arrival.</span> <span id="s546">I was picked up at the pier, and I stayed with them, since Detroit was busy with the funeral and the mourning period.</span> <span id="s547">I stayed for couple of weeks in New Jersey, and I developed a very warm friendship with the great-uncle, and his wife, who was an elder -- elderly, charming lady, speaking few languages, and she endeared herself to me, because she made me feel at home.</span> <span id="s548">It was warm, it was not anything material that I needed, I needed -- I needed love and affection, and that’s what she gave me.</span> <span id="s549">But after couple of weeks they sent for me to go to Detroit.</span> <span id="s550">They put me on a train in a very beautiful, luxurious car.</span> <span id="s551">I was sitting with the chair facing the window, turn around chair, I remember, and they gave the porter extra money to take care of me because I couldn’t speak the language, to bring me food and so forth.</span> <span id="s552">And it was a long trip, and when the train arrived in Detroit, a whole group of people ar -- were awaiting me.</span> <span id="s553">Now, at this time, I forgot to mention that when I was leaving Germany, I was still having some ration from the Joint.</span> <span id="s554">I had some coffee, cigarettes, and I never smoked.</span> <span id="s555">So I decided to change this for some decent clothes.</span> <span id="s556">So I received for my cigarettes [indecipherable] some fur coat.</span> <span id="s557">Some -- I -- [indecipherable] I-I think it was, and a nice hat, and I looked -- I wanted to look presentable when I was arriving.</span> <span id="s558">So when I arrived in Detroit in this coat, and white gloves, and I looked -- I suppose I was already nourished because in -- Joint gave us food, and in -- in New Jersey I was getting good food and care.</span> <span id="s559">So I came -- I -- I looked almost human.</span> <span id="s560">They were all stunned.</span> <span id="s561">I don’t know what did they expect?</span> <span id="s562">Some spectacle?</span> <span id="s563">Somebody wh-who is from beyond the moon?</span> <span id="s564">Who -- of course, I didn’t speak English, but here I looked like a lady.</span> <span id="s565">And they brought me home.</span> <span id="s566">The older lady and her husband were very nice and they spoke some German, so there was some communication.</span> <span id="s567">But they had only daughter who was, well, I must say she had two degrees from various universities, but that doesn’t make a person very bright, or very polite.</span> <span id="s568">And she made my life miserable.</span> <span id="s569">She resented me.</span> <span id="s570">I was the attention gathering point.</span> <span id="s571">My -- that -- that -- the daughter-in-law of this old lady that died wanted to be very nice to me.</span> <span id="s572">She was very nice lady.</span> <span id="s573">She was patroness of arts and music, and I could communicate with her because I loved it.</span> <span id="s574">And her daughter resented every single thing that I -- I did or said.</span> <span id="s575">They sent me to a night school to learn English.</span> <span id="s576">And this was a class composed of elderly people who came here very early as -- I suppose i-in the 1910 or 20’s.</span> <span id="s577">They worked all their lives and now that they were retired they were -- wanted to learn the proper language.</span> <span id="s578">So after a few weeks, the teacher said, my dear, this is not a class for you, because y-you will learn rapidly in a different class.</span> <span id="s579">And I stopped going there.</span> <span id="s580">What I really wanted was to have a good medical care, but my family, for some reason, did not take me to doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Did you ask them to?</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: No.</span> <span id="s583">I wouldn’t ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s584">Q: Did they know how --</span></p> <p><span id="s585">A: They knew, but this was healed by this time.</span> <span id="s586">It was crooked, you can still touch it, how crooked it is, but I didn’t ask.</span> <span id="s587">I -- I just -- I never partook of anything that welfare had to offer, or my family had to offer.</span> <span id="s588">I just wasn’t brought up this way.</span> <span id="s589">So, way -- since I was here, I did not bother with that aspect, and it wasn’t that noticeable at that time.</span> <span id="s590">And I -- I -- the family did not understand that I had pride, I didn’t want to be given few cents.</span> <span id="s591">I was walking without a penny in my pocket.</span> <span id="s592">Now, when -- I wanted to work, I wanted to earn some money.</span> <span id="s593">Now, they took me to a bakery one day, and I was supposed to sell bread and cut bread, but evidently I wasn’t fast enough, so after the whole day work, they dismissed me without pay.</span> <span id="s594">And I -- I came home and everyone said, you didn’t get paid?</span> <span id="s595">You have to get pay anyway.</span> <span id="s596">I said, but they didn’t like my work.</span> <span id="s597">So I didn’t get any pay.</span> <span id="s598">So that was the end of the bakery.</span> <span id="s599">But I still didn’t like being so dependant.</span> <span id="s600">I wanted to -- my independence.</span> <span id="s601">And I -- I was very unhappy with the daughter’s treatment of me, so I decided to get a job on my own.</span> <span id="s602">Now, Detroit has a large Polish population, and I went to that Polish sector -- these are people who live here many years, but Polish is still the language of the house.</span> <span id="s603">I got my serve -- sort of menial job working on camera cases, on -- I don’t remember exactly, but I think it was --</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: Don’t go quite so close to the microphone, just --</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: I -- I -- I think I was getting about 18 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s606">I -- those days, I -- and my family -- so-called family was absolutely stunned.</span> <span id="s607">You don’t have to work, you have bed, and you have food, and you have -- I want to be independent.</span> <span id="s608">I don’t want to ask for 10 cents, if I want ice cream cone for instance, I just don’t want to.</span> <span id="s609">So I decided to save the money enough for a ticket to go back to New York, and to the family in New Jersey that I loved, that old lady.</span> <span id="s610">Now, the old lady with her husband in New Jersey, who was my grandmother’s half-brother, they were retired people in not too great financial situation.</span> <span id="s611">Their children were quite well off, but they lived a very nice, middle income group.</span> <span id="s612">And I got myself -- they accepted me with open arms, and I got myself -- I went to nursing class.</span> <span id="s613">By that time I was already rapidly learning the language, reading, going to movies, picking up quickly.</span> <span id="s614">And I -- I couldn’t go for three years, so I went for a short course in private -- private nursing to take care of newborn infants.</span> <span id="s615">I loved babies, and I didn’t have to speak to them.</span> <span id="s616">And I got my diploma, and my very first job that I had was with the doctor from the family who recommended me to another doctor, they had new baby.</span> <span id="s617">And I became part of their family, they -- they were just -- till today.</span> <span id="s618">Till today I am in touch with them.</span> <span id="s619">And my very first pay I gave to my aunt, and I said, now I’m independent, I can pay.</span> <span id="s620">And it was a wonderful feeling.</span> <span id="s621">But the -- the freedom had a fringe always, of guilt.</span> <span id="s622">The survivor guilt.</span> <span id="s623">And I -- I was not the very happy person that I was before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Could you -- could you talk to anybody about your experience?</span> <span id="s625">Did anybody ask you, did they want to know how was --</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Well, people knew that bad things happened to me, but they thought that by avoiding the subject they did not make me feel bad going back to it.</span> <span id="s627">And I thought maybe even for therapeutic reasons I should have talked about it, and I did not start my talking until quite late.</span> <span id="s628">It developed as my own project and it grew by word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s629">Q: Your public speaking, but not [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s630">A: My public speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">Q: -- private, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">A: In private, well we mentioned things.</span> <span id="s633">They knew about my back being scarred, and the ribs crooked here, and about family, yes, everybody’s gone, and everybody’s killed.</span> <span id="s634">Oh, that’s just terrible, let’s not talk about it.</span> <span id="s635">They thought that they did me a favor not to go back into it.</span> <span id="s636">But I felt that since we were getting on, getting a little older, and older, and something has to be said, something has to be aired.</span> <span id="s637">And when the museum came into being, this was for me a -- a tremendous step.</span> <span id="s638">But by that time I was speaking already on my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yeah, well, we’ll get back to that a little later.</span> <span id="s640">So you were -- you now had to work, and you felt independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s641">A: I felt independent.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Did you make friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: I made friends m-m-mainly were in the class, the nursing class that I was.</span> <span id="s644">I was a large group of people and I made some friends, I was invited for Christmas holiday, for the Christmas tree and so forth, and we became friends, yes.</span> <span id="s645">And the people for whom I worked, I was always very fortunate, I -- I worked for people who treated me as a member of a family, as an equal.</span> <span id="s646">Not like that cousin’s daughter who made me feel very inferior, and th-that’s what I said, you don’t need the college degrees to be absolutely a -- a miserable, evil person.</span> <span id="s647">Knowing intelligence from book doesn’t make you a whole person.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">Q: Did you take -- take part in -- in Jewish -- in the Jewish community and activities --</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Not -- no, not in the beginning, no.</span> <span id="s650">I am not really very religious person.</span> <span id="s651">It would be very difficult, even if I would have been, to continue being very rely -- religious.</span> <span id="s652">As I said in my tape, some people lost their faith completely, and some people died with the name of God on their lips.</span> <span id="s653">So my family, my father and my mother were no -- were very free thinkers.</span> <span id="s654">They were not very observant.</span> <span id="s655">My grandparents were.</span> <span id="s656">Th-The older family.</span> <span id="s657">And we spent holidays together, which the memories of this I treasure.</span> <span id="s658">That is the warmth, this is -- you ask me before what gave me the background, the strength.</span> <span id="s659">The strength, part of it, is due to the basic background of the person.</span> <span id="s660">Of the family, of the ethical, moral upbringing of the behavior and of the sense of obligation to society and to myself and I always said that, if people ask me about religion I said I -- I am not very organized in religion, but if I obey the commandments, I’m religious.</span> <span id="s661">It doesn’t have to have a label.</span> <span id="s662">I don’t do anything that they say don’t.</span> <span id="s663">And I -- and I do respect people and respected my parents, and I didn’t steal and I -- thou shall not kill.</span> <span id="s664">Yes, I am that kind of p -- th-therefore I am religious.</span> <span id="s665">So I never thought that I needed a house of worship to make me religious.</span> <span id="s666">A human being can be religious, like my father said, that God surrounds us in -- in the nature.</span> <span id="s667">When you sit at a bank of the river, as I did with my father, and we watched the flow of the water, and the little ducks on it, and the flowers and trees, this -- this is part of my religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Did you want to have a family at that time, and is that what you wanted your family to grow into, that kind of --</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: When I survived and came here, this was the uppermost thing in my mind.</span> <span id="s670">I wanted a child so badly, because I felt that I owed this to my family.</span> <span id="s671">I wanted a child to show Hitler that I conquered him.</span> <span id="s672">And when my granddaughter -- the strange part here is that I, my mother was not religious, my father was not religious, I was not religious.</span> <span id="s673">My daughter is not religious, but she sent her daughter to Hebrew school, and her daughter had Bat Mitzvah, which neither she, nor I, nor my mother had.</span> <span id="s674">And I spoke at that Bat Mitzvah, and at one point I said, if I remember verbatim, that some honorable people up there must be smiling today, because our seed survived after all.</span> <span id="s675">I addressed this to my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s676">She is -- she’s the one who is carrying on.</span> <span id="s677">So sometimes -- and when I was pregnant, when I wanted to get pregnant, my doctor said, this will be very bad for you, your back.</span> <span id="s678">It will throw you off completely.</span> <span id="s679">I said, it’s worth it.</span> <span id="s680">I had to have a child.</span> <span id="s681">I wanted to get married because of [indecipherable] you just didn’t have a child without being married that -- those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: Yeah, I was just about to say, before we get to your granddaughter, let’s get to your husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s684">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: How did -- how did you -- how did you meet him, and is he -- is he Jewish as well?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: My husband is Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s687">Q: Is he s -- a survivor, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s688">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s689">He was born in Germany, and his parents, a middle-class family, had six children, and in 1935 - six - seven, started to send the children out, one by one out of Germany.</span> <span id="s690">And they followed them in 1938.</span> <span id="s691">So this was wise, because if -- some very wealthy people didn’t leave because nobody could believe what would happen.</span> <span id="s692">I mean, it was just unthinkable.</span> <span id="s693">But they survived because they were just middle class people, they sent one by one the children here.</span> <span id="s694">My husband arrived here as a boy, went to high school and high school, and started university in Rochester, but had a very tough time financially, and had to -- he worked anyway.</span> <span id="s695">And I met my mother-in-law first, before I met my husband, as a -- as a nurse.</span> <span id="s696">And she was a dear, sweet, wonderful lady, who she -- when she lived in Brooklyn on a f -- low floor, the window was open and theres was sitting Frau Rochelle with cookies, and gave everybody cookies, and she was known in the whole neighborhood.</span> <span id="s697">And when she -- when I took care of -- took care of -- was it that child in the hospital?</span> <span id="s698">But I got to know her, and I visited her.</span> <span id="s699">And way -- she said, I have a son, a very nice boy.</span> <span id="s700">And later when she talked to Harry over the phone, because Harry lived on the west coast, she said, she’s not only nice girl [speaks German here], she speaks German.</span> <span id="s701">That was to her -- because she didn’t speak English, so to her this was just wonderful.</span> <span id="s702">And I met my husband, she went to west coast, her si -- her daughter lived in Oregon, and they sent for me, just like that, and I started -- first I corresponded with him.</span> <span id="s703">And I met him and we went to Justice of Peace, I didn’t have any wedding.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: So what did you like about him?</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: I’ll tell you what I liked about him.</span> <span id="s706">I met some people in New York that were interested that I -- but I couldn’t -- I couldn’t find really what I would have done before the war.</span> <span id="s707">I was not that desirable either, because I was not that well.</span> <span id="s708">I had to compromise somehow.</span> <span id="s709">I wanted somebody who’s nice, who has had some things that we shared, love for music, love for animals, love for nature.</span> <span id="s710">We are otherwise very different people.</span> <span id="s711">But I had to settle for certain things.</span> <span id="s712">My husband will like operas, I like classical music.</span> <span id="s713">My husband will read certain things, I love to read, I’m an avid reader.</span> <span id="s714">I enlarge my vocabulary, English, by reading.</span> <span id="s715">I went to community college to better myself.</span> <span id="s716">I -- I -- under normal circumstances, I suppose I would have gone on and on because, education.</span> <span id="s717">My husband, education is important to him, but he was not as fast in it, and he worked, he made very mediocre living.</span> <span id="s718">I was happy.</span> <span id="s719">I mean, this was not the most important things.</span> <span id="s720">I wanted to create a home and atmosphere into which I bring the child and teach her from the very early on, love for music, love for the word -- written word, and I succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">Q: Yes, you did.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">A: Yes, I succeeded.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">Q: When was she born, and what’s her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: Her na --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: [indecipherable] a little bit about her.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: My daughter -- well, when it came to naming her, my mother was Ann -- Anna -- Annemarie.</span> <span id="s727">So, Anna.</span> <span id="s728">My husband lost a sister in childbirth, her name was Rose, and I didn’t like Rose.</span> <span id="s729">So we -- we made Rochelle Ann.</span> <span id="s730">And aftia -- after awhile we dropped the Ro because the kids in school teased her, roach.</span> <span id="s731">So it was Shell Ann.</span> <span id="s732">And now it’s Shelly.</span> <span id="s733">Now she’s Shelly.</span> <span id="s734">And she -- she has Master’s degree in advanced English from England.</span> <span id="s735">She writes, and she works for Santa Monica college, for the students.</span> <span id="s736">Her husband is from England, he’s an attorney.</span> <span id="s737">And Alexis -- Alexis wants to be --</span></p> <p><span id="s738">Q: That’s your granddaughter?</span></p> <p><span id="s739">A: My granddaughter is Alexis, Alexis Danielle.</span> <span id="s740">She wants to study environment law -- environment.</span> <span id="s741">She wants to save the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">Q: Good for her.</span> <span id="s743">We’ll get to her a little later, I still would like to stay with your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: When was she born, and what kind of parenting ideas did you have for her?</span></p> <p><span id="s746">A: Okay, she was born in March 22nd, 1951, and I have to say that I was a little bit brainwashed being in United States, by Dr. Salk.</span> <span id="s747">Dr. -- no, no, doctor -- not Dr. Salk.</span></p> <p><span id="s748">Q: Was -- was he the famous --</span></p> <p><span id="s749">A: Yeah, yeah, the child --</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: Oh, Dr. Spo --</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: Dr. Spock, Dr. Spock.</span> <span id="s752">I had his book, this was my bible, because I didn’t know much about it.</span> <span id="s753">So I had Dr. Spock book, and I believed that the mother doesn’t work, mother has to be home, mother has to bring up the child.</span> <span id="s754">Well -- well, my financial situation was very precarious, we lived on a walk-up in the Bronx on the fourth floor, one bedroom, which I gave to my child.</span> <span id="s755">We slept in the living room on a couch.</span> <span id="s756">I believed in the education.</span> <span id="s757">I was singing to her, reading to her, and she had dancing classes.</span> <span id="s758">I -- I would have gone out without anything, but she had to have things that I thought were important, and she -- she was taught she will be polite, she was taught proper manners.</span> <span id="s759">Well, she became American very soon, you know, after the -- with school, and the peer pressure, you know, that -- she was fairly good student, not the best.</span> <span id="s760">She -- she did not try to achieve her potential, sometimes was lazy.</span> <span id="s761">But she developed very, very good background culturally.</span> <span id="s762">She is avid reader, she is avid theater-goer, she loves music.</span> <span id="s763">And Alexis plays piano beauti -- my daughter started to play piano but we gave up after I saw it was no use.</span> <span id="s764">It was no use.</span> <span id="s765">I had piano lessons and I wasn’t good either.</span> <span id="s766">So I must admit, I wasn’t good.</span> <span id="s767">My -- my -- my two uncles were pianists, but I didn’t in-inherit this, and neither she did, did she?</span> <span id="s768">Alexis plays piano, but also she’s not a pianist.</span> <span id="s769">She plays piano.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: How did she di -- how did you teach limits, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: A very, very difficult in United States, because she would say, her mother let her do this, or -- I said, well -- there was a saying in my house.</span> <span id="s772">She -- her best friend was brought up in a very free house, very free.</span> <span id="s773">At the age of nine, she could go [indecipherable] hang out, or go to a movie or something.</span> <span id="s774">And she said Annie can go.</span> <span id="s775">I said, you can’t go.</span> <span id="s776">So she used to -- she wanted to hurt me, she didn’t know how.</span> <span id="s777">So she said, you’re such a continental mother.</span> <span id="s778">This was the worst she could come up with.</span> <span id="s779">I was a -- I said yes, that’s your misfortune.</span> <span id="s780">I -- I set the limits on -- to a certain point.</span> <span id="s781">When -- Annie was brilliant, her best friend.</span> <span id="s782">No doubt about it, extremely high IQ.</span> <span id="s783">She went to Bronx High School of Science.</span> <span id="s784">My daughter didn’t, my daughter went just to high school.</span> <span id="s785">She was permitted to -- to do things, some her own.</span> <span id="s786">Her teacher told her mother that she reached the top, they can’t teach her any more.</span> <span id="s787">Annie became some sort of a failure in life.</span> <span id="s788">They still communicate, they love one another, they -- when Annie used to come to my house -- we lived in the same building, too.</span> <span id="s789">When a -- she used to come to my house, or -- I insisted on open door.</span> <span id="s790">This was one of my -- because Annie I didn’t trust.</span> <span id="s791">Annie’s smoking, and things -- what she was smoking.</span> <span id="s792">My daughter didn’t smoke.</span> <span id="s793">I said, I’m not going to sit and preach to you that it’s bad for your health, but I said, look what’s happening to these people later on.</span> <span id="s794">You -- you have brain, use it.</span> <span id="s795">She never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: You mean drugs?</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: Drugs and things.</span> <span id="s798">Never did.</span> <span id="s799">Neither did Alexis, I’m very fortunate.</span> <span id="s800">Neither did my son, you know.</span> <span id="s801">Well, he was brought up by very square people in England.</span> <span id="s802">So we were very lucky there.</span> <span id="s803">I never pressed on her any strong beliefs, she develop her own.</span> <span id="s804">You know, we had many arguments, a number of them, yes, because I tried to foolishly spare her some of the disappointments in life.</span> <span id="s805">But evidently you have to go through the experience yourself to learn.</span> <span id="s806">And I wanted to spare her the hard lessons.</span> <span id="s807">So sometimes it was backfiring.</span> <span id="s808">However, at the end she realized that maybe I was right after all.</span> <span id="s809">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s810">Q: Did she ask you -- did you talk to her at a certain point about what happened to you?</span> <span id="s811">Did she -- when was --</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I la -- I never made a secret of my past, but she herself had -- her -- her love for me is so deep, so intense, that she did not want to know the details, til today.</span> <span id="s813">She cannot stand listening to how they did it to me, and what they did to me.</span> <span id="s814">For instance, they pulled my wisdom teeth without anesthesia, learning.</span> <span id="s815">And at one point, and I don’t remember it was Ravensbrück, somebody pulled my teeth, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: For instance, when we arrived in Ravensbrück, we were subjected to the medical exam.</span> <span id="s818">We had to be stripped naked in front of the men there and put on the chair with legs up, I never saw this.</span> <span id="s819">They were looking for valuables, and -- and they were laughing because we were virgins, few of us there.</span> <span id="s820">This -- it was very humiliating -- humiliating, degrading experience, that she wouldn’t want to hear, and she wanted to spare me, le -- don’t think about it.</span> <span id="s821">When I had bad dream, don’t -- get away from.</span> <span id="s822">Til today she cannot stand my -- she feels sometime that I am too pessimistic, that I have bad moments, and she calls every night.</span> <span id="s823">Every single night.</span> <span id="s824">And no matter, even if we had argument, which we do, she ends up with I love you.</span> <span id="s825">Because she once said, I never want to be sorry that I never said to my mother I love you when she was here.</span> <span id="s826">That some people say it’s too late, I should have told my mother this and this.</span> <span id="s827">We are friends as well as mother and daughter, and that is wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s829">I have to change the tape again.</span> <span id="s830">This -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span> <span id="s832">This is tape number two, side B.</span> <span id="s833">So we just talked about your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: And your very close relationship to her.</span> <span id="s836">It just occurred to me that in a sense that you have not recreated, but -- but cre -- created something close to the relationship that you had with your own mother, and your grandmother.</span> <span id="s837">And now you have very close relationship with your daughter, and it -- one child, you were one child, too.</span> <span id="s838">It’s an interesting progression, and your grandchild is very close --</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Very close.</span> <span id="s840">As matter of fact, she was here this weekend, spent with us, went with her Papa to the zoo, and here -- and Nana makes what she likes to eat, and we have be --</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Nana and --</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: Nana and Papa.</span></p> <p><span id="s843">Q: Nana, that’s you.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s845">Very, very close relationship.</span> <span id="s846">As -- my relation with my mother was more formal than my daughter and myself.</span> <span id="s847">We are more friends.</span> <span id="s848">Where with my mother there was a -- a -- some formality, some respect, which here in the United States is a l -- sometimes a little absent.</span> <span id="s849">I sometimes wouldn’t dare to approach my mother in a manner that my daughter will come to me.</span> <span id="s850">However, we very freely express the love for one another, and my daughter calls me nightly, saying I love you, Mom.</span> <span id="s851">And I’ll say I love you, no matter how angry I can be at her.</span> <span id="s852">So -- and this is the closeness.</span> <span id="s853">My mother-in-law -- my mother, for instance, prior to the outbreak of the war, was being courted by a -- a physician, because my dad passed away couple of years.</span> <span id="s854">And she tried to keep me still very, very young.</span> <span id="s855">She used to come home in the evening, and she’d say, is the child asleep, and I was 14.</span> <span id="s856">So th-this didn’t happen with my daughter and me.</span> <span id="s857">That -- that was a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: Well, that was a different age, and a different world --</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s860">Q: -- still, it is a very close --</span></p> <p><span id="s861">A: Oh yes, very close fami -- yes, absolutely.</span> <span id="s862">This -- this is as -- as I said previously, this is my -- my solid background that -- the basis that gave me that push to survive and to live and to continue.</span></p> <p><span id="s863">Q: So how was survival in America, then?</span> <span id="s864">You continued to work?</span> <span id="s865">You had a daughter, what -- where -- where -- where are we?</span> <span id="s866">We are now in --</span></p> <p><span id="s867">A: When I got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s868">Q: Yeah, but when did you get married?</span></p> <p><span id="s869">A: December 22nd, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s870">Q: In ’49.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">A: It’s going to be 50 years this December.</span> <span id="s872">And we got married on the 22nd of December because he had day off on Christmas, and we had no money, so there was very -- just right.</span> <span id="s873">I remember a small, little detail, we went to the store to look for a wedding band, and the clerk said which one would you like, and I said, I would like the cheapest.</span> <span id="s874">Yes, because it didn’t matter to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">Q: It’s -- it’s lovely though.</span> <span id="s876">It’s a small, delicate -- delicate band.</span></p> <p><span id="s877">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s878">Q: So then the 50’s approached.</span></p> <p><span id="s879">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: Did you feel -- wa -- di -- do you remember when you began to feel comfortable in this country, or in your identity as American?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: The beginning was tough.</span> <span id="s882">I still had my European way of thinking.</span> <span id="s883">My upbringing.</span> <span id="s884">The -- certain things bothered me.</span> <span id="s885">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Like what, example?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Sometimes there are bra -- they were abrasive, the Americans.</span> <span id="s888">I used to go to the subway, and I used to get up and give my seat away, and people thought I was crazy, but I was brought up this way.</span> <span id="s889">I couldn't understand otherwise.</span> <span id="s890">There were young kids spread around with the legs sticking out, they wouldn’t dream of getting up.</span> <span id="s891">I couldn’t under -- this.</span> <span id="s892">In my mind, I criticized this.</span> <span id="s893">I ate differently, I used my fork and knife differently.</span> <span id="s894">I was different.</span> <span id="s895">It took me time.</span> <span id="s896">Not that -- funny part is I learned to eat chicken drumstick with my hand now, and I think it’s very comfortable.</span> <span id="s897">I really like it.</span> <span id="s898">But I wouldn’t dare to do it at home.</span> <span id="s899">No, the beginning was tough.</span> <span id="s900">And the lack of the -- the knowledge of the language makes it very tough.</span> <span id="s901">And then you see people who even were kind towards the newcomers, still called us uh -- these are the -- they don’t know much, they’re from Poland, what do they know?</span> <span id="s902">And I thought to myself, they don’t really know me.</span> <span id="s903">They don’t know my potential, and to them I was -- I was just the newcomer, a displaced person.</span> <span id="s904">What is a displaced person?</span> <span id="s905">A person who was chased away from somewhere and came here in order to rebuild their life.</span> <span id="s906">But that person, even though may not use your language yet, or your customs, can be equal, or sometimes even maybe superior to the people who criticize her.</span> <span id="s907">So the beginning wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: Did you feel that Americans knew about -- w-were they knowledgeable about th-the Holocaust, especially what survivors had gone through?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Nobody who is not walking in the shoes can understand fully what has happened.</span> <span id="s910">You have to suffer to understand somebody else suffering.</span> <span id="s911">My -- my experience with the family, for instance, with their daughter, she was minimizing everything, and I was -- I -- I wouldn’t talk about my experiences, because I felt that I created a disruption in the family by my coming there.</span> <span id="s912">I didn’t feel comfortable.</span> <span id="s913">I wanted to be on my own.</span> <span id="s914">So my beginning was difficult, un-until I went back to New Jersey and started working.</span> <span id="s915">And then I got married.</span> <span id="s916">Even after I got married, my English wasn’t -- getting better, not as fluent as it is now, I am more articulate with the passage of time because I made my business to learn the language properly.</span> <span id="s917">And I will never get rid of my accent, but I will speak correctly, hopefully.</span> <span id="s918">I don’t say don’t, he don’t, I mean, like, like, you know, you know.</span> <span id="s919">I try to avoid this, and I can see this in my own family, but th-this is something that makes me me.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: You should never lose your accent.</span> <span id="s921">When -- when did things get a little easier for you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: Well, when I had my child, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s923">I was very happy because I had the child, and I wanted a daughter the worst way.</span> <span id="s924">I was so partial to it that sometimes it scared me, because the doctor said I should -- if I attempt to have a child, I shouldn’t have -- try again, because of my health.</span> <span id="s925">So I said, oh, if there is any power, anything -- I wanted a daughter because a daughter usually is closer to mother than a son.</span> <span id="s926">And when I had a daughter, I was absolutely in seventh heaven.</span> <span id="s927">At that time my husband worked nights because he had 15 percent bonus for working nights.</span> <span id="s928">We lived in New York, and I lived on this fourth floor.</span> <span id="s929">And of course my pains came in the middle of the night when he wasn’t home.</span> <span id="s930">So we had prepared a telephone near my -- telephone -- maternity [indecipherable] sort of, and I called him, and the man downstairs came, he says, come down.</span> <span id="s931">I says what do you mean come down, I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- I have pains.</span> <span id="s932">I -- I had to walk down with my little piece of luggage down.</span> <span id="s933">It was a plain man with a car, who made himself maternity -- and he took me to the hospital in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s934">I walked with this little luggage, with the pain, and they ask me, are you married?</span> <span id="s935">Because who comes alone to have a baby in the middle of the night.</span> <span id="s936">So I said, what do you think?</span> <span id="s937">So this was funny.</span> <span id="s938">And of course, after I had my -- my daughter, I was absolutely deliriously happy.</span> <span id="s939">And I totally devoted myself to bringing her up.</span> <span id="s940">And the result is good.</span> <span id="s941">It paid off.</span> <span id="s942">And we are very close.</span> <span id="s943">We share many interests.</span> <span id="s944">Well, they are diverse.</span> <span id="s945">For instance, our taste in literature is a little different.</span> <span id="s946">And I adopted some love of the new music, because after all I had a teenager home, a girl, so I could tolerate The Beatles, for instance.</span> <span id="s947">But when the new groups started coming, I couldn’t take this, quite.</span> <span id="s948">You know, it -- an-and especially now, it -- it’s a lot of vulgarity and -- and in the movements and in the -- in the lyrics, so-called.</span> <span id="s949">And this is -- this is totally u-undesirable.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: When you began to make friends here, were they other survivors, or was it a -- a range of people?</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: No, strangely enough, when I moved to New York City, because I got married on west coast, we -- we decided to come back because my husband’s mother became ill with cancer, and I said, I lost my family, and I love your mother, we have to go back to New York.</span> <span id="s952">And I was pregnant.</span> <span id="s953">We arranged rides from city to city, sharing expenses until we reached -- reached New York.</span> <span id="s954">And we got an apartment at this walk-up in the Bronx, and I see my mother-in-law deteriorating, but she did see her granddaughter born.</span> <span id="s955">And I loved her.</span> <span id="s956">I respected her.</span> <span id="s957">What else can --</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: I asked -- I asked about friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: About friends, yes.</span> <span id="s960">We moved to this building in the Bronx, and there were no survivors that I knew in that building, but we became then the really good friends, because we were in the same, at that time, little lower middle class financially people, but with the same hopes and aspirations.</span> <span id="s961">We wanted our children to be educated, and th -- to have a decent upbringing.</span> <span id="s962">I learned how to play Mahjong.</span> <span id="s963">And I played Mahjong with the ladies.</span> <span id="s964">And they were one Italian lady, Connie, whom I adore, and three Jewish ladies, one in my building, two across the street.</span> <span id="s965">It was safe to walk out on the street in the evening.</span> <span id="s966">When I took my baby in the carriage, we walked to that park in the evening because it was hot, there was no air conditioning, and the apartment was s-stifling, and nobody was afraid because the times were different.</span> <span id="s967">And we -- I met the other mothers with carriages there.</span> <span id="s968">And the -- it wasn’t easy, but it was a happy time, because I had what I wanted.</span> <span id="s969">Of course, financially was a little difficult.</span> <span id="s970">We never hit if off really, but it -- it -- it -- it didn’t matter to me that much because I saw what can happen.</span> <span id="s971">We had so much and we lost it overnight.</span> <span id="s972">So, the priorities changed.</span> <span id="s973">What was important was to have good family and enough to eat and be dressed and go to s -- schools are free here, libraries are free here, which is wonderful.</span> <span id="s974">People don’t know, there are so many free.</span> <span id="s975">We used to go to Lewison stadium those days for free concerts.</span> <span id="s976">I took the baby in the blanket and we were sitting like in a amphitheater, around, and listen to concerts.</span> <span id="s977">It was free, it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s978">So if you partake of what the city could offer you, it is not the amount of money that people try to amass more, the greed is so enormous.</span> <span id="s979">They never have enough.</span> <span id="s980">My priority was not to amassing wealth, but wealth of cultural things, of good life, and I hope that in some measure, I achieved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: Since you mentioned The Beatles, let’s just say we are in the 60’s somewhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: Which events out of the 60’s, say, remain as events that were -- had an impact on your life?</span> <span id="s984">Can you -- whether here in the U.S., or in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">A: The Seven Day War, you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: I don’t know, anything that --</span></p> <p><span id="s987">A: Well, as I previously s -- mentioned, I am not religious, however, I have a strong feel of Judaic tradition in me, because it is -- it is ethical, it’s moral and it is misunderstood.</span> <span id="s988">And I thought that my people deserved to have their homeland after f -- millennia of suffering.</span> <span id="s989">And the creation of the state of Israel meant an -- a lot to me.</span> <span id="s990">I was deliriously happy when Israel came into bene -- being, because it gave home and hope to countless people who didn’t have it.</span> <span id="s991">I remember one event on -- at Madison Square Garden, there was a big gathering on -- that was on the eve of the Six Day War, I don’t remember the date, but Golda Meir was speaking, and I got there in, with a friend of mine.</span> <span id="s992">And they were holding that Israeli flag and people were just throwing money in it.</span> <span id="s993">And I had very little, but whatever I had, I put it in, because it was an -- I -- I was elated that the people deserved it, they should have it, and -- the homeland.</span> <span id="s994">So, I myself could not fit into the life there, because you have to be strong, you have to be healthy.</span> <span id="s995">My life I made in United States, I’m very happy here.</span> <span id="s996">I became an excellent citizen, my husband and I, because we are civically mind people.</span> <span id="s997">We are volunteers; my husband in hospitals four days a week, and I with my speaking and helping, and I was a school mother.</span> <span id="s998">I went on every trip with this class.</span> <span id="s999">I was always he- helping.</span> <span id="s1000">Of course, without remuneration, just because I thought it’s necessary.</span> <span id="s1001">And -- you know.</span> <span id="s1002">Yes?</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">Q: I -- I want to talk about in -- in -- in depth, really, about your work a little later.</span> <span id="s1004">For the time being, I would just like to ask you t-two more questions.</span> <span id="s1005">Did you go to Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: I went once.</span></p> <p><span id="s1007">Q: When was that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1008">A: After the Six Day War.</span> <span id="s1009">Six Day War, it was -- when the wall --</span></p> <p><span id="s1010">Q: So it was [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1011">A: -- in Jerusalem was liberated.</span> <span id="s1012">Now, the trip to Israel was, my husband had a sister in Israel, who was sent by the parents prior -- in the 1930’s, early 1930’s.</span> <span id="s1013">So we went to his sister.</span> <span id="s1014">And she had three daughters [indecipherable] were married and the -- the -- the sons-in-law took us with the car, we went to Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1015">This I have to say, I have to mention this.</span> <span id="s1016">For somebody who is not religious, when I walked in Jerusalem, this was one of the biggest impacts on my life.</span> <span id="s1017">When I touched the wall, something happened to me, because it was like a link in history.</span> <span id="s1018">I touched the wall that for so many years was important to my history.</span> <span id="s1019">I remember my grandfather having the sign for Jerusalem in his room, because every Jew’s hope was someday to be in Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s1020">I walked the streets that Christ allegedly walked, the 14 station of cross, and something happened to me.</span> <span id="s1021">I was walking on the cobbled streets that Jesus walked.</span> <span id="s1022">It was important to me, historically.</span> <span id="s1023">I went to the Mosque, to the Grand Mosque.</span> <span id="s1024">I took my shoes off, paid my respects.</span> <span id="s1025">I went there and I went down and I saw the huge rack that was supposed to be the sacrificial -- he was supposed to sacrifice his son there, Isaac, and God stopped him.</span> <span id="s1026">So all these things that you read -- I have books on -- on all the world’s religions here, because I was interested, the impact of Jerusalem, it was very deep, emotionally, spiritually, and -- and I thought to myself, if people only would know -- all three great religions are meet in this little place, if we could learn how to get along.</span> <span id="s1027">The Arabs say Salaam, and we say Shalom, it’s so much alike.</span> <span id="s1028">Both are Semitic.</span> <span id="s1029">Yugoslavia, all these people, it -- it’s religion divides them, why?</span> <span id="s1030">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1031">Q: Did you see the Yad Vashem, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: What -- what was that whole experience?</span> <span id="s1034">Did you learn something that you didn’t know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: Yes, I -- I learned so -- a very powerful lesson, I’ll tell you what.</span> <span id="s1036">Yad Vashem, when I went in, I was in the gallery, af -- that was only once, and so many years ago, and I looked in the somber, dark cham -- chamber, with the names of the camps.</span> <span id="s1037">I -- I broke down, I cried, because I thought of the people who did not survive.</span> <span id="s1038">And when I left Yad Vashem, and I opened the door, and I walked out, and that was very sunny day, and there was this street with the trees, and -- called the Avenue of Righteous Gentiles, with the name of the Righteous Gentiles underneath each tree, this was my greatest impact of Israel, because I was not aware, up through that moment, that there were Gentiles who did help.</span> <span id="s1039">This was the very first time.</span> <span id="s1040">Nobody told me about that before, I don’t know why.</span> <span id="s1041">That people did help, and people paid the supreme sacrifice, that people cared.</span> <span id="s1042">I thought nobody did.</span> <span id="s1043">And this, in itself, motivated me to speak and to mention this fact in most of my speeches, that there were people who were righteous, that there were people who cared, in spite of everything.</span> <span id="s1044">It was tremendous impact.</span> <span id="s1045">I always mention this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1046">Q: Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1047">Let’s talk about your work then.</span> <span id="s1048">When did you begin -- when did you begin to speak out publicly in a more cons -- sort of in a more concentrated fashion?</span></p> <p><span id="s1049">A: Well, I became -- I became more reassured in my English, and I -- and my daughter also said that I have something that I should share with people, that a -- maybe -- she calls this a gift, that I am able to communicate and impart of myself, and -- and present in such a way that it will be not offending to some people, but rather, instructional.</span> <span id="s1050">And I try to do my very best to -- to fulfill this.</span> <span id="s1051">I go -- I used to go to every place that ask me, anybody who was willing to listen, to schools, and churches, and public -- not really public, but groups of people that wanted to hear me, and I was very happy.</span> <span id="s1052">And when I started to see the results and the letters that I was getting, this became the impetus even more so, that I was able to reach some of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: What -- what did people say?</span> <span id="s1054">Say a little bit more about what kind of different groups you went to, and what -- what were some of the responses that you got.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">A: Well, as an example, I can give you for instance the Navy intelligence unit.</span> <span id="s1056">This unit is comprised of very young people.</span> <span id="s1057">And I always tell it -- I have to repeat myself that if they’re in intelligence unit, they must be fairly intelligent.</span> <span id="s1058">I have to say this because -- but they are also, at the same time, are very gung-ho, very -- how did you let yourself to -- to go this way, and to be done to you.</span> <span id="s1059">They cannot perceive that the circumstances under which we were, were so outrageous, we were not only persecuted and beaten and starved by the Germans, but the Polish population was sort of enjoying it.</span> <span id="s1060">Helping, and not helping us.</span> <span id="s1061">We tried to -- to -- if we could get a gun smuggled to ghetto.</span> <span id="s1062">Me -- I understood first in Yad Vashem that there were some Polish people who did help, but up til that moment, I did not know it.</span> <span id="s1063">There’s a whole wall of people names that did help, and I was in a shock, because I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s1064">My love was concentrated on the country of Denmark because what -- what they did, as a country, as a country.</span> <span id="s1065">They saved about 95 percent of their Jewish population.</span> <span id="s1066">And I -- each time -- in San Diego there is a little place in a Balboa park that has that little -- a Danish place, and German place, and Polish place with the flag.</span> <span id="s1067">On Sunday they’re open.</span> <span id="s1068">Whenever I walk to the little Danish place, and there is a book that you write, I say thank you, Denmark.</span> <span id="s1069">They don’t know why and who and what, but it makes me feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: So you are trying to communicate to these little macho young people that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: I try to communicate and you have no idea what a tremendous response I’ve got.</span> <span id="s1072">Now this was, I would say from the entire group, there was one Jewish woman lieutenant, and one half-Jewish.</span> <span id="s1073">That’s it.</span> <span id="s1074">They were magnificent, all of them.</span> <span id="s1075">They listen intently, they made sort of mental notes.</span> <span id="s1076">They ask question after my presentation.</span> <span id="s1077">They listen to my explanation.</span> <span id="s1078">I told them, yes, it’s easy to say, but the circumstances were such, we were completely helpless.</span> <span id="s1079">I said, do you know how many people committed suicide because they couldn’t do anything?</span> <span id="s1080">The world didn’t listen.</span> <span id="s1081">They -- there was a Polish representative who -- who reached United States, Jan Karski, he tried to tell them.</span> <span id="s1082">They didn’t want to listen, they didn’t want to believe.</span> <span id="s1083">So we were -- if the war would have been cut by a year, they could save God knows how many people.</span> <span id="s1084">They never bombed the trucks that were leading to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s1085">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Did you tell them about s-small acts of resistance, as -- such as your -- your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: I did -- my -- absolutely.</span> <span id="s1088">This -- this was a hit, because this sabotage, in their eyes, was a tremendous act of courage, which it was, because we risked death at every moment.</span> <span id="s1089">But at that point we didn’t care anyway, because we thought we will die anyway.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: This is a story, just for our listeners, a story that Blanka has told in the videotaped interview, when she was working in an aircraft factory, when she committed acts of sabotage, really.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Ye-Yes.</span> <span id="s1092">While -- excuse me, while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of the p -- airplanes, I noticed a small notation in a Russian script, done by the Russian prisoners of war who worked at night shift, i-instructing us what to do and how to sabotage.</span> <span id="s1093">When we joined the two parts, to leave a little bit opening at every third or fourth rivet, hoping that the force of air will force this rivet out.</span> <span id="s1094">And this was tremendous, tremendous thing [indecipherable] us, and -- for us, and the -- the young intelligence officers were absolutely s -- mesmerized by this story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">Q: Yeah, we should -- unfortunately we should stop here.</span> <span id="s1096">And this is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span> <span id="s1099">This is tape number three, side A. So, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the response from the Naval intelligence unit.</span> <span id="s1100">Just maybe elaborate a little bit more on what they said, and -- and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, they were very intent on listening, they were very polite.</span> <span id="s1102">And when I finished, I’ve seen few tears, I must say I did.</span> <span id="s1103">Because they were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too.</span> <span id="s1104">And then there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very frequently come up were asked there as well.</span> <span id="s1105">And one of them was how did we permit this to happen to us.</span> <span id="s1106">And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to them, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were kept completely prevented us from doing anything.</span> <span id="s1107">There were a couple of revolts in some camps, I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some ammunition, and even the Warsaw ghetto had revolt.</span> <span id="s1108">But in Lódz ghetto, for instance, where I was, it was impossible.</span> <span id="s1109">We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic population.</span> <span id="s1110">We could not get any gun for the life of it.</span> <span id="s1111">We were -- as a matter of fact, the people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation.</span> <span id="s1112">So -- and we were starved.</span> <span id="s1113">Now, if you are starved, you don’t have strength to pick up anything, how can you fight?</span> <span id="s1114">That’s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them.</span> <span id="s1115">Besides the spirit was completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being taken away, and knew -- by that time you already knew that they were going to places where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin.</span> <span id="s1116">The second question that very often I am asked is if I can forgive.</span> <span id="s1117">I believe that I even spoke about it on my videotape, and this question has two prongs.</span> <span id="s1118">The people who committed these horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive them, and I never will.</span> <span id="s1119">But the other people, the other German people, who did not participate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is nothing to forgive.</span> <span id="s1120">They did not do anything wrong.</span> <span id="s1121">So as I said, there are two parts of this question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: When you go to -- you go to other place, to schools for instance, what -- ho-how do you sort of experience a response there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Well, when I go to schools, I try to tailor myself to the audience that I’m speaking to.</span> <span id="s1124">If I am in a class of let’s say, junior high students, who are young children, I always tell them to close their eyes in the beginning of my presentation, because what they see in front of them is an elderly lady who has some problems walking, and they cannot relate too much to her.</span> <span id="s1125">So when I ask them to close their eyes and try for a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was.</span> <span id="s1126">I was a young girl, and I had shared the same interests as they do now.</span> <span id="s1127">I was thinking of my friends, and I was thinking of boys, and of secrets.</span> <span id="s1128">So I was young, and I was fairly good looking, and I didn’t have any other worries as -- if I g-got enough weekly allowance to buy myself something.</span> <span id="s1129">But of course, now I’m older.</span> <span id="s1130">So I -- I try to sort of bring them a little bit up to my level, and lower myself to their level and I go from there.</span> <span id="s1131">So when I speak about us as young girls in ghetto, they try to -- try to bring this to the previous saying, that oh yes, I was once young, and how did I got into the situation?</span> <span id="s1132">They listen intently, and they ask question afterwards, and they write me letters.</span> <span id="s1133">I’m a recipient of many, many hu-hundreds of letters, some of them which I sent to the archives, to the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">Q: In the end of this interview, maybe you can read a few excerpts from such letters.</span> <span id="s1135">I have some, yeah -- not -- not right now, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: All right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: But -- but later on, so --</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: All right.</span> <span id="s1139">There is a Catholic school here in San Diego, Saint Madeline’s, and I spoke.</span> <span id="s1140">I was invited there three times already, to different classes.</span> <span id="s1141">And I said to the teacher, but I’m repeating myself.</span> <span id="s1142">She said, but what you think the teachers do every year, they repeat themselves.</span> <span id="s1143">And it’s a different class.</span> <span id="s1144">As a matter of fact, some lay-sisters came from other classes, were standing at the door to listen, and -- and the receptionist always [indecipherable] they -- they -- they ask questions, they bright, they have -- they show that they have good schooling, and this is very rewarding to me, because if I can reach couple of them, then th -- I accomplished something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: Do you think the impact, or the impression of a survivor in -- in person, talking about it, is a different one than reading it from -- i-in books or seeing films?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.</span> <span id="s1147">And this is why I drive myself even though physically it’s getting exceedingly diffing -- difficult for me to do so, because I am disabled.</span> <span id="s1148">But I -- I -- I still try and -- when I tell them that they will be able in the future to say to some -- maybe their own children, I heard the story from the mouth of actual survivor, not from a book.</span> <span id="s1149">And there is an impact there.</span> <span id="s1150">And the children, especially the -- the brighter ones, they do respond to it.</span> <span id="s1151">They react.</span> <span id="s1152">And that makes me happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Can you think of an example?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: Yes, I can think of the example of -- which is the letter that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: -- from the high school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: I -- I looked for the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: And th-this was a girl in high school, in a very affluent part of San Diego, who has written me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Which one is it, this one?</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1161">And my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Oh, your glasses?</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: I had them --</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: [indecipherable] they’re just looking for -- over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1166">The girl who has written me, and I thought that was very significant.</span> <span id="s1167">As a matter of fact I sent a copy of it to Dr. Ringleheim in the museum.</span> <span id="s1168">“Dear Mrs. Rothschild.</span> <span id="s1169">Thank you for coming to our school and telling us about the way it was for you in the World War ІІ.</span> <span id="s1170">It meant a lot to me.</span> <span id="s1171">My views on white supremacy and hating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed.</span> <span id="s1172">Your presentation helped me realize a lot of things that I never even thought of.</span> <span id="s1173">I felt terrible to think my boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that broke your back, or hit your grandmother.</span> <span id="s1174">I’m very sorry for many things I have said and done.</span> <span id="s1175">I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand.</span> <span id="s1176">There are a lot of young people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors.</span> <span id="s1177">I know you made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things that I have said and done.</span> <span id="s1178">Sincerely, C. Hale.”</span> <span id="s1179">Now, the letter is grammatically very poorly written, especially for a high school student in an affluent area.</span> <span id="s1180">However, I made a dent in her way of thinking.</span> <span id="s1181">I made her think, and that is extremely important to me.</span> <span id="s1182">She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me.</span> <span id="s1183">That means that she -- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her.</span> <span id="s1184">Now, even s -- even small change.</span> <span id="s1185">If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that I have done some good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: You have spoken now for about 30 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: About, just about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1188">Q: About [inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1190">Q: What is the price that you pay for that role?</span></p> <p><span id="s1191">A: The price that I pay is my health.</span> <span id="s1192">It is getting extremely difficult for me, especially when I have to travel.</span> <span id="s1193">But I do not want to s-s -- keep that occasion.</span> <span id="s1194">If I’m invited -- for instance, I was invited to Duke University twice already.</span> <span id="s1195">And I went the first time a-absolutely on my cost, because I do not charge for my speaking, I feel this is my obligation, my obligation to -- to those who cannot speak for themselves.</span> <span id="s1196">The second time I was invited, and I was -- I was provided with a fare and a hotel, which helped.</span> <span id="s1197">But of course, nothing for the speaking.</span> <span id="s1198">And I received a booklet, beautifully done, because I spoke for two days.</span> <span id="s1199">The first day it was in a large auditorium which was filled to capacity.</span> <span id="s1200">Besides the students, there was also some contingent of faculty and ministers, couple ministers.</span> <span id="s1201">And the kids who came little bit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the floor, because all the seats were taken.</span> <span id="s1202">And the second day I spoke in a classroom.</span> <span id="s1203">This is a special course on Holocaust at Duke Institute at this year.</span> <span id="s1204">And the teacher of the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is Polish, was kind enough to send me a booklet comprised of the letters, he-headed by her own letter, and in which she said that she gave the students a task of instead of a final, to write a letter responding to Mrs. Rothschild.</span> <span id="s1205">And I have the letters, and this just very special to me, and a copy of it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the second copy I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">Q: Yeah, at the end of this interview we will read a -- a few excerpts from -- from that booklet.</span> <span id="s1207">But let me ask you also, when I ask you about the price, does it get easier to speak about it as the years go on, or do you still have a -- bad nights before or after, and bad dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: I -- I usually have, no matter how many years I will speak, there is apprehension before I go, because I don’t know what kind of audience or reception I will receive, and there is sleeplessness that is usually associated with it, and it -- it bothers me a great deal.</span> <span id="s1209">And then after I speak, and I come home, even though it was very good reception, I always have some thoughts that I omitted something important, that I should have said this or that, and that was of major importance.</span> <span id="s1210">But there is a sense of accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1211">Q: Have you ever mistrusted your memory?</span></p> <p><span id="s1212">A: I made couple of mistakes, even on my video.</span> <span id="s1213">I tried to -- to tell Dr. Joan at the very end, when I speak of my liberation, on the interviewer asked me the day I was liberated, I said, April 26, 1944, and it was 1945.</span> <span id="s1214">That’s one thing.</span> <span id="s1215">And another one was oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my mother.</span> <span id="s1216">I -- I just cannot say the right -- maybe this is this -- the terrible pain that I have in my heart.</span> <span id="s1217">And also, once I made a mistake on --in my speaking, when I talked about Bittenberg, which is the city that I slaved in Arado airplane factory, and I said that the city had the church on which door the Martin Luther affixed the 1905 thesis.</span> <span id="s1218">And in one speech I said Martin Luther King.</span> <span id="s1219">And they couldn’t take that King out, because it was too late.</span></p> <p><span id="s1220">Q: Well, we have corrected it here.</span> <span id="s1221">Do you do anything to -- just to -- to ha -- to stimulate your memory?</span> <span id="s1222">Is it -- is it fading, or is it still very strong, except for now and then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: A cert -- no, certain things are very deeply engraved on my memory, that I will always repeat it, and they stay with me.</span> <span id="s1224">But many things slowly start fading away.</span> <span id="s1225">And that’s why it’s so important that I did speak for all these years.</span> <span id="s1226">Yes, some things I -- as I said previously, I try to erase from my memory, like the faces of my tormentors.</span> <span id="s1227">But some -- dates, for instance, I don’t remember.</span> <span id="s1228">And I don’t remember what I wore when I left that camp.</span> <span id="s1229">I called my friend in New York who was also in a camp, she’s, don’t you remember?</span> <span id="s1230">I said no.</span> <span id="s1231">Then I -- I ask somebody about something and she said, Blanka, but I was with you.</span> <span id="s1232">And I didn’t remember that.</span> <span id="s1233">So the age takes over.</span> <span id="s1234">That’s why I’m speeding with my speaking.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: Did you ever go back to Germany, to Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: I was in Poland only after I was liberated, and once I left after the bad reception, I decided never, ever to come back to Poland.</span> <span id="s1237">I was back in Germany couple of times, because the German government recognized that they did impair my health quite badly.</span> <span id="s1238">They crippled me, and the condition is worsening with age, so a couple of times I was granted a so-called cour.</span> <span id="s1239">I was in a resort that the doctor treated me, and I received treatments, however what they gave me was not sufficient to cover all the expenses like flight and the hotel, so I had to stop going to Germany for that reason.</span> <span id="s1240">The treatments were wonderful, much superior to the ones that I’m getting here.</span> <span id="s1241">I’m going now to, so far, couple of times to Canestoga spa, which has some bath, and they are not quite the same quality and value.</span> <span id="s1242">But it does help me, so I do go there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: You never received compensation for slave labor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Not so far, I -- I’m receiving a gesundheitshan.</span> <span id="s1245">I’m receiving a m-monthly rent for my broken health, but now there is a class action for the slave labor and I filled the papers, and I hope that I will be able to -- after all, I worked in Lódz ghetto for a few years, in a -- is -- not factory, but this was establishment.</span> <span id="s1246">I was working making sweaters for Germans, they needed for the winters.</span> <span id="s1247">And then we were working on some cement place, making blocks for the buildings that were being destroyed.</span> <span id="s1248">And of course in the airplane factory until the liberation in the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: When you went back to Germany, what was your impression then of the country of the Germans?</span> <span id="s1250">Was there something that stays with you?</span> <span id="s1251">Conversations you have had, things you have seen?</span></p> <p><span id="s1252">A: Well, when I went there, I used to go to the spa.</span> <span id="s1253">In the spa there were many people who were coming for their vacation, and they were at the -- their very best, at leisure.</span> <span id="s1254">And if they ever ask me anything -- not a person that I met knew about anything, so they were quite innocent.</span> <span id="s1255">They did not know about the atrocities, they did not hear about the camps.</span> <span id="s1256">Anyway, the people that I met never, with the exception of the old lady in Berlin after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and so were all her friends, the doctor and the personnel in the spa were very nice.</span> <span id="s1257">After all, they were being paid for it, and the people that I met there were friendly with me, but then I met couple of Dutch people there who come in for the same treatment.</span> <span id="s1258">And there were a couple of people even from Israel that I met there, and the local population I -- I -- I made friends with a man who made me brace, because I have to wear back brace, I just put it on.</span> <span id="s1259">And in the beginning he -- his reaction was not too friendly, but after awhile when he got to know me, he became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1260">He and his wife visited us in United States.</span> <span id="s1261">He made me brace, for which he was paid by the German government, and he made me a brace as a gift.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Do you think his original unfriendliness had -- he was just a grumpy person, or did it have something to do with who you were?</span> <span id="s1263">Not you as a person, but that you were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">A: I really couldn’t put my finger on it.</span> <span id="s1265">He was not too intelligent man, but he was a very good businessman.</span> <span id="s1266">So he knew how to -- how to work for the government because he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not too many people nowadays know this.</span> <span id="s1267">There’s no industry for making this type of braces, so he was just about one of very few in all of Germany, and he cashed on it.</span> <span id="s1268">In the beginning why he wasn’t too friendly, well I was somebody strange, and maybe he thought that I resented him.</span> <span id="s1269">I had to go to him from Bad Kissingen to Schweinhold on train, but the next time when he saw me and he -- he met me, and he sort of liked me, he came with his car to pick me up, and spare me the ride on a train.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: Nice.</span> <span id="s1271">Did you have any anti -- did you hear any anti-Semitic remarks anywhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">A: Well, wa -- once.</span> <span id="s1273">People were careful with me when they knew that I was Jewish, but once I had an incident because the couple did not know I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s1274">And that was in a café and we were sitting at the same table, and they admired me, I’m -- to them I was somebody from America.</span> <span id="s1275">And they said, how do you like Germany?</span> <span id="s1276">And I said it’s very nice.</span> <span id="s1277">And they said, well it’s very nice, but too many Jewish people are coming back.</span> <span id="s1278">And at that point I excused them from my table.</span> <span id="s1279">At the same token I spoke -- my husband was with me the last time -- couple of times because I needed escort, I couldn’t travel by myself.</span> <span id="s1280">My husband and I were sitting in the park, speaking of course, English.</span> <span id="s1281">And an elderly gentleman with wife were sitting nearby and start the conversation with us in German.</span> <span id="s1282">And he became a friend.</span> <span id="s1283">He was there for his health.</span> <span id="s1284">And we went to the cafés together, and he was a very charming man, and he -- when we left for the States, they brought us very nice gift.</span> <span id="s1285">And we exchanged Christmas greetings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1286">Q: You also told me, and not on the tape yet, but I would like you to talk about it, that you had invited younger German people to your home in New York.</span> <span id="s1287">Maybe you could say something about that.</span> <span id="s1288">When --</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">Q: -- when was that, and what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1291">A: When I lived in New York City, prior to being on the west coast, we lived for 20 years in the city, we -- I contacted the -- The Quaker Society, American Friend Society, and I ask them to send a couple of students for a holiday for a dinner, because I wanted people from different countries to learn about us, and I thought that one on one, it’s the best way to learn about people.</span> <span id="s1292">And one day the lady from The Friend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German girl.</span> <span id="s1293">And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am.</span> <span id="s1294">And she and a Dutch girl came together to our house.</span> <span id="s1295">She was in the beginning very shy, and very sort of frightened.</span> <span id="s1296">But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite friendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment.</span> <span id="s1297">Yes, I think that the young people should try to reach and meet, maybe some survivors, or people who -- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond.</span> <span id="s1298">It’s very important when people try to understand each other.</span> <span id="s1299">After all, we are all individuals, we are all different.</span> <span id="s1300">We have different points of view, religions, cultural background, but we are all human beings, so if we try to overcome our prejudices, and reach a hand and listen, then the world would be much better, much better off.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Do you still have hope?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: Ah, that’s such a tricky s -- question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Honestly now.</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: Honestly I -- I am -- I am at times pessimistic, because I don’t see much progress in many parts of the world.</span> <span id="s1305">I’m afraid that the human race did not learn the powerful lessons that Holocaust and the previous genocides provided.</span> <span id="s1306">They are still going on around the globe.</span> <span id="s1307">And it’s not only Yugoslavia, but it’s in Rwanda, it’s in Sri Lanka, it’s in yugo -- it’s in Ireland.</span> <span id="s1308">Bo-Both people are Christian, only different denomination and they hate one another.</span> <span id="s1309">I -- this is the greatest divisor of people, religion.</span> <span id="s1310">And if people would really, truly were religious in their hearts, they would find a way to -- to find this common bond, and the link.</span> <span id="s1311">But truthfully, when I see the situation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia, I -- I am not too optimistic, sadly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">Q: This is the end of tape three, side A, interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild.</span> <span id="s1315">This is tape number three, side B.</span> <span id="s1316">So after the sort of skeptical statement that you have just made, maybe we can continue with some hope afterwards, because we are looking at a booklet now.</span> <span id="s1317">Maybe you should say something about that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1318">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1319">Q: -- and then we’ll read a few ex-excerpts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1320">A: Yes, on -- my last speaking enda -- engagement was at Duke University, and I spoke twice, one day to the third auditorium of student and some faculty and ministers, and the next day I spoke before a class which was instituted this year, specifically on Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1321">The class is small si -- consisting of a teacher and 16 students, and this teacher was kind enough to send me a lovely, bound booklet with some of the -- with the letters.</span> <span id="s1322">And she said she had high expectation for the class and student, and she worried, but eventually the class -- she was afraid that the class become desensitized by the narratives of horror.</span> <span id="s1323">But eventually she saw the transformation of students to deeper understanding.</span> <span id="s1324">And she said, “This is the moment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful.</span> <span id="s1325">It was your visit and your important message that coincided with this success.</span> <span id="s1326">The student had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide, and the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices around the world.</span> <span id="s1327">They had started to question their own complicity.</span> <span id="s1328">They asked what they could do for Kosovo, for Rwanda, for East Timor, for those suffering on our own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to testify for those who are forever silent.</span> <span id="s1329">Your dedication to social action that solidified this response from the students.</span> <span id="s1330">It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those who had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor bear witness.</span> <span id="s1331">All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email news -- newsgroup.”</span> <span id="s1332">And I will read a couple of excerpts.</span></p> <p><span id="s1333">Q: Yeah ga -- about five or so, because they are really important, I think.</span></p> <p><span id="s1334">A: Yes, by the way, they -- they endeared themselves to me because they all called me Nana, as my granddaughter does, who is part of this class.</span> <span id="s1335">“Dear Nana, some people come into our lives and quickly live -- leave.</span> <span id="s1336">Some stay for awhile, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.”</span> <span id="s1337">This is how she started her response.</span> <span id="s1338">Maggie Gandi wrote, “Mrs. Rothschild made clear not only her appreciation for the fact that we are studying the Holocaust, but also channe -- challenged us to spread what we have learned to future generations.</span> <span id="s1339">Therefore, I’m going to take from this class, more than the images provoked by any one passage or movie clip, are the words of Mrs. Rothschild.</span> <span id="s1340">The challenge that we not forget what we have learned, and that we bear some of her burden by passing our knowledge onto our children and peers, so the stories of the Holocaust are never forgotten.”</span> <span id="s1341">Another student wrote, “I had such a great time talking to her, not only about her Holocaust experiences, but about life in general.</span> <span id="s1342">I think that it took so much courage and fortitude for her to speak for over 30 years about -- 20 years, about her horrific experience during the war.</span> <span id="s1343">I just want to finish by saying that I admire Alexis’s grandmother so much for not only coming to talk to us, but for just volunteering to talk to anyone who is willing to listen.</span> <span id="s1344">I also admire her because she has such an air of dignity and pride that surrounds her.</span> <span id="s1345">I am definitely a better person for having met her.”</span> <span id="s1346">There’s so many.</span> <span id="s1347">[indecipherable] Let’s see now, I can’t find -- “In our final meeting the students presented me with a gift.</span> <span id="s1348">They gave me a picture from -- frame engraved with the words, we will remember, April 14, 1999.</span> <span id="s1349">Inside was a photo of you and I with the entire class, taken on the day of -- of your visit.</span> <span id="s1350">For me this gift is a lasting monument, a commitment that the members of col -- Holocaust testimonies will remain vigilant, strive for social justice, and educate future generations about the Holocaust.”</span> <span id="s1351">This is what -- she had it -- her letter with, but I wanted Melina.</span></p> <p><span id="s1352">Q: Take your time.</span> <span id="s1353">Just look for the ones that you really want to -- to read.</span></p> <p><span id="s1354">A: This letter I’ll -- I’ll read an excerpt from, is from a girl from a -- Kosovo.</span> <span id="s1355">Dear Nana, I’m writing this letter to thank you for coming to Duke on Wednesday.</span> <span id="s1356">I -- although I was unable to attend your formal talk, I enjoyed hearing your stories from an intimate perspective.</span> <span id="s1357">They’re extremely vivid accounts of your experiences in the concentration camp, and encouraged me to think more about the situation in regards to my relatives in Kosovo.</span> <span id="s1358">I am sure that those who have heard you speak will agree that you have made a tremendous impact on their lives.</span> <span id="s1359">I will never forget being moved to tears by your words and emotion.</span> <span id="s1360">I find it extremely fortunate that I was able to hear your experiences.</span> <span id="s1361">Again, I thank you so much for coming.</span> <span id="s1362">Until then, to your health and happiness.</span> <span id="s1363">Melina.”</span> <span id="s1364">And this is from my granddaughter.</span> <span id="s1365">“Dear Nana, thank you for doing something for me that forever will be part of my memories at Duke.</span> <span id="s1366">Your speech was wonderful and inspirational as us -- always.</span> <span id="s1367">The presence that you have while speaking to o -- strangers, bearing your soul and revealing some of your most painful experiences, astounds me.</span> <span id="s1368">As I have said before, your family can rest in peace knowing that you told and continue to tell their story.</span> <span id="s1369">You are -- you have touched many lives with your testimony, but you have touched me because of the person you ca -- became -- become after the war.</span> <span id="s1370">Your generosity, love and strength are your greatest assets and you have taught me well, as I now enter my senior year of Duke and begin to look for the road I will travel next, I will keep all that you have told me in my heart.</span> <span id="s1371">Thank you again for coming to Duke and for sharing yourself so unselfishly.</span> <span id="s1372">I love you.</span> <span id="s1373">Always, Alexis.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">Q: How does that make you feel when you read that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">A: Wonderful.</span> <span id="s1376">Wonderful.</span> <span id="s1377">Th-There’s so many of them here, it’s -- well, but Joan has it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1379">So you -- our listeners who would like to read more of those can find it at the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Yes, the booklet is -- I -- the teacher was thoughtful enough to send me two copies, one for me and one for the museum specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr. ronga -- Ringelheim.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: Well, since we are with the museum, let me follow up with a question about the museum.</span> <span id="s1382">How do you -- how do you see the role of the Holocaust Museum in -- in Washington, D.C.?</span> <span id="s1383">How do you feel about what -- what they are doing, or what they have done already?</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: Well, I express myself, I feel very eloquently about it on my video.</span> <span id="s1385">I -- I was absolutely delighted with the creation of this museum, because it is a tremendous tool, not only of showing people what has happened, but as a tool for educating people for the future, how to learn to get along.</span> <span id="s1386">How to -- how to see things from the perspective of different human beings, people who went through it, people who did help, people who taught about it.</span> <span id="s1387">The museum has testimonies of so many survivors, and they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are very articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and open their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons.</span></p> <p><span id="s1388">Q: I’ve heard some survivors be quite critical, though, of the fact that this is not a museum solely dedicated to Jewish survivors.</span> <span id="s1389">Ho-How do you feel about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: No, I disagree strongly.</span> <span id="s1391">I disagree because then it would defeat the purpose.</span> <span id="s1392">If it would be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial.</span> <span id="s1393">I think that the museum is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions all around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the museum.</span> <span id="s1394">It is a morally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the evil, but also to the goodness.</span> <span id="s1395">It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like myself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations?</span> <span id="s1396">Because we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last ones who will be heard from.</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">Q: Do you think there can ever be too much education about the Holocaust?</span> <span id="s1398">Because some people are also a little fearful that too much quote, fixation on the Holocaust takes away from more -- fr-from other aspects of Jewish culture.</span></p> <p><span id="s1399">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1400">I disagree.</span> <span id="s1401">This is my point of view.</span> <span id="s1402">You can never take away from the culture by teaching people how to get along with other people.</span> <span id="s1403">It is this -- my individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will agree with me, that the museum, it was created for the purpose of teaching people to avoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people everywhere on this earth.</span> <span id="s1404">Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now throughout the world.</span> <span id="s1405">And this museum teaches people how to -- how to understand this, and how to avoid.</span> <span id="s1406">How can the museum be a -- a -- o-only preaching about the Jewish genocide?</span> <span id="s1407">There’s genocide now going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1408">Q: D-Do you feel that there was a certain point in American history when people were beginning to be more interested and more knowledgeable about the Holocaust in -- in -- as -- as a whole?</span> <span id="s1409">Was -- do you think there was a certain turning point, or -- yeah, well, that’s the first point of my question.</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: I think that many of the survivors who became successful in their private lives were very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this museum, and they were able to support it financially.</span> <span id="s1411">And ever since that time -- there are other museums in different countries that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the Washington Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span id="s1412">Q: And how do you feel about sort of popular films and -- and sort of popular culture to -- representing the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1413">A: Well, I’m not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true Holocaust.</span> <span id="s1414">The movie “Holocaust” that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy tale, absolutely pointless.</span> <span id="s1415">On the other hand, “Schindler’s List” was a teaching tool.</span> <span id="s1416">I feel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in the beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make money.</span> <span id="s1417">However, eventually, by seeing the injustice and the h-horror of the German authorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people.</span> <span id="s1418">So this fi-film I believe it -- it was worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Do you -- are you a part of a s-survivor group, or do you -- do you socialize with survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Not really, because where I lived, I -- I have my few friends here who happen to be just American born friends, and not necessarily Jewish.</span> <span id="s1421">I -- we have a writing class, we have a reading club, and I also play Bridge.</span> <span id="s1422">I do not belong to the group which is very active in our city, of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can’t travel them and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can’t drive, they pick me up and take me with them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1423">Q: Is there anything that you would like to say to end this interview?</span> <span id="s1424">I have asked you what I wanted you to ask -- what I wanted to ask you and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">A: As usual, my ending would be first thanking the interviewer for taking the time, and being very kind, and asking me all the questions and traveling here in the very hot day.</span> <span id="s1426">And my philosophy is always the same, I try to persuade people to open their hearts, and open their ears, and thinking of -- that we are here on this earth, put on temporarily, and we should make the best of the time that is allotted to us.</span> <span id="s1427">Why do we have to fight?</span> <span id="s1428">What divides us?</span> <span id="s1429">We all are of human race, no matter what color, what religious persuasion.</span> <span id="s1430">We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along and to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that we have spread around the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">Q: Unfortunately, I have just thought of one more question, and that’s the very last --</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">A: That’s ok -- that’s all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">Q: -- I promise.</span> <span id="s1434">When you think back about the last 55 years, that’s a long time, it’s five and a half decades, is there something that you can say about that second life, if you will, that you have lived -- and are still living, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">A: Well -- well, my life as I would have thought when I was young and hope for the future, it’s very different from the one I pictured for myself.</span> <span id="s1436">For one thing I thought that I will go on with my education to -- to the -- to the nth degree because school was always my -- my favorite.</span> <span id="s1437">And my health problems prevented me from it.</span> <span id="s1438">However, I taught myself English well enough to be able to speak about it.</span> <span id="s1439">And I -- and I educated my daughter in the manner that I wanted to be educated myself.</span> <span id="s1440">And the next generation, my granddaughter as well.</span> <span id="s1441">So these 50 years, I am proud of what I did in my small measure, to -- to help.</span> <span id="s1442">And I can see that the help is in the form of the letters that I receive from people who listen to me, and in the next generation, my daughter and my granddaughter, who are perpetuating my dream of good life and education and -- and being close to the family.</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Thank you very much.</span> <span id="s1444">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with branka -- Blanka Rothschild, and this
