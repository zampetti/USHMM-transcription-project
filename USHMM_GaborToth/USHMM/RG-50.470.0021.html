World War</span></p> <p><span id="s3">II.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: Well the camp was uh [ahem] about two or three miles from town called Ludwigslozen.</span> <span id="s5">And I was with 18th Airborne headquarters at that time, under General [ahem] Matthew Ridgeway.</span> <span id="s6">Now um, we're told that uh our troops are advancing, had overrun a small concentration camp.</span> <span id="s7">And being a physician and a major, I was told to look into the situation and write up a report on it, and take whatever action was necessary, which I did.</span> <span id="s8">Part of my job was uh along the field of public health, so I might be on that concentration camp for a couple of days, and then I might be at a hospital where there were 1500 cases of Typhus, not typhoid but Typhus fever.</span> <span id="s9">People with a temperature of 105 for a couple of weeks.</span> <span id="s10">And um went to other hospitals, um, one hospital had a German general in it an- got captured him, [laughs] and took him back to army headquarters alone[?]</span> <span id="s11">.</span> <span id="s12">That was essentially the uh type of work that I was doing and concentration camp was a part of</span></p> <p><span id="s13">that.</span></p> <p><span id="s14">SWB: Had you heard about them, did you know what you were</span></p> <p><span id="s15">going to

course the Germans had left, had flown, and uh, looked around and I believe that the whole camp was only on about three or four acres and there was no uh, there were no gas ovens or anything like that.</span> <span id="s21">Uh, there was one place there where the dead were piled up like cardboard, and they wore these uniforms which were striped.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">[Ahem] And there were other people who were near death from starvation.</span> <span id="s23">So apparently I don't know why the people were sent there, I didn't get involved in that at all, uh, in the barracks, as I recall, now I'm 88 years old and what, and this happened 50 years ago, but damned if I can forget it.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">It's so, it had such an imprint on my memory.</span> <span id="s25">The uh, the wire in the beds of the barracks was barbed wire, how they could sleep on barbed wire I'll never know.</span> <span id="s26">[Ahem] Starvation causes a loss of teeth and a swelling of the legs.</span> <span id="s27">And this was very apparent in those that were still alive.</span> <span id="s28">And uh there was cannibalism there and in the barracks I saw evidence of liver having been eaten, human liver, they made a, opened up the chest and the lower abdomen and got out the liver, they could eat the liver when their teeth were gone, but they couldn't eat anything else without teeth.</span> <span id="s29">And uh, [Ahem], shall I just continue...</span></p> <p><span id="s30">SWB: Did the people who were alive, what did they do when</span></p> <p><span id="s31">they saw you?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: Well there were two or three women there who were in very good shape, and they were smiling and seemed to be very happy.</span> <span id="s33">I think that's probably because they saw someone in an American uniform, and because they were free now.</span> <span id="s34">Um, there were a few uh, they were lying on Working

inmates they were lying on the ground, in the last stages of starvation and death and uh, um, I had to write up a report on this, and do you want me to continue this way [ahem] um so the question was what did I do about it.</span> <span id="s37">Well, I wrote up a report, went back to my headquarters, and told them that [Ahem] made my recom mendations and said that the town of Ludwigslust is very nearby and I sai- and they had apartment houses there and I suggest we kick the Germans out of the apartment houses and move the concentration camp people in there and feed them, and we had to feed them very carefully, just give them liquids, otherwise you give them too much they'll, you'll kill them.</span> <span id="s38">Well actually we lost 25 percent of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">[Ahem] there was a, a captain, a Dutch captain and he was a Lunden Pole, a l- uh I me- I mean a Polish captain, and he was a Lunden Pole, and of course of the Russians, just loved to get ahold of them ______ Poles, Lunden Poles.</span> <span id="s40">And uh I said now look, I'm gonna have to leave here tomorrow, and I want somebody in charge, and I'm gonna put you in charge of this place.</span> <span id="s41">He said, but look, look at the uniform I have on here, I can't be in charge with this uniform like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">And I said, don't worry about that, I had some enlisted men with me, I said, look, go over to that apartment house, and get this, bring this man with you and get him five suits of clothes and make sure they fit him and look well on him.</span> <span id="s43">So they did that.</span> <span id="s44">And uh, then uh, they came back the next day and the 82nd airborne division got involved in this.</span> <span id="s45">82nd airborne was one of the divisions that was connected with the 18th airborne Corps which I was a member.</span> <span id="s46">And they had a funeral for the ones that died, and everyone in the town of Ludwigslust, I imagine the town was about ten, twelve thousand people.</span> <span id="s47">Everyone there had to attend the funeral.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">The men had to dig the graves, and

Page 4 about uh, oh I'd say about 30 or 40 graves there, and the graves were dug with such precision, that you wouldn't find an inch difference in the measurements of the different graves.</span> <span id="s51">And uh, so they [Ahem] they were buried there and the graves were filled with, and they put wreaths on the graves.</span> <span id="s52">I had, I got a lot of pictures, took a lot of pictures of uh, this camp.</span> <span id="s53">And I took a lot of pictures of the funeral.</span> <span id="s54">And the reason I was able to take pictures was that even though cameras were forbidden, the G2, a lieutenant colonel in our outfit, who was in charge of intelligence, was allowed to have army cameras.</span> <span id="s55">So I had a pistol, and usually I hate guns, cause I'm a medical man, [Ahem], and he saw the pistol and he wanted it, he was drooling for it.</span> <span id="s56">So, I said I'll give you the pistol if you'll give me a camera with plenty of film.</span> <span id="s57">So he said, okay.</span> <span id="s58">So I took pictures of that, and of the funeral and, I have given those pictures to you and I hope you'll be able</span></p> <p><span id="s59">to use them.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SWB: How do you think the Germans who participated in that</span></p> <p><span id="s61">burial felt?</span></p> <p><span id="s62">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: You mean what

exactly, it's awfully hard, I didn't ask any of them how they felt about this.</span> <span id="s66">I should have, I wish I had now.</span> <span id="s67">But I did take pictures of them and I have some close, distant pi- and uh, close-ups of women's, one woman's face and you can see in her face a look of sorrow, guilt, shame, it was all, I read her face that way and that was a close-up Working

the inmates moved into those homes</span></p> <p><span id="s73">of the townspeople.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: Oh yes, [Ahem] and [Ahem] we didn't have enough beds although we stole beds from the other apartments, and let the people sleep on the floor, we hated them they were Germans.</span> <span id="s75">And then, so we had to use straw, and I have a few pictures of patients sleeping on straw, l-l-lying on straw on the floor of this apartment house, which was now our hospital.</span> <span id="s76">And uh [Ahem] saw one of the men smoking a cigarette lying on the straw in the apartment house, so we had to prevent them from smoking, and uh, we lost 25 percent of them died in spite of our treatment, they were so far gone.</span> <span id="s77">I imagine that uh, we probably saved about 25, 75 and lost about 25.</span> <span id="s78">It was a relatively small camp, but a horrible thing oh God.</span> <span id="s79">I'll never forget it.</span></p> <p><span

okay.</span> <span id="s83">Are you ready?</span> <span id="s84">Well [Ahem] our troops overran this camp and the word was sent back to our headquarters that the camp was there, and my colonel, and I was a major at that time, and my colonel uh told me to come up and look the camp over and make a report on it, and make recommendations.</span> <span id="s85">So I had a jeep and a Working transcript:

approached the camp in the jeep and the camp was uh had uh barracks buildings that looked like an ordinary army camp.</span> <span id="s88">Two or three barracks buildings, open ground, and [Ahem] and one of the buildings, there was an opening and uh, it looked as though it was a place where they kept cord wood, but there wasn't any cord wood there, there's just bo- bodies piled up like cord wood.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">That's one of the first things that I noticed.</span> <span id="s90">The other thing I noticed was people lying on the parade ground, two weak to get up, just barely breathing, there must have been a dozen of those.</span> <span id="s91">And uh, [Ahem] then I was im- wanted to see what was in the barracks.</span> <span id="s92">So I went into the barracks [coughs] and found that the beds were adjacent to each other and uh, there was barbed wire, the wire in- in the whole, the whole-, I mean how they could sleep on a bed of barbed wire, I couldn't get any answer to that, maybe they didn't sleep there.</span> <span id="s93">But uh on, however, I saw in the barracks, on several occasions, several beds, bodies in which, in which there had been, had the chest and abdomen cut open, and since these people under starvation had lost their teeth and had swollen legs, and of course were very very underweight, skin and bones, starvation, they uh, there was cannibalism, and since they lost their teeth, they could only eat the liver without teeth, and it was apparent from several bodies that the liver had been eaten.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">SWB: Was there a small?</span> <span id="s95">A lot of people talk about smelling the camps before they got to the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: There was, strangely enough, I have, in

people.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">SWB: When you were in the town, did you and your friends find a bust of Hitler, can you tell me about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">ALFRED SUNDQUIST: Oh that was another experience outside of the camp.</span> <span id="s103">[laughs] A brass bust of, just a head of Hitler, it was a hollow head, so we used that for a football, I kicked it up and down the street, in a town in Germany and [laughs] hoping that the people would notice it [laughs].</span></p> <p><span id="s104">SWB: Tell me that story again, where did you find that</span></p> <p><span

other, I was only there for about a day and a half, and uh then the [Ahem] then the army took over, I mean we turned it over to the Army and [Ahem] I had to go to all the, many different hospitals, and all the hospitals that were overrun I went into to find out if there were any American or British troops, and I told them, they told me to ignore the French troops, but uh, Americans or British.</span> <span id="s108">And I captured the German general who was in one of the hospitals, took him to Army headquarters.</span> <span id="s109">That's a t- Oh and then there was another
