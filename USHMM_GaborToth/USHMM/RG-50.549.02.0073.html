id="s18">Answer: I was what?</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: You were very eager to come to --</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Eager, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: -- come to the U.S..</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: Sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: And I would like to know what did the United States represent to you at that time, and why were -- were you eager to come for reasons other than just accompanying your husband?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: Well, the main -- one word that can cover it all is just freedom.</span> <span id="s25">That would be all it is, freedom.</span> <span id="s26">The rest is, yes I came here with somebody I fell in love with.</span> <span id="s27">I was too young to calculate, is this gonna be better for me, let me get away from here.</span> <span id="s28">I still loved Europe, and my parents were there, so it was very hard to leave my parents.</span> <span id="s29">But coming here, it’s freedom.</span> <span id="s30">Freedom to think and freedom just to walk, and not to be afraid.</span></p> <p><span id="s31">Q: And when you came to the U.S., where did you live?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: With my mother-in-law.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: A very, very charming little woman we called -- everybody called her Bubby, and definitely she spoke only Yiddish to me.</span> <span id="s35">I mean, I was from Europe, I was Jewish, I spoke Yiddish, and that was it.</span> <span id="s36">There was no way that anybody could tell her, well no, she does not speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s37">She see a Jewish little girl, she speaks Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s39">And where was this, in what city?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">A: That’s in Youngstown, Ohio.</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">Q: And -- and was your husband going out every day going to work and you were at home with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s44">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s45">I had many interests I brought with me, and I will never probably lose them, that was one was my accordion, and two I did paint.</span> <span id="s46">So I went -- I went to a local museum, and I join a class.</span> <span id="s47">That is how I spend my -- the beginning of my life in America.</span> <span id="s48">And definitely playing the accordion.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">Q: Publicly?</span></p> <p><span id="s50">A: Well, the moment people knew I play, I was invited to play.</span></p> <p><span id="s51">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">A: I didn't sing, I just play.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s54">And what was your life like the first few years you were here?</span></p> <p><span id="s55">A: Youngstown, Ohio?</span> <span id="s56">Very primitive, very closed -- closed in, with not too many friendships.</span> <span id="s57">Nothing really going, but we were in Youngstown only a year, then we moved to Dayton, Ohio.</span> <span id="s58">From Dayton, Ohio, we were invited to see the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. -- that was a friend of my h-husband.</span> <span id="s59">And I fell in love with that city, I said this is where I want to live.</span> <span id="s60">And my husband was very understanding and said, sure, that’s where we going to live.</span> <span id="s61">We came here, started from scratch.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">Q: Was he still in the service?</span></p> <p><span id="s63">A: No, no, he was out of the service, trying all kind of jobs, as all the service people, when they c-come out of the army, til he settled down and started building business.</span> <span id="s64">Th-This was his family’s trade, construction and building.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">Q: And when you were in Youngstown and then in Dayton, did you attend synagogue there?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: Ye-ye -- not too much.</span> <span id="s67">I did go with Bubby on holidays.</span> <span id="s68">She was very religious at home.</span> <span id="s69">So I more or less realized that even if they speak Yiddish, they’re still a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s70">So that made me feel better.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s72">And did you -- did you talk to other people, maybe other -- other survivors, or did people know your story?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: There were no survivors, no, there were nobody -- there was really nobody from Europe in Youngstown, Ohio when I came.</span> <span id="s74">I was the only one and sort of was a little -- sort of a city story, this little girl came from Italy, a survivor and Holocaust and all that stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: And did you feel isolated --</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: -- or lonely?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Yes, yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: -- very.</span> <span id="s81">Very much, and I was expecting my parents, that was the biggest pain, because I was promised that -- that they would come, and mic -- I could bring them, and it was very slow, so that was kind of tough, to wait.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">A: Beside that I had -- I have Betty and that was already Washington, D.C., and I had Betty and the life started the other way around.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: She was the first?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: She was the first, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s87">What year --</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: And then -- wa -- once I came to Washington, D.C., it was a different change.</span> <span id="s89">Even the first neighbor I had, she had -- she loved music, and so -- and I played music for her.</span> <span id="s90">See, my whole life, it will be in your paper, all connected by music.</span></p> <p><span id="s91">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s92">A: I mean all -- all -- always looked for somebody who plays or sings, so we have something in common, because it started with my Nonna, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s93">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s94">And -- and were you playing the old songs from -- from Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: I was playing pop songs from Italy, honestly.</span></p> <p><span id="s96">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">A: Or folk songs from Yugoslavia.</span> <span id="s98">But I lived in Italy three years, so that’s where I picked up a -- a lot of pop music, from Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s99">Q: Hm, hm.</span> <span id="s100">And this -- wh -- what -- what year, more or less, did you come to the States?</span></p> <p><span id="s101">A: Oh, we’re talking about, let’s see --</span></p> <p><span id="s102">Q: I mean, did you come to Washington?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Wash -- Washington, let’s see, Betty was -- oh, it’s 50 -- Betty is 55.</span> <span id="s104">So we got to 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s106">And this was in the early -- see, if she’s 55, this was 1949 - ’50.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">A: Yeah, because I -- I got married ’45 in Italy, ’46 I came here -- ’47 almost.</span> <span id="s108">Then it was Youngstown a year, Dayton couple years.</span> <span id="s109">Something like that, but [indecipherable] little less than 55.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: In -- in those small places in the Midwest, were there other Jews, and -- or did you experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: You’re talking Youngstown, Ohio?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: And Dayton, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">A: Oh, they have three synagogues.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s115">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">A: They were mostly p -- Polish Russian -- mostly eastern Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">A: The majority of them were eastern Europe, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">A: All of them spoke Yiddish.</span> <span id="s122">And some never even -- I mean, the majority didn't even know what Sephardic is.</span> <span id="s123">They had no idea what Sephardic is.</span> <span id="s124">And I lived with that very uncomfortably.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: Well, that’s what made me sort of feel very nostalgic for what I left, that I considered the -- to be Jewish.</span> <span id="s127">See, I came from the complete different community where I really spoke Spanish.</span> <span id="s128">That was their Jewish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s130">Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">A: And all of a sudden here you are hearing a German sound, and I can hurt, just a German word would drive me crazy.</span></p> <p><span id="s132">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s133">A: And it was all around me, all the company that came to visit, all the -- all the friendships, was all Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">A: So my big plus was that I spoke German in school, you see, in Zagreb where I went to school, you spoke German.</span> <span id="s136">I mean, you studied German.</span> <span id="s137">That was the language that is really a daily lesson.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s139">So you could speak it, but you didn’t want to hear it.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: The sound was scary.</span> <span id="s141">The sound was frightening.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">A: Then later, I mean, I saw then I -- I came April nine, the Pesach, Passover was the -- the end of the month.</span> <span id="s144">My God, I saw the customs were the same, but the melodies were different.</span> <span id="s145">That again I was very nostalgic ab -- for the -- for the melodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">A: See, of -- of prayers.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: During those years in the Midwest, before you came to Washington, even though there were Jewish communities in both Youngstown and Dayton, did you experience any anti-Semitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">A: No, I did not, because I didn’t -- I didn’t have a contact with outside people from family, and family friends.</span> <span id="s152">I didn’t make these kind of friendships.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">A: So there was -- no, I didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">Q: And what -- what year then did your mother and father come -- stepfather.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">A: Well, we went to -- t-to Washington, we lived in Washington, Betty was born 1947.</span> <span id="s157">I guess around ’49 - ’50 they arrived to Washington, D.C..</span></p> <p><span id="s158">Q: Had they been in Italy that whole time?</span></p> <p><span id="s159">A: Yes, yes, they were in Italy, in fact, they were going to stay in Italy.</span> <span id="s160">They -- they felt at home, they learned the language already and my father started a little necktie business, and she was sewing for people, and they were -- they were very comfortable in Italy.</span> <span id="s161">Italians are nice people.</span> <span id="s162">They’re great people, they helped us a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s163">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">A: A lot.</span> <span id="s165">So Italian people, I mean, when I think home, I m -- actually, I really think Italy more then Yugoslavia because that’s where the problems started, so it left bad feeling, see?</span> <span id="s166">Bad memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s168">And what was the adjustment like for them coming here?</span> <span id="s169">They must have been in their 50’s or so by that time.</span> <span id="s170">It must have been harder for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, they were 50’s, the adjustment was very tough, it was all me, me.</span> <span id="s172">It was me and my children, that was their whole life.</span> <span id="s173">They didn’t speak the language, there were no other -- there were about four or five families in Baltimore.</span> <span id="s174">And we used to drive them there on weekends, and then they had a good time.</span> <span id="s175">But it was lonely, just me and my children, that’s all they had.</span></p> <p><span id="s176">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">A: Children.</span> <span id="s178">At the beginning just the one baby --</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">A: -- when they came.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: And did your father work?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Well, they were -- th-th-they were very independent, very proud, and my mother started sewing.</span> <span id="s183">We lived in an apartment building in Arlington, and all my neighbors knew my family arrived.</span> <span id="s184">They went to -- right away to the immigration school, to English school.</span> <span id="s185">They take the bus to town, study English, learn English, broken English.</span> <span id="s186">My father found a job, Mayflower Hotel in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s187">And she end up with a job with Pearl Kirsner of Connecticut Avenue, sewing, alterations.</span> <span id="s188">And they got themselves an apartment, N Street, Washington, D.C., very proud and happy, and old [indecipherable] place.</span> <span id="s189">And had a life of their own, which they wanted, they were very proud.</span> <span id="s190">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: That’s quite an accomplishment to come at that age and start over.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">A: Oh yeah, very proud.</span> <span id="s193">Well, survivor.</span> <span id="s194">That word means a lot, a survivor.</span> <span id="s195">A survivor has that touch to continue to survive.</span> <span id="s196">So it was in them, it was in me, and then -- then -- this is how it is.</span> <span id="s197">Most of the -- I don’t know how many you meet, but maybe you hear that kind of a story.</span> <span id="s198">A survivor learns how to fight to go on.</span> <span id="s199">Fight for anything to continue.</span> <span id="s200">My music as -- as my story is, or continue go to school beca -- continue be a doctor, which is a hard school to go through, I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s202">Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s203">In -- in the 50’s there was what they were -- were calling the red scare, here in the U.S..</span></p> <p><span id="s204">A: What kind of scare?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: The red scare.</span></p> <p><span id="s206">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s207">Q: And the hearings in the -- in the Senate about a -- you know, the anticommunism hearings, and lots of concern about communism infiltrating the U.S..</span> <span id="s208">What kinds of conversations did you all have about your former homeland, where communism had taken root in some form?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: A lot of our dear family went the communist way, the partisans --</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">A: -- went to -- to the mountains, fought.</span> <span id="s212">For that time a -- that time in life, in their life, that’s the only thing they could do.</span> <span id="s213">Again we go back to survival.</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: It’s not always that the idea is born in you.</span> <span id="s216">It becomes part of you because of the circumstances around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">A: So that’s what I remember.</span> <span id="s219">In fact, when we were interned in the Korcula, an island not far from Split, all my friends went to the mountains to be partisans.</span> <span id="s220">All of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s222">And you yourself had made that decision --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: The only thing I did [indecipherable] back is because my father went to Split to exchange my little accordion for the big accordion, and I couldn’t leave my mother alone.</span> <span id="s224">And she screamed don’t leave, don’t leave and they just left, all of them, the whole -- the whole bunch of young people.</span> <span id="s225">It was all around you, it’s not what you are, it’s what you become.</span></p> <p><span id="s226">Q: And after -- in the 50’s, were -- did you hear from any family members or people back there, were you in correspondence with people that you knew?</span></p> <p><span id="s227">A: No.</span> <span id="s228">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s229">Q: No, nobody.</span></p> <p><span id="s230">A: No, there was no connection with anybody.</span> <span id="s231">42 of them in Vlasenica, in that little city, a mountain village.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: And later on, as you know the story what -- I found what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s234">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s235">What about anybody in Zagreb, or anybody -- friends?</span></p> <p><span id="s236">A: Zagreb, yes I knew some families that were in Barre, where most all of them escaped and ran away to Barre.</span> <span id="s237">Not really personal contact, no.</span> <span id="s238">It was mostly Americans.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">A: Especially after I had my second child, when Betty was already, I think two and a half, I wanted to be American in the worst way.</span> <span id="s241">I wanted to cook American, I named my children -- Betty Lou, she hates that name.</span> <span id="s242">But -- she hates that name.</span> <span id="s243">But that’s what sounded good in America to me, hm.</span> <span id="s244">So I sort of didn’t -- didn’t even try to keep in touch with my people, as much as I wanted to be American mother.</span> <span id="s245">PTAs, you name it, I was right in it.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s247">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: I mean, that was -- would be the beginning of your interview, how we adjust.</span> <span id="s249">We’re just really loving this country, want to be part of this country, didn’t want to be a foreigner.</span> <span id="s250">And beside that, you just wanted to turn the page and start a new book.</span> <span id="s251">And you’d never go back, just go ahead and be an American mother, an American grandmother.</span> <span id="s252">They still call me Nonna, but I’m still an American, American Nonna.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s254">In the 60’s in this country, did you have any response to civil rights efforts here, and the segregation and -- di-did any of those struggles resonate with you in any way?</span> <span id="s255">The minority struggles in this country that black Americans were having?</span> <span id="s256">A: Yes, yes, definitely.</span> <span id="s257">I had a heart for any immigrant in cun -- this country, because I’ve gone through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: The black, as you’re asking, that was new to me.</span> <span id="s260">We didn’t have black people.</span> <span id="s261">It was very new to me and I had to adjust to that.</span> <span id="s262">I didn’t know how to handle this whole situation.</span> <span id="s263">So I didn’t go into it too much, I’m not -- as much as I said survivor fights, but no, in that case, I stay away from anything I didn’t know about enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s265">Did your children get a chance to know your mother very well?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: How -- how long did she live?</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s269">My mother -- well, they came 50’s, Betty was just a baby.</span> <span id="s270">They were with my children a good 15 - 20 years.</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: An -- and it was a Nonna who spoke of -- no, no, we -- I didn’t want them to call her Nonna.</span> <span id="s273">She was their grandmother.</span> <span id="s274">It had to be everything very American.</span> <span id="s275">And with the broken English, you know, accent.</span> <span id="s276">They were not ashamed of that like you hear so many stories that they’re ashamed of their grandparent’s ac-accents, because li -- by then I met lot of people who were survivors and the kids were very, very used to accents from all co -- from all countries.</span> <span id="s277">So in fact among us, my parent would speak to me simple Croatian, in one minute they would turn into a Ladino, or another minute in Italian.</span> <span id="s278">They lived in ital -- Italy, Ladino was at home, Serbo-Croatian was in school.</span> <span id="s279">So it was a mixture of m-made no -- there was no difference to them what language they speak, they would just go from one to another what fits that sentence, see?</span> <span id="s280">So that’s how my kids grew up, hearing all these different languages.</span> <span id="s281">And naturally, later on Ladino took over musically, because they all sing with me, the three of them sing with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: And perform and we traveled all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s285">Did your -- then your kids always knew your story, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Yes, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: They knew my story way back -- the first time that I wanted to go back, Laurie, my younger one was almost 16 and I decided to go back the first time with my second son and the younger daughter, the three of us.</span> <span id="s289">So on our way to -- to -- to the airport, my son Andy, who is a physician now in New York says well, wa -- your name is Cabilio, but then what is this Pappo?</span> <span id="s290">A-And a -- what is Vlasenica?</span> <span id="s291">Oh, he was all confused, too many things.</span> <span id="s292">Barre, Italy, Korcula, the island.</span> <span id="s293">Too many things, so I started explaining to them the whole thing of the mother being rebellious, living in the mountain village, and you know the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">A: And that’s what they sort of found out, the very different parts in this little book.</span> <span id="s296">[indecipherable] story.</span></p> <p><span id="s297">Q: This was on the way there?</span> <span id="s298">On the way there you told them the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s299">A: On my way to the airport.</span> <span id="s300">I -- I didn’t want them to get shocked because they were going to see many things, and go to many different places.</span> <span id="s301">So I wanted to sort of prepare them for it.</span> <span id="s302">And when we came to Sarajevo, the first thing we did, went to the house where I was born.</span> <span id="s303">That was a sha -- shabby looking place.</span> <span id="s304">And then we went to the Cornelius Center, started looking for the names.</span> <span id="s305">And my son Andy found the name of my father Pappo [indecipherable] Pappo.</span> <span id="s306">My mother married a Cabilio.</span> <span id="s307">It was a mixture of -- in a child’s mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: To o -- to take all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: What year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s311">A: What year was what, when we went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">Q: When you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">A: We went back -- Laurie, let’s see, Laurie is 44, and she was 16.</span> <span id="s314">That’s a good 20 more, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: Let’s see, she’s 44 --</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: That was the first trip back.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: -- she was 16 -- ’76.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah, that was the first trip back, then later on I did -- but this time I went back and I did not want to speak Serbo-Croatian to anybody.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: You didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: I came in as an American, and that was my goal.</span> <span id="s321">With American children, speaking English.</span> <span id="s322">That was my goal.</span> <span id="s323">But I had a cousin Berta, who I brought here now, she lives here in America.</span> <span id="s324">She lives now -- she works at the Holocaust Museum.</span></p> <p><span

with your kids and you were -- you wanted so badly to -- people to know you as an American, a mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">A: Oh yeah, dressed up in slacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s330">Q: And that you wore pants.</span> <span id="s331">You kept talking -- kept saying that.</span> <span id="s332">Talk about why that’s si-significant.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: That you wore slacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">A: Because you wouldn’t wear -- women didn’t wear slacks that time.</span> <span id="s336">Besides, half of Vlasenica [indecipherable] was Moslem.</span> <span id="s337">They all wore dymia you know, th-the -- the -- the balloon pants?</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: And com -- a woman in slacks, wow, you look at her right away.</span> <span id="s340">Who is she?</span> <span id="s341">But that’s all I wore, slacks.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: And your daughters too

id="s353">And what was it like for you to see this through their eyes?</span> <span id="s354">A: See it through their eyes?</span> <span id="s355">Once upon a time long time ago my -- my grandmother lived here.</span> <span id="s356">Just the realistic mentality of a child of 16 - 15 - 18.</span> <span id="s357">Andy was ready for college, so it -- he was about 18.</span> <span id="s358">Laurie was 15.</span> <span id="s359">Nothing crucial, heavy crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: I never did that in front of the children.</span> <span id="s362">In fact, they didn’t even know.</span> <span id="s363">They didn’t know the bad things.</span> <span id="s364">They just didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: Even when you went to Vlasenica?</span></p> <p><span id="s366">A: I can -- told them very lightly what happened, but all in all, I really made up my mind when I came to this country I’m going to have an American life, and I’m not going to burden everybody with sadness.</span> <span id="s367">I had a very happy house [indecipherable] our household, full of music.</span> <span id="s368">We just played music, we had lot of folk dancing.</span> <span id="s369">We had group folk dance -- folk dancers come to my house every month and we had -- had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: I-I -- I think maybe subconsciously I want to ma -- make up for everything.</span> <span id="s372">Have good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s374">Did -- but being there with you in that town, didn’t it cause them to ask more questions, and did they --</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: Actually they didn’t.</span> <span id="s376">Actually they didn’t.</span> <span id="s377">We walked town and they didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: It was a lot to take in, just being there, I would think.</span> <span id="s379">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: One day one of them should talk, maybe there was something that they kept in.</span> <span id="s381">But no, and people make fuss over them, Americans, the Americans, the American lady with American children, and hospitality and you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: Dinners, and they had a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s385">A: I did go to the house of my grandfather, but we are going back to the other story --</span></p> <p><span id="s386">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">A: -- I don’t think you were here for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s389">Did you go with them to Zagreb, too?</span></p> <p><span id="s390">A: Yes, we went to Zagreb, we went to the [indecipherable] to see where I lived.</span> <span id="s391">Took pictures of that.</span> <span id="s392">Again, it was sightseeing.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">A: I-I -- I don’t think I ever sat and cried, and poor me, this is what I went through.</span> <span id="s395">Never.</span> <span id="s396">This is why I think the children have very happy upbringing.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: There was no pain and -- and -- and dolore, as we say in Ladino.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: There wasn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s402">And -- and did you say that you did do some singing while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: I always sang, anywhere I went.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">A: Do you know this song?</span> <span id="s406">Hey, do you want to hear this song?</span> <span id="s407">I have this song, do you have these lyrics?</span> <span id="s408">I have these lyrics.</span> <span id="s409">Show it to me, write it down, tape record it.</span> <span id="s410">That was always with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s412">And Laurie and Andy, were they singing with you by that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: No, they were not.</span> <span id="s414">They were not into singing.</span> <span id="s415">I mean, Andy was a medical student, so he -- he’s one out of four that did not sing.</span> <span id="s416">The other three started performing with me.</span> <span id="s417">My first records came out ’82.</span> <span id="s418">They had performed before as children, I taught

them.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">A: No, it’s just -- just looking for songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">A: Just collecting -- mostly Ladino songs I was interested then.</span> <span id="s426">That already started, it came back to life.</span> <span id="s427">My mother was one of the four singers with her

want to have mother’s story, father’s story, they would start asking questions.</span> <span id="s481">And they were older enough to read themselves, to hear about the Holocaust, and they were star --

are, well why did you leave?</span> <span id="s489">Well -- what a beautiful place.</span> <span id="s490">And the story just falling in love with Daddy was not enough because what about -- why were

And everything is music.</span> <span id="s521">Everything is a song.</span></p> <p><span id="s522">Q: You mentioned that in your -- in your video interview that sometime in the late 70’s you were

that was the first time really, that I felt that maybe my music means something to local Jewish community.</span> <span id="s526">But it really didn’t.</span> <span id="s527">It really didn’t.</span> <span id="s528">They didn't know anything about it.</span> <span id="s529">And the first Pesach performance for one of the Jewish organizations was a shock.</span> <span id="s530">And it followed many other shocks, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Q: A shock for who?</span></p> <p><span id="s532">A: A shock for me to -- to see how much this community does not know about their own brothers and

see?</span> <span id="s535">So, I was asked to do a Pesach program.</span> <span id="s536">And my God, I brought all my songs from pe -- our Pesach.</span> <span id="s537">Eight days, there’s a lot of singing you know.</span> <span id="s538">And I went through song to a s -- to another song and the program chairman comes and she says, do you know any of our songs?</span> <span id="s539">I said, this is our songs.</span> <span id="s540">And I was heartbroken, because I’d practiced for hours.</span></p> <p><span id="s541">Q: What did she mean by our songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s542">A: Jewish songs.</span> <span id="s543">And boy, those were Jewish songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s545">A: But in Ladino, Judeo-Spanish.</span> <span id="s546">But that is when I really realized I have to start all over in this country if I want to do Jewish programs.</span> <span id="s547">For awhile I gave up completely and I went into international singing.</span> <span id="s548">Italian, Yugoslav.</span> <span id="s549">And I was known as international folk singer.</span></p> <p><span id="s550">Q: Right after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s551">A: Well, even before --</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: Right after that experience --</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: -- no, I had that feeling even in Youngstown, that what I do is really not Jewish to them.</span> <span id="s554">Just not Jewish to them.</span> <span id="s555">And I do come from a -- Nonna was very pious, she was very religious.</span> <span id="s556">Very religious.</span> <span id="s557">So I -- she put into me way deep, and I end up feeling most of the Judaism through music again, through songs, see?</span> <span id="s558">So when she said, do you know any of our songs, I said, these are our songs.</span> <span id="s559">She says no.</span> <span id="s560">And -- didn’t know.</span> <span id="s561">And then my first -- now, these are my musi -- mu-music experiences in America, is what you’re looking for, what a survivor f-felt at th -- I think this is what you wanted.</span> <span id="s562">There is an organization, Jewish study group in Washington, D.C., and I gave -- I was asked to do a workshop -- no, this was Jewish Folk Art Society.</span> <span id="s563">And they were giving a festival in American university, they asked me if I would do a workshop.</span> <span id="s564">So I remember it like yesterday, I introduced myself, come from Bosnia and all this stuff, and I am going to talk about Ladino songs.</span> <span id="s565">And I hear a student from way back, in a very student way of talking, what in the hell’s that?</span> <span id="s566">I mean, we wouldn’t put that in a book, but that’s just the way it is.</span> <span id="s567">What in hell is that.</span> <span id="s568">So I explained to him.</span> <span id="s569">And after I did a couple pairs, which are chanting pairs, another student says, well this can’t be Jewish, it’s -- it can’t be Jewish.</span> <span id="s570">It’s -- it -- it -- it’s Catholic, it’s Spain.</span> <span id="s571">They couldn’t connect it.</span> <span id="s572">Because they were not taught.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: They didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">A: They didn’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: So that was a tough experience.</span> <span id="s577">And from there on I knew, I mean you want to stay and sing and -- and perform?</span> <span id="s578">I mean, this is what all of the whole family did for years.</span> <span id="s579">You learn Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s580">And I did.</span> <span id="s581">And I was singing Yiddish songs.</span> <span id="s582">But to pour your heart out, [indecipherable] the soul, you had to sing Ladino, but that’s what you were brought up to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s584">You

when I lost my religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s588">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s589">Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: Standing in that field, and I think you have that story, and this man telling us, this is where your family is.</span> <span id="s591">I said this can’t be [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s592">He can’t -- there can’t be anything there.</span> <span id="s593">Cause these were good people.</span> <span id="s594">Store downstairs, the wife upstairs and close-knit family and I -- in fact, I have a song Las Tias, the aunts, all about my aunts, because every day, every holiday was a different aunt’s house.</span> <span id="s595">This is all memories that I put into my songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s596">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s597">So -- but -- but up until that time --</span></p> <p><span id="s598">A: Up til that di -- time, we were very pious, religious people following my Nonna with candles and the holidays and -- but then -- in fact, in the -- in Zagreb, which we started the modern life all together, I went to synagogue myself, because that was what you do on Saturday morning.</span> <span id="s599">Was no question about it.</span> <span id="s600">Why?</span> <span id="s601">That’s what you do.</span> <span id="s602">My mother didn’t have a kosher home, or she was very up to date with the ladies in Zagreb, they were all Ashkenazi.</span> <span id="s603">They all spoke German at home, and she didn’t want to speak Ladino, so I went by myself, and I loved it.</span> <span id="s604">It was Ashkenazi synagogue, but the sound of Hebrew was peaceful, see?</span> <span id="s605">It gave you an inner peace, as you call it here.</span> <span id="s606">But once I saw the ma -- that -- that man on -- on -- on -- in the field when he told this is your family, well that was it.</span> <span id="s607">Don’t just -- don’t sell me God, and He’s -- protects you and looks over you and -- even in today I have a hard time sitting in that synagogue.</span> <span id="s608">I see it mostly as being with people, friendships, being together.</span> <span id="s609">This is what I see in the synagogue today.</span> <span id="s610">Be nice to each other, maybe helping w -- another person, performing, sing to them.</span> <span id="s611">But He’ll protect me?</span> <span id="s612">No way.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Did you raise your children in a synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: I raised my children what a Jewish mo -- heart -- a Jewish mother should [indecipherable] without even feeling is it right or wrong.</span> <span id="s615">I -- we had Friday nights.</span> <span id="s616">The father sent them all to syn -- to -- to Hebrew school, even the girls were -- went to Hebrew school.</span> <span id="s617">They all know all the prayers, they know all the holidays.</span> <span id="s618">They’re raising Jewish children.</span> <span id="s619">Laurie has three, they’re all in yi -- Bat Mitzvahs, Bar Mitzvahs, the whole deal.</span> <span id="s620">But we never talked about how I feel inside.</span> <span id="s621">That was something of my own.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: You never talked with your kids about it after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: No.</span> <span id="s626">Oh, they know what happened, they’ve seen pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s627">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">A: But I didn’t sit down and start talking God, they know.</span> <span id="s629">Th-They know.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: But the father did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: How so?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: The father taught them, the father saw that they have Hebrew education.</span> <span id="s634">The father was more -- he still goes to synagogue every Saturday morning, he’s 90.</span> <span id="s635">And he drives by himself.</span> <span id="s636">It’s something that Bubby really put into him in many, many years as he was growing up.</span> <span id="s637">But I can’t see it.</span> <span id="s638">I’d love to.</span> <span id="s639">I envy people who believe.</span> <span id="s640">I really do.</span> <span id="s641">I -- I envy people who pray with such, you know, you look at some people and they’re praying.</span> <span id="s642">How do they feel?</span> <span id="s643">They pray.</span> <span id="s644">Well.</span> <span id="s645">That’s a survivor’s story, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: And I think maybe you’ve heard before the same thing.</span> <span id="s648">Or, some go the other way around.</span> <span id="s649">Like Sephardim at the Inquisition, they said, we were not good Jews, that’s why we’re punished.</span> <span id="s650">It goes back to religion.</span> <span id="s651">So that -- the opposite way of working, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">A: But it didn’t work for my generation any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: You went back then, ano -- a second time to Vlasenica.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: I went --</span></p> <p><span id="s656">Q: We’ve heard that whole -- you told that whole story very --</span></p> <p><span id="s657">A: -- back for the second time --</span></p> <p><span id="s658">Q: -- very articulately.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">A: -- with my husband and -- and Berta lived there.</span> <span id="s660">My cousin Berta.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: She’s the last of the family, of [indecipherable] family.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s664">And was that after the war in Bosnia or before?</span></p> <p><span id="s665">A: Yes --</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: After.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">A: -- before.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">Q: Before.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">A: Not after, before.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s671">In the 80’s.</span> <span id="s672">I think it was in the 80’s, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">Q: That you went, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">A: It was in the 80’s and it was aft -- before the war, and we had that horrible day, which I don’t think we want to go through all that [indecipherable] take too much time.</span> <span id="s676">But that day end up with song.</span> <span id="s677">We sang all evening.</span> <span id="s678">They knew that I sing, that I like to sing, so my cousin Berta invited a lot of her friends, a lot of them with guitars.</span> <span id="s679">And couple sardines, hard boiled egg.</span> <span id="s680">It was in a nu -- you know, half-heart, the whole cocktail party was there, alive.</span> <span id="s681">A very primitive life, very primitive.</span> <span id="s682">And then we sang til three in the morning and it felt good.</span> <span id="s683">That was, I think, as I would say, God’s blessing.</span> <span id="s684">It was some blessing.</span> <span id="s685">But that would follow the kind of a day we -- we had.</span></p> <p><span id="s686">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s687">And what was it like for you in -- coming back, then?</span> <span id="s688">Did you feel more attached to that place than you had been before?</span> <span id="s689">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s690">A: What place?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: To Vlasenica.</span> <span id="s692">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: I didn't want to go back any more.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: No, it was over.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">A: I just wanted to get away from it and never return.</span> <span id="s696">I still feel that way.</span> <span id="s697">Never return.</span> <span id="s698">I’ve seen it, I’ve heard, I’ve saw.</span> <span id="s699">And no way.</span> <span id="s700">I don’t want to have anything to do with any of these places any more.</span> <span id="s701">Just brings memories, bad memories and I’m very happy here.</span> <span id="s702">Especially now, I have six grandchildren.</span> <span id="s703">We get together and we have the warmth of life, see?</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: What was it like during the war there, in the early 90’s, it -- that news was all around you.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: The Bosnian war?</span> <span id="s706">Bosnian war --</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: -- was very bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s709">Q: You couldn’t get away from it, I’m sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">A: It was very bad and I had a cousin Berta living in Vlasenica, and I worked very hard to get her out, through connection here, connection there, nothing really worked.</span> <span id="s711">We finally send her a two way ticket in Air France and we said, get in a plane, we’ll do something here, maybe.</span> <span id="s712">And she flew to Chicago and we had a lawyer, and we paid.</span> <span id="s713">And she came to Chicago, lived there for awhile.</span> <span id="s714">She has a niece, Dragana who lives in Chicago.</span> <span id="s715">And then we brought her here and she lived with me for about five, six months, went to one of the singles, got a husband.</span> <span id="s716">American husband.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: How old was she when she came?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: About 45.</span></p> <p><span id="s719">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">A: She married a lovely man.</span> <span id="s721">Very happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: And today she’s teaching English -- I mean, her own Serbo -- Bosnian.</span> <span id="s724">Today it’s very hard, is it Serbian, is it Croatian --</span></p> <p><span id="s725">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">A: -- is it Bosnian, is it Macedonian.</span> <span id="s727">But all in all she is really a professor of languages.</span> <span id="s728">She went to University of Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s729">So teaching is her li -- you know, her job.</span> <span id="s730">So she’s working for one -- for -- for -- for one -- one of those language schools.</span> <span id="s731">I think it’s under the State Department.</span> <span id="s732">And gets a job here and there, not a full time, but whenever they have somebody going to Yugoslavia -- former Yugoslavia, and wants to learn the language fast, le -- Berta has a job.</span> <span id="s733">Now she has a couple who are going to, I think Zagreb in March, so she has a full time job, teaches half a day him, and half a day the wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: Wow.</span> <span id="s735">You know, in this country, in the 80’s and 90’s, became a time when a lot of Holocaust survivors decided to speak publicly.</span> <span id="s736">And -- and your speaking publicly was singing.</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: No.</span> <span id="s738">Singing was mostly ba -- but I added to my singing a little story to every song, which I didn’t before.</span> <span id="s739">In other word, if I would be singing Las Tias, the aunts, I talked about those aunts.</span> <span id="s740">Then I started with slideshows and I showed them Vlasenica, a whole f-family, pictures of each tia and got closer and closer int -- into this whole tradition through my songs, see?</span> <span id="s741">And I me -- I think my music has done everything for me, from the accordion that saved my life all the way to -- to today.</span> <span id="s742">Now there are some wonderful moments, there’s still disappointments.</span> <span id="s743">Like the last -- well, this is a good example, the last celebration the Holocaust Museum had.</span> <span id="s744">When was it, two months ago, or a month ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s746">When all the survivors came, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">A: The performers were invited to sing or play.</span> <span id="s748">Til almost three, four days before, I did not call because when you call and when you’re performer, you’re looking for a concert, and that was the last thing I had in mind, a concert, because I’ve done concerts at Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s749">This was to light a candle.</span> <span id="s750">Just a candle, because I was th -- at the Holocaust the spring, last spring, yeah this years -- last year, it’s already gone -- to sing one song, I flew to Poland, to Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s751">And all the songs that I sing the Holocaust came to life because I saw the place where everything really happened.</span> <span id="s752">So I came back feeling very, very -- very emotional about the Holocaust survivors from Salonika, Greece, Turkey, Balkans.</span> <span id="s753">And I have a prayer, and I wanted to light a candle because the memorial at the Auschwitz was to -- to ma -- to -- in memory of these victims.</span> <span id="s754">So I wanted -- so I called a day before, I -- so it’s too late, nobody called, nobody wants anything Sephardic, let me do something about it.</span> <span id="s755">So I called and I said, I don’t want a concert.</span> <span id="s756">I had enough of that.</span> <span id="s757">I want a prayer and light a candle for these survivors.</span> <span id="s758">Two minutes.</span> <span id="s759">I had a plain flat no.</span> <span id="s760">And that was one of disappointments that -- that even happens today, you see?</span> <span id="s761">I mean, i-it -- it will never be that I can say, oh I’m so glad my Sephardic music is part of the Jewish music.</span> <span id="s762">It’s still not accepted.</span> <span id="s763">And it’s not that I’m saying well, we died too, and the -- th-the eastern European Jews died, too.</span> <span id="s764">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s765">Many more on that side than here?</span> <span id="s766">No.</span> <span id="s767">[indecipherable] to light a candle?</span></p> <p><span id="s768">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s769">Do you understand that pushing aside at all?</span> <span id="s770">I mean, I -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: I don’t understand.</span> <span id="s772">I don’t understand --</span></p> <p><span id="s773">Q: -- I don’t know understand it at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s774">A: -- I’m trying to understand, I -- it’s not so much understanding as not believing that this is happening.</span> <span id="s775">People who were planning something like this were not really, as much as they really tried to -- they tried to, they cover -- I mean, they have exhibits, Jews from Poland, Jews from Greece.</span> <span id="s776">Ja -- there’s so many days concerts in honor of a Greek Jew -- Jew -- Jews that’s vanished.</span> <span id="s777">Whole -- who-whole trainloads were go -- went straight, I don’t know if you know the stories, straight to Auschwitz.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: And we saw the pictures from the train, straight to crematorium.</span> <span id="s780">Not even give them a chance to -- to -- to rest.</span> <span id="s781">Now, these kind of stories -- now, we talked to survivors who survived the Auschwitz, and I came back with this feeling that I, you know, feel terrible about this whole thing, and this is many years later.</span> <span id="s782">Sometimes I say, why go back and even talk about this any more.</span> <span id="s783">But I was there, so I saw it.</span> <span id="s784">And I couldn't light a candle and make a prayer.</span> <span id="s785">I’m not blaming the Holocaust Museum.</span> <span id="s786">A person who was planning it did not have the knowledge to understand this.</span></p> <p><span id="s787">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s788">A: Maybe because they didn’t talk to anybody who just came back cha -- Auschwitz, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: So that -- that hurts.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">A: So as much as I say all these wonderful rosy things about this country, there’s still little humps here and there that hurt you and I don’t know if you can do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s793">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s794">Are there very many Sephardic Jews in this country who speak Ladino like you?</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Well, we have a lot of</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q: [indecipherable] communities.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">A: -- we have a -- oh, we’ve come a long way.</span> <span id="s798">We have a computer daily, Ladinokomunita.</span> <span id="s799">They’re in touch with each other, or you can talk to people --</span></p> <p><span id="s800">Q: On the internet.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">A: -- from Australia, some people from Austria, another one is Greece, and the other one is way -- Poland.</span> <span id="s802">From all over the world they talk to each other Ladino.</span> <span id="s803">Talk, write, you know.</span> <span id="s804">And I started a Ladino group here in Washington, D.C..</span> <span id="s805">We started with four people, I think it’s about 24 of us now.</span> <span id="s806">We get together, we just talk to each other.</span> <span id="s807">And with this language that’s getting lost all the time, you know.</span> <span id="s808">If you don’t speak, you lose, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s809">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s810">And where are they -- what is the traditions?</span></p> <p><span id="s811">A: We meet in different homes.</span> <span id="s812">There’s Istanbul and there is Sofia, Bulgaria and there’s Salonika.</span> <span id="s813">People from all over who just have this hunger to be with somebody who has the same background.</span> <span id="s814">A lot of laughing with olds -- old words that the grandmothers used to speak.</span> <span id="s815">A-A very nice atmosphere, we have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: And cooking?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Cooking.</span> <span id="s818">Whoever remembers to cook something.</span> <span id="s819">I cook many of these dishes, and I make them bourekas and we have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: Tell me about some of the dishes that you make, that you [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: A lot of it is like Greek dishes, dough with feta cheese and spinach inside.</span> <span id="s822">Or stuffed cabbage or stuffed grape leaves.</span> <span id="s823">Lot of fish dishes, a lot of vegetable dishes.</span> <span id="s824">Lot of leek, eggplant.</span> <span id="s825">In fact, in prayers, there is dishes that you make a prayer over, like the leek dish and eggplant dish.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: And of those things that you -- those things that you cook, what -- are there some that you know go way, way back --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s828">Q: -- that your grandmother --</span></p> <p><span id="s829">A: Yes, yes, yes, bourek.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">Q: Like what?</span> <span id="s831">Bourek.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Yeah</span></p> <p><span id="s833">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">A: That goes -- but that is actually adapted probably in a Bosnian way, but that -- I know the bur-bourek, cause they had it from way back Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s836">And those are?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: And wherever they settled, let’s say the Greece or Turkey or Bulgaria, Bosnia, they, not even knowing they are adopted the rhythms of that country and the ri -- tastes of that country and the cooking [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s838">Q: Say what bourek is -- say -- describe what bourek is.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">A: Bourek is dough that you -- it’s a little Americanized now, instead of using a real, heavy oil, you use margarine.</span> <span id="s840">But it’s dough that you can fill with spinach and cheese, you can fill with meat and onions.</span> <span id="s841">I -- I think every country has its own traditional dish that is similar to this.</span> <span id="s842">Every country.</span> <span id="s843">I know South America, when you’re -- Russian, they all have dough with something stuffed in the middle.</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span> <span id="s845">And your kids make it?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Yes, oh Betty entertains only with bourek.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Oh yes, they do, definitely.</span> <span id="s849">Not only my kids, my friends, my neighbors.</span></p> <p><span id="s850">Q: You taught them.</span> <span id="s851">You taught them?</span></p> <p><span id="s852">A: Sure.</span> <span id="s853">I have to.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">Q: Uh-huh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s855">A: They call it Flora’s dough.</span> <span id="s856">Flora’s dough, or Flora’s bourek.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s858">You now -- you’re still performing, your children perform with you sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s859">A: My children perform -- they’ve performed more.</span> <span id="s860">We don’t live in the same cities, so to practice, since we’re getting better and more fussy with what we do, we need to practice more, okay?</span> <span id="s861">So, for them, they have to come from New Jersey, and that is already leaving the job, or the children.</span> <span id="s862">They all ha -- it’s not as easy any more, but I have local apprentice, we were in the -- this is a very pretty story of mine that I can say in America.</span> <span id="s863">I -- I did receive an endowment for the arts last year.</span> <span id="s864">I was a master apprenticeship program in Charlottesville and UVA.</span> <span id="s865">I’ve done many things lately.</span> <span id="s866">I’ve been immigrant of the year.</span> <span id="s867">That on top is Auschwitz, where I was invited to sing a song.</span> <span id="s868">This is all what’s happening in my life.</span> <span id="s869">E-Every one of these things is a good happening.</span> <span id="s870">That’s just what I can say, that this America has done a lot for me.</span> <span id="s871">It’s mostly connected in music.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">Q: I’d like to know from your perspective what -- I -- I know when you tell -- when you sing and you tell stories about your relatives and your village and what happened, I me -- I have a sense of what it means to you, but what -- what does it mean to your children when they sing th-th -- these songs?</span></p> <p><span id="s873">A: If I’m saying a p -- a sad s -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s874">Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Flory Jagoda.</span> <span id="s875">This is tape number two, side A.</span> <span id="s876">What -- what do you think it means to your children when they sing these songs and they perform them?</span> <span id="s877">What -- what do you --</span></p> <p><span id="s878">A: At the beginning was stage.</span> <span id="s879">They’re all stage people, to be very honest.</span> <span id="s880">Elliot was a rock and roll musician for many years, king of the rock in Georgetown.</span> <span id="s881">Betty went -- well, she was Adelphi University, she went into arts, she end up as a art -- the -- the dance therapist.</span> <span id="s882">Laurie went to the University in Miami, dance therapist.</span> <span id="s883">They all went into the arts, only the youngest one is a doctor.</span> <span id="s884">But as the question -- the answer to your question, it was stage [indecipherable], that’s it.</span> <span id="s885">As doing it, year after year, hearing my story, it seeped in the other way.</span> <span id="s886">So Betty into it now is really as cultural.</span> <span id="s887">And then all the concert that we have done when we went to Yugoslavia, and one of the most important ones, when we were invited to Spain, see?</span> <span id="s888">Ribadavia, Spain.</span> <span id="s889">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s890">That ca -- the whole thing came to head in their minds with a daily experience.</span> <span id="s891">Because we were invited by a young club s -- university students, who claims that they have never been taught about -- they never knew there was Inquisition.</span> <span id="s892">All right?</span></p> <p><span id="s893">Q: In Spain?</span></p> <p><span id="s894">A: In Spain.</span> <span id="s895">This was Ribadavia, it was Galicia, north.</span> <span id="s896">They found out what horrible things happened in all these cities and that Ribadavia is vineyard countries, all wine and grapes.</span> <span id="s897">And they claim Jews owned these vineyards.</span> <span id="s898">And they have named -- the whole city was -- it had a Judaria, the Jewish quarter.</span> <span id="s899">And the whole city, you could see the life of that whole community, that they left as it is.</span> <span id="s900">And every year -- now I don’t know if this is a tourist’s clique, or I don’t know if it’s a tourism to bring Jewish -- what’s the word -- travelers, or really their own intention to teach their young, look, this is what happened.</span> <span id="s901">We kicked out thousands of people because they didn’t want to convert.</span> <span id="s902">And the young feel bad about that, because they’re not more -- so [indecipherable] into the -- the religion that they could understand that like their ancestors.</span> <span id="s903">So they see this as a wrong thing that happened.</span> <span id="s904">But that’s 1492, see, a long time back, you know.</span> <span id="s905">Many things have happened since.</span> <span id="s906">But all in all they do once a year a Jewish wedding, and all the villagers come over.</span> <span id="s907">And they do a really typical Jewish wedding.</span> <span id="s908">They sang all my songs.</span> <span id="s909">And ah, to me that was the highlight of life.</span></p> <p><span id="s910">Q: How did you make a connection with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s911">A: They heard about me.</span> <span id="s912">They heard about me and they have invited, they made a [indecipherable] Sepharadi.</span> <span id="s913">A -- a -- a week, Sephardic week.</span> <span id="s914">They invited a woman from Israel, a woman from Canada, the three of us, another two countries.</span> <span id="s915">So every night was a different concert from a different country in the world, bringing back this Ladino --</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: -- and the public really enjoyed my -- because it’s a real broken up Spanish.</span> <span id="s918">So they would say, my a -- my grandmother used to say that word, wow, my grandma -- they would say from the audience.</span> <span id="s919">Was a lot of fun.</span> <span id="s920">I spoke to them this old Ladino, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s921">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">A: -- my family, that’s all they spoke.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s924">A: You went to school and you spoke Serbo-Croatian, but you -- and the moment you cross that door --</span></p> <p><span id="s925">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s926">A: -- it was that language.</span> <span id="s927">They called it Jewish language.</span></p> <p><span id="s928">Q: So 500 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">A: Five years -- that’s -- that -- that’s what it is to -- that’s what’s me today.</span></p> <p><span id="s930">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s931">A: I -- actually -- I think the last generation, I think.</span> <span id="s932">I don’t think that it will go on.</span> <span id="s933">Once my generation’s gone -- and I’m 80, so how much can you go?</span> <span id="s934">Even if they’re learning a bit Ladino, it’s not the same, you have to talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: -- and you have to gossip and you buy and sell, and that’s what living is.</span> <span id="s937">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s938">Q: Is there any place in the world where it’s spoken as a daily language?</span></p> <p><span id="s939">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s941">A: I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s942">Israel has some neighborhood communities where there’re old people, see?</span> <span id="s943">Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span id="s944">California has a synagogue, you -- you -- right across the street with UCLA, I gave a concert there.</span> <span id="s945">New York has a small synagogue, half of them -- very few really speak a good Ladino.</span> <span id="s946">This Ladino group I have, some speak very nice, but are the French Jews, and it’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s947">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s948">A: I mean, people who don’t want to talk reality, this is, oh well, we’ll teach the -- y -- many young are interested.</span> <span id="s949">What young?</span> <span id="s950">15 of them maybe, or 20?</span> <span id="s951">The same thing with Yiddish, only they’re stronger, because it’s more of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">Q: More people, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">A: It’s more of them because a bunch of them came back, around 18th century or so.</span></p> <p><span id="s954">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">A: But I don’t see too much, even if they have this Ladinokomunita that is -- it’s a wonderful thing to receive daily.</span> <span id="s956">And you talk to somebody from Columbia, somebody from Morocco, and you have a good time.</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, that’s a great story.</span> <span id="s958">So by now you said that you -- since you went back to Vlasenica, you -- you know that your children know your story.</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: My children know my story, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s960">Q: They know the whole thing now.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">A: They know why I’m doing what I’m doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s963">A: They know it is not stage only.</span> <span id="s964">Yes, stage is where you perform, but they know there is more to it since they see and hear my students performing, see?</span> <span id="s965">Since this ap-apprenticeship program, one of the apprentices, that’s Susan Gaeta, she’s already giving concerts in La-Ladino songs.</span></p> <p><span id="s966">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">A: Now I -- I am now -- preparing a concert now with Ramon Tasat, who is Argentinean.</span> <span id="s968">I’m teaching him my Bosnian songs, we are preparing a concert.</span> <span id="s969">He will continue my work.</span> <span id="s970">So it will go on only through my students, more than my children.</span></p> <p><span id="s971">Q: Why so?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">A: Because they are performing, they are preparing all the time, they keeping it fresh.</span> <span id="s973">The children, the younger one has two Gold gyms.</span> <span id="s974">She -- she owns two gyms.</span> <span id="s975">She’s there from six in the morning, up and down, with fitness, you know, no time.</span> <span id="s976">Music is something that you set to practice.</span> <span id="s977">No matter how much feeing you have for it, that can come out only when you’re performing.</span> <span id="s978">But to perform, y-you have to prepare.</span> <span id="s979">And that means have time, and leave everything else and make that a goal.</span> <span id="s980">When you have a family you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s981">You have a business, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s982">You have distances to drive, you can’t do that.</span> <span id="s983">This Ramon Tasat comes from Maryland.</span> <span id="s984">He comes tomorrow and day after tomorrow.</span> <span id="s985">He loses from nine to one, time.</span> <span id="s986">It -- it’s -- it’s time consuming, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s987">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: Now with the children, when they were living at home, you say, let’s do this song, la, la, la, la, get a guitar.</span> <span id="s989">It was all in the room.</span> <span id="s990">But once they’re married, in another city -- but they know what I am doing and why.</span> <span id="s991">They know it is not just stage and being a performer, it’s -- there is a role to it, and I’ve done that.</span></p> <p><span id="s992">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s993">A: Through the -- through the four recordings, and that documentary -- I don’t think you’ve seen the documentary, you saw the one at Holocaust.</span> <span id="s994">They definitely know what my goal is, teach and spread it.</span> <span id="s995">Music.</span> <span id="s996">Talking music.</span> <span id="s997">But if you doing this music, sooner or later you get interest into the culture of it.</span> <span id="s998">You can’t help not to.</span> <span id="s999">So all these students I have, they know why I am teaching them.</span> <span id="s1000">See, it will go on musically, I think.</span> <span id="s1001">For how long?</span> <span id="s1002">Who knows?</span> <span id="s1003">But for me, to get in stage is, you know, no big deal any more y -- unless I can bring in a message.</span> <span id="s1004">I have a song that is [indecipherable] di Spania, that I have written here in this country, and that’s the key -- they key of Spain.</span></p> <p><span id="s1005">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: See the keys all over, peop-people send me keys.</span> <span id="s1007">It’s -- it’s all -- written on a legend that when the Sephardim left Spain they took the key with them.</span> <span id="s1008">The key of the synagogue, the key of the homes.</span> <span id="s1009">And that key went through generation to generation.</span> <span id="s1010">It was always in their drawer.</span> <span id="s1011">So the song is asking, where is the key that used to be in the drawer?</span> <span id="s1012">And this is from Bosnia.</span> <span id="s1013">That was already transferred to Bosnia now, left the key in Bosnia.</span> <span id="s1014">So, the legend -- and this key took over among musicians a lot.</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">Q: The song.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">A: So two wee -- two -- a month ago we had a concert, the -- Georgetown University, an interfaith.</span> <span id="s1017">And they asked me to do [indecipherable] di Spania.</span> <span id="s1018">And the ambassa -- Spanish ambassador came and kissed my hand.</span> <span id="s1019">You kissed my hand, I was thinking, you know.</span> <span id="s1020">Look what happened.</span> <span id="s1021">Look where we are today.</span> <span id="s1022">That’s why I bring this trip to Spain, that they would invite me back.</span> <span id="s1023">My songs are about Spain, and all our history is about Spain.</span> <span id="s1024">And we love that country because we love it the way it was, see?</span> <span id="s1025">And that you transfer again through songs.</span> <span id="s1026">I told you everything you’ll get from me is songs and music.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: When you went to Spain was that the first time you’d ever been there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s1029">No, no, no, I went once before as an American lady, a tourist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1030">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1031">But did you have a resonance with it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: No?</span> <span id="s1034">It was a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1037">Not because you heard stories, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: No, I -- I’ll tell you what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: -- images or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: -- a-as a survivor you become very realistic.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Romantic, yes, when you sing.</span> <span id="s1043">Emotional.</span> <span id="s1044">But you get realistic too.</span> <span id="s1045">When yo-you go over there, there is nothing Jewish.</span> <span id="s1046">For tourists, yes, they take you to a Jewish street, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1047">Q: But it’s not real.</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">A: That’s the big thing, the Jewish street.</span> <span id="s1049">A Judaria.</span> <span id="s1050">And a quarter buys [indecipherable] of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1051">Q: But it’s not real.</span></p> <p><span id="s1052">A: It’s gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: You talk to some people they don’t even know that -- that -- who there is left that lived here.</span> <span id="s1055">They don’t know.</span> <span id="s1056">The kids are not taught in school about it.</span> <span id="s1057">Why?</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: It’s not the right thing to teach your children.</span> <span id="s1060">The first time that came out in the open about this whole Inquisition business, it was always covered by the church, see?</span> <span id="s1061">Was it here at the cathedral two months ago, I don’t know if you read about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1062">Q: Mm-mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">A: This whole exhibit came from Madrid that was filmed in Madrid and they showed here in the cathedral.</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">Q: At the national cathedral?</span></p> <p><span id="s1065">A: The national cathedral.</span> <span id="s1066">Was a big happening in our lives that finally came out, the story.</span> <span id="s1067">Not that you want to do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1068">It happened five -- five centuries ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">A: This is couple pages in your book, in your history book.</span> <span id="s1071">If you read history books, then you know about it.</span> <span id="s1072">If you don’t read those books you don’t even know about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: And through the songs that I’ve been doing, my audience know.</span> <span id="s1075">So I -- I did drill a hole in s -- in -- in -- in ice.</span> <span id="s1076">And I’m thinking what you want to know more about this country, America.</span> <span id="s1077">I think we did cover some.</span> <span id="s1078">I think we got something out of this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1080">Let me just look at my notes here.</span> <span id="s1081">Grandchildren now, you have grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1082">Six.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: They ask questions.</span> <span id="s1084">Isn’t that something?</span> <span id="s1085">They ask questions more than the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1086">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s1087">About what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">A: About Nonna, I mean, all -- all Nonna’s stories.</span> <span id="s1089">Where were you b -- I -- I -- I get usually calls, Nonna, I have to interview you.</span> <span id="s1090">All right, let’s go.</span> <span id="s1091">Number one, where were you born, and where did you live here?</span> <span id="s1092">And who -- I mean, questions, you know?</span> <span id="s1093">But that’s their schools.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1095">A: They bring in story, family stories.</span> <span id="s1096">You have children?</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: This is what the kids usually are told in school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1099">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">A: Go home and talk to your Nonna, or your -- or your Nonnu, and ask them about their life.</span> <span id="s1101">And then they -- they learn.</span> <span id="s1102">This is why they learn, they ask.</span></p> <p><span id="s1103">Q: So the seed is there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">A: Oh yeah, seed’s there and it will go on.</span> <span id="s1105">It will go on.</span> <span id="s1106">My daughters do carry some customs that I taught them.</span> <span id="s1107">I knew a little and I dropped everything.</span> <span id="s1108">My mother dropped everything, too.</span> <span id="s1109">She left Vlasenica when she said, there must be something more than this.</span> <span id="s1110">So I’m told.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: But you’re going back again, and you have that story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1113">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">A: You can’t cu -- y-you know, you can’t help.</span> <span id="s1115">It’s connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: It’s all connected.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: You can’t help.</span></p> <p><span id="s1118">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1119">You did your interview, your original interview in 1995.</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1121">Q: It’s almost 10 years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">A: Is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: And I’m just wondering if there’s anything that you have learned about your family, or anything that you’ve come to understand or realize since you did that interview that you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1124">A: No, it’s cut.</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">A: It’s cut and gone.</span> <span id="s1127">No, I didn’t find, I didn’t learn anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Since then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Maybe now this Ladino group, I hear a word that brought back memories, that I said oh my God, I didn’t hear that for years.</span> <span id="s1130">My nonna used to say that.</span> <span id="s1131">That’s about it.</span> <span id="s1132">Nothing else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: Nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1135">Q: Whatever happened to your cousin --</span></p> <p><span id="s1136">A: Cousin Berta?</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Lay -- Laisel?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Oh Laisel, that’s uncle.</span> <span id="s1139">That’s Berta’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">Q: Oh, her father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1141">A: Yeah, Berta’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1142">Q: What year did he die?</span></p> <p><span id="s1143">A: That’s a -- that’s another big story.</span> <span id="s1144">Y-You -- you opening a complete ‘nother five pages.</span> <span id="s1145">I don’t even think you want to start with that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">A: Complete new story.</span> <span id="s1148">I d -- I don’t think I added Loy -- Laisell even i-in -- in that interview.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: Well, he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">A: Just little.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: -- he was there because he had written the letter originally and then when you went back he was there, right?</span> <span id="s1152">He was there with you when you went back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">A: No, he was not.</span> <span id="s1156">He was go -- he was gone -- the story that we found out about that family, it’s whe -- when I was getting ready to go on the honeymoon in Barre, Italy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1158">He had written the letter to your mother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: That’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: That’s all I know about Uncle Laisel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1162">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">A: But that’s Berta’s father.</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">Q: You never saw him after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1165">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1166">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1167">A: Didn’t see anybody.</span> <span id="s1168">Just Berta is the only one that I could connect, see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1170">And when was the first time you met her?</span> <span id="s1171">The first time you went ba -- back to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">Q: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">A: That first trip with the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">Q: In the 70’s.</span></p> <p><span id="s1176">A: Went to se -- her, she lived in Sarajevo.</span> <span id="s1177">And she was attending a University of Sarajevo in language department.</span></p> <p><span
