7th of February, in 1934, in Belgium, in the City of Antwerp.</span> <span id="s8">My parents divorced in 1935, one year after I was born.</span> <span id="s9">Belgium is a very small country.</span> <span id="s10">It’s actually broken down into three languages.</span> <span id="s11">In the north, we call that Neelandophone, the Flemish section.</span> <span id="s12">In the center, you have Brussels, the capitol, which has two languages, Niederlander (Flemish) and French, and in the south it’s mostly French, but there’s a very small section called Malmedy, where German is spoken.</span></p> <p><span id="s13">When I was a little boy, I was told it had eight million people, the same quantity of people that New York City has.</span> <span id="s14">A very small population for a country.</span> <span id="s15">Belgium has a constitutional monarchy and has been independent in many ways.</span> <span id="s16">It’s a country that unfortunately had a Colonial experience, just as Great Britain, Spain, France, and Portugal.</span> <span id="s17">It colonized the Belgian Congo.</span> <span id="s18">That’s a naughty part of Belgium, that experience of colonization.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">It had always maintained a sense of neutrality in international politics.</span> <span id="s20">Of course, in WWI, that neutrality was breached by the invasion of Belgium by the German Army, by the Keiser’s Army.</span> <span id="s21">Alas, a parallel situation transpired in WWII.</span> <span id="s22">The war was started on the 10th of May 1940, and it was perhaps 18 days later that the Belgian government capitulated to the German occupying forces.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">We were not Belgian citizens.</span> <span id="s24">My father was born in Hungary.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was born in Romania.</span> <span id="s26">They immigrated to Belgium because of economic opportunities.</span> <span id="s27">Hungary had a racial policy, Romania had a racial policy.</span> <span id="s28">They had their own anathema population – people who were considered unacceptable.</span> <span id="s29">So Belgium seemed like a perfect place for political asylum.</span> <span id="s30">If you were considered an unacceptable citizen, this is where you would go.</span> <span id="s31">They thought about France, but France had the Dreyfus affair, so there was a question of anti-Semitism, but Belgium seemed like not a racist country, a country in the lowlands, part of Holland, part of Benelux.</span> <span id="s32">I mean, what a perfect place to go.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">My father was a carpenter, and he got a job working for Ford, in Antwerp, as a carpenter.</span> <span id="s34">We were not religious Jews.</span> <span id="s35">We were secular Jews.</span> <span id="s36">In fact, my father met my mother through a Marxist organization.</span> <span id="s37">They were both Marxist Communists.</span> <span id="s38">They were not interested in their religious identity.</span> <span id="s39">Judaism was not – they were secular Jews.</span> <span id="s40">My father proceeded to make plans to come to America, the land of milk and honey, as it was known.</span> <span id="s41">He had his mother, his brother, and sisters here, and the plans to come to America appeared to be solidified.</span> <span id="s42">So the invasion, of course, created a terrible imposition.</span> <span id="s43">We could not travel so easily across the Atlantic, but we thought – at least, they thought – that we could go to France, and from France go to England, and from England find passage to America.</span> <span id="s44">Alas, it was already too late.</span> <span id="s45">The phony war started in September of 1939, and the real war started on the 10th of May 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">We were still optimistic about the possibility of getting to England.</span> <span id="s47">We joined a massive army of refugees trying to go to the coast in Belgium and, from the coast, try to cross into the Flanders region of France and, ultimately, we would make it to England.</span> <span id="s48">The period of evacuation was, of course, very, very treacherous.</span> <span id="s49">That’s where the German Luftwaffe was coming down and aiming their machine guns on the evacuating thousands.</span> <span id="s50">As my father, in his book – my father wrote a book about his experiences – says, there is nothing more terrifying on the scale of fear than a child’s fear of death.</span> <span id="s51">Of course, so I was worried that we would be the people killed, because there was a lot of destruction, a lot of barbarism, a lot of inhumanity.</span> <span id="s52">This is the first time that we saw people dying in front of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">When we got to the border between France and Belgium, we were considered persona non grata.</span> <span id="s54">My father was of the wrong nationality.</span> <span id="s55">He was Hungarian.</span> <span id="s56">Hungarians were considered part of the Axis, so we were considered collaborators.</span> <span id="s57">Although we were determined to do so, by suggesting that as Jews we were considered pariahs by that community of oppressors, it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s58">Bureaucracy was so preponderant that they turned us back.</span> <span id="s59">So we went back to Antwerp.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">TRACK 03 – Juden Verboten In Antwerp, life seemed almost as it was before the German occupation of Belgium.</span> <span id="s61">Each day there were new laws about what we had to do, new mandates from the occupying forces, institution of ration for food, and subtle changes.</span> <span id="s62">But I felt, as a child, that everything seemed normal again.</span> <span id="s63">Little by little, we saw signs that said Juden verboten, Juifs interdits, Jews forbidden.</span> <span id="s64">Signs that were more and more conspicuous in places like parks and cafes.</span> <span id="s65">We were not in any way practicing Jews.</span> <span id="s66">As secular Jews, I asked my father – I had just learned how to read and write – what’s a Jew?</span> <span id="s67">He said a Jew has no definition.</span> <span id="s68">It’s only an anti-Jew who can tell you what a Jew is.</span> <span id="s69">So that was the answer.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">We were beginning to worry.</span> <span id="s71">We had heard from different friends, acquaintances that the Nazis are imposing more and more laws as to where Jews can go, from point A to point B. We’re not allowed to go to parks or libraries.</span> <span id="s72">All public institutions were forbidden.</span> <span id="s73">Schools were interdicted, as well.</span> <span id="s74">Beginning the end of 1941, 1942, they imposed a law that all Jews had to wear the Star of David.</span> <span id="s75">The Star of David had the word Judah.</span> <span id="s76">They tried to give it sort of a Hebrew character.</span> <span id="s77">My father was inclined not to have that, because he felt that we never were practicing Jews.</span> <span id="s78">We were secular Jews, as I had mentioned before.</span> <span id="s79">There was no reason for it.</span> <span id="s80">But then, he was told by acquaintances again, if we do not wear that Star of David and they do arrest you, you will be severely punished.</span> <span id="s81">Little did we think at that time that severe punishment – what could be more severe than being exterminated, at one point, for having worn that?</span></p> <p><span id="s82">My father, being a Marxist, he joined the Belgian underground, the Maquis.</span> <span id="s83">He got a job working for the German military industry, where he would be a saboteur.</span> <span id="s84">We moved to a village called La Louviere.</span> <span id="s85">He realized that this was a war where even children were not safe.</span> <span id="s86">Not just from bombardment, but even children could be deported to a place somewhere in the east.</span> <span id="s87">The idea that a war should involve deportation of entire families was very suspicious to him.</span> <span id="s88">He said it’s inconceivable that children should be prisoners of war or civilians should be participating in a war, where there is no raison d’être for that.</span> <span id="s89">The idea of adults being taken to offlag, to prison camps for German military labor, that’s understandable.</span> <span id="s90">Anyway, we did not wear that Star of David, but I have first cousins, my mother’s sister’s children, Jackie and Yudi, who did wear that Star of David, and they were very proud of it.</span> <span id="s91">They said, we are like sheriffs.</span> <span id="s92">That was very impressive.</span> <span id="s93">Ultimately, we found out that entire families were being arrested, deported to a place called Malins (Mechelen), which is a city between Brussels and Antwerp, and these families were being taken somewhere in the eastern part of Poland.</span> <span id="s94">My father, the older people, the adults, the friends, the family, said there is something suspicious where an entire family can be deported to Germany.</span> <span id="s95">It’s not just labor that they want.</span> <span id="s96">We still had no idea that there was such a thing as an extermination camp.</span> <span id="s97">Extermination camps only became a reality around the end of 1943, 1944, and absolute reality at the end of 1945.</span> <span id="s98">The idea that was such a thing as a gas chamber, with crematoriums, and that children could be ultimately taken to such a camp, they would be gassed and cremated – once again, because they were Jewish, because they were not in harmony with the philosophy of the Third Reich – this to us was so mindboggling that this is just another propaganda against the German occupation forces.</span> <span id="s99">Little did we realize that this was not propaganda.</span> <span id="s100">This was a reality.</span> <span id="s101">But that reality would come much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">TRACK 04 – Becoming a Hidden Child At this point, we had to hide.</span> <span id="s103">We learned that no one was safe from deportation into somewhere in the eastern part of Europe.</span> <span id="s104">So, who was safe?</span> <span id="s105">Well, anyone who was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s106">If you were a Christian, you would be acceptable.</span> <span id="s107">But if you were Jewish, if you were a homosexual, if you were a Russian – we had a whole numeration of who was considered anathema to the Third Reich occupation.</span> <span id="s108">So, my father, through his underground activities met a wonderful human being called Pere Froidure, Father Froidure.</span> <span id="s109">Father Froidure was running a camp for underprivileged children of Brussels, called les Stations de Plein-air.</span> <span id="s110">This was an outdoor recreation center outside of Brussels, where poor children, living in the slums of Brussels, were invited to spend their daytime, like a summer camp, and at night they would be taken back by trolley car to the center of Brussels.</span> <span id="s111">This was my first hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">I was one of the first children hidden at the Stations de Plein-air by Pere Froidure.</span> <span id="s113">Pere Froidure was ultimately denounced by a Belgian Nazi collaborator, Rexist they called him.</span> <span id="s114">He was tortured and he wound up in Dachau, the concentration camp Dachau.</span> <span id="s115">So, as a hidden child, I had to assume a total identify.</span> <span id="s116">I became a Catholic.</span> <span id="s117">I was a Sacred Heart child, and my name was now Henry Gerard.</span> <span id="s118">Henry Albert Gerard.</span> <span id="s119">I actually fell in love with the idea that I was now a Catholic.</span> <span id="s120">This was my first religion.</span> <span id="s121">My highest aspiration was to become a priest some day.</span> <span id="s122">Anyway, from 1941 to the end of 1944, was a vicissitude of hiding places, from one place to another.</span> <span id="s123">My father would come and visit me wherever I was, as much as he could.</span> <span id="s124">It was very hard for him to travel.</span> <span id="s125">He had to be very careful.</span> <span id="s126">There were a lot of Belgium Rexists, collaborators, who would get some kind of a reward for denouncing who they considered pariahs, a member of the Jewish population, or a member of any kind of Slav population, or any kind of illegal immigrant that was hiding in Belgium somewhere.</span> <span id="s127">So we had to be very discreet, as to how we would get together.</span> <span id="s128">I was in a camp called Tervuren.</span> <span id="s129">I was in another camp called Darmantier.</span> <span id="s130">Finally, I was with some private families.</span> <span id="s131">Ultimately, into early 1943, we found a place called Jamoigne.</span> <span id="s132">Jamoigne is where I stayed for the balance of the war.</span> <span id="s133">Jamoigne is really in the heart of the Ardennes.</span> <span id="s134">To the south of Jamoigne you have the country of Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s135">Luxembourg is even smaller than Belgium.</span> <span id="s136">Then, further to the east of that you have Germany.</span> <span id="s137">So, Jamoigne is really sort of the crossroads between France, Belgium, and Holland, and there in the south you have Germany.</span> <span id="s138">You could see a lot of the activities of what was going on in WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s139">I remember being nine years old.</span> <span id="s140">I was walking in one of the cemeteries, not far, with a Catholic priest, who was the priest with whom I was doing my altar boy work.</span> <span id="s141">He, at that time, was in his 80’s.</span> <span id="s142">He was an old priest.</span> <span id="s143">He was born in 1856.</span> <span id="s144">He was 14 years old when he lived in that same area, during the Franco-Prussian War.</span> <span id="s145">He was too old for WWI.</span> <span id="s146">He was talking about all the battles that this area, geographical area, had experienced.</span> <span id="s147">The battle of the Franco-Prussian War, with Bismarck and Napoleon III, WWI, between the Kaiser and the Allies, etc., etc.</span> <span id="s148">Little did he anticipate that in this very same place we would have, about eight months later, the Battle of the Bulge.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">TRACK 05 - Jamoigne Anyway, we were in Jamoigne.</span> <span id="s150">Eighty-three Jewish children, not knowing that each one of us was Jewish.</span> <span id="s151">We were all good Catholics.</span> <span id="s152">Some of us better Catholics than others.</span> <span id="s153">Jamoigne was run by the Sisters of Besancon.</span> <span id="s154">This was an order that has existed since the 18th century.</span> <span id="s155">They were the kindest, the most affable, the most generous.</span> <span id="s156">They were true Christians, in the essence of the word.</span> <span id="s157">They did everything for the children.</span> <span id="s158">They themselves could have been harmed by what they were doing.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">We had frequent visits from the German – the Nazi authorities.</span> <span id="s160">I have to always make that clear, because there were some good Germans.</span> <span id="s161">In fact, I’m sure that the majority of the Germans were good.</span> <span id="s162">It’s just that you had a military organization, the Wehrmacht, and they had the Gestapo, and they had their police.</span> <span id="s163">But this was not necessarily representative of the German population, so we should always say Nazis, rather than Germans.</span> <span id="s164">So, I apologize.</span> <span id="s165">But after the war, we were so bitter, we were so angry at what happened that we simply said German, and now we have to qualify that and be a little more discerning.</span> <span id="s166">These things always transpire like that.</span> <span id="s167">Anyway, Madame Taquet, who was the coordinator of the Chateau, saw the German troops, but they were looking for British pilots, who had parachuted in the Ardennes.</span> <span id="s168">There were a lot of British planes going through a reconnaissance.</span> <span id="s169">They wanted to know exactly where they would land.</span> <span id="s170">They were trying to coordinate their landings.</span> <span id="s171">There was a plane that was shot down, right near the Chateau and, obviously, they didn’t find the bodies, so they must have assumed that the British pilots parachuted.</span> <span id="s172">So they came to the Chateau looking for British aviators.</span> <span id="s173">But they said, since we’re here, we heard a vague rumor that there were Jewish children hidden here, but that’s not our primordial objective.</span> <span id="s174">We want to find that aviator.</span> <span id="s175">Madame Taquet, the directress of the Chateau said to one of the counselors, look, one of you will have to sacrifice and pretend that you are one of the British aviators.</span> <span id="s176">This way, the children will be saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Mouton was the name of the young man who pretended to hide, but they had German shepherds.</span> <span id="s178">The German shepherds immediately identified Mouton, and he said yes, I’m one of the aviators.</span> <span id="s179">At least take me with you.</span> <span id="s180">But the candy incident was still in the back of the mind of the commandant of this particular group searching for the British pilots.</span> <span id="s181">He said, children, how many of you gathered together here - we were about maybe 60 of us - you speak many languages in Belgium.</span> <span id="s182">How many of you speak Dutch?</span> <span id="s183">A few of us.</span> <span id="s184">How many of you speak – and candy was distributed.</span> <span id="s185">How many of you speak French?</span> <span id="s186">More of us.</span> <span id="s187">How many of you – ultimately, three of the younger kids, they were maybe five years old – they wanted the candy.</span> <span id="s188">Candy was absolutely a luxury in that period of history.</span> <span id="s189">They said, we speak Yiddish.</span> <span id="s190">They were taken away.</span> <span id="s191">They were never heard from again.</span> <span id="s192">Another thing, what could they do to a four- or five-year-old?</span> <span id="s193">I mean, that age?</span> <span id="s194">This happened.</span> <span id="s195">We were once again, after the Nazis left, told to please never, never be seduced by candy.</span> <span id="s196">We’ll give you anything you want, but you are here admonished, because of the children that had gone.</span> <span id="s197">We were worried that they would also visit the infirmary.</span> <span id="s198">There was an infirmary at the chateau, and that the children in the infirmary – there were three or four kids in the infirmary – who could be revealed as Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">From 1942, to September 1944, life in hiding was not too complicated.</span> <span id="s200">The war was going on.</span> <span id="s201">But somehow, the only thing we experienced was hunger.</span> <span id="s202">We were incessantly hungry.</span> <span id="s203">There was never enough food to be had.</span> <span id="s204">As children, we always talked about food.</span> <span id="s205">The way sailors talk about women, we always talked about food.</span> <span id="s206">One kid would say, I remember I had this much butter on my sandwich.</span> <span id="s207">Oh, it was fantastic!</span> <span id="s208">Another kid would say, I had even more butter than you.</span> <span id="s209">Food was an obsession.</span> <span id="s210">Well, the nuns did as much as they could.</span> <span id="s211">We were all vulnerable.</span> <span id="s212">From hunger, we did not have always the strength to fight diseases.</span> <span id="s213">But the nuns always took care of us in that respect.</span> <span id="s214">Some of us had ear infections.</span> <span id="s215">There was no penicillin.</span> <span id="s216">I had a very bad ear infection, and one of the nuns took me to the city of Arlon, which is a border between Belgium and Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s217">There was an infirmary there, where I was treated temporarily.</span> <span id="s218">But this was the problem.</span> <span id="s219">We were not fed enough.</span> <span id="s220">We did not have enough food.</span> <span id="s221">We were just waiting to reunite with our families, never knowing how the consequence of this war was going.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">The Germans, when they invaded Belgium, did not really have a political strategy.</span> <span id="s223">Once you incur your power in another country, you have to have some kind of a plan, economic, political, whatever.</span> <span id="s224">They didn’t.</span> <span id="s225">It was just a question of occupying this country as ultimately you would be the slaves of the One thousand-Year Reich.</span> <span id="s226">Ultimately, all bad things come to an end, and the occupation of Belgium finally came to an end, as the Americans liberated Belgium.</span> <span id="s227">We thought that September 1944 we would begin to see the end of the war, we would reunite with our families, and all would be like it was in the beginning, before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Alas, it didn’t turn out that way.</span> <span id="s229">There were no computers.</span> <span id="s230">There was no way of coordinating reunions with our family.</span> <span id="s231">But, somehow, after September, we were placed in different families that could accept us.</span> <span id="s232">I was placed with a Madame Stephanec, who my father worked for, and then we were sent back south, because they couldn’t accommodate us.</span> <span id="s233">Life was absolutely difficult, economically speaking.</span> <span id="s234">Unfortunately, we were in the one area where the Germans came back in WWII.</span> <span id="s235">They went from Dinant, and that was the Battle of the Bulge.</span> <span id="s236">Terrible aerial bombardment.</span> <span id="s237">The worst part of my experience of WWII was when we saw fields of American soldiers who were dead, German soldiers who were dead.</span> <span id="s238">We were looking for food.</span></p> <p><span id="s239">TRACK 06 – The Term: Hidden Child The term “hidden children” was not coined until, I think, shortly after 1947, 1948, when the diary of Anne Frank was found.</span> <span id="s240">The Diary of Anne Frank is the first concept that we had that we had to hide, as children, for being not responsible for who we are.</span> <span id="s241">In other words, the idea that because we’re considered pariahs, anathema, whatever you want to call it, marginals, we were – we had to be hidden, in order not to be exterminated.</span> <span id="s242">That whole concept of hidden children just is a concept that transpired after WWII, with the finding of the diary of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s243">I never heard the expression until about 1948, 1949.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">You would talk at the dinner table.</span> <span id="s245">So, what happened to you during the war?</span> <span id="s246">I was in hiding.</span> <span id="s247">Oh, good, pass the salt, please.</span> <span id="s248">It was trivial.</span> <span id="s249">It had no meaning.</span> <span id="s250">Of course, after Anne Frank’s diary became world famous, the world realized that there was such a thing as a hidden population; children, primarily, because even children were considered anathema.</span> <span id="s251">So, here I was, a hidden child amongst millions of hidden children.</span> <span id="s252">I’m sure that every war has a group of children who are in hiding, but nothing equal to WWII.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Amongst the children in Jamoigne, I doubt if maybe three of us or four of us ever found our parents.</span> <span id="s254">It was such an exclusive situation.</span> <span id="s255">My father was arrested in October of 1943, and he was taken from a place called Malin, to Buchenwald, which is Weimar, Germany.</span> <span id="s256">It’s a city where Goethe was born.</span> <span id="s257">Goethe is a German writer.</span> <span id="s258">The whole romantic school of German literature, Klopstock, Schiller, Goethe – in that particular geographical area of Germany.</span> <span id="s259">In fact, when my father was taken to Buchenwald, he met a professor of German literature who said, isn’t it nice to be near such a concentration of romantics?</span> <span id="s260">He realized quickly that it was a concentration camp, that it wasn’t a concentration of romanticism.</span> <span id="s261">Eighteen months’ experiences were revealed in his book, Beyond the Last Path.</span> <span id="s262">He was liberated by General Patton’s American Army on April 11, of 1945.</span> <span id="s263">This is the same day that Franklin Delano Roosevelt died, so here was an exuberant moment of liberation and, at the same time, the Americans were in their state of despondency.</span> <span id="s264">It was a sad moment for them, so there was sort of a conflict here, celebrating liberty and, at the same time, commemorating the death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s265">It was a very sad period for the liberators.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Shortly after we had our first meeting, and before too long, in 1946, we came to America.</span> <span id="s267">One of the first immigrants to come to America, right after WWII.</span> <span id="s268">My father had his mother, his two sisters, and two brothers, who came to America in the late 1930’s, just before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">L’abbe Froidure came to New York City in March of 1946, to raise money for his camp, which was called Le Camp des Enfants de Tervueren.</span> <span id="s270">This was a camp for children who came from the slums of Brussels.</span> <span id="s271">He wanted to give them an opportunity to breathe fresh air, to get out of the slums.</span> <span id="s272">He found this opportunity – did you know that there is a Henry Weinstock here who you hid?</span> <span id="s273">My God!</span> <span id="s274">So we went to the Belgian Consulate in Rockefeller Center on the 3rd of April 1946, and we hugged each other, and then, of course, it became a mediatic event.</span> <span id="s275">At that time, there was no television newscast, but there was the radio ABC, WCBS and, of course, the New York Times, the New York Post, and there were all sorts of journals.</span> <span id="s276">It says, “Boy Reunites with His Savior from the Gestapo.”</span> <span id="s277">That was very moving
