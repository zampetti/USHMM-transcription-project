and December fifth.</span> <span id="s4">Well, first perhaps -- let's go back just a little bit to, if you could talk a little bit about the circumstances leading up to the time of, of the liberation.</span> <span id="s5">What was, what was happening to you at that time in, you know, '44, '45?</span></p> <p><span id="s6">Answer: While in camp, or prior to the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s7">Q: In the camp.</span> <span id="s8">Why don't we start, start just talking about when, your arrival in the camp and a little bit, if you tell me, just give me a little bit of a sense what that experience was like on a day-to-day basis.</span></p> <p><span id="s9">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s10">Well, approximately in the Fall of 1942, I was transported from ghetto to Auschwitz concentration camp -- I arrived with my mother, my sisters and my two brothers -- where, at the time of arrival, men and women were separate immediately and when it came to select, to separate men, to put them in the right places, me and my two brothers were approached by the, by the German officer.</span> <span id="s11">He pointed my brothers to one side and me to another side.</span> <span id="s12">Within twenty or thirty minutes, I found myself standing with all the men and young children.</span> <span id="s13">On the other hand, on the other side, I saw where my brothers were, were about 45 young men.</span> <span id="s14">Something told me that I am in the wrong spot, I didn't like where I am, I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s15">When the soldier passed me by, I just ran across to where my brothers were.</span> <span id="s16">Later on, about 45, 50 boys were ordered to kind of slow running, jogging, went into Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s17">On the spot where I was, they went all to crematorium, they were gassed.</span> <span id="s18">So did my mother, my sisters.</span> <span id="s19">At that time, there were no women needed for labor, so all the women were gassed from that particular transport.</span> <span id="s20">When I arrived in Auschwitz, I was the youngest of the camper -- of about 18,000 inmates, and I was the youngest.</span></p> <p><span id="s21">Q: You know, in, in seeing the videotape and reading the transcripts, I, I was struck over and over again by that you seem to -- had a, had a sharp instinct for when there was trouble or when to take advantage of a situation -- you know -- such as that, such as that you were in this one place and you felt like something was wrong and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s22">A: There are a few, few moments like that you mention, in my life, kind of miracles.</span> <span id="s23">For instance, prior to arrive in the camp, as it is well known that I was raised by Dr. Janusz Korczak in the orphanage, where I spent some years.</span> <span id="s24">Many times, while German occupation on the ghetto, I had the chance to go out of the ghetto, over a wall or by a certain tube or by the way of a sewer, to go to the Polish side, where I did not look very much Jewish and I spoke very clear Polish, and the doctor used to give me a few zlotys so I could buy some supplies.</span> <span id="s25">I me…mean, how much could I carry, but as little as I could and bring it into ghetto.</span> <span id="s26">And also I was torn apart, I didn't know whether to be with my mother, my whole family was hungry, or be with the children.</span> <span id="s27">So sometimes I spent nights with, with my mother, where also during the night I used to go over the gate to the Polish side and buy loaves of bread, throw over the gate, throw over the wall to my mother; she used to sell it.</span> <span id="s28">What I want to bring out, that one particular night when it -- they decided to evacuate the orphanage, to take the childrens to Treblinka, to gas chambers, I was out of that ghetto, particularly that night.</span> <span id="s29">So, that happened to be what, one of the miracles that happened in my life, that I was not there at that night.</span> <span id="s30">When I arrived in there in the morning, the whole orphanage was gone, although I tried to join them and I was chased away by police that said, "You're not Jewish, get lost."</span> <span id="s31">There was another, another instinct while in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s32">If one was quite awhile in concentration camp, you got known and if the -- a good job, a good kind of opportunity came along, naturally the older inmates got priority.</span> <span id="s33">So I had a good job.</span> <span id="s34">I was working in a, in a place sorting clothes and while you sort clothes from the people that arrive from, from, from, from Poland to Holland, to -- or France, you always found an extra bite, something to eat.</span> <span id="s35">So I was pretty content.</span> <span id="s36">One day this German woman, a Nazi, uniform, I'll never forget her name, her name was Berta, she was wearing these leather boots and a whip, just flipping around her whip against her boots and was pointing with the, with the whip to certain men and young boys, and only with, with, with good skin on them, that the ribs were not exposed, the bones were not exposed, I had no idea why.</span> <span id="s37">And she pointed at me and my number was taken down by one of her helpers.</span> <span id="s38">Upon that, a request came from a camp that they need a few hundred men to build certain air strips.</span> <span id="s39">It was kind of emergency and they called the blockältester.</span> <span id="s40">From that barrack, his name was Heinz, a young man, he got along with me very good and he put me on the transport.</span> <span id="s41">I was very angry.</span> <span id="s42">I didn't know why is he sending me away, when I have it good, when I have, I was not hungry.</span> <span id="s43">Well, I couldn't help it, my number was given and I had to go.</span> <span id="s44">Later on, when evacuation started, when the allies were approaching this concentration camp… all those camp were naturally liquidated, and I met up with this guy, with Heinz.</span> <span id="s45">I says, "I'll never forget you, Heinz.</span> <span id="s46">Why, why did you do it to me?"</span> <span id="s47">He says, "Bubi" -- he used to call me “bubi” -- "you know, you wouldn't be alive now."</span> <span id="s48">I says, "What do you mean?"</span> <span id="s49">"Remember Berta?</span> <span id="s50">Remember she took your number down?</span> <span id="s51">Do you know why?"</span> <span id="s52">I says, "No, why?"</span> <span id="s53">"She wanted to make a bag and a pair of gloves out of your skin."</span> <span id="s54">Naturally, I was shook up very much and then, then I was grateful to him.</span> <span id="s55">So there was another miracle in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">Q: So where were you, where were you, where were you at the time of liberation?</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: At the liberation, I was liberated in a concentration camp called Allach near Dachau, near, near Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s58">Q: You had been transported to?</span></p> <p><span id="s59">A: I was transported fr… to many, many camps.</span> <span id="s60">From camp to camp, from camp to camp, because, as I said, the Germans were building little air strips, so always a few hundred men were in a certain, out of a village, like they had a, they had a shack made out of metal and they kept us there.</span> <span id="s61">But on the last days of war, like maybe it's known already to you that they put all the inmates on a dead march, and I was among also them, a dead march.</span> <span id="s62">We were marching and marching and marching and marching, thousands of, of people, of men, thousands of them, and everyday there were less and less and less and less.</span> <span id="s63">They left a certain time, I don't remember, a few weeks, after marching once, they told us to sit down and have our break.</span> <span id="s64">It was no coffee break, by all means, they gave us a few cold potatoes to eat and then they said, "Okay, let's go."</span> <span id="s65">Well, like the message passed from one to another, nobody would get up anymore.</span> <span id="s66">Like it was senseless, no use.</span> <span id="s67">So they got very angry and they ordered us to go up the hill and go against the trees and hands up.</span> <span id="s68">They said that they wanted to, to execute and also they gave the order, the, the high rank officer gave the order the soldiers, like “aim at the neck.”</span> <span id="s69">And we heard that the guns -- you know, whatever they had to do -- we heard that noise and we keep our hands up and we wait and wait and wait and wait and nothing happens, and then we hear one soldier looking through his binoculars said, "Mine God, four kilometers from here are the Americans."</span> <span id="s70">We heard that, and we stay and naturally you stay so long with your hands up, you get a little tired, so you kind of, we kind of look back a little bit and we saw no more Germans.</span> <span id="s71">So we drop our hands, we turn around, no Germans.</span> <span id="s72">So naturally we run down the hill, and believe it or not the tanks and trucks were rolling and we ran and, "Please, please, take us, take us, take us."</span> <span id="s73">Unfortunately, they had other orders than to take us and they passed by, they left us there, and the Germans came back and took us again.</span> <span id="s74">Took us again, put us in that camp and then not long we were liberated.</span> <span id="s75">We were liberated in, as I told you, in Allach when the allies came in, naturally they came in, they make pictures and everybody was running and asking, making motions with their hands for food, because we didn't know how to speak English.</span> <span id="s76">And they said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah," but nothing happened, there was nothing there, and by that time the Germans left us a few days before.</span> <span id="s77">They were afraid and we were kind of sorry because like this, everyday we got a little bit whatever -- we got.</span> <span id="s78">But like us, for three, four days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still there's nothing.</span> <span id="s79">But I, as I was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra bite, I went up on a -- it's bigger than a Jeep, kind of a little -- little truck, and I was looking, looking and I found and I ate a full box of what I thought it was chocolate and I ate a box of Ex-lax.</span> <span id="s80">I didn't know, I was happy, I found chocolate, I ate it and you could imagine what happened to me.</span> <span id="s81">I, I got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and I walked out of that, of that camp and there was this, on the road there was the field kitchen that the soldiers were fed, and I went and I was crying, "Pain, pain, pain," and there was one American soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polish, and I told him that I'm so sick.</span> <span id="s82">So he put me in his car, in, in his Jeep, and drove me to town called Mühldorf, put me in a hospital.</span> <span id="s83">They put me in a hospital.</span> <span id="s84">Oh, that was beautiful.</span> <span id="s85">They fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, and I, I just walked out of the hospital and went on my own.</span> <span id="s86">I went on my own and went into a little, a little village called, it was Mühldorf, I forgot the name, and I met with two other friends from concentration camp and there were, and, and on a, on a farm with two German older sisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they have to take in and take care of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s87">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s88">Because they, they think it was just the right thing to do or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yeah, they didn't know, they thought that's the order, that the Germans, for them to pay back, they have to take care of, of people that were in the camp.</span> <span id="s90">Ampfing, that's the name, Ampfing, yeah.</span> <span id="s91">And we went to them and they took care of us, we ate and drank and they did our clothes.</span> <span id="s92">We were there for several months.</span> <span id="s93">We got on our feet, then we decided to go to big town, to, to Munich.</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: What were you doing during those several months?</span> <span id="s95">These are the first couple of months after the whole experience, then...</span></p> <p><span id="s96">A: Well, right away we had an idea of doing business.</span> <span id="s97">In the -- in this little village, Ampfing, there was a forest and there was also a concentration camp called the Waldlager.</span> <span id="s98">In there, they were producing parts for airplanes, cyclically, and there were those, many, many of those electrical mo…motors left.</span> <span id="s99">So we used to go in there, take motors and sell to the farmers in exchange for a cow or -- and, and, and we took that cow or a calf or a sheep, we slaughter it and we used to sell the meat to those camps that were set up by, by, by the UNRRA camps, and made, made some money and...</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: But still, I mean, after you had, you had been in the ghetto and then been in, in Auschwitz-Birkenau and then, I mean that was a long period of time and this was the first point at which you were freed from those kind of stresses on your life.</span> <span id="s101">What was that experience like, those first couple of months?</span> <span id="s102">Were you elated or did it seem...?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">A: Well, those first few of months, why did we do those business, that kind of business, preparation, storage, buy food, put away, all in, in our mind was only not to be hungry, anymore.</span> <span id="s104">That's why we didn't want to wait, many of us, we didn't want to wait to get a handout, to wait from the UNRRA to give us something.</span> <span id="s105">I mean the first money came to my pocket and the first bakery I saw, I must have bought about thirty loaves of bread, and put it away.</span> <span id="s106">That was, you know, only in our mind, nothing else, nothing else mattered till later on, start, you know, we start to relive the whole bitter experience, try to look if anybody was left of the family, or whatever.</span> <span id="s107">And we came to Munich and got involved in business, doing business with, with the Germans, or with the Americans, kind of start, start, start a new life again.</span> <span id="s108">Till one day, I met somebody and I saw a number.</span> <span id="s109">By the number, we could identify which transport or which camp that person was, and I saw this number and I knew that he was in one of the camps where I was, which is Buna, and my brother was there.</span> <span id="s110">So I ask him, "You must have been in Buna."</span> <span id="s111">He says, "Sure, I sure was."</span> <span id="s112">"Did you happen to know Icek Baum?"</span> <span id="s113">He says, "Sure, I know him.</span> <span id="s114">Here's his address.</span> <span id="s115">He survived.</span> <span id="s116">He's in Czechoslovakia."</span> <span id="s117">Now, you can imagine how I felt.</span> <span id="s118">Immediately, I ran to a, to a translator that wrote a letter to the government of Czechoslovakia and I'm looking, looking for this person.</span> <span id="s119">Unfortunately, the answer came that “No one like this is known by the name.”</span> <span id="s120">During that time, my brother Icek -- and there's my older brother who wind up in Belgium, he was liberated somewhere and they went to Belgium -- thank God they found each other, and they were writing letters to each other and crying over my death.</span> <span id="s121">In the meantime, I was a hustler.</span> <span id="s122">I was successful in Munich.</span> <span id="s123">I was the first boy who could have a car, you know, I put a pillow under my seat so girls could see me and I was doing pretty well, and they were crying over me.</span> <span id="s124">But that never gave me any rest, that he told me my brother, and, and, and then I gave up hope.</span> <span id="s125">I said, "Well, must have been a mistake or something."</span> <span id="s126">Well, one day my brother Icek from Czechoslovakia decided to join up with his brother in Belgium.</span> <span id="s127">So he had to leave Czechoslovakia, come to Germany and somehow go to Belgium.</span> <span id="s128">On the train going to, going to Munich, he met up with a girl and says, "Why don't you accompany us to our camp?"</span> <span id="s129">And so he spent sometime with her.</span> <span id="s130">She says “Okay.”</span> <span id="s131">On the train station, he meets again the same person who told me that my brother was alive.</span> <span id="s132">He says, "Did you find your brother?"</span> <span id="s133">"Oh, come on, I have no brother."</span> <span id="s134">He says, "Yes, you have a brother.</span> <span id="s135">He's got a golden tooth, wavy hair."</span> <span id="s136">Now, again, my oldest brother that did not survive had the golden tooth and wavy, wavy hair.</span> <span id="s137">But that didn't matter.</span> <span id="s138">But he brought them next day to me, you know, to Munich and I joined up with Icek and I says, "Edyl didn't survive."</span> <span id="s139">He says, "What do you mean, he didn't survive?</span> <span id="s140">He's in Belgium."</span> <span id="s141">So then, somehow, we got together, all three.</span> <span id="s142">I was very happy.</span> <span id="s143">Me, me and my brother Icek went to Belgium to be with my, with my, with my other brother, and we were in a home not, not doing much.</span> <span id="s144">But that didn't give me any rest.</span> <span id="s145">I used to go over the border, forth and back, back and forth to, to Germany, do a little business, and then one day I was caught on the border, you know, and Belgium gave me a deportation.</span> <span id="s146">I had to leave Belgium.</span> <span id="s147">So, somebody took me over to Luxembourg.</span> <span id="s148">I went to Luxembourg and while I was in Belgium, somebody from my hometown, from Warsaw, approached me.</span> <span id="s149">He says, "Hey, you're 19 years old, you're just walking the streets, not doing nothing.</span> <span id="s150">Why don't you come to my place down, I, I have a fur shop.</span> <span id="s151">I put you down by the machine.</span> <span id="s152">If you learn the trade in two weeks, you have a job and you can make something."</span> <span id="s153">I says fine.</span> <span id="s154">So, I learned the trade and it was very useful, because when I went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier and I was working there, and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from Belgium decided to go as a volunteer.</span> <span id="s155">So I figured, my brother's going, what I'm going do all alone here?</span> <span id="s156">I went to Israel also, as a volunteer and became a Navy man.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">Q: Can we just go back and ask you; I’m, I’m, I'm curious as to -- you're this young man, in, in Munich, say, and right after the war -- 19, 20 early 20s.</span> <span id="s158">What was life like there for you at that time?</span> <span id="s159">I mean, you know, were you, were you -- you say you, you were interested in meeting women or were you hang…hanging out with friends or did you -- who were you, who were you -- what kind of social at…atmosphere was there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">A: Well, we had an apartment.</span> <span id="s161">Sure, I was interested, I was interested in girls and we had a maid in the house.</span> <span id="s162">You know, we used to socialize.</span> <span id="s163">We used to go out, there were concerts and, as I told you, I had a car and I couldn't register the car because there was that gasoline business.</span> <span id="s164">So I went to the, to the office of the Israel -- it was the Palestine, you know, Palestine consul -- and they had doctors to be driven around from camp to camp to, to check out the children, were they in good condition to eventually immigrate to Israel.</span> <span id="s165">I mean I was busy that I had my little world around me.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">Q: Who were the other members of that world and...</span></p> <p><span id="s167">A: Well, only, only us survivors.</span> <span id="s168">Only us survivors.</span> <span id="s169">We only mingled with the survivors, and then, naturally, started a business, buying American dollars, buying diamonds, buying watches, exchanging, doing this and that.</span> <span id="s170">Purpose, there was no purpose.</span> <span id="s171">We didn’t know -- just for the moment, to have a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s172">‘Til, ‘til I went to Belgium and then to Luxembourg and then to Israel, where I joined the Israeli Navy, also as a volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Was it, was it worth -- was it chaot… were, I mean you told me the story about you and your, your finding your brothers.</span> <span id="s174">I mean there must have been -- everybody, all of your friends -- must have had those stories of trying to find people and it seems like it must have been chaotic.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Oh, it was very, very chaotic.</span> <span id="s176">Very, very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s177">I mean, it was, it was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s178">It took about a year and a half to find them, you know.</span> <span id="s179">And while my brother was in Belgium, I got some connection with somebody who had connection with the Belgian consulate in Munich, and that man, that consulate gave to that man a list of names of people that did not survive.</span> <span id="s180">So we used that opportunity, because people didn't want to stay in Germany, Munich.</span> <span id="s181">They wanted to go.</span> <span id="s182">United States didn't open up the doors, yet.</span> <span id="s183">Canada, nothing happened.</span> <span id="s184">To Israel, nobody could go.</span> <span id="s185">So if there's opportunity to go somewhere, they wanted to go.</span> <span id="s186">So for 200 dollars, I was able to get an ID, piece of paper with a picture ID on the name of the person who perished in Belgium, and he could go home.</span> <span id="s187">So that person arrived in Belgium and Belgium the HIAS changed and gave him some, some papers.</span> <span id="s188">So we, we had the world and then, as when my turn came, I went to Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s189">Q: What was it like being in, in Germany af…after the war?</span> <span id="s190">I mean, did you, were you, were you angry at the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: Oh, we were, we were, we were very an… very, very angry.</span> <span id="s192">But, what, what can I tell you?</span> <span id="s193">We were very, very rough, very arrogant in, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s194">Like we went on a train and they ask for a, for a train ticket.</span> <span id="s195">We used to say, “Hitler paid already.”</span> <span id="s196">We never stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation.</span> <span id="s197">But after awhile, we calmed down.</span> <span id="s198">We calmed down, because we say, “Hey, what's the use, after all, you cannot blame the whole, the whole nation for it.</span> <span id="s199">Here, now, the Nazis, I thought were arrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're feeling with us, they're nice to us.”</span> <span id="s200">So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a young person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and calmed down, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: What do you mean brainwashed?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: That they say, “It's not my fault, I didn't know, my daddy, you know, it was very bad, he was forced into it.</span> <span id="s203">He didn't mean to do it.</span> <span id="s204">If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would go also to concentration camp.”</span> <span id="s205">And, and I saw these things happen because there were certain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not fulfilling the orders that they received.</span> <span id="s206">I didn't know exactly what the orders were.</span> <span id="s207">Like one very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the uniform, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to him.</span> <span id="s208">He says, "Well, I was a very high rank officer and I came home on vacation and my wife and the children were deported to a camp."</span> <span id="s209">He says, "Why?"</span> <span id="s210">Because apparently, his wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy.</span> <span id="s211">So that made her also a gypsy, they put in concentration camp.</span> <span id="s212">So he came back, he says, "Who am I fighting for?"</span> <span id="s213">You know, so he came to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s214">So, this way the Germans of the war made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were, were brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: And yet, it seemed reasonable at the time?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: I mean, I was reasonable, because after all, I, I didn't read any books.</span> <span id="s217">I wasn't that my --that much educa…educated.</span> <span id="s218">After the war, I didn't feel like going back to school and, you know, I wanted to roam around, to drive my car, to show off, go to dancing, be with girls, and my dream was to have a beautiful blue suit with white stripes.</span> <span id="s219">It was impossible to get it, but somehow I got it.</span> <span id="s220">So like after the war, whatever I wanted, it came to me, it fell into my lap, very easy.</span> <span id="s221">So I stopped thinking ab…about the past.</span> <span id="s222">I mean, it happened, it's unrepairable and when I found my two brothers, I was very, very, very, very happy and we kind of started a new life again.</span> <span id="s223">And as I said, the war broke out in Israel and my brother went.</span> <span id="s224">I says, "What am I sitting here in Luxembourg?</span> <span id="s225">There's no future here.</span> <span id="s226">I go to Israel."</span> <span id="s227">And I went to Israel and then I went to the, to the Israeli Navy as a volunteer.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Why did you, why did you decide to...did you have strong militant feelings about...?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: Not militant, I had the feeling for a Jewish state, for a Jewish state, that's Israel you know, that's all I knew.</span> <span id="s230">Because the camps, the UNRRA camps that I used to visit, you know, and all the girls, I used to socialize with a beautiful girl, and she says, "Oh, I'm not going to stay here.</span> <span id="s231">I'm not going to."</span> <span id="s232">Because people used to make, start making applications to go to United States, you know, had to wait for a quota.</span> <span id="s233">And people say, "I'm going to Eretz, I'm going to Eretz Israel, I'm going to Eretz Israel."</span> <span id="s234">And here, war breaks out and the word came around that young men should go to Israel to, to defend the country.</span> <span id="s235">So what was I then, 21 or 22, “What am I sitting here, sitting in Luxembourg?</span> <span id="s236">I'm with people that I, that I don't know, all alone, and I have a brother that came up from concentration camp.</span> <span id="s237">I want to be with him.”</span> <span id="s238">So I went to Israel, then I was in the Navy and I met my wife, got married -- while I was in the Navy, a beautiful wedding -- and the war ended and then they had to liberate me because it was not aliyah, was just a volunteer.</span> <span id="s239">And then I got angry in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: Well, when I, when I got married and then I finished the army, I needed some work.</span> <span id="s242">I needed something, so I used to go to the authorities and say, "It would be fair to give me a little help.</span> <span id="s243">I'm here, I came, I fought, I did my duty."</span> <span id="s244">And, "Well, nobody ask you to come."</span> <span id="s245">And I -- my ego, you know.</span> <span id="s246">So I said, “In that case, I would kindly ask for an -- you needed an -- exit visa.”</span> <span id="s247">So, took a while and I got an exit visa and I with my wife we return to Belgium.</span> <span id="s248">By then, I couldn't get any more help from, from, from the HIAS, because I left once.</span> <span id="s249">They wouldn't help me, so I was...by the way, I came into Belgium not legal, just with a transit for three months and I used to have to be -- have to -- had to hide out because the police was always chasing me.</span> <span id="s250">"You have to leave, you have to leave, you cannot be here, cannot be here."</span> <span id="s251">But to Israel I didn't want to go back, to Poland I didn't want to go, so I made an application to go to United States or to Canada, whatever comes first.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: Let me ask you about, I was wondering about how you met your wife in the army?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Well, I met my wife through a, through a friend.</span> <span id="s254">We used to walk when we had our, our day off or a few hours off, we used to walk on a main street and there was a photograph shop and my wife's picture was there.</span> <span id="s255">So my friend went in there.</span> <span id="s256">He said, "Who is that girl?"</span> <span id="s257">So, he introduced her, so they went out, and if one goes out, I was going with my friend also, you know.</span> <span id="s258">So she kind of liked me better because my, my, my friend was a kind of little, little funny making, making jokes, throwing over garbage cans and all that, and I was more on the quiet side, so she liked me and she intro…introduced him to her girlfriend and we got married and, after, they got married.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: What was her, what was her background?</span></p> <p><span id="s260">A: My background?</span> <span id="s261">For—</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Hers.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: My wife's?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Yeah, she also...?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: She's, she’s, she’s, she’s from Russia, Jewish girl from Russia, where her father was shot, 1941, and her mother married a Polish Jew, a Part… was in the Partisans.</span> <span id="s266">Now, because he was in Partisans, in Polish he was allowed to leave Russia.</span> <span id="s267">So he took the wife and his daughter out and they came to Poland, to Germany, and from Germany she went to Israel and that's, that’s where I met her.</span> <span id="s268">So, I went back to Belgium and then thank God my papers came through to come to Canada, first.</span> <span id="s269">So in 1951, I emigrated to Canada, where I was 15 years in Canada and then I came to beautiful United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Why did you -- you just went to Canada because— End of Side 1, Tape 1 Tape 1, Side 2</span></p> <p><span id="s271">Q: You just went to Canada because you couldn't get into the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s272">A: Because, because I couldn't st… they wouldn't let me stay in Belgium.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: I know, but...</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: And I couldn't stay in, in the United States.</span> <span id="s275">I mean, the quota was not, didn't call for Polish Jews, so I couldn't come.</span> <span id="s276">So I took whatever I could, so I went into Canada and started naturally work as a furrier and then I..</span> <span id="s277">.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: How come you didn't want to stay in Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">A: In Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s281">Why did you want to leave Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: Because I went, as I went to Israel and then to Belgium and I couldn't stay in Europe.</span> <span id="s283">I mean, I could have stayed in Germany, but the heart wasn't there, didn't want to stay in Germany.</span> <span id="s284">And Israel, I had a sour taste.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: And you didn't want to go back to Poland or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: No, I didn't want to go back to Poland, no.</span> <span id="s287">Poland, there's nothing there.</span> <span id="s288">No, I didn't want to go back to Poland.</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Why not?</span> <span id="s290">You didn't think of going back there and trying to restart your life there?</span></p> <p><span id="s291">A: In Poland?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s293">A: There was nothing there.</span> <span id="s294">All the family, everything was gone.</span> <span id="s295">The house, we, we heard a rumor it burned down.</span> <span id="s296">There was nothing there, and, and I suffered prior the war in Poland very much.</span> <span id="s297">I -- as I said, I only have four years of education.</span> <span id="s298">I had to be twice in grade four -- in fourth grade because of the anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s299">If there was a, a religious -- hour of religion, Jewish boys or girls had to go out of the classroom.</span> <span id="s300">When it was over, they came and start to beat me up because I killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s301">So I had a very sour taste about Poland, didn't want to go back to Poland.</span> <span id="s302">And in Belgium, I couldn't stay, so, and then Canada opened up, it was mass immigration, so I went to Canada.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: I'm curious as to -- how, how did the experience of, of, the experiences you had influ…influence the way that you and your wife decided to plan your life?</span> <span id="s304">I mean, did you -- do you think you kind of fell in love in the way that you…young people do here, or were you kind of hardened by the experiences you'd had and so didn't really have that -- kind of fall in love that way, or what was the...?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">A: Well, I did fall in love with her because she was 19, I was about 21, two young people started to grow up together, used to each other, and I was there for her, she was there for me, in the beginning.</span> <span id="s306">Then we came to Canada, started a new life, could -- tried to have a child, couldn't have a child, you know, tried and tried and tried.</span> <span id="s307">Business-wise, I became quite successful and finally in 1960 we adopted our daughter, which brought the greatest happiness in my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: What were you do... what was your career -- what career did you have?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Well, I started out as my trade as a furrier.</span> <span id="s310">But because I always was a hustler, I never felt like working for somebody else.</span> <span id="s311">So I started to work for myself, as a furrier.</span> <span id="s312">Then I changed, I opened up a driving school with somebody and I did driving school for ten years.</span> <span id="s313">Then—</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you taught or did you have a -- were you...?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: No, no, I taught how to drive.</span> <span id="s316">Yeah, I taught how to drive and then I drove taxis and then a building boom started.</span> <span id="s317">People were starting, getting money from cl— from Germany for restitution, you know, reparation money, and they want to buy houses and I saw on every corner they, they're building houses.</span> <span id="s318">So, I went into construction business also.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: What, what kind of business was it, just...</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: Building, building, building houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Contracting or...?</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: No, just building from, from, from ground.</span> <span id="s323">Yeah, build -- built houses and sold them and made some nice money, and then I was approached by some distant relative of my wife, I should come to United States, that the, the opportunity would be better and there are many people that would invest because they saw my experience because if I started a, a project, I was the first one to finish it, the first one to sell them.</span> <span id="s324">So they kind of like it.</span> <span id="s325">So I came to United States and it didn't turn out to be the way they said it's going to be.</span> <span id="s326">So I naturally came here and I spent two years in, in United States, not legal, because I couldn't come, they wouldn't let me.</span></p> <p><span id="s327">Q: How did it turn out not the way you thought it was, not the way they said it was going to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s328">A: Well, instead of my benefiting from them, they wanted to benefit from me.</span> <span id="s329">For instance, I had to grab a bus, leave my wife and kid at home and come because a broker called and there's a piece of land available, I have to go and see it, so I left everything and I came to see it.</span> <span id="s330">I drove around a whole week and I did what I had to do and Sunday -- everybody -- we had -- were supposed to be full partners and then Sunday I had to go up and show them.</span> <span id="s331">“See, if we built here, we make you the garden apartments or two units,” this and that, and everybody gave their opinion, not knowing what they're talking about.</span> <span id="s332">And that was going on for months and I -- even came a time when -- where in New Jersey, I actually made deposits to purchase some land for garden apartments and again, you know, back and forth, back and forth.</span> <span id="s333">So one day I called a meeting.</span> <span id="s334">I says, "We are here, four partners.</span> <span id="s335">We are ready to invest about 100,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s336">But in the meantime, everyone of you is working and making a living and you're calling me.</span> <span id="s337">I come here, I spend time, I leave a wife and a child, I have nothing.</span> <span id="s338">I would like that everybody should give me 25 dollars and I give myself 25 dollars, so I can send 100 dollars home so they can live.”</span> <span id="s339">"Oh well, you start to build, we sell, you make money."</span> <span id="s340">So I saw, so I just canceled out the whole thing, took back the deposits.</span> <span id="s341">But somehow I had to come to this country, so the only way was to clear the Labor Department.</span> <span id="s342">So I bought with somebody a little luncheonette.</span> <span id="s343">I thought it would be for a short time, so that I clear the department.</span> <span id="s344">So I came here, took me two years, until finally I got my green card, and I got stuck in that luncheonette for six years.</span></p> <p><span id="s345">Q: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s346">You bought -- you owned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: I owned the luncheonette, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: Where was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: On one, on Hudson Street, near the printing, near the Holland Tunnel, the exit of the Holland Tunnel.</span> <span id="s350">So I was stuck there for six years.</span> <span id="s351">It was the worst six years of my life, I must say, as a free man.</span> <span id="s352">I had to get up three o'clock in the morning and work and work and work and work, and finally I said if I'm not going to sell it, I'm going to burn it.</span> <span id="s353">I was so fed up.</span> <span id="s354">So finally in 1972, I was lucky to sell it and then my brother-in-law was in Russia and they married off their daughter and I always wanted to go, and like before I always, my dream was to go on a cruise.</span> <span id="s355">So I remember I was signing the papers Friday to sell the store.</span> <span id="s356">Saturday morning, I still had to go to the accountant to iron out some things and then a telephone call came in and they say there are two spots for 499 dollars on a cruise, you can go if you can make it by one o'clock.</span> <span id="s357">I made it, we went on that cruise, it was very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">Q: Where, where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s359">A: To the, to Nassau, to the Bahamas.</span> <span id="s360">It was very nice, and then I went to Russia to attend the wedding of my brother-in-law's daughter.</span> <span id="s361">And what else did I do?</span> <span id="s362">And then got enrolled in a, in a soap distribution.</span> <span id="s363">I used to sell cleaning products, and finally I went downtown and I saw the way that people are dressed, the people -- young, young kids.</span> <span id="s364">It gave me an idea to start an antique clothing store, clothing from forties and thirties, and I open up that store and since I'm a furrier, I was handling also furs.</span> <span id="s365">Became quite successful and I was able to purchase the building and was doing financially, financially very nice and at home, things weren't that great.</span></p> <p><span id="s366">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s367">What was...</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: I did, I didn't know that my wife is looking for her physical satisfaction somewhere else.</span> <span id="s369">I didn't know.</span> <span id="s370">I thought she doesn't need men, she's cold.</span> <span id="s371">But, so she had a fling here and there.</span> <span id="s372">I didn't know to any extent, until about 19, in the eighties, I got my married, my daughter married, naturally made a beautiful wedding.</span> <span id="s373">She has two children now.</span> <span id="s374">About 1987, my wife met a, a person who was homeless.</span> <span id="s375">I mean, partially, practically homeless.</span> <span id="s376">She was taking advantage of many people and she open up the door for her, to bring her in here.</span> <span id="s377">Slept on the floor and tried to manipulate my wife, a very shrewd person, very shrewd.</span> <span id="s378">I will not mention the names, but when the time comes I have to, I have to.</span> <span id="s379">And she used to convince my wife that it's all right to see other people, you know, kind of help her, bringing her up to some, to some, to some point, and at the same time tried to take money from her.</span> <span id="s380">“Borrow me here, borrow me there, borrow me here,” and “don't worry, do what you have to do, I'll take care of him.”</span> <span id="s381">And she was so shrewd, she convinced her.</span> <span id="s382">She brainwashed her and you know, but I didn't like her, her...</span></p> <p><span id="s383">Q: And she was living in the apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s384">A: That's right and I didn't like her mouth.</span> <span id="s385">Very, very bad mouth, so one day I wrote her a letter that if -- that she should leave us, leave our life and go, you know, and at that time when my, when my, my daughter left for, for California, I had the relapse.</span> <span id="s386">Because in 1983, I had a car accident and I had a disc, a herniated disk, but with exercise, and I fell into a depression when my daughter left me.</span> <span id="s387">And when I told this woman to go, she start begging me, “don't, don't.”</span> <span id="s388">My wife says, "Leave her alone, leave her alone, she's okay, you know, she helps out."</span> <span id="s389">I didn't know that my wife is using her as a cover-up, as a cover.</span> <span id="s390">Well, then when she pumped out from my wife whatever she could, she went to work on me, you know.</span> <span id="s391">"Oh, you're so nice, your wife is going to Florida, everything is fine, no worry, she cooked for me, she made me meals," and all that, and she says, “oh you're like my father and I give my life for you," and blah, blah, blah, talk and talk and talk a lotta nonsense.</span> <span id="s392">But one day she says, "Do you ever cheat on your wife?"</span> <span id="s393">I says, "No I don't.”</span> <span id="s394">Why?</span> <span id="s395">Because, well, I had a complex because my wife used to reject me, so I didn't have the, the, the, the courage to approach other women, because I couldn't stand rejection.</span> <span id="s396">So I said, "No, I don't do it," and, and we left it at that.</span> <span id="s397">And then again, and again, and again, when she couldn't take anymore money from my wife, she started, "Oh, I need an apartment, I need this, you help me."</span> <span id="s398">Okay, so I helped -- a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, and then she dropped, when she saw the moment is ripe, you know, that I am so depressed, she dropped a bombshell on me.</span> <span id="s399">She says, "You never cheat on your wife?"</span> <span id="s400">I says, "No, does she?"</span> <span id="s401">She says, "Yeah.</span> <span id="s402">You know this and this guy?"</span> <span id="s403">"Well, I think I do."</span> <span id="s404">And she told me, let's go, let’s go, let’s go to a detective office and I know exactly when and where she can be caught with this man.</span> <span id="s405">And she used to take telephone and put my wife together with that man.</span> <span id="s406">I mean, she plotted the whole thing.</span> <span id="s407">And, naturally, I go to this detective and I give a deposit, and she tells him exactly when and where -- they get caught.</span> <span id="s408">They get caught, I got grounds for divorce.</span> <span id="s409">Right?</span> <span id="s410">I got grounds for divorce.</span> <span id="s411">But here, I'm a wealthy man.</span> <span id="s412">See?</span> <span id="s413">So she says, "She's going to take everything away from you.</span> <span id="s414">Why don't you transfer it to me?"</span> <span id="s415">Transfer the building, you know, and make promises everywhere, “I do it for him because of my love and whenever he wants it I'll give it back to him,” you know?</span> <span id="s416">And she says, I says, "I want to make a settlement.</span> <span id="s417">Give her so much and so much to my wife."</span> <span id="s418">She says, "No, no, no.</span> <span id="s419">You'll give her as little as possible and leave the rest to me."</span> <span id="s420">Anyway, she manipulated my brain, she manipulated her brains and I was then under so much depression I used to take tranquilizers, Xanax, you know?</span> <span id="s421">And whenever I got depressed, she even had these pills in her bag and she used to give me, just to keep me calm.</span> <span id="s422">And she dragged me to a lawyer.</span> <span id="s423">Naturally, I signed over everything, you know, with a promise she is going to give it back to me, just because she put my wife on the telephone and she spoke to her and I heard her say, "Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s424">If he's going to find out, gonna to be divorced.</span> <span id="s425">I'm going to take everything and find myself a young lover and live my life."</span> <span id="s426">She prepared all that and I should hear it.</span> <span id="s427">So, of course, that aggravated me.</span> <span id="s428">So, I didn't want that to happen, that she should get everything.</span> <span id="s429">Whatever stocks she had, she made her sell and give me a check.</span> <span id="s430">I'm telling you, she took the building and hundreds of thousands of dollars and all that, and she was nice to me.</span> <span id="s431">She gave me a few years that I never had in my life.</span> <span id="s432">Actually the divorce went through.</span> <span id="s433">Right?</span> <span id="s434">She gave me, you know, and always money here, money there.</span> <span id="s435">And when the money start, you know, there was nothing much to give, she kind of pulled off and she looked somewhere else.</span> <span id="s436">So here comes along a woman friend that we knew together, that is in the process of dying, you know, of cancer.</span> <span id="s437">And so she went to work on her.</span> <span id="s438">"Oh, I'm gonna to be for you here.</span> <span id="s439">I'm gonna to help you."</span> <span id="s440">This and that, and that poor woman had a, had a bad relationship with her only son.</span> <span id="s441">She left with a second husband.</span> <span id="s442">For years, she couldn't get along with her son.</span> <span id="s443">However, her son has three children, very poor, and he made a bat mitzvah for her, for his daughter, and me and this person were invited and he didn't speak to his mother.</span> <span id="s444">His mother was dying of cancer.</span> <span id="s445">He didn't speak to her.</span> <span id="s446">But there come a moment when they were playing the hora, you know, dancing the hora.</span> <span id="s447">So he is -- the boy -- dancing the hora.</span> <span id="s448">I take his hand and his mother comes in.</span> <span id="s449">So I joined the hands of his mother and the boy and I say, "It's time."</span> <span id="s450">So they got together and start talking, you know?</span> <span id="s451">But in the meantime this woman get sick.</span> <span id="s452">So this person, again, start to brainwash this woman.</span> <span id="s453">"Get away from your husband."</span> <span id="s454">Blah, blah, blah.</span> <span id="s455">"I take care of you."</span> <span id="s456">And so sh— this woman made her the executive, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: So, so you said, but you said before that there are, there were a couple of years that, that it was okay, that—</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: I mean I, I, I accepted what she told me.</span> <span id="s459">I said -- I, I thought, “What's the use having everything, everything on my name, she wants it on her name to protect from the other one, shouldn’t take it.”</span> <span id="s460">So she gave me a few nice years.</span> <span id="s461">But when she met up with this woman and this woman started, oh she started on this woman also, make her executive over the -- full power of attorney, take out money from here, from there, everything, everything and her, she let up on me.</span> <span id="s462">She started to neglect me completely and I wasn't happy because I saw then, I realize, I saw, and this woman used to fa— the sick woman used to fall into a coma.</span> <span id="s463">And one time she woke up, she says, "Erwin, I hope she's not going to do to my son what she did to you."</span> <span id="s464">I said, "What are you talking about?"</span> <span id="s465">And she went back.</span> <span id="s466">You know, apparently this woman saw something.</span> <span id="s467">And I saw, look, she's making this woman sign this, and sign here, sign power of attorney and take money and transfer from here, and transfer there, and make the boy give her money.</span> <span id="s468">I didn't like it, and here three months she neglects me.</span> <span id="s469">So I approached her once, I says, "Look here, it's nice to take care of the person, but you're neglecting me.</span> <span id="s470">You're leaving in the morning, you come home three, four o'clock in the morning, five o'clock and run back."</span> <span id="s471">I says, "I don't feel good.</span> <span id="s472">I, I, I had chest pain and I had to go to emergency."</span> <span id="s473">She says, "Well, I'm not going to worry about you now."</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: So, in, in, in the meantime she had control, had the control of all your money and...</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.</span> <span id="s476">Well, and why I trusted her, people also ask me why I trusted her.</span> <span id="s477">My depression led to a heart bypass, to an operation.</span> <span id="s478">So I go to the hospital.</span> <span id="s479">My wife didn't have the time to go with me to the hospital, because she told her, "It's okay, you don't have to go.</span> <span id="s480">I'll take care of him."</span> <span id="s481">Now, before I go down to operation, before I close my eyes, I don't see my wife, I see her.</span> <span id="s482">When I come out, I don't see my wife, I see her.</span> <span id="s483">So, I mean that's how she plotted everything and that's how she made me trust her in full.</span> <span id="s484">You understand?</span> <span id="s485">So now, go back to this woman and so...</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: I just was wondering about the, I was a little concerned about the [tape skippeed].</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: This woman would argue back and forth.</span> <span id="s488">I says, "Look, you always promised, whenever I want the building, whatever money I gave, I mean hundreds of thousands of dollars, now I have nothing."</span> <span id="s489">I says, "Just transfer the building back to me."</span> <span id="s490">Because she took a big mortgage on the building also and messed it up.</span> <span id="s491">I took a mortgage of this apartment I gave her.</span> <span id="s492">Now I'm responsible for it.</span> <span id="s493">She says, "I'm not giving it back.</span> <span id="s494">I'm not giving back nothing.</span> <span id="s495">I give, I gave you, I took care of you."</span> <span id="s496">Well, naturally I started a litigation.</span> <span id="s497">I started a litigation and we came to a settlement that she, she will pay me for the building like -- on the time of transaction, somebody advised her that it couldn't be just like this.</span> <span id="s498">She got to kind of make a sale, so 160,000 dollars, she gave me a second mortgage.</span> <span id="s499">I wasn't aware that it's so powerful.</span> <span id="s500">She says, "The only thing you can get, you can get payments on the mortgage."</span> <span id="s501">So, well, we agreed on that.</span> <span id="s502">She made a few payments and then she, she defaulted on payments.</span> <span id="s503">So now I'm in litigation again with her, and she's such a person so vicious, you know.</span> <span id="s504">Wha— on every sentence, there's threat, she's threatening, oh, she'll do something, “I'm going to destroy him, my mother, my mother will come.</span> <span id="s505">She's going to make his family disappear.”</span> <span id="s506">Threatening and threatening and threatening.</span> <span id="s507">And that's where it's at now.</span> <span id="s508">I was a rich man and she, she made me a poor man.</span> <span id="s509">She's holding everything and wouldn't give it back, and now we're in litigation, and she took her mortgage and the bank is foreclosing on her also, because I put a sheriff to collect the rents, so there's no income.</span></p> <p><span id="s510">Q: Could you, could you tell me about -- I wonder if -- do you see any relationship between how -- what happened with this person and the earlier events of, of your life?</span> <span id="s511">Perhaps in terms of what happened with you with, with the, the -- your relationship with your wife and, and, you know, you said that she, you felt that she was, she was cold and—</span></p> <p><span id="s512">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">Q: I mean do you think that just happened because, you know, because of the relationship or is there something about your earlier experiences that may have—?</span></p> <p><span id="s514">A: Well, I don't know about what happened with my earlier experiences, because I thought that I was the happiest man in the world, you know, I was married for over forty years and I kept my wife on the pedestal, and in everybody's eyes we were the perfect couple, the perfect example.</span> <span id="s515">Everything is nice, so maybe she, she had a fling here and there somewhere, which is, I don't know, it might be, it might be natural, or not.</span> <span id="s516">But naturally, I wasn't happy at home -- very happy -- because she was not very attentive.</span> <span id="s517">Like I had to go to a doctor for a, for a angiogram report.</span> <span id="s518">She did not have time to go with me.</span> <span id="s519">And these little things bugged me very much and I felt an oppression.</span> <span id="s520">When I divorced her, you know, and this one was here -- came to my life.</span> <span id="s521">I mean, I was treated like a king, I must say.</span> <span id="s522">My juice was squeezed freshly in the morning.</span> <span id="s523">Right?</span> <span id="s524">My clothes was always prepared, what I should wear today, what shall I wear tomorrow, the best food.</span> <span id="s525">It took me on a trip to Europe, to Italy.</span> <span id="s526">I mean, the burden is on me now, because she falsified my signature on the credit cards and all that, the burden is on me.</span> <span id="s527">But she opened up my eyes.</span> <span id="s528">I, I saw things that I have never seen.</span> <span id="s529">But it wa— everything was planned, everything was, was planned in a, in a, in a most vicious way.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: What do you mean that she opened your eyes with just things?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: She showed me a world that I have never seen.</span> <span id="s532">I mean, she gave me love.</span> <span id="s533">She gave me compassion.</span> <span id="s534">She, she opened up her heart and her body to me in a way that I have never, never experienced, and, and I was happy, you know, I was happy and I had a good life, until I saw that all was material, you know?</span> <span id="s535">As long as there was money coming from here, some stock here, some bonds here and then she got everything -- there was nothing more to gain, to get, and she needed it.</span> <span id="s536">She could spend thousands in a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">Q: Did you talk to her about, tell her about your earlier exp…experiences, about your time in camps and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s538">A: Yes I told her, but she, she, she wouldn't -- she doesn't believe in Holocaust and that she doesn't believe in it.</span> <span id="s539">She says, "Oh, yeah, even you're acting when you talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s540">It's not true."</span> <span id="s541">You know, that's in a fight or -- later I understand why.</span> <span id="s542">Because she was married to a German and then she was married to an Arab, so it's a good combination to, to be anti-Semitic.</span></p> <p><span id="s543">Q: Do you think that that was something, that, that she felt, “Well, you were a Jew and so it was—”</span></p> <p><span id="s544">A: I don't know why.</span> <span id="s545">But this was apparently, this was her, her way of life, to get things out of other people.</span> <span id="s546">Because now, it clears my puzzle, because when she just came into our life, she used to ask my wife if she could get 10,000 dollars.</span> <span id="s547">Because when she left Europe, she shipped a lot of antiques to San Francisco, which are in storage -- you know -- and unless she gets it out, it will be auctioned off.</span> <span id="s548">So apparently she ripped off somebody else over there.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: How old is she?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: She is now about 35, 36, 38.</span> <span id="s551">I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">Q: And she was from Europe originally?</span></p> <p><span id="s553">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s554">Q: Tell me about your daughter.</span> <span id="s555">Tell me about your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: My daughter's my best thing that happened to me.</span> <span id="s557">She's, I mean, the way she wrote this poem, we, we are very close.</span> <span id="s558">She's very against her mother -- very much of what, what she did, and now she says, “Now she's a woman, now it comes back also.”</span> <span id="s559">Because she say, as a small child, my wife was never, she was never, she was never a mother, she was never a wife.</span> <span id="s560">The child was in first grade, all she had is a string with her keys on her neck.</span> <span id="s561">She had to go from school to this neighbor, to this neighbor, to this neighbor, to this neighbor.</span> <span id="s562">I had to manage, to close my restaurant, my luncheonette, as early as possible so I could run home and catch her, so I could be with her.</span> <span id="s563">When the child woked up at, at night and she never, she never cried out “Mommy,” she always cried out “Poppy.”</span> <span id="s564">So up to this day I was always for her.</span> <span id="s565">You should see the letters she writes to me, you know, so my experience with my daughter is very, very, very, very close, very close, very good, and my two little grandbabies, I mean, that's my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s566">Q: Can you tell me about the, you showed me the poem earlier.</span> <span id="s567">I wonder if—</span></p> <p><span id="s568">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s569">Q: …you could tell me—</span></p> <p><span id="s570">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">Q: …about what, about what she wrote and, and how that, how that happened -- she gave it to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s572">A: How that happened?</span> <span id="s573">She was, she was here in 1989.</span> <span id="s574">Her husband's brother got married on a wedding.</span> <span id="s575">And I think that, about that time, the Holocaust experience started to come out of the people, because we hold it, we were all holding it very, very suppressed.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">Q: What time was this?</span> <span id="s577">Was it like...</span></p> <p><span id="s578">A: That was 1989.</span> <span id="s579">Prior to that, my daughter would never want to hear about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s580">I mean, it didn't ring the bell.</span> <span id="s581">But then, one day she, she watched a movie, "The Last Solution."</span> <span id="s582">Certain things in it start to come toget…together and I don't know what it was, maybe I was, I was preparing an interview or something and I had an idea, "Why don't you write something, your experiences?</span> <span id="s583">What do you think about your father?</span> <span id="s584">," I ask her.</span> <span id="s585">So before she left, just scribble up on a little paper, to express feelings about me.</span> <span id="s586">So that's how she did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s587">Q: So tell me about what, what you meant, that, that up until 80 -- late, mid -- late ‘80s that you kept a—?</span></p> <p><span id="s588">A: Couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, it was too painful.</span> <span id="s589">Couldn't talk, because many times, going back again to the, to the -- with this person and my wife, I used to -- even now I have nightmares, you know?</span> <span id="s590">It's never escapes my mind.</span> <span id="s591">I'm seeing a psychiatrist, even at this time now, I just, you know.</span> <span id="s592">I wake up or I don't, I have to sit home and I cry, you know, because it, it haunts me all the time.</span> <span id="s593">So I used to wake up and cried, I cried at night, at sleep.</span> <span id="s594">My wife wouldn't come in.</span> <span id="s595">This person came in to wake me and calm me.</span> <span id="s596">And prior to that person, when she came to our life, my, my, my girl -- my daughter was sleeping here and she heard me and she didn't know what's what, and that's how she expressed herself here.</span></p> <p><span id="s597">Q: So your daughter would -- wasn't she, she wasn't aware that when she was growing up, there was -- you know -- you were, you were still haunted by this experience?</span> <span id="s598">Or she didn't know that you were going…?</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: We didn't talk about it very much.</span> <span id="s600">But only later on when I used to have those nightmares.</span> <span id="s601">Because before this we lived in a two bedroom apartment somewhere else, she has her own bedroom so she couldn't hear.</span> <span id="s602">But, yes, she heard me crying and she used to run, "Daddy, Daddy, what is it, what is it, what is it?"</span> <span id="s603">And I woke up in a cold sweat.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">Q: And you would tell her?</span></p> <p><span id="s605">A: I tell her that I just had this nightmare, this dream, of what was happening to me and then there, there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s606">Q: And how did she resp— what, what -- and how did she respond?</span></p> <p><span id="s607">A: Well she, I don't know how she took it because she never expressed her feelings to me.</span> <span id="s608">Because if you tell your story to somebody, it's to the other person, it's just like reading a book.</span> <span id="s609">It doesn't affect you very much because you did not live it.</span> <span id="s610">You see, us, survivors, you know?</span> <span id="s611">I'm talking to you and somehow I can not touch upon the, the feeling that it happened to me, you know?</span> <span id="s612">Because it was so tragic, so awful, what I went through, that it's just humanly impossible to comprehend, you know?</span> <span id="s613">So it's just like reading a book about somebody's experience.</span> <span id="s614">So you cannot expect anybody to have any, any feelings about it.</span> <span id="s615">Only it's being bombarded to the minds now, second generation and third generation are getting, you know, the, the, the, the experiences of the -- of their beloved is getting soaked into their, into their brains and, and the fear emerges, “God forbid it should happen to my children.”</span> <span id="s616">because a teenager will not feel it unless they have their own children and start to be afraid of what will happen to their children.</span> <span id="s617">Because seeing movies, “Schindler's List,” or reading books, or, or talking like I used to talk.</span> <span id="s618">I don't know if she heard me or not.</span> <span id="s619">That, that, that, that, that, that I watched them -- my sister, they told her to, to, to, to give the child, she wouldn't give the child so, so, so the guy pulled it out, throw down from the balcony, she screams and he shot her right in the mouth, you know?</span> <span id="s620">It's too heavy for a child to comprehend that it happened to her own family.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">Q: Anyway, you wouldn’t want -- I mean you -- that's not the kind of thing that you would tell—</span></p> <p><span id="s622">A: And I wouldn't, and I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">Q: So at, at that point, when she became— End of Tape 1 Tape 2, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: So at that, that point, when she became more aware that you had these experiences, did she then start to ask you about it or, or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: It was no need, it was no need to ask because it became all of a sudden it became knowledge, you know?</span> <span id="s626">Television, papers, books, libraries, you know?</span> <span id="s627">And people, I mean the people that we were associating with, you couldn't escape, you know, you could not have a conversation even up to day, you know.</span> <span id="s628">I go, even if I go see or socialize, I go out to evening with American people, so what comes first to their mind?</span> <span id="s629">Where are you from?</span> <span id="s630">Because of my accent.</span> <span id="s631">I tell them, well, to me, you are a refugee because you have an accent, you speak funny -- have an accent, oh, "where are you from?"</span> <span id="s632">"Poland, Warsaw."</span> <span id="s633">"Oh, my mother, oh my father, oh my uncle was in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s634">How did you survive?"</span> <span id="s635">So you cannot get away with it.</span> <span id="s636">It just lingers on and on and on and on.</span> <span id="s637">Like I talk to my psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s638">He says, "You have to try to get away.</span> <span id="s639">I says, "How?"</span> <span id="s640">No matter where I go, I come to you, I speak about it.</span> <span id="s641">I go to my doctor.</span> <span id="s642">I sit on, on a bus, on a subway, have a conversation about, about, about President Clinton, how wonderful he is and about Mayor Giuliani, what a wonderful thing he did to, he didn't let Arafat to the party.</span> <span id="s643">"Oh, where, where you from?</span> <span id="s644">I see that you're a European."</span> <span id="s645">So and then it starts, but it does not escape and the children are around and then they hear it, they listen.</span> <span id="s646">So there was never necessary to talk one on one to child what happened to me, because I wouldn't want to lay it on her.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: So, but you mentioned awhile ago that, that you thought that she -- the time when she became more aware of it was also the time when she had her own children.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Can you tell me how—</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: And now, now, now she’s a—</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: how did you see that -- what happened to her?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">A: Well, she, she, she became, she became aware and very protective of her children.</span> <span id="s653">God forbid -- and, and her hope and prayer is that Holocaust should not be repeated.</span> <span id="s654">Not so much afraid of herself, as of the children.</span> <span id="s655">Me -- like me now, God forbid something should happen to he— to, to them, rather it should happen to me.</span> <span id="s656">She became a mother, you know, very, very fearful because, of course, I mean she's intelligent woman, she hear of the skinheads and the, and the, and the neo-Nazis and all that.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: Can you tell me about the -- your -- is this fir— have you been in therapy for a long time or…?</span></p> <p><span id="s658">A: Yes, yes, for the past few years, I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">Q: For past few years.</span> <span id="s660">But had you before at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s661">A: Also before also, also before also.</span> <span id="s662">And in and out, in and there, but—</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: For how -- which time frame?</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Like in 1983, after that car accident, I was always in pain, always in pain, always in pain, and they tried everything on me and then figured that I need some therapy.</span> <span id="s665">So I went, I had biofeedback and, and psychiatry and all that and, and it helps me.</span> <span id="s666">And then, you know, taking those pills, those Xanax and Halcion, you know, they were bad stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s667">Q: What did -- so wh…wh…when -- how did the therapist respond to—</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Well, just talk and give me, give me some, some pills to calm me down, and I figured out that the best healing you have to heal yourself, you know.</span> <span id="s669">I got fed up with going, because every time I go to therapist, I get all worked up, you know, and it comes back again, the picture again, ‘til the next visit.</span> <span id="s670">You see, like I have to see my therapist on the seventh and already I'm like this, I have a few weeks of, of peace and it doesn't leave me.</span> <span id="s671">So I figure now maybe it's like two years almost, maybe, maybe I should take a break a few months.</span> <span id="s672">Maybe, maybe it's going to help me.</span> <span id="s673">She keeps me on those Prozac pills.</span> <span id="s674">But it doesn't do much to me, you see.</span> <span id="s675">I learned to accept, because I can't switch it off.</span> <span id="s676">No matter what I do, I can't switch it off.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: What do you mean?</span> <span id="s678">What, what can't you switch off?</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: The memories, the haunting, I can't switch it off.</span> <span id="s680">You see, like it gets, it gets dark, you switch a switch, a switch, a switch.</span> <span id="s681">You have light, you switch it off, it's dark.</span> <span id="s682">I cannot do it in my, in my brains, you know, it's just there, it's just there.</span> <span id="s683">I just see this Bertha, this woman pointing at me, you know, get his number down.</span> <span id="s684">I see this, this, this, this, this, this Ukrainian with a, with a, with a brown uniform, waiting for me at the end of the road with this branch, who got me here.</span> <span id="s685">Because we were, we were in ghetto.</span> <span id="s686">Out of Warsaw, my mother had two sisters in another part of town or a hundred kilometers from, from Warsaw, where the hunger was not so great and there was a little bit possibilities for food.</span> <span id="s687">But a lot of people found out and a lot of people came.</span> <span id="s688">So one night, they ordered all the Jews out in the field in the ghetto and they said to produce an ID card that you're a residents.</span> <span id="s689">My oldest brother, which is not alive, he succeeded to have one because the president of the ghetto's daughter used to socialize with my brother, so he fixed him a card.</span> <span id="s690">Comes me, my mother, my sisters, my brothers, we didn't have it.</span> <span id="s691">So what happened?</span> <span id="s692">About, they made like a -- like about a hundred of them here and a hundred of them here, standing on a row and everybody was back there and everybody had a whip or a br…branch and who didn't have that ID card, had to walk through there, around through there, to a destination over there.</span> <span id="s693">One of my sisters and two brothers were so lucky that they were the first ones, so one soldier took them and walked them through, without being beaten.</span> <span id="s694">So the other ones knew where to go.</span> <span id="s695">Came the turn of my older sister, she got beaten up like don't ask.</span> <span id="s696">Came my turn, I was small boy, I got a long coat, and I was running like a snake, you know?</span> <span id="s697">And almost at the end, there was one waiting for me and got me straight on my face, here.</span> <span id="s698">Actually, I had like, you know, swollen upper lip.</span> <span id="s699">It lasted about three days.</span> <span id="s700">No water even to wash it off.</span> <span id="s701">Lost my teeth and everything else.</span> <span id="s702">I mean all of those things, I..</span> <span id="s703">.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Ha…has that -- did those things affect you as much when you were, when you were young or—</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: Of cour—</span></p> <p><span id="s706">Q: …back in the fifties when you first came—</span></p> <p><span id="s707">A: It affects you—</span></p> <p><span id="s708">Q: …or you're away from Europe, you're in Canada?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: It affects me, Mr. Shapiro, when I hear the Ukrainians speak.</span> <span id="s710">You know, when I hear the Ukrainian language, that's, you know, it affects me.</span> <span id="s711">Because they were worse than, than the Nazis and the Germans.</span> <span id="s712">The Ukrainians, the Croatians and naturally the Polacks, the Polish people, bad.</span> <span id="s713">Because of a Polish boy in concentration camp, I was hanged by my hands this way, 20 minutes, and it gave me a disc and up, up to this day I have pain here.</span> <span id="s714">Because for us -- being good workers -- private, private, private people, truck owners, when we put, very fast, stones on the truck, as many trips they made, they made more money, used to give cigarettes to give to this commander, about 75, I guess.</span> <span id="s715">If there, if there were a few cigarettes left, my kapo, kapo, you know -- did you hear about the kapo?</span> <span id="s716">Gave me a name of somebody that passed away -- died -- so I could go again and get the cigarettes.</span> <span id="s717">So I went again and this Polish boy says, "Hey, he was here already."</span> <span id="s718">You know, he was here.</span> <span id="s719">So I start to run and they caught me and they hanged me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s720">Q: So, so those -- but you said that you can't turn off the memories of those.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: So it's not just that things remind you of those, that they're always just there.</span></p> <p><span id="s723">A: Yes, they're always there, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s724">Q: Do you think about them, do you think more now than you used to when…?</span></p> <p><span id="s725">A: Well, I cannot, I cannot, I mean it's always there, more or less it's always there.</span> <span id="s726">You know, a certain part of my life is now, five minutes something else can come about.</span> <span id="s727">All depends of the, of the environment where I am.</span> <span id="s728">If I see, if I see, for instance, a river, comes to my mind, oh yes, in Warsaw, Poland we were living not far from a river, you know, and people used to pass by to play tennis and stop by, buy some candy, some cigarettes from my, from my mother.</span> <span id="s729">And then I see a small house, I remind myself of a little village where my aunt used to live, with a, with a straw roof.</span> <span id="s730">I used to go every summer.</span> <span id="s731">And if I hear the, the, the, the Ukrainian language, I, I get frustrated, I start shivering.</span> <span id="s732">Then, then, then it all comes back.</span> <span id="s733">When I hear even a Jew speak German, oh my God, you know?</span> <span id="s734">Polish I can't stand.</span> <span id="s735">So it's everything connects to everything immediately, like I'm involved in everything, everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s737">A: Like ever…everything -- how can I express?</span> <span id="s738">Open up the TV.</span> <span id="s739">Most of, most of what you see is shooting, right?</span> <span id="s740">So, I saw it everyday of my life.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: So what is that...how does that...</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: That brings me that I witness those sceneries -- that affects me.</span> <span id="s743">Hanging, you know, I remember.</span> <span id="s744">Why, why hanging?</span> <span id="s745">Because three men, one of them I knew very well, Leon Fo…Fox, he was working in the barrack of clothing, he distributed clothing.</span> <span id="s746">And because of the clothing, he could find for himself nice civilian clothes, and in the clothing he'd find dollars and, and gold coins and he was able to bribe the SS to get him out of the camp.</span> <span id="s747">So him and two others escaped.</span> <span id="s748">But Auschwitz was no such a thing as escaping.</span> <span id="s749">One day, two days, three days, four days, they caught ‘em and brought ‘em back.</span> <span id="s750">And here they hang ‘em in front of everybody, you know?</span> <span id="s751">So when I see any hanging in a cowboy film, you know, that comes back.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Do you think that you're -- in the choices that you made in your life in terms of the kinds of things you were doing or that you wanted to do, I mean did you ever -- do you feel like that you were able to do what you wan…wanted to do or would have liked to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I was—</span></p> <p><span id="s754">Q: I guess like when I was growing up or most kids, when they're growing up, you know, they have these dreams of what they want to be, and in a way if you didn't have that chance -- how do you, you know -- I mean…</span></p> <p><span id="s755">A: Well, I was successful of doing what I wanted to do, you know, even, even though in the camp, even though in the camp….</span> <span id="s756">When they put us to Auschwitz and there was Russian and there was hunger, so to me it was no big deal.</span> <span id="s757">What else is new?</span> <span id="s758">I was hungry before the war.</span> <span id="s759">Before I went to this orphanage, I was hungry.</span> <span id="s760">So here it was already at least you guaranteed a few meals a day.</span> <span id="s761">Now, there were good days, there were bad days in the camps.</span> <span id="s762">When there were good days, was fine.</span> <span id="s763">When it was bad days, we used to talk.</span> <span id="s764">So they asked me -- they used to call me Bubi because I was the youngest there -- "Bubi what do you think?</span> <span id="s765">Are we gonna to survive?</span> <span id="s766">Are we going to make it?"</span> <span id="s767">I says, "I will.</span> <span id="s768">I don't know, you."</span> <span id="s769">I had that in my mind, implanted somehow.</span> <span id="s770">When they put the numbers, swear to God, you know, I should have learned this from my children, I'll talk to my brothers, “You know, we're gonna to show this in the United States.”</span> <span id="s771">I didn't even know if there is a United States.</span> <span id="s772">I thought there's Warsaw, there's Poland, that's it.</span> <span id="s773">I didn't even know.</span> <span id="s774">So I had that, how shall I say it?</span> <span id="s775">The foresight of surviving, of getting out of it, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s776">Q: Do you feel that you still, I mean especially given the troubles you've had recently, do you still have a sense of that, that, of that foresight of survival, that you'll get through and…?</span></p> <p><span id="s777">A: Oh yes, oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Is that helpful to you still?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: Yes, it helps me to get through.</span> <span id="s780">You see, what a person did to me, you know?</span> <span id="s781">And, somehow, I learned to live with it.</span> <span id="s782">Although I'm litigation, I'm going to get something out of it.</span> <span id="s783">I know I will.</span> <span id="s784">I know I will survive, somehow.</span> <span id="s785">See, thanks God, I'm not in too poor health.</span> <span id="s786">I'm gonna to be 70 years old, you know.</span> <span id="s787">I have my daughter.</span> <span id="s788">I have my two brothers.</span> <span id="s789">See, I don't know what to ask out of life more, because of what I didn't have.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Like, like, like I say, I was hungry before the war.</span> <span id="s792">Now, thanks God, my refrigerator is full of food, you know.</span> <span id="s793">I'm seeing a few people around me that are very, very nice to me, you know.</span> <span id="s794">I'm invited fo— to dinners and here and there.</span> <span id="s795">I go to synagogue twice a week.</span> <span id="s796">I'm very close to the Rabbi, although I cannot pay any membership.</span> <span id="s797">But someday I will, you know?</span> <span id="s798">I always hope that, that, that, that, you know, God will let me enjoy the rest of my years as peaceful, as normal as possible and do the best I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: Do you think that over the course of, of your life that you, that you, that you -- that hadn't made -- you know, what you said about how you -- because you didn't have any food and that just having food, having food was enough and to be able to sustain yourself is enough…</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: That was the dream in the camp.</span> <span id="s801">What was, what, what was our dream?</span> <span id="s802">Our dream -- like most of us, when there was a day off like Sunday, we didn't work, we were able to be in camp.</span> <span id="s803">Outside the camp, we didn't see it.</span> <span id="s804">But while in camp, we saw the fire above the chimney going very, very high, because of the fat of the human flesh.</span> <span id="s805">Not only there was the, the, the -- how you call -- the, the smog, but the fire.</span> <span id="s806">And in people's mind, well, one day, what do you want before that happens?</span> <span id="s807">Enough bread, just bread to satisfy your hunger and then I don't care what happens.</span> <span id="s808">Like before they execute a person, your last wish, that was our last wish.</span> <span id="s809">Now what I would, now what I, my only regret is, which I'm angry, why didn't my wife let me go 25 years ago?</span> <span id="s810">If I wasn't what she wanted me, I could have remarried.</span> <span id="s811">My daughter always cried out, "Why don't I have a sister or a brother?"</span> <span id="s812">I could have give her all that.</span> <span id="s813">That's my, that's my, that’s my pain.</span> <span id="s814">That's what I'm angry.</span> <span id="s815">And then, sometimes, I have an argument with God, to have an argument with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s817">A: Why, why did he take away my, my beloved?</span> <span id="s818">I mean my father had to die, he was 48 years old, he was a sick man.</span> <span id="s819">The war broke out, my mother was only 50 years old.</span> <span id="s820">One of my sisters had a little boy, two years old, I mean young.</span> <span id="s821">Why did he take ‘em all away and left me with all this hurt, this feelings?</span> <span id="s822">And then I forgive him.</span> <span id="s823">Sometimes I have not, then I forgive him.</span> <span id="s824">Well, somebody had to remain to, to, to tell the story.</span> <span id="s825">It shouldn't repeat itself.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Do you ever question or think about how, how it is that people can be evil to that extent, or how people can…?</span> <span id="s827">Did that ever -- is that something that happened then, or that you thought about -- that you think about since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: Circumstances brings it to them.</span> <span id="s829">How could people do it?</span> <span id="s830">Right?</span> <span id="s831">Germany before the war, I mean now I'm big scholar.</span> <span id="s832">What did I know?</span> <span id="s833">Germany before the war was in big depression.</span> <span id="s834">Right?</span> <span id="s835">No work, no food, no nothing.</span> <span id="s836">Here comes Hitler.</span> <span id="s837">Prosperity starts, everybody has everything, then he builds the Volkswagen for them.</span> <span id="s838">Whatever he does is right.</span> <span id="s839">So he says, "The Jews are our enemies.</span> <span id="s840">They're no good.</span> <span id="s841">It's their fault.</span> <span id="s842">They wanted the war.</span> <span id="s843">We have to get rid of ‘em."</span></p> <p><span id="s844">Q: But what is it about?</span> <span id="s845">I guess I’m thinking about, do you ever think about what it is about certain, certain people, that allows them to do things that are, you know, horrendous?</span></p> <p><span id="s846">A: Well, something, something penetrates to the mind, that dictates them it's the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s847">See?</span></p> <p><span id="s848">Q: But all the things -- I mean the things -- some of the, the things that you've seen, experienced, how could, how could anyone even justify that?</span></p> <p><span id="s849">A: Yeah, people think it's the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s850">Like this person, you know, who did so, so bad to me, took, you know, made me penniless.</span> <span id="s851">And this poor women, you know, took money from her and then she says to her son, "You know, I have to put some money on your account."</span> <span id="s852">So she put money on his account.</span> <span id="s853">Then she says, "You know something?</span> <span id="s854">You better withdraw the cash and let me hold it for you because your wife will leave you and get off, you'll have nothing."</span> <span id="s855">So the boy gives it to her, you know?</span> <span id="s856">He trusts her, because she's so manipulating.</span> <span id="s857">And now a year and a half later, the boy ask her -- you know, they also had the fight -- he ask her, "Are you ever going to give me the money?"</span> <span id="s858">She says that I got it, that I took it, you know?</span> <span id="s859">And then the poor boy believes it.</span> <span id="s860">So…some people that can manipulate other people's brain to do the right thing, and she thinks she does the right thing.</span> <span id="s861">Because she spend with me those few years, you know, I deserve that she should make me penniless and not give me back nothing.</span> <span id="s862">So it's very hard, it's very hard to say why, why people hold up other people, why people rape other people, why people kill other people.</span> <span id="s863">It's another sickness.</span> <span id="s864">Why, why, why people do good thing to people?</span> <span id="s865">You see?</span> <span id="s866">Like when I, I go back and I think, I good, I good -- I did good things, even while I was hungry, I did good things.</span> <span id="s867">And there are people up to this day, thanks God, to verify it, you know.</span> <span id="s868">While we were working in camp, there was a certain Kommando.</span> <span id="s869">We used to clean up, it was called the clean-up commander like.</span> <span id="s870">People came by transport.</span> <span id="s871">They had to leave all the luggage and everything and we used to put it on trucks and then go to the other location.</span> <span id="s872">We sorted clothes here, this, that and a big b…box, put the money in there.</span> <span id="s873">But while helping the people coming off the train, there was a few boys of us, what told us to do, I don't know.</span> <span id="s874">But when we saw a woman, in the 60s, a woman in the 20s, 30s, holding a child, we asked them, "Please have the child -- let your mother hold it."</span> <span id="s875">Why?</span> <span id="s876">A woman with a ch— an old woman had no chance, had to go.</span> <span id="s877">She was no, no, no good for labor.</span> <span id="s878">She had to go to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s879">A woman with a child -- because no children, no babies in camp -- go to gas chambers.</span> <span id="s880">But if we took the child and give to the older woman, we save the young woman -- she went to camp.</span> <span id="s881">Who told us to do?</span> <span id="s882">Why?</span> <span id="s883">No reason.</span> <span id="s884">We did it.</span> <span id="s885">There is one, there is one instant I experienced that I shall never forget for until I close my eyes.</span> <span id="s886">The end of 1944, Hungarian transports used to come.</span> <span id="s887">Two thousand day, 2,000 at night.</span> <span id="s888">I mean the crematoriums were so busy, they couldn't acc…accommodate all this killings.</span> <span id="s889">So they dug big, big holes, put people on the truck and straight in the fire.</span> <span id="s890">Here comes this transport at night and we're getting called out.</span> <span id="s891">I mean, I was hard as a rock over there.</span> <span id="s892">I didn't care, because I knew it might happen to me.</span> <span id="s893">If my cousin, whoever came, I knew he was going to die.</span> <span id="s894">Only looked if he has a piece of bread.</span> <span id="s895">Like from France or Belgium, they came.</span> <span id="s896">They used to bring sardines.</span> <span id="s897">We wanted a piece of salami.</span> <span id="s898">What happened to him will happen anyways.</span> <span id="s899">But here comes a transport and I do my thing.</span> <span id="s900">I see a girl, 18 years old, whether it was her baby or not her baby, I don't know.</span> <span id="s901">I say to, in Yiddish, “Gib dos kind tzu di mameh, un kim mit mir.”</span> <span id="s902">She goes like this, she takes me by my shirt, she says -- and the, yeah, the people knew what's going on.</span> <span id="s903">The flames from the crematoriums were noticed on the ramp.</span> <span id="s904">People were putting on tallasim -- “Shema Israel” were praying and screaming and the Nazis were running around, calm down, calm down the people, calm down with the dogs, I mean.</span> <span id="s905">And this girl, like that.</span> <span id="s906">"Look" she says, "I'm 18 years old.</span> <span id="s907">I didn't love in my life, yet.</span> <span id="s908">Why are you taking me to dead already?"</span> <span id="s909">You know, if she would have put a knife in my heart, I would be happy.</span> <span id="s910">It got me so down.</span> <span id="s911">So I got to talk to her.</span> <span id="s912">"No, no I don't -- it's no good for you to have the baby.</span> <span id="s913">Give it to mommy, give it to mommy."</span> <span id="s914">And we couldn't talk because if we would have be…been spotted, it would be the end of us.</span> <span id="s915">So, somehow I managed to surrender the baby and I managed to get her in the right place, where she went to camp, you know?</span> <span id="s916">And a few weeks later, I, I kind of visited that camp.</span> <span id="s917">I had a way of getting in, to exchange with somebody else who was working there, and the girl got, got crazy in that camp.</span> <span id="s918">I thought I saved her life.</span> <span id="s919">So this, this will haunt me to the rest of my days -- this moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s920">Q: Have you been, you know, active at all politically or, or with terms of, you know, trying to continue to kind of he…help people that way, or, or in your life since then—</span></p> <p><span id="s921">A: I mean, I mean—</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: …or have you been too busy just trying to—?</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: I mean, I mean, no, no, I can't because it’s, it's too, it's too, very -- too, too, too, too, very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s924">I mean, if I'm being questions, I can go on and blabble and talk, you know, I can answer the questions.</span> <span id="s925">But to be involved, not really.</span> <span id="s926">I mean, if the Rabbi has a demonstration somewhere, I go besides him, you know, help him out.</span> <span id="s927">Like there was this incident that a Polish priest accused the Jewish star of being equal to the, to the Nazi or the Russian.</span> <span id="s928">You know, we went and protested that they should retrieve this, this -- you know.</span> <span id="s929">But otherwise, not really, no.</span> <span id="s930">I mean, I'm a member of the Holocaust survivors, where we meet, you know, and talk about things.</span> <span id="s931">But nothing, nothing big, nothing much, because there's nothing I can do.</span> <span id="s932">I mean, to talk to people, what can I tell them?</span> <span id="s933">What can I tell them that they don't know, yet?</span> <span id="s934">I mean -- and to -- and there is plenty of us to educate the youth and there is plenty books available now, that children can read.</span> <span id="s935">And sometimes children of American parents, from synagogue want to interview me, I do it.</span> <span id="s936">I, I speak to them, because they have a project to write or whatever.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: I wanted to talk a little bit more about the, the period of your life in the ‘50s, after you got to Canada and kind of—</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">Q: …seemed like there was period there where you kind of really started to settle and rebuild a—</span></p> <p><span id="s940">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: …rebuild your life.</span> <span id="s942">And I was interested in, in, in that period particularly, and I was wondering if you're interest in, in having a child was in all related to your earlier experiences.</span> <span id="s943">Was that…?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Yes, it was.</span> <span id="s945">It was very important to me to have a child, because I always wanted a family.</span> <span id="s946">Because being, being from a family of seven, you know, and then I have a -- my, my brothers, like one brother has two children, the other brother has three children and here I'm, I’m childless.</span> <span id="s947">And I always loved children, you know, I wanted to have a child and tried and tried and tried.</span> <span id="s948">Nothing happens and one day she got pregnant and lost it, you know.</span> <span id="s949">So, I was kind of very depressed about it and it was very much on my mind, until we found out about this adoption agency -- the Jewish agency, of course -- and going through a lot of investigations and thanks God I succeeded to have my daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">Q: Did they have any, did the people who do investigations, the people in the adoption agency were interested in you and...</span></p> <p><span id="s951">A: They were, yeah, but not directly to me.</span> <span id="s952">They were speaking to other people.</span></p> <p><span id="s953">Q: Do you think that, did you find out what they were interested in particularly or were they...</span></p> <p><span id="s954">A: My character, my character, my character, and if I'm, if I’m a suitable father.</span> <span id="s955">My character, but, of course, they all, all gave their best opinion.</span> <span id="s956">I didn't know, I didn't know, until I found out this past Jewish holidays, because I always go for the holidays to Montreal, to my -- to be with my brothers for Passover, now I went.</span> <span id="s957">And there some people, even my partner that wa— I was in driving school business with him, he's still there.</span> <span id="s958">When what happened with my wife, I kind of closed the doors.</span> <span id="s959">I didn't want to speak to nobody, because of -- I don't want ‘em to start pumping me with questions.</span> <span id="s960">Because I wanted this chapter, I want it to be forgotten.</span> <span id="s961">But then I figure, “These people didn't do me any wrong.</span> <span id="s962">They always inquire about me.</span> <span id="s963">It's time to get out of the closet.”</span> <span id="s964">So while I was in my brother's house, I invited two of my closest friends.</span> <span id="s965">Ah, well [indecipherable] you cannot.</span> <span id="s966">So we start to talk and they told me, you know.</span> <span id="s967">"You know, when you were adopting Mona, they came to us to vouch for you and they asked me, 'What do you think Mr. Baum?</span> <span id="s968">Is he going to make a good father?'"</span> <span id="s969">They said, "Of course, he's going to make a wonderful father."</span> <span id="s970">"How about, is she going to make a good mother?"</span> <span id="s971">And the answer was, "Mr. Baum will be a very good father."</span> <span id="s972">You know?</span> <span id="s973">That's what they told me.</span></p> <p><span id="s974">Q: So they had the feeling already then?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">A: They have a feeling, yeah, that she wasn't much.</span> <span id="s976">But things got, that, that was my, my luckiest break, you know, to, to have her.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Could you tell -- I was wondering about if you ever feel that people see the, the number or that—?</span></p> <p><span id="s978">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s979">Q: Do you ever get tired of, of people recognizing you as that, or seeing you and saying, "Oh, well, that's what he is and that's..."</span></p> <p><span id="s980">A: No, what -- because nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to be ashamed of, you know.</span> <span id="s981">Nothing to be ashamed of.</span> <span id="s982">That's one reason.</span> <span id="s983">Second reason, if anyone of the people who did it to me, “Hey, I made it.</span> <span id="s984">You did not succeed.</span> <span id="s985">You didn't get this one.”</span> <span id="s986">Know what I mean?</span> <span id="s987">I have something to, like I say, “Here, you may touch me, I'm real and I was there.”</span> <span id="s988">My idea, because in 1981 was the first gathering in Jerusalem of the concentration camp survivors, and I heard that there are many that don't believe it ever happened.</span> <span id="s989">So I said, "Well, you come talk to me.</span> <span id="s990">I was there.</span> <span id="s991">Here it is, my picture."</span> <span id="s992">You know, just to prove.</span> <span id="s993">It's not that I am proud of it, you know, but there it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s994">Q: You're still speaking in the sense of that maybe some -- you know, how celebrities feel, that people are always recognizing them—</span></p> <p><span id="s995">A: Oh, well—</span></p> <p><span id="s996">Q: …and then they kind of, you kind of -- you don't want people to just assume that's the most, the biggest part of your life or that—?</span></p> <p><span id="s997">A: Yeah, it is, it is.</span></p> <p><span id="s998">Q: It is what?</span></p> <p><span id="s999">A: It is the biggest part of my life, because, you know, my youth was robbed.</span> <span id="s1000">You know, I was robbed of the best years of my life.</span> <span id="s1001">Couldn't go to school, you know, and after when I was growing up, I didn't know, I was floating around.</span> <span id="s1002">A boy 19 years old, all alone in the world, you know.</span> <span id="s1003">What the hell are you doing?</span> <span id="s1004">You know?</span> <span id="s1005">You cannot come home and see that— End of Tape 2, Side A Tape 2, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s1006">A: A boy 19 years old, all alone in the world, you know.</span> <span id="s1007">What the hell are you doing?</span> <span id="s1008">You know?</span> <span id="s1009">You cannot come home and see that Mama made dinner for you or have a brother or sister to talk to.</span> <span id="s1010">All alone.</span> <span id="s1011">That was, that was wrong.</span> <span id="s1012">You know, that's—</span></p> <p><span id="s1013">Q: What is -- what were you, were you -- did you, did you have at all that sense then?</span> <span id="s1014">When you talk about that period, you almost talk about it as though it was a happy -- not a happy time, but it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s1015">A: I was try…, I was trying to disguise it, to be happy, you know?</span> <span id="s1016">“Well, let's live now,” but it wouldn't escape me.</span> <span id="s1017">It wouldn't escape me, especially, especially to see people who do have family, because right after the war, people came from Russia, people came out of hiding and here were those families.</span> <span id="s1018">Where are, where are mine?</span> <span id="s1019">See?</span> <span id="s1020">One of my youngest, one of my sisters, went to Russia in 1941.</span> <span id="s1021">She went deep into Russia.</span> <span id="s1022">Now, there were mil— thousands and thousands coming out of Russia and I cannot find her.</span> <span id="s1023">And I'm sure the Germans didn't get where she was, because one year later after she went, she wrote us a postcard.</span> <span id="s1024">We got one postcard.</span> <span id="s1025">She and her husband.</span> <span id="s1026">"Oh, we are in, in Siberia, voluntarily."</span> <span id="s1027">Because my brother-in-law was working as a mechanic for Singer Sewing Machines and she was learning to be, to -- as a welder.</span> <span id="s1028">So, they were workers and I write to Red Cross and everywhere else and I cannot find them, you know?</span> <span id="s1029">If I would have a sister and I was her joy, you know?</span> <span id="s1030">She is, she is two -- four -- six years older than me -- she was already a teenager and I was a child.</span> <span id="s1031">She used to work as a cashier in a bakery before the war.</span> <span id="s1032">Whatever money she make, she used to take me to amusement park, on rides and buy me pastry and all that -- and I don't have her.</span></p> <p><span id="s1033">Q: So, so you'd say you think you were kind of trying to disguise it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">A: I disguise it, you know, I inflict fake happiness.</span> <span id="s1035">You know what that means?</span> <span id="s1036">Fake happiness.</span> <span id="s1037">Because loneliness is a terrible thing, especially when holidays come about.</span> <span id="s1038">You know, that's why I run at least to be with my brothers, you know, because this—</span></p> <p><span id="s1039">Q: How long do you think that, that continued for?</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">A: How long it will continue?</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: How long did it continue, that, that kind of—</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">A: Disguise?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">A: It's still there.</span> <span id="s1045">It's still there, you know, like I, like my brain would be split in two.</span> <span id="s1046">This one is happy and this one is trying to repair it, you know?</span> <span id="s1047">Where -- what the freak are you happy about?</span> <span id="s1048">What are you happy about?</span> <span id="s1049">You're all alone, you know?</span> <span id="s1050">You suffered so much, you know?</span> <span id="s1051">You cannot -- American people, other people, are blessed with one thing; whether it's Thanksgivings or Yom Kippur, you can go to cemetery, visit your beloved ones, beloved ones.</span> <span id="s1052">Where can I go?</span> <span id="s1053">You see, there are certain times, that's very tragic.</span> <span id="s1054">1988, the Polish people from Warsaw decided to invite people, kids that were in the orphanage by Dr. Korczak.</span> <span id="s1055">It was 75 years of existence of the home.</span> <span id="s1056">Naturally, I was invited.</span> <span id="s1057">I go with my friend David from, from California.</span> <span id="s1058">I go there and, naturally, we go -- first of all we go to visit the home.</span> <span id="s1059">So I walk in to the, to the home, where there were my happiest time I spend there.</span> <span id="s1060">Five meals a day.</span> <span id="s1061">I was hungry before the war.</span> <span id="s1062">There were five meals a day.</span> <span id="s1063">You know what that means?</span> <span id="s1064">Clean clothes, clean beds.</span> <span id="s1065">I mean, respect at the school.</span> <span id="s1066">"Oh, this boy's from Korczak."</span> <span id="s1067">Respect.</span> <span id="s1068">I walk in.</span> <span id="s1069">First of all, I take a look.</span> <span id="s1070">There was this big, big armoire we had and everybod… every kid had a drawer with a number.</span> <span id="s1071">This is gone, feeling like you were a little boy and you had your favorite toy.</span> <span id="s1072">They take it, but they give it to you back broken.</span> <span id="s1073">You know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1074">That feeling surrounds me.</span> <span id="s1075">But anyway, time for introduction and “Oh, I'm from there, I'm from there, I'm from there.”</span> <span id="s1076">All the kids that were there, were already prior to me and were out before the war, because they accepted children from seven to 14.</span> <span id="s1077">After 14, they went -- Dr. Korczak gave them two suits, pair of shoes, a job and a room -- room for next one.</span> <span id="s1078">They were all gone.</span> <span id="s1079">I was the last one to be in the period with Dr. Korczak together.</span> <span id="s1080">Now I hear people come to introduce themselves, “I am so and so, and I am so and so.”</span> <span id="s1081">And here comes this tall, skinny man in the 70s.</span> <span id="s1082">He says, "My name is Aleksander, Misza, Aleksander, but they used to call me Szura."</span> <span id="s1083">Now, Mr. Shapiro, if there would be a hole I would fall right in there.</span> <span id="s1084">This was my Mr. Szura.</span> <span id="s1085">He was my counselor.</span> <span id="s1086">He used to do my homework with me.</span> <span id="s1087">When there was a parent meeting, he used to go for me.</span> <span id="s1088">So -- you know?</span> <span id="s1089">And I showed him one of the picture and he recognized me.</span> <span id="s1090">Now, we embraced and hugged.</span> <span id="s1091">Unbelievable, you know?</span> <span id="s1092">I found somebody that was, like, very close to me.</span> <span id="s1093">And of course we go in the hall, we sit down and everybody gets assigned to, to a seat at table.</span> <span id="s1094">Now, why would I get assigned at a table where I was, where I was as a child there, at the same chair, they made me sit there, you know?</span> <span id="s1095">They didn't know.</span> <span id="s1096">Kind of a coincidence.</span> <span id="s1097">And then we start telling stories about experience, you know -- what -- “Who knew Walter (ph) Korczak?”</span> <span id="s1098">and I says, “I remember Dr. Korczak of two, two special events.”</span> <span id="s1099">One nice one, and one not so good.</span> <span id="s1100">The nice one was that Dr. Korczak was very, very much conc…conscious about the kids eating.</span> <span id="s1101">He used to walk around and make sure that the child eats.</span> <span id="s1102">Walk around, so.</span> <span id="s1103">The child takes a piece of bread, takes a bite and he holds it, so he used to grab from the piece of bread, put it in his mouth as a joke, as a gesture.</span> <span id="s1104">The second moment, war broke out, the bombs are falling, no food.</span> <span id="s1105">But Dr. Korczak managed to bring always a little bit more.</span> <span id="s1106">Now, here it says on the blackboard, “Two slices of bread each.”</span> <span id="s1107">Everybody gets two slices of bread.</span> <span id="s1108">Dr. Korczak gets two slices of bread.</span> <span id="s1109">What happens?</span> <span id="s1110">He gives this two slices of bread everyday to another child.</span> <span id="s1111">Doesn't eat.</span> <span id="s1112">You know?</span> <span id="s1113">Things like that.</span> <span id="s1114">And then they took us -- I want to come back about the cemetery -- they took us to visit the camps.</span> <span id="s1115">Visit the camps, and then the thing was over and I tell to my friend David -- since we hired this Polish guy with a car, with a Mercedes -- “Why not go to Auschwitz?”</span> <span id="s1116">I want to got to Auschwitz, to Birke…, where I was.</span> <span id="s1117">I didn't know why, you know?</span> <span id="s1118">Although I, I knew why, because I was never -- I did never feel liberated.</span> <span id="s1119">Because, when I was a child, they push me into camp, you know?</span> <span id="s1120">I had to go in and the thing was closed.</span> <span id="s1121">Like in the, in the, in the, in the country -- in the small villages, if a train has to pass, they have a kind of, to close off the road.</span></p> <p><span id="s1122">Q: A gate, kind of.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">A: Yeah, on a pole, that's what they close, I couldn't get out.</span> <span id="s1124">Here I go to Auschwitz and I walk in, because I want to walk in.</span> <span id="s1125">Right?</span> <span id="s1126">I walked in, I go to, to the crematoria, I say my kaddish there, because that's where my beloved -- you know?</span> <span id="s1127">And here, there is a car waiting outside for me and I walk out, and I'm free!</span> <span id="s1128">I liberated myself.</span> <span id="s1129">So I feel liberated, now.</span> <span id="s1130">Since 1988, I feel liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">Q: So you, you, you felt different before—</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">A: I felt different—</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">Q: …your whole life before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1134">A: I felt different before, because -- why?</span> <span id="s1135">Because I know the Russians liberated the camps.</span> <span id="s1136">Their object was to liberate the camps.</span> <span id="s1137">Unfortunately, our American people, they had no orders to liberate the camp.</span> <span id="s1138">They went to occupy the territory.</span> <span id="s1139">They came into my camp, is like a person purchase, buys a building and the tenants are there.</span> <span id="s1140">So we were there, whether they want it or not, and beside there was no provision for us, no nothing, and beside running down from the hill, they wouldn't take us, they left us.</span> <span id="s1141">So I didn't feel I was liberated.</span> <span id="s1142">They came in, they took away the camp.</span> <span id="s1143">I went to the hospital.</span> <span id="s1144">So I never felt like they came in for the purpose of liberating us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1145">Q: I was surprised about that -- about the hospital -- that they -- what kind of hospital was it that they would -- just a civilian German hospital?</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">A: Civilian German hospital, yeah.</span> <span id="s1147">Matter of fact, there was a German lying next to me.</span> <span id="s1148">He didn't get nothing, you know, because there was no food.</span> <span id="s1149">But for me, was -- there was a Jewish administrator already placed in there, you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1150">Q: But, but how come it wasn’t -- how come the hospital wasn't just full of other people from the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: Be…becau…becau…because there was, there was, there was, was -- right away in the camp -- was made like a hospital in the camp.</span> <span id="s1152">I mean beds and the sanitars, you know, came, took care of ‘em, because they were dying like flies from overeating or whatever, you know, there was, you know, but I walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: So it's almost -- I mean, you were almost kind of really lifted out of that whole experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: That's right, that's right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1155">Q: By this soldier.</span></p> <p><span id="s1156">A: By the soldier, yeah.</span> <span id="s1157">By the soldier, I was -- I says “schmerzen” in German, “pain, pain, pain,” -- crying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">Q: You never went, you never went back to Auschwitz until—</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: No, no, ‘til 1988.</span> <span id="s1160">I never went back there.</span> <span id="s1161">Never went back and it felt good, I went to the crematoria site.</span> <span id="s1162">I said my kaddish and I, and I walked out.</span></p> <p><span id="s1163">Q: What was it, what was it like being back there and seeing those places after all that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1164">A: Reliving the whole thing, reliving because naturally they appoint a, a, a, a guide.</span> <span id="s1165">You know, whatever he was telling me, I says, "Oh, come on.</span> <span id="s1166">That's how it was.</span> <span id="s1167">That's where it was.</span> <span id="s1168">That was my bunk.</span> <span id="s1169">That's where I slept.</span> <span id="s1170">That was my barrack.</span> <span id="s1171">Here they put a number on me, you know, and here is the place where they made all experiments on the people, you know, on the -- like removing testicles from the men or giving, giving all kind of experiments to the women."</span> <span id="s1172">I knew all that, I knew, all of a sudden everything came back to me.</span> <span id="s1173">Although, although in Birkenau, they, they, they were able to preserve some barracks, but somehow they were all there when I came in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: They were all—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: They were all there, I mean in my mind they were all there.</span> <span id="s1176">I could say, “This is the A lag— A camp, B camp, C camp, here's the Gypsy camp,” you know.</span> <span id="s1177">“Here's this block -- there were the people that were brought from Theresienstadt, you know, they allowed people to come in with their families, with their husbands and fathers and childrens and they were making movies.”</span> <span id="s1178">I say “Here's block nine, where they kept two Greek Rabbis, with the beard and the tallis and prayer books everything, so they could film them for propaganda.”</span> <span id="s1179">All that, all that came back.</span> <span id="s1180">I didn't see myself as, as coming from United States.</span> <span id="s1181">I see myself as being there, like walking from place to place.</span> <span id="s1182">And, then, all of a sudden something shook me up, “Hey, come on, time to go home.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: And so, then, then you left.</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: Oh, it was very hard, was very hard.</span> <span id="s1185">You know, we were invited to this Mr. Alexander, to his home and talked and cried and hugged and talked and cried and hugged and...</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">Q: What were you talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s1187">A: About what our experiences -- and he still continues to take care of children, to take care of an orphanage.</span> <span id="s1188">Because he survived in Russia and his wife saved his life.</span> <span id="s1189">He's got a Polish, a Catholic wife.</span> <span id="s1190">She saved him.</span> <span id="s1191">She hid him, and he still, talking about the experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1192">Q: Do you talk about the experiences much with, with other camp su…survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">A: Yeah, everybody has a different story, you know and we try to compare.</span> <span id="s1194">If we hit on one who was in the same camp, “So, you knew this one, you know that one, you knew this one, you knew that one.”</span> <span id="s1195">And everybody -- not only a book -- I mean every survivor has a whole library.</span> <span id="s1196">There's so many things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1197">Q: Library of other people's stories or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1198">A: I mean everybody could open up a library, write many books, you know?</span> <span id="s1199">If I would have the possibilities to ever, to write a book, don't you think I could write a book?</span> <span id="s1200">I mean, if somebody would want to write it or like, a lot of books come out that does -- don't make much sense.</span> <span id="s1201">But I think that mine experiences, I don't know if they must be greater, but….</span> <span id="s1202">And then I was kind of disappointed in the museum in Washington, also.</span> <span id="s1203">They are making a big fuss of Anne Frank.</span> <span id="s1204">Okay, so she's a girl, she wrote a diary.</span> <span id="s1205">But why isn't there nothing about this Dr. Korczak?</span> <span id="s1206">Dr. Korczak was one Jew in Poland who had a program on the Polish radio.</span> <span id="s1207">He was, he was a doctor, he was writing books for children.</span> <span id="s1208">Never mind all that.</span> <span id="s1209">By the end of the last moment, they had papers for his freedom.</span> <span id="s1210">Can you imagine?</span> <span id="s1211">Germans trying to liberate a Jew.</span> <span id="s1212">There was so much pressure for him, and he refused.</span> <span id="s1213">He wanted 200 passports because there were 200 children then, and they went all to gas chambers, to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1214">I mean, a little bit more, could be, should be elaborated about him.</span> <span id="s1215">There is nothing, although I gave ‘em material, plenty material.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: What do you think that that has -- do you think that that has -- I mean someone like that has a larger effect on the world than just what he does for his particular children, just by being alive and performing those acts that he can treat something on a larger—</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Who?</span> <span id="s1218">The doctor, Dr. Korczak?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">Q: Yeah, someone like that.</span> <span id="s1220">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1221">A: I mean he was the, he was the, as a young man, already his life was devoted for children.</span> <span id="s1222">He says, "I'm not married yet, but I love children already."</span> <span id="s1223">Doesn't matter, although my orphanage where I was, were only Jewish children.</span> <span id="s1224">But he also took care of other children.</span> <span id="s1225">No matter what, a child could come into the orphanage with, with blisters and boils, he kissed them on the head and took them in.</span> <span id="s1226">It was an amazing, I mean unbelievable person.</span> <span id="s1227">Sure, he's got an effect, because there are not many like him.</span> <span id="s1228">And I was, was one -- to me, to me -- he asked me -- I mean I have no name for him.</span> <span id="s1229">You want to ask me, how will you call him?</span> <span id="s1230">A hero, sure, a grandpa, Superman.</span> <span id="s1231">Just a wonderful, wonderful man who was -- soft, little hands, lil…little pillows, you know, he touched you.</span> <span id="s1232">You know, when he came into the room the whole house lit up.</span> <span id="s1233">He sat down there was one child here, one child on this knee, one child on the shoulder and the hands, you know, on the shoulders.</span></p> <p><span id="s1234">Q: Were your experiences something that your wife and you talked about much over the years?</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">A: Well, not, not, not really, because she had nothing to do with the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s1236">She was in Russia during the war and she had her own bad experience.</span> <span id="s1237">She was hiding out.</span> <span id="s1238">She lost her father.</span> <span id="s1239">Her brother was taken to the army.</span> <span id="s1240">They didn't know where he is, when they left Russia, they didn't know about him.</span> <span id="s1241">Although later on he was found and we brought him over here.</span> <span id="s1242">But Holocaust survivors, no, she didn't have that much experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">Q: Was she -- was it something that she would discuss in terms of your relationship at all or did she, you know, feel that—</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">A: Well, I don’t—</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q: …did she ever tell you that she felt that, that—</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">A: …felt that—</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">Q: …you were changed by that experience?</span></p> <p><span id="s1248">A: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1249">Q: Or there were things that...</span></p> <p><span id="s1250">Q: Not really, no.</span> <span id="s1251">It didn't, it didn’t, it didn’t affect her because I couldn't make her, make her feel like one of me -- like, like she should, you know, feel for me because she hel— she heard stories from other people.</span> <span id="s1252">So, my story to her was just another story, because she happens to be a non-compassion person.</span> <span id="s1253">No compassion, you know, no compassion whatsoever.</span> <span id="s1254">Whether I was sick or her mother was sick, “Ah, it'll be all right, be all right,” like.</span></p> <p><span id="s1255">Q: Do you think that do you think that, that, that the fact that, that you became involved with someone like that or became married to a woman who was like that -- do you think that—</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">A: I didn't know then.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">Q: You didn't know then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1258">A: I didn't know then, because when I met her, you know, three months later we were married.</span> <span id="s1259">Three months later we were married and then some pity, pity overtook me, because she had a stepfather -- you know, and they were in Haifa, only one room, there was not much room -- and her stepfather kind of pushed her to get married, no matter who it is.</span> <span id="s1260">So one day, she, she used to tell me, she got together with a, with a -- that boy, you know.</span> <span id="s1261">And a wedding was arranged to take place like a day or next day, and then she broke out in tears to her mother, "Mom, I don't love him.</span> <span id="s1262">I can't, I can't."</span> <span id="s1263">So her mother says, "Okay, you don't love him, don't get married."</span> <span id="s1264">And when she met me, there was love, I think she loved me too, but it was, it was different.</span> <span id="s1265">It was different, you know, we're two -- we're qui…quite comparable and I must say I'm a person that -- I'm a, I’m a giver -- always giving, always giving.</span> <span id="s1266">I mean when I, when I used to go with her to a party, no matter if I came home dead tired from, from my work, I made sure that she's being served together -- the smorgasbord, whatever -- I make a plate first for her.</span> <span id="s1267">You know, always kept her on a pedestal.</span> <span id="s1268">And she was a taker.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">Q: Are you, are you a religious man at all, or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">A: No, not religious, but confused, you know, because sometimes, where was he?</span> <span id="s1271">You know?</span> <span id="s1272">And then when I'm in trouble, I'm turning to him, “God, help, God help me please.”</span> <span id="s1273">And, sinc…since a couple years, I started to attend synagogue and that makes me feel good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Why?</span> <span id="s1275">What makes you feel good?</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: I have no, I have no idea.</span> <span id="s1277">Becau…because it's my like second home, you know.</span> <span id="s1278">I got, I got friends there, you know, and we sit together.</span> <span id="s1279">They're all survivors and we pray and sometimes I'm lucky, I'm being called to the Torah to say the prayer and it’s -- it warms my heart a little bit, you know.</span> <span id="s1280">And I'm being invited sometimes for supper at night, dinner.</span> <span id="s1281">I'm seeing a lady and I can make kiddush.</span> <span id="s1282">You know kiddush?</span> <span id="s1283">Although I didn't know Hebrew to pray, but now I educated myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">Q: You've learned it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1285">A: Yeah, educated, because as a little boy, I knew a little bit.</span> <span id="s1286">I didn't want to go to cheder because the Rabbi used to beat us.</span> <span id="s1287">So mother was trying to get it to the home, but then again it was interrupted because she didn't have any money to pay him.</span> <span id="s1288">So certain words I remember and now I, I taught myself again.</span></p> <p><span id="s1289">Q: But you said you were, there's some confusion, that you're confused in some sense about God.</span></p> <p><span id="s1290">A: I'm confused about God -- of, of seeing things happen that should not happen, you know.</span> <span id="s1291">I was touched by it personally, you know?</span> <span id="s1292">But then I don't know whether it was his fault or it was -- but I always turn to him.</span> <span id="s1293">I always turn to him, I always turn to him.</span> <span id="s1294">Is -- Well, well you can be mad at your father also, you know.</span> <span id="s1295">“Why, why did you do this?</span> <span id="s1296">Why?”</span> <span id="s1297">And then when you need him, you go to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: So, you -- but you believe in Him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: I think that He's there, I think, I think He's there, you know?</span> <span id="s1300">He couldn't save, He couldn't save everybody, must have been busy, too busy at that time when everything happened, overlooking other things, so.</span></p> <p><span id="s1301">Q: Do you have any notion of an afterlife or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: No, not really, not really, you know, it's gone, it's gone.</span> <span id="s1303">There should be some indication there is something.</span> <span id="s1304">Nobody, nobody came back, so, I mean it would be so good, some beloved would come, hey don't worry, come and join us or are they so selfish, you know?</span> <span id="s1305">“It's there for me, I'm afraid there's no more room for anybody else.”</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">Q: Do you have -- have you ever had a sense that after what you had been through -- I mean it seems that you were able to at least have a sense for yourself that life was worth living, that there were things that were, you know -- you wanted to have children, you wanted to have, have work and build a comfortable life for yourself, a career for yourself and—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1307">A: Yeah, sure, li…life was worth living.</span> <span id="s1308">God, God gave me, God gave me a gift of life and I took the best advantage I knew how and I had good times.</span> <span id="s1309">Like I said, I became very, very successful, although it went down the drain.</span> <span id="s1310">I don't know whether it was God's will or it was, it was kind of a vicious act of somebody, to take advantage of the situation when, when I was going through heart surgery and I was going through a depression -- but, but that, that's okay.</span> <span id="s1311">But again I turn to God and I say that God, in his way, will punish the guilty and award the, the one that's being mistreated.</span> <span id="s1312">I believe that somehow everything will come to an end and it will straighten itself out when I'll be on my feet again and be able to go see my children as often as I can, which is -- this is my priority.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Do you think it's easier for you to be friends with other survivors because you have this kind of common—</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Not only that's in common, I'm a easy person to, to have friends, I'm -- you know, I must say, if I make acquaintance with somebody, they seem to like me immediately because I'm so easy going -- very, very easy.</span> <span id="s1315">I don't complain, I don't criticize.</span> <span id="s1316">To me, they’re -- people are beautiful.</span> <span id="s1317">People are beautiful and they're basically good people.</span> <span id="s1318">There are someone bad, so then again, they have poisoned blood in them, you know, that you cannot extract.</span> <span id="s1319">But basically people, people are good people -- people are not, are not vicious, in general.</span> <span id="s1320">So—</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: Have you maintained your attachment to, to Israel, do you think, or do you still have a sense of—</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: Well, I had, I mean I feel for Israel very much.</span> <span id="s1323">I feel, but as again, I have a sour taste in my mouth of -- the, the refusal of getting a little bit of help -- like you help me to get it to get a room, help me to get a job, because it was available.</span> <span id="s1324">But the time was called protektsia.</span> <span id="s1325">It means, it's not what you know, it's whoms you know, you know.</span> <span id="s1326">Like at 1949, the, the, the, the job you could get is to unload ships -- hundred kilo sacks, work eight hour shift -- if you were lucky enough to get it.</span> <span id="s1327">But some people got two shifts, you know, again.</span> <span id="s1328">So I was angry about it and I went to the authorities.</span> <span id="s1329">I said, "I'll do anything.</span> <span id="s1330">I want to stay.</span> <span id="s1331">I want to…."</span> <span id="s1332">"Nobody ask you to come."</span> <span id="s1333">That hurt, you know, I risk my life, so God let me live.</span> <span id="s1334">But I did my duty.</span> <span id="s1335">So did my brother.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Do you think you would have stayed if you—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1337">A: I would have stayed if I could get a little -- establish myself, get a room and support support myself -- earn a living.</span> <span id="s1338">I would have stayed, of course, I would have stayed.</span> <span id="s1339">But I had the choice and people were trying to leave Israel.</span> <span id="s1340">There was no possibility, and I thought I was privileged just because I was a volunteer, so they could not hold me there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1341">Q: Were there a lot of other survivors there at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1342">A: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s1343">I mean, the Haganah you know -- right, or I'd say 85% survivors, you know, they came in.</span> <span id="s1344">They got a gun, one gun for a few people, didn't know what to do with it, but just got it, you know.</span> <span id="s1345">The war was won by, by God -- miracles, miracles, you know.</span> <span id="s1346">Didn't have nothing to shoot with, you know?</span> <span id="s1347">We went on a, on a, on a boat -- on a metal boat, and they taught us how to make machine gun noise with our heels.</span> <span id="s1348">And there I thought, my God, what is this, what they have?</span></p> <p><span id="s1349">Q: You mean so that—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1350">A: A noise, a noise like you make [stamping] -- stamped on the deck -- “da, da, da, da, da” with your foot -- with your heel on the metal, and it's noisy, sounds like a machine gun.</span></p> <p><span id="s1351">Q: And what was the value of that?</span> <span id="s1352">So that people would think—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1353">A: To make them think that we shoot them with machine guns.</span> <span id="s1354">They left everything they had and ran, so we could get -- grab their ammunition, because they had more than we did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1355">Q: What do you feel -- do you think people felt like after the experiences in camps?</span> <span id="s1356">That they had nothing to lose at that point or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1357">A: Well, first of all, nothing to lose.</span> <span id="s1358">Then, second, was a challenge, the challenge to be in the army among your own.</span> <span id="s1359">Because before the war, if Jewish boys were supposed to be drafted to the Polish army, they did everything possible not to go.</span> <span id="s1360">Chop off a finger, chop off a toe, go on a, on a, on a diet to lose a lot of weight, fu— and not to go to the Polish army.</span> <span id="s1361">And here was different -- volunteered, volunteered.</span> <span id="s1362">But once you were in the army, we were trying to get out.</span> <span id="s1363">By all means, we were trying to get out.</span> <span id="s1364">So, you know, that, that we were not stable, we were not stable, you see.</span> <span id="s1365">Couldn't call a home, Germany.</span> <span id="s1366">Some people went to Poland, back.</span> <span id="s1367">They were killed there, right?</span> <span id="s1368">In 1956, there was this killing and all that.</span> <span id="s1369">So we had no place, no, no place that we could call home.</span> <span id="s1370">So when Israel became a country, “Oh, we're going home, we're going home to our homeland.”</span> <span id="s1371">And then you came -- then, then you saw a different story; where there are two Jews, three opinions.</span> <span id="s1372">It was, was very hard.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: Have you ever thought of going back there since then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: To live there?</span> <span id="s1375">Well, if my daughter would go, I would probably go to live, yeah.</span> <span id="s1376">My, my late friend that passed away, he, he bought a condominium there and we were planning to be together, spend a lot of time together in Israel -- maybe I would live there.</span> <span id="s1377">But now they are as they are -- they are already 3,000 miles away from me and to go to live there, I would be too far again from them, so….</span> <span id="s1378">And then I have my two brothers and we're not getting any younger, you know, so I don't want to spread out too much.</span> <span id="s1379">I'm the youngest, each two years apart, so whenever there is an occasion, I just -- be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: Do you, do you ever talk with your brothers about your experiences?</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: Only, only, yeah, only experiences and—</span></p> <p><span id="s1382">Q: What do you mean only what?</span> <span id="s1383">You only talk about—</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">A: I mean there is no -- nothing else to talk about.</span> <span id="s1385">What can we talk, politics?</span></p> <p><span id="s1386">Q: No, about your lives now or—</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">A: Well, we know, we know the lives -- we know.</span> <span id="s1388">They know my life, I know their lives.</span> <span id="s1389">So that’s -- oh, we pick, we pick a topic like, you know, hear about the persons; “Oh, how is, how is Moisha doing?”</span> <span id="s1390">“Oh, remember, he was here and…,” then, then we go on, we go on with experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s1391">Q: Just remembering—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1392">A: Remembering -- repeating the experiences, yeah.</span> <span id="s1393">Like my oldest brother, my oldest brother Edyl, he, he had worse than all of us because he is a nosy person, you know, he walks around.</span> <span id="s1394">So when we came to Auschwitz, he started walking around and I always -- I said, "Let's be together, so when they put our numbers we have ‘em close by."</span> <span id="s1395">So like my older brother has “630,” I have “631” and I told Edyl, “Be behind, you're going to have ‘632.</span> <span id="s1396">’” But he wandered off, half an hour later I don't see him.</span> <span id="s1397">And months later we find out that they took him to another camp called Jawischowitz coal mines, in the coals, working in the coal mines at night and getting -- going to work in chains.</span> <span id="s1398">Terrible, terrible, terrible.</span> <span id="s1399">Now, I was working on that cleaning Kommando.</span> <span id="s1400">I had access to money, access to jewelry, and my brother, Joe -- Icek -- was in Buna, also working already, two, three yea…years in a camp, he organize and he knew some authorities.</span> <span id="s1401">So, truck drivers were going from my camp to his camp bringing supplies, shoes and clothing from us to them and he send me a little letter, through a driver.</span> <span id="s1402">He says, “If I could get—” End of Tape 2.</span></p> <p><span id="s1403">Tape 3, Side A</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">A: He says, “If I could get hundred dollar bills, a lot and some jewelry or watches, I could pay off some people to bring our brother from his camp to our camp.”</span> <span id="s1405">So I -- whatever I -- nobody saw, because we were ordered to put all the valuables in a big box, but I gave to the driver.</span> <span id="s1406">If I gave him five hundred dollar bills, so maybe he gave to my brother one or two.</span> <span id="s1407">But he accumulated and he succeeded.</span> <span id="s1408">They called him as a specialist from one camp and they brought him to, so they were together for the, for the last few months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1409">Q: So—</span></p> <p><span id="s1410">A: So we talk about those things, how he came as a muselman and how my brother made them clean the, the kettle of the food and how he scraped out and swallowed a piece of wire and they had to, had to operate on him -- you know, the Polish sanitars operate on him and there was no, they couldn't put him to sleep, they didn't know what to do, or how to do, they just open up, they thought he's got appendicitis.</span> <span id="s1411">So they looked in -- nothing wrong, so they cut op— cut open the stomach -- the belly cut open and they look and look and they find a piece of wire and there's an air raid, you know?</span> <span id="s1412">So, they let him lie on the table like that, you know, tied up hands and feet, no, no narcotics, no nothing and then when the raid is over, they come and they stuck a chicken feather in his eyes, “Oh you're still alive?”</span> <span id="s1413">They threw the intestines in, sew him up and my poor brother is still suffering because everything is tangled up in there, so he's got to live on baby food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1414">Q: Are, are you close with your brothers?</span></p> <p><span id="s1415">A: Very, very much, oh yeah, very much, very close, very close.</span> <span id="s1416">The sister-in-laws didn't get together, but who cares?</span></p> <p><span id="s1417">Q: What do you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">A: I mean sister-in-laws, like always, you know, whether it's envy or jealousy or what, but I'm very close to my brothers, we call each other several times a week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">Q: Did they have, have they had successful marriages, or—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1420">A: Yes, yes, my eldest brother has a successful marriage -- he's got three children.</span> <span id="s1421">My middle brother also, he, he lost his wife, but he's got now another one -- which, which is better, she takes care of him -- I mean, I'm so happy with her -- he's a sick man.</span> <span id="s1422">He's got one kidney, I brought him to Montreal and because he had knowledge of electricity, so I got him a job with electrician, with a man that I saved his life in concentration camp so he, he owed it to me.</span> <span id="s1423">So, he gave him a job with him and they would put, to put up fixtures, you know those fixtures on a concrete ceiling, so had to with a gun, to shoot in place.</span> <span id="s1424">And the jo— the boss didn't give him any protection and something went through his eye, he lost an eye.</span> <span id="s1425">So he lost a kidney, he lost an eye.</span> <span id="s1426">Now he had already two bypasses, twice.</span> <span id="s1427">Now he has asthma on top of that, very sick boy.</span> <span id="s1428">So I'm very concerned about him, but what, what can I do?</span> <span id="s1429">I mean -- that's why I want to be as close as possible, as long as God will let us live and be together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: Do you ever think of remarrying now?</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Me?</span> <span id="s1432">No, not really, no, no, I mean.</span> <span id="s1433">I met, I met somebody, it was close to be married and then some misunderstanding came about with signing some papers -- you know, about this and that -- I says, “forget it.”</span> <span id="s1434">No, this way I see whoever I want, when I want.</span> <span id="s1435">I like, like my freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1437">Is there anything that you felt like that we, we should have talked about, about, about your experiences just after the war, was there anything you—</span></p> <p><span id="s1438">A: That's, that’s about summarizes, you know.</span> <span id="s1439">I told you in short and you'll work it out somehow, you'll stretch it out, I think you know plenty, now.</span> <span id="s1440">I mean, this was a—</span></p> <p><span id="s1441">Q: There's one thing that kind of sticks in my mind about, about the, the, the early time which was the time you spent, those couple of months at the farm—</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1443">Q: Afterwards, what else was going on in -- and what else -- what did you see happening around you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1444">A: Nothing was happening, it was -- everything was too new, too fresh -- too new.</span> <span id="s1445">Everybody found out -- the few survivors there was, there were maybe 75 boy survivors -- you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">Q: From?</span></p> <p><span id="s1447">A: From, from, from the camps, you know?</span> <span id="s1448">Then, then the UNRRA camps started to open up around Munich and people used to, there was a Feldafing and a Freimann and all that and people were there and boys and girls getting married.</span> <span id="s1449">I mean like -- and they had entertainment but I never did -- I didn't want to be a part of it -- I didn't want to be in a camp any more, I wanted to be on my own.</span> <span id="s1450">So three of us got an apartment in Munich like the HIAS told us, “If you find a place where a Nazi used to live, you tell us.”</span> <span id="s1451">And—</span></p> <p><span id="s1452">Q: So you were anxious just to -- you didn't want to be—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">A: I didn't want to be a part of a camp, wou… to get rations.</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">Q: Like a displaced persons camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">A: That's a, DP camp, yeah, I didn't want to be.</span> <span id="s1456">I used to go visit them and I also used to drive around the Rabbi to give chuppah kiddushin -- you know, whoever got married, they need a Rabbi -- I drove him with the car.</span> <span id="s1457">So I was always a, a special person, I wanted to be unique.</span></p> <p><span id="s1458">Q: And it sounds like you, you were able to avoid being -- I mean a lot of people couldn’t -- had nowhere else to go, so—</span></p> <p><span id="s1459">A: That's right, but I was on, I was on my own.</span> <span id="s1460">As I said, we got an apartment -- we were three partners -- three b—</span></p> <p><span id="s1461">Q: I mean, how did you, you know -- you got out of the camps and you had no money—</span></p> <p><span id="s1462">A: Didn't need it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1463">Q: You had no clothes, you had nothing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1464">A: Yeah, first of all, as I said, being on the farm by that woman, we used to do business with the meat, right, because one of the boys was a butcher, so we used to take him -- motor from the camp, sell them to a farmer and get a cow or a calf and that.</span> <span id="s1465">We went to the DP camps, you know -- and the DP, DP camps, these people used to get packages and cook for themselves, but apparently they didn't get enough meat, or whatever, so we used to bring it in and sell it to them and that's how we got, we got money.</span> <span id="s1466">The German money we exchanged by dollars, you know -- watches, whatever, so we got a feeling of business.</span> <span id="s1467">So when we went to Munich, and that was everybody was doing -- trading, you know?</span> <span id="s1468">The American soldiers used to get the scrips -- that was the army money --and the ration money, people used to go to Poland and bring stuff.</span> <span id="s1469">So we used to handle for them -- back for them, back, back -- until they went to, to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1470">We had the maid, who cooked for us, I mean food was very easy, was very cheap for us, was available and was a easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1471">Q: And, and, and the—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1472">A: We had the maid, who cooked for us -- I mean food was very easy, was very cheap for us -- you know, was available and was a easy life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1473">Q: So the, the, the, the women -- the two sisters on the farm—</span></p> <p><span id="s1474">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1475">Q: …that's what enabled you to skip away from—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1476">A: …to sk… give us the start.</span> <span id="s1477">I mean, they didn't tell us to go, because they didn't know any better -- they were old, in their high 80s.</span> <span id="s1478">They thought that, you know, whoever comes -- like butter, I mean, was like getting God knows what -- there wasn't that much after the war.</span> <span id="s1479">But they used to make theirselves, and if somebody came from the outside, “you have butter to sell?”</span> <span id="s1480">they didn't know -- because he's a survivor, you know?</span> <span id="s1481">They give him the butter, and we say, “Why did you do that?</span> <span id="s1482">You didn't have to give it to.”</span> <span id="s1483">She says, “I didn't know, I thought I must give him.”</span> <span id="s1484">because he came with the American uniform on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1485">Q: How did you find these women?</span></p> <p><span id="s1486">A: Well, these two boys were there already and I came out of the hospital -- I saw them walking in the streets -- I say, “Oh, can I, where are you, can I be with you?”</span> <span id="s1487">They say, “Yeah, come on, join us.”</span> <span id="s1488">So they brought me in, introduced me and says, “Noch eine,” one more.</span> <span id="s1489">She had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1490">Q: And they were also from the camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s1491">A: Also from the camp, yeah, also from the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s1492">Q: And you knew them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">A: We knew the— I knew them in the camp, I recognized them.</span> <span id="s1494">One lives in Trenton, he's still there, he must be -- what, 85 years old -- Leon.</span> <span id="s1495">And the other one went back to Germany and there's me.</span> <span id="s1496">So we were there, we were not starving.</span> <span id="s1497">Didn't need much, didn't need much money.</span> <span id="s1498">We didn’t -- I mean -- we didn't have the brains.</span> <span id="s1499">We had the brains we would buy property -- didn't, didn’t, didn’t, you know, didn’t sink in.</span> <span id="s1500">Although some did -- remained -- they're the very, very wealthy men, because you could have get it for nothing.</span> <span id="s1501">So I bought a car for a few thousand marks.</span> <span id="s1502">I mean, money was, was very easy to get.</span> <span id="s1503">Didn't know because could have buy blocks and blocks of property, or movie houses -- or whatever -- or land.</span> <span id="s1504">But, we did not try.</span> <span id="s1505">Just today -- what's tomorrow happens -- today have nice, nice dinners, nice food, you know.</span> <span id="s1506">Didn't worry about the diet, you know, went to the farm, bought a two week old little piglet, you know, slaughter it.</span> <span id="s1507">Brought it into the bakery -- they didn't have it, the Germans -- so the bakery, after the bread was baked, over was hot, he put in a little piglet, brought it out, was like goosemeat, you know, was machaya.</span> <span id="s1508">The German woman, she cooked for us, so we lived a, a good life, a good life.</span> <span id="s1509">Then there was some entertainment -- you know, European people -- theaters and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s1510">Q: While you were enjoying that, were you also having nightmares even then or did that come to you later?</span></p> <p><span id="s1511">A: Not in the, not in the beginning, not in the beginning because the mind was occupied; “what you do tomorrow,” you know?</span> <span id="s1512">I would like -- every day, like I got in touch, I got in touch with the Bul…Bulgarian, what was she?</span> <span id="s1513">A diplomat and he could go to Switzerland you know, in and out, and he brought me from Switzerland these thin, gold watches to sell for him -- because he couldn't, you know, he was afraid.</span> <span id="s1514">He used to hide them under the mat in the car and that was my -- I was looking forward.</span> <span id="s1515">I was selling for him, and for that money he wanted to have things that were hard to get; Nescafe, American cigarettes, nylons for the woman that he was seeing, and all that.</span> <span id="s1516">So I was busy supplying.</span> <span id="s1517">Like every day was something else, and I had a car, that was, I mean that was like being a president, nobody could have a car, nobody could have a car because you needed a special -- like we have the inspection sticker now -- you needed a big thing to show that you are legal and you -- you're getting coupons of gas.</span> <span id="s1518">Now coupons, you were allowed about 20 liter a month, but again -- where a pack of cigarettes or some -- you know, I got, I got 100 gallons of gas.</span> <span id="s1519">So I was hustling and organizing, being busy in my own world, not thinking.</span> <span id="s1520">I knew that nobody's left; I have no brothers, I have no sisters, I have no family.</span> <span id="s1521">And I was young and I starting to getting attracted, you know -- my strength came back, you know -- I wanted to be with girls, and—</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">Q: So when did the, when did the -- you know, when did you start having dreams?</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">A: After I got married, after I got married -- after, after I got married, I mean in Israel, you know, when I was settled already -- I mean not hustling, not running, you know?</span> <span id="s1524">Went, went to Canada and start working -- doing one thing and you know, you sit on a sewing machine and you sew, so you just don't see this -- you think.</span> <span id="s1525">And what woke me up actually, in Montreal there was an, an, an, an, an, an advertising in that paper that there's a theater -- a piece playing about Dr. Korczak.</span> <span id="s1526">Of course, I went to see that, you know?</span> <span id="s1527">I went to see that and that play did not make any sense whatsoever, not what happened there, you know?</span> <span id="s1528">With the small child -- baby -- there was no babies, nothing.</span> <span id="s1529">So after that I went on the stage and I says, “You made a play -- I'm a survivor of Dr. Korczak.”</span> <span id="s1530">Of course, they were right away excited and before I know, I have a telephone call -- they want to have a radio interview with me.</span> <span id="s1531">So with the Canadian radio -- the outfit came too, you know -- so then I, I started to talk, you know -- because I have a whole -- I don't have it, my daughter has a whole transcript about my talking about Dr. Korczak experience.</span> <span id="s1532">And after that I get a phone call or a letter from New York -- Mr. Levine, I think, who was writing books -- he wanted to write something for Reader's Digest about….</span> <span id="s1533">So he paid my trip.</span> <span id="s1534">I came over and he had me oral interview also four hours.</span> <span id="s1535">And then as I talked -- the more I talked, the more these things came -- to come back and haunt me, because I had to open up and talk and talk and talk and talk.</span></p> <p><span id="s1536">Q: Do you wish that you didn't?</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">Q: …rather you wouldn't have—?</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s1540">I mean if I wouldn't have those I would take it with me, it would be buried in there, you know?</span> <span id="s1541">But our aim -- not only mine -- but our aim is for the world to know, to know -- and especially the young generation -- how, how….</span> <span id="s1542">“Be careful, it might happen, don't be so sure of yourself.</span> <span id="s1543">Even here, it might happen.”</span> <span id="s1544">It's to prevent, because such a horrible tragedy, you know?</span> <span id="s1545">And then you have -- it's the extension of us, our children -- then there's grandchildren.</span> <span id="s1546">You saw your parents go, now we start to feel how our parents feel -- like they're, they’re, they’re now parents that children were taken from them, they survived and the children didn't.</span> <span id="s1547">Now I think it's the worst punishment for a mother or a father to give up a child, you know what I mean?</span> <span id="s1548">I mean I wouldn't want to live to see my daughter -- something happen to her.</span> <span id="s1549">I'd rather go.</span> <span id="s1550">So it's okay, it's okay to talk.</span> <span id="s1551">It, it, it must be just to do our best we can and leave the rest to Ha-Shem.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: So, do you -- these dreams come to you every night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: Oh, mostly -- yeah.</span> <span id="s1554">It doesn't escape me for a moment because there isn't a day -- unless I sit home, I won't open the TV or anything -- then maybe I can think about something else.</span> <span id="s1555">But whatever you do, whoever you see, “Oh, how are you?”</span> <span id="s1556">So here you are -- I know him from here.</span> <span id="s1557">Why do I know him?</span> <span id="s1558">Because we were talking about -- or we were there and we met, you know?</span></p> <p><span id="s1559">Q: And it comes to you at night?</span></p> <p><span id="s1560">A: Of course, even we go to functions, like we were, we were -- I was invited -- a lady friend of mine was invited to the Elie Wiesel Bond Drive at the Hilton.</span> <span id="s1561">Beautiful event -- you know, beautiful food and all that -- but you sit down at table, “Oh, this one is from Munich, this one is from here.”</span> <span id="s1562">“Oh you're from Munich, but where are you originally from?”</span> <span id="s1563">Bingo, and the conversation goes on.</span> <span id="s1564">Then you come home and you take the whole thing with you.</span> <span id="s1565">So doesn't escape -- I, I mean, as I said, I cannot sit in a closet.</span> <span id="s1566">“That's what it is,” I tell to my psychiatrist, “That's what it is, I cannot change it, I cannot erase it, you know?”</span> <span id="s1567">It makes me shiver, I wake up with cold sweat -- goose pimples, but then I say, “Hey look, that's what it is, you know?”</span> <span id="s1568">I have to accept it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1569">Q: What, what do they, what -- she says that you should be leaving that behind, though?</span></p> <p><span id="s1570">A: She says, “Try to, try to be involved in other activities.”</span> <span id="s1571">I says, “Doctor, what activities?</span> <span id="s1572">I cannot open up my mind.</span> <span id="s1573">If I could adopt your accent -- okay, then I could talk about baseball, about football, about American way.”</span> <span id="s1574">The minute I open up my mouth, I'm being asked ‘where are you from?’</span> <span id="s1575">because every American has a parent or a grandparent from where I come from -- either from Russia -- either from there -- and here the conversation.</span> <span id="s1576">I cannot be -- say, “I don't want to talk about.”</span> <span id="s1577">You cannot do to these people -- you cannot put the people down, because right away you're a snob, right?</span> <span id="s1578">So you cannot help it, so you're being punished by, by, by the people you're surrounded with and nobody means any harm to you.</span> <span id="s1579">And that's what it is and sometimes people want to talk about it, and it's good to talk about it -- it kind of, kind of relief, and after I'm finished talking, you know, then I say, “Hey, despite of all that, I made it!”</span> <span id="s1580">What else can I say?</span></p> <p><span id="s1581">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1582">I think that's what I need to talk to you about.</span></p> <p><span id="s1583">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1584">Are you going to write it out?</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: Yeah, it will be.</span> <span id="s1586">I won't, but they will.</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1588">Q: They'll, they’ll transcribe it all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">A: Yeah, so how is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">Q: Oh, great, I mean, it's fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s1591">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1592">There aren't any happy, happy events that I could talk about.</span> <span id="s1593">It's all mostly pain or -- so, you know.</span> <span id="s1594">The most happy event is when -- my daughter's wedding -- when I ordered the first dance with her, and I told them to play “Daddy's Little Girl.”</span> <span id="s1595">It was nice.</span> <span id="s1596">Made her a beautiful wedding and I'm happy about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1597">Conclusion of interview.</span></p></body></html>
