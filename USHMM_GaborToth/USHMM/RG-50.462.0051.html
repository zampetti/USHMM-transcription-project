Mrs. Adachi, to be able to speak with you about your experiences during the war.</span> <span id="s3">But before we do that, I wonder if you would be good enough to tell us a little about your life at home in Budapest, let's say from 1940 until the time of the troubles, let's say not necessarily the invasion by the Germans in March of 1944, but even of an earlier time when you felt the sting of persecution by the Hungarian government.</span> <span id="s4">Would you be able to sketch those years for us?</span></p> <p><span id="s5">AA: Yes.</span> <span id="s6">Yes, I could.</span> <span id="s7">Well, actually you have to know that Hungary was always antisemitic.</span> <span id="s8">It was nothing new.</span> <span id="s9">Not that you were barred from anywhere, but we knew that we were not liked as the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s10">However, in my life, I did not feel it very badly because my father was a business man and he was a person who believed that there are no differences between people and religions, and that's how he brought me up.</span> <span id="s11">He felt that Christmas was not a religious day, but it was a giving, love and happiness, and he invited all his employees to our house.</span> <span id="s12">So I grew up with a Christmas tree.</span> <span id="s13">He was not a religious man, neither was my mother, but Mommy had to have her candles every Friday night, and I was always blessed by Mother on Friday nights with my father together.</span> <span id="s14">Otherwise I was not brought up as a child of Jewish religion.</span> <span id="s15">So much so that when it came to junior high school my father took me to the best school in Hungary, what was a Reformed Church school, a Protestant school, and told the principal there, who was a lady that time, that he would like me to go to this school.</span> <span id="s16">And the principal looked at him and he said, "Mr. Mandel, why do want your little daughter to come to our school?</span> <span id="s17">We do not have Jewish children.</span> <span id="s18">We have Catholics, but no Jewish."</span> <span id="s19">And my father said, "Because your school is the best.</span> <span id="s20">And I don't like bigots.</span> <span id="s21">I want my daughter to know everything."</span> <span id="s22">And then she smiled at me and she says, "Would you like to come here, little Aggie?"</span> <span id="s23">And I said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s24">And I was in.</span> <span id="s25">And my Jewish religion I learned from the Reformed Church religious teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">NL: Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s27">AA: Who was my best friend.</span> <span id="s28">The Catholic children were not allowed, but I was allowed every morning to sit in the ten-minute hymn singing–'cause I love to sing–and to hear a little prayer, and then, as I lived in school until 7:00 in the evening for the half-pension, she was the one three or four times a week who would take my hand and say, "Come, Aggie.</span> <span id="s29">Let's learn Hebrew.</span> <span id="s30">You have to learn it."</span></p> <p><span id="s31">NL: Do you remember her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">AA: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">NL: Let's put it in the record.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">AA: Olga.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">NL: Pardon me?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">AA: Olga, that was O-L-G-A.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">NL: Olga.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">AA: Tante Olga was her name.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">NL: Tante Olga.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">AA: And she was about six-foot-ten, and 300 pounds, with the most beautiful black hair, and she gave all the love, and she told me, "You have to know that the Jewish religion was the first one in the world."</span></p> <p><span id="s41">NL: Where did she learn Hebrew, I wonder?</span></p> <p><span id="s42">AA: Well, they all, Reformed Church religious teachers are all learning Hebrew.</span></p> <p><span id="s43">NL: Interesting.</span></p> <p><span id="s44">AA: And from her I learned.</span> <span id="s45">The next year we already got some Jewish children, and then we got a Jewish teacher.</span></p> <p><span id="s46">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s47">AA: But I was the one who broke the ice.</span> <span id="s48">But the school has given me everything, and I never felt, except once, and that was in the last, no the last before year, when we graduated.</span> <span id="s49">One girl, who was a officer's daughter, she said something, "You bloody Jew."</span> <span id="s50">And I really didn't know what she was saying, but I didn't like it.</span> <span id="s51">And the next day I was out in the corridor and I saw her with one eye coming and I thought she's coming to hit me and I turned around and hit her right in the nose, and our dear lady principal walked into the room.</span> <span id="s52">We were 45 kids there, cause they say here they can't manage 15 children.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">AA: Private school and we were 45, and there was quiet in there, you could drop a needle.</span> <span id="s55">And she walked in, and she said, "I understand there have been a religious slur in my school."</span></p> <p><span id="s56">NL: Wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">AA: "And I will not, and there was a fight.</span> <span id="s58">I will not name names, but I want everybody to get up, whoever hurt another person, either by words or by hitting," and of course we all got up, except one little girl.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">AA: And she looked at her and she says, "You never hurt anyone?"</span> <span id="s61">And this kid spoke up, she says, "No!"</span> <span id="s62">So we all looked at her, and then she said, "I will not do anything now, but if it ever happens again, the children who did this will be removed from the school."</span> <span id="s63">Not only it never happened, but this girl of the officer became my very best friend and the rest of the year, because she didn't know what she was saying, and I didn't really wanted to hit her.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">NL: She was repeating what she had heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s65">AA: She was repeating, what happens in this country too.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">AA: You repeat what you hear from your parents.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">NL: But, Mrs. Adachi, how do you account for the fact that this school seemed so insulated from the social and political antisemitism in the country?</span> <span id="s69">Was it organized in a more liberal tradition?</span></p> <p><span id="s70">AA: I believe it was.</span> <span id="s71">As the Protestant Church always have been–the Reformed Church–now, I don't know...</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NL: The Reformed Church.</span></p> <p><span id="s73">AA: Because I never went, I–didn't become more interested in that either, but later on our new principal was a Reformed pastor, Beretski [phonetic], who became later on the Bishop of Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">AA: And when Hitler walked in, he arrived to our house–he was a very tall gentleman and he had a crew cut and beautiful blue eyes, and he looked at my father who was the same age–and he said, "Uncle, we have to baptize this child, because the radio just said that anyone who doesn't have a Jewish religion will be saved.</span> <span id="s76">Would you like to save my child?</span> <span id="s77">Because she is my seventh daughter."</span> <span id="s78">I was always together with his daughters, and he was...</span></p> <p><span id="s79">NL: And what year was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">AA: And what could my father say?</span> <span id="s81">This was in '40–the end of, no, the middle of '43, just before the Germans came in.</span> <span id="s82">The Hungarian Nazis already started Eichmann's work.</span> <span id="s83">Up till now it was quiet.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">NL: Is that so?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">AA: And what could my father say, no?</span> <span id="s86">He said, "Yes."</span> <span id="s87">So we went, the three of us, to the Reformed Church, and my father was crying, all the way in the back, and he kept on saying, "Uncle, be quiet.</span> <span id="s88">I have Jews down in the basement.</span> <span id="s89">And if they find out, we'll all be killed."</span> <span id="s90">And he baptized me, and I think his tears were more on my head than his water.</span> <span id="s91">Maybe he saved me; I don't know.</span> <span id="s92">It was a nonsense what he did, and he looked at me, and he said, "Child, you have learned as much of our religion than you did in the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s93">Whenever you want to go back, you go back, but I want to have the feeling that I saved you."</span> <span id="s94">That kind of people they were.</span></p> <p><span id="s95">NL: Was there some special relationship then that he had with your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s96">AA: No, but he had a relationship with me.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">NL: With you.</span></p> <p><span id="s98">AA: Because I was part of his family.</span> <span id="s99">I spent my time in his house with his children.</span> <span id="s100">There were six daughters, and I was, as he said, the seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">NL: Seventh.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">AA: And in the school, then he took over that little hymn in the morning, and I was there, and the Protestant and the Jewish teachers kept on teaching me what they wanted me to know, but I never felt in that school that I didn't belong there.</span></p> <p><span id="s103">NL: It's extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s104">AA: And around us, people hated everybody.</span> <span id="s105">And then it started.</span> <span id="s106">We didn't believe either, you see, we had already Polish, German, Austrian, Czechoslovakian, Romanians, coming into the country, those who could run away, and told us the stories, and we didn't believe.</span> <span id="s107">We were just as bad as were the Allied forces.</span> <span id="s108">We didn't believe, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s109">NL: You heard nothing about what was happening in the other parts of Europe?</span></p> <p><span id="s110">AA: Yes, they told us, but we didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">NL: You didn't believe.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">AA: And we said, "No, in Hungary it cannot happen."</span> <span id="s113">And then it did.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">NL: Let's step back a bit.</span> <span id="s115">How long did you stay in this particular Dutch Reformed school then?</span></p> <p><span id="s116">AA: It was not Dutch.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">NL: Excuse me, Protestant Reformed.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">AA: For the whole junior high and senior high.</span></p> <p><span id="s119">NL: Until what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s120">AA: That was, let's see, when did I finish?</span> <span id="s121">Ah...</span></p> <p><span id="s122">NL: Approximately.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">AA: Approximately.</span> <span id="s124">I can't remember.</span> <span id="s125">Let's see, '38 I think I finished, that's when I went to Switzerland.</span></p> <p><span id="s126">NL: Ah, '38, I see.</span> <span id="s127">Then you went to Switzerland and returned and then...</span></p> <p><span id="s128">AA: And returned, and he came, 'cause I was still his child.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">NL: His child.</span> <span id="s130">And, may we ask now what experiences you had in Budapest, let's say, '40, '41, '42?</span></p> <p><span id="s131">AA: Well, '40, '41, '42 we still didn't have anything.</span> <span id="s132">On the end of '42 it started.</span></p> <p><span id="s133">NL: Were you working in Budapest?</span></p> <p><span id="s134">AA: I was working.</span> <span id="s135">I was working, first I was working in a big hotel where I wanted to learn everything about running a hotel, the same place that was the Hotel Ritz.</span> <span id="s136">It doesn't exist anymore.</span> <span id="s137">That's where Mr. Hilton learned himself.</span> <span id="s138">This was the famous hotel where the king, the English king, met Mrs. Simpson.</span> <span id="s139">And that's in my book.</span> <span id="s140">And that I was learning and in there, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s141">NL: You didn't feel any antisemitism there?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">AA: I didn't feel any antisemitism, maybe because the man who ran the place was a Yugoslavian gentleman who was a very magnificent personality.</span> <span id="s143">He spoke 16 languages, but not like me, he spoke them, without an accent, whichever, and he was a great gentleman.</span> <span id="s144">And he ran his place like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">NL: He knew you were the child of a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s146">AA: Oh yes, he did know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">NL: It didn't matter to him.</span> <span id="s148">And the other employees didn't trouble you?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">AA: Nobody.</span> <span id="s150">Actually it was a Christian who brought me in, and her boyfriend was the only one who tried to do the bad things to me, but he couldn't, because he would have lost his job, at the moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">NL: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s152">AA: And so, anyways, how in '42 the first time I figured out that now we are in trouble and I went, there's a very famous restaurant in Hungary, it was Gundo [phonetic].</span> <span id="s153">I don't know how many people were in Budapest, but that was out, way out of the city, and I went with a very dear friend of mine who was a great farmer, a gentleman farmer they called them, and he was a Jew, and we went into this restaurant, and the waiter came over and says, "I don't serve Jews."</span></p> <p><span id="s154">NL: That was the first experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">AA: And it was the first experience, and I felt that they might shoot at us, and we just got up and walked out.</span> <span id="s156">And that was the end of going out.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">NL: This was '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s158">AA: That was the end of '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">NL: The end of '42.</span></p> <p><span id="s160">AA: Then, when in '43, I remember that morning that one very excited neighbor of ours running, and he says, "Arnold, open your radio, the BBC" (but we were not allowed to listen) "the BBC just announced that Hungary is going with the Allied forces!"</span></p> <p><span id="s161">NL: The Allied forces?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">AA: The Allied forces.</span> <span id="s163">And, "Horthy's coming!"</span> <span id="s164">Horthy was our admiral...</span></p> <p><span id="s165">NL: Regent.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">AA: Without a seat.</span> <span id="s167">He was the Regent of Hungary.</span> <span id="s168">"And he will come on the radio and say so!"</span> <span id="s169">And my father ran and brought out the champagne, and I said, "Papa, don't drink.</span> <span id="s170">I don't believe in it."</span> <span id="s171">And my father says, "You are too young!"</span> <span id="s172">That's how it was that time.</span> <span id="s173">We were too young, we couldn't say anything.</span> <span id="s174">And he sure enough put in all the champagne, and Horthy came on the radio, and all he said, "My fellow members, I am announcing now that we are going with the Allies."</span> <span id="s175">And then you heard the German Horst Wessel [song] playing, the radio goes dead, I dropped my glass, and I ran out.</span> <span id="s176">It was the most gorgeous day, like today, even nicer, it was blue sky, and I get out in the street–I had to go to the hotel–and it was blackened by airplanes.</span> <span id="s177">And I was so naive, I said, "Ah!</span> <span id="s178">The Americans are here!</span> <span id="s179">Finally, the Americans and the British!"</span> <span id="s180">And I ran all the way to the hotel, and as I walk in, the porter says, "Go to Mr. Marenchic’s desk."</span> <span id="s181">The manager that was there, the gentleman, and I walked in, and he turned to me and he said to me in French, "Child, go home.</span> <span id="s182">It was a putsch.</span> <span id="s183">Horthy's already taken.</span> <span id="s184">These are the Germans, not the Americans."</span> <span id="s185">And he kissed me, he says, "Go home.</span> <span id="s186">I don't want you to be taken from here."</span> <span id="s187">I got home and we were not taken from home either.</span> <span id="s188">For a couple of weeks we didn't even have the stars on.</span> <span id="s189">Then, of course, it came.</span> <span id="s190">We had to be like a pig, you know, have the star on.</span> <span id="s191">And they didn't take us from the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">NL: Excuse me, but my impression was that the Germans didn't come in until '44, March.</span></p> <p><span id="s193">AA: They came in '43, March.</span></p> <p><span id="s194">NL: '43 March.</span></p> <p><span id="s195">AA: Yah, I think so, we have to look in my book.</span> <span id="s196">[March 19, 1944.]</span></p> <p><span id="s197">NL: Well, we can check that.</span> <span id="s198">But, were these, airplanes in the...</span></p> <p><span id="s199">AA: They were Germans.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">NL: Germans.</span> <span id="s201">Now, was father's business affected at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">AA: Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s203">That was already before that.</span> <span id="s204">He gave that up.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">NL: Ah.</span> <span id="s206">Could you step back a little and tell us what happened to his business?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">AA: Well, it begin to slow down, because people did not want to buy textiles from a Jew.</span> <span id="s208">And that was very clear, but he was expecting that.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">NL: Was some of his property confiscated?</span></p> <p><span id="s210">AA: No, we didn't have any property.</span></p> <p><span id="s211">NL: Didn't have, were any of his...</span></p> <p><span id="s212">AA: The store was already, he was a partner with a Christian, and he of course took over without asking.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">NL: He took over.</span> <span id="s214">Was Father still able to function in the store, or was it in effect...</span></p> <p><span id="s215">AA: Yes, he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">NL: He was.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">AA: He was a very well-loved person.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">NL: He was well-respected.</span></p> <p><span id="s219">AA: And his employees loved him.</span> <span id="s220">But he was, he was sort of expecting this, you know.</span> <span id="s221">And all he said to me that time, he says, "You were right, child."</span> <span id="s222">Cause I said, "Don't drink the champagne."</span> <span id="s223">And then of course it became terrible, because my father was taken away by the Hungarian Nazi party, and he worked as a..</span> <span id="s224">.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">NL: This is the Arrow Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">AA: The Arrow Cross.</span> <span id="s227">The Arrow Cross was far, ten times worse, than the Eichmann group.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">NL: That's what I have read.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">AA: Because Eichmann felt they know better how to do it, he don't have to do a thing.</span> <span id="s230">And they were, because they were young, they couldn't read or write, because in Hungary there were a lot of un-alphabets.</span> <span id="s231">You see, in Germany there weren't any, but in Hungary there were.</span> <span id="s232">But they told these children how to use the guns, and which child of 12 isn't happy to get the gun and say, "Hey, when you see someone in the yellow star, shoot."</span> <span id="s233">They did it.</span> <span id="s234">Happily and gladly.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">NL: But prior to the attacks on the Jews in Budapest as I understand it, there was a division of Hungary into six zones, and each of the zones was to be, the Jews in those zones, were to be deported.</span> <span id="s236">Were you aware of any of those activities...</span></p> <p><span id="s237">AA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s238">NL: Outside of Budapest?</span> <span id="s239">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s240">AA: Outside of Budapest, we heard that...</span></p> <p><span id="s241">NL: You heard.</span> <span id="s242">Can you tell us what you heard?</span></p> <p><span id="s243">AA: I tell you how we heard it, not through BBC or radios, but we had two French men who were friends of my friends who, after the war we found out, they were in the French underground, and they were parachuted down in Hungary.</span> <span id="s244">Now, later on we found out they really came from Romania to kill Germans and to kill Nazis.</span> <span id="s245">And they brought us the news that Eichmann's troops are taking the people from the countryside.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">AA: But in Budapest we were not collected.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">NL: Now, did you,</span></p> <p><span id="s249">AA: But was amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">NL: Of course there was a plan, because Budapest was still within one of the zones.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">AA: Oh, it was a big plan.</span></p> <p><span id="s252">NL: Did you have any information from the Jewish Council, from for instance, Freudinger, Philip, you know that name?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">AA: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">NL: Philip Freudinger, who was...</span></p> <p><span id="s255">AA: Yes, I know the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s257">AA: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">NL: No one.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">AA: No one.</span> <span id="s260">What happened after we were still in our apartment what was Christian house, I don't know if you know that what the Hungarian Nazis decided, after a while when the Germans were in, that every second house in Budapest have to be one with a star, and people have to get out of their Christian apartment and move in, because the Americans will not bomb because they don't want to bomb the Jews.</span> <span id="s261">Well, of course the Americans knew better, they bombed anyhow, and it happened to go on Jewish houses, but mostly they blew up the headquarters of the Nazi parties on both sides.</span> <span id="s262">But, we were still in our apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">NL: Through '43?</span></p> <p><span id="s264">AA: Through '43, and almost into '44.</span> <span id="s265">Now in '44, as you know, Raoul Wallenberg arrived, but before that, in May of, let's see now, when I get my dates right, '43, '44, July he came, so you may be right but I will have to look at the book.</span> <span id="s266">In, around end of March or end of April I got a letter, small letter.</span> <span id="s267">In our Christian house where we still lived we had the yellow star on but we didn't go out much.</span> <span id="s268">We, I got a letter from the Swedish government to please visit them, the Swedish Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s269">NL: Had you had any contact with the Embassy?</span></p> <p><span id="s270">AA: I had a correspondence with a Swedish man for the past ten years, because as a girl scout with knowledge of languages we used to be guides for tourists, and one year I was guiding Swedish tourists and this young man kept on writing letters to me, and I answered, and I had huge correspondence.</span> <span id="s271">But I had no idea what the letter is, they just said, "Please come and visit us."</span> <span id="s272">And of course, that was already dangerous, to go in to a foreign embassy, especially with a star.</span> <span id="s273">And my cousin had a very wonderful Christian boyfriend who said, "There is no problem.</span> <span id="s274">I have a Mercedes Benz.</span> <span id="s275">I'll put on a German flag, and I will put on a Nazi uniform and I'll take you."</span> <span id="s276">I said, "Wonderful!"</span> <span id="s277">And he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">NL: And he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">AA: And, I went up to the Embassy, and he was waiting for, no, he was waiting for awhile.</span> <span id="s280">And, the Ambassador then told me what was amazing to me.</span> <span id="s281">The first time I heard about the Danish king who put on the yellow band and he says, "I don't have Jews in my country; I only have Danes."</span> <span id="s282">And also the first time I heard that the Swedish king, Gustav V, who is dead of course, that he placarded all over Sweden to say that, "Anyone who has any connections with Hungary and wants to save the people, whether they're Christians or Jews, please come to the Foreign Department."</span> <span id="s283">"And, therefore, your fiancé," the Ambassador says to me, "has come to us, come to the Foreign Department, and said that if the war wouldn't be there then she already would be my wife, and therefore she would be Swedish, so please help her."</span> <span id="s284">And, I looked at the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s285">"My fiancé?"</span> <span id="s286">He said, "Yes, Toto Harburg [phonetic]."</span> <span id="s287">And I just looked, you know, I have a fiancé I didn't know, inside me, you know.</span> <span id="s288">And he said, "And therefore, we would like to ask you to be our guest and stay at the Embassy.</span> <span id="s289">We will notify your parents."</span> <span id="s290">And I was actually frozen, and I said, My God, here comes the Reformed Church's priest and tells me that he will make me a Christian so that he can save me, and now, a young man whom I correspond for ten years says that I am his wife, or I will be his wife, and he saved my life, I can't believe it!</span> <span id="s291">And I said, "Yes, but I have to go back to my parents."</span> <span id="s292">And he said, "No, now the Swedish government is responsible for you, and we will send somebody to your parents."</span> <span id="s293">What they did, they sent down and asked them to send some soap and clothing and whatnot, and then I found out I wasn't the only guest at the Swedish Embassy.</span></p> <p><span id="s294">NL: There were others.</span></p> <p><span id="s295">AA: Oh, there were others.</span> <span id="s296">There was a very famous Nobel Prize winner, Szent-Györgyi, who found a vitamin, who was not a Jew, but he was a great arch anti-Nazi.</span> <span id="s297">And they had to put him away, otherwise he would have been taken.</span> <span id="s298">Later on he had to be disfigured and all that and he was taken somewhere else because he wasn't safe at the Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s299">Anyhow, I had a wonderful and soul-searching because I felt terrible that I am alive and my parents are down there.</span> <span id="s300">And I wanted to call them.</span></p> <p><span id="s301">NL: They were still in your apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s302">AA: Oh yes, they were in the apartment until a point.</span> <span id="s303">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s304">NL: Could you communicate with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s305">AA: No, I did not, but this secretary went down once a week to tell them that I was fine, because their telephone I think was taken, but they were still in the apartment.</span> <span id="s306">And when you are young, maybe one should have said, "No, no, no, I have to go back," but I wanted so badly to live.</span></p> <p><span id="s307">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">AA: And it was terrible.</span> <span id="s309">But after three weeks, the Mercedes, with the uniformed friend of mine, arrived, and he said, "Get home.</span> <span id="s310">They took your, your parents had to leave the house because that's now a Christian house, and they moved into your grandmother's place what became a Jewish house, and you have to come back."</span> <span id="s311">So they had a little fight with the Ambassador.</span> <span id="s312">The Ambassador said, "No, because we are responsible."</span> <span id="s313">But he said, "Yes, she has to come back because [inaudible] her parents, because they still have a lease, and Aggie's name is still on the lease."</span></p> <p><span id="s314">NL: So the baptism didn't save you?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">AA: No, of course not.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">NL: Yah, that was...</span></p> <p><span id="s317">AA: Nothing would saved you, but people tried to save people.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">NL: Yeah, I understand.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">AA: Anne Frank, didn't they try their best?</span> <span id="s320">It doesn't work!</span> <span id="s321">But still, it was a miracle, OK?</span> <span id="s322">So, in any case, the Ambassador said, "All right, she can go down, not with you.</span> <span id="s323">I want her to go on in a street car, and we have one of our secretaries sit there, because we want to know exactly where she goes."</span> <span id="s324">So he said, "Fine."</span> <span id="s325">And he went with his little Mercedes, and I went down, and when we got to the house, my grandmother's house, I saw the secretary looking, and then he winked at me and then he disappeared, with the promise that, I mean, the Ambassador said the Jews were allowed out two hours a day onto the street and telephones were still working.</span> <span id="s326">So that we were bound to give them a call if possible, daily.</span> <span id="s327">And I was hardly down there for three weeks when a very excited Ambassador says, "Please come back.</span> <span id="s328">Ask your friend to bring you back.</span> <span id="s329">There is a big surprise for you here."</span> <span id="s330">So I went down on my knees, "Micki, Micki, please take me just once more."</span> <span id="s331">He says, "But you're not going to stay."</span> <span id="s332">I said, "I'm not going to stay, just take me there."</span></p> <p><span id="s333">NL: Excuse me, could I interrupt?</span> <span id="s334">What–how did you spend your time in those three weeks, Mrs. Adachi, do you remember how it was living with your beleaguered parents and grandmother?</span></p> <p><span id="s335">AA: Well, it was, first of all, when I arrived there, I mean, the whole family was there, thanks God.</span> <span id="s336">My grandmother wasn't alive anymore, so, but it was her house.</span></p> <p><span id="s337">NL: Was she deported, or did she die of natural...</span></p> <p><span id="s338">AA: No, no, no, no, she died of natural causes a couple of years before, but it was her house, because my aunt lived there with her daughter.</span> <span id="s339">And they had some Sal–San Salvadorian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">AA: They were still there.</span> <span id="s342">Then, her, her best friend moved in there with her Christian boyfriend, and they lived there, and then my parents came, and now I came.</span> <span id="s343">And I felt pretty miserable when I arrived.</span> <span id="s344">I felt that they hate me all because of my heaven of three weeks I had, and they had all their rights to do that.</span> <span id="s345">But what we did, believe it or not, we were listening to Gigli recordings, because he sang those beautiful songs of “Mama”.</span> <span id="s346">And, we listened to the BBC, and we were reading...</span></p> <p><span id="s347">NL: Did you have enough to eat?</span></p> <p><span id="s348">AA: Yes, because our two Christian boyfriends have supplied us with quite a lot.</span> <span id="s349">They went to burned-out places where they brought us coffee in sacks, what you won't believe it.</span> <span id="s350">And, whatever they could find, they brought.</span> <span id="s351">Beans, I had never eaten so many beans in my life, and I can't look at them today, but that's what they brought.</span> <span id="s352">But in any case, I asked him, and he said, "Would you please just take me once more?"</span> <span id="s353">So, we went up and there was Raoul Wallenberg.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">NL: You were introduced to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s355">AA: And, I was the first, because I already had a Swedish passport.</span> <span id="s356">Now you see, there is two things...</span></p> <p><span id="s357">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">AA: As you know, there was a passport what they gave to 800 people, and there were also Swedish people who were without a passport and they got it and it was not hard covered.</span> <span id="s359">And I got that one Swedish passport, because I was "married" to a Swede.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">NL: You were married to a Swede.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">AA: I thought, or at least I was engaged to the man.</span> <span id="s362">Then, I had that passport, and Raoul Wallenberg turned to me and he said, "Would you work with me and the Swedish Red Cross?"</span> <span id="s363">And I said, "Yes, sir.</span> <span id="s364">I will, but I still have the star."</span> <span id="s365">So they all started to laugh.</span> <span id="s366">I said, "Why are you laughing?"</span> <span id="s367">He said, "Cause that star won't stay on."</span> <span id="s368">"Oh," I said, "O.K." So, to be short, the star had been removed.</span></p> <p><span id="s369">NL: What was your impression of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s370">AA: It was very strange, because he is not a "typical" Swede.</span> <span id="s371">He's not a tall blond, he was already a little bit receding hair, the most wonderful eyes, you know.</span> <span id="s372">In those eyes was a whole heart and soul in it.</span> <span id="s373">And the handshake, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s374">NL: Strong.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">AA: You felt that you had someone there who's unusual.</span> <span id="s376">And I really didn't know what he came to do.</span> <span id="s377">No idea why he was sent or who he was.</span> <span id="s378">The name didn't mean a thing to me at that time.</span> <span id="s379">So the next day already I went down with [unclear] paper to the, and you will read this in the book, I went down to the police station, and the police chief must have been bribed, pretty greatly, because he was one of the greatest Nazis, and he cried and took me in his arms, how proud he was to cut off the star himself.</span></p> <p><span id="s380">NL: You were asked to go to the police station to have that done?</span></p> <p><span id="s381">AA: Oh yes, by myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s382">NL: Why was that necessary?</span></p> <p><span id="s383">AA: Well, because I can't run around with the star.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">NL: Couldn't Wallenberg have cut it off?</span></p> <p><span id="s385">AA: No, they wanted them very precisely.</span> <span id="s386">And they...</span></p> <p><span id="s387">NL: Do you think it was a deal of some kind?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">AA: Oh, I am sure it was.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">NL: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">AA: And, of course the police chief turned to me, and I don't even know his name to the end, he said, "And you will tell the forces who liberate us what a great man I am."</span> <span id="s391">And I looked at him, I said, "Sure, I will."</span> <span id="s392">And I think I, I did like this, you know; I'm sure Raoul did the same thing.</span> <span id="s393">Anyways, when I walked out, I heard somebody say, "And there goes another bloody Jew."</span> <span id="s394">But I made it home!</span></p> <p><span id="s395">NL: You made it home.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">AA: Without the star.</span> <span id="s397">Now, Raoul said next day, "Here is another paper.</span> <span id="s398">Now you go to the House Commission and get your apartment back."</span> <span id="s399">Now, you read that already, I guess.</span> <span id="s400">Ah, House Commission, you see, what happened in Hungary as soon as the Hungarian Nazis took over, they just ransacked the Jewish apartments, and now suddenly they made a House Commission and gave up.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Tape one, side two:</span></p> <p><span id="s402">NL: Mrs. Adachi, side two of tape one.</span> <span id="s403">And so, you had to approach a house authority.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">AA: So, I had to go to the house authority with this little paper which said that I am employed by the Swedish Embassy and the Swedish Red Cross, and I want this apartment back.</span> <span id="s405">And I never even thought of it that the apartment was actually written on my father's name, not on mine.</span> <span id="s406">And I walk up to this horrible looking, uniformed individual.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">NL: This was an Arrow Cross man.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">AA: An Arrow Cross man, of course, and inside, I think, my stomach went whut whut whut, but with a big chutzpah, and like Raoul Wallenberg, you know, I put my nose up, I was very elegantly dressed, and I shoved that paper to him and says, "I want my apartment back."</span> <span id="s409">And I thought that the way he looked at me that he either will shoot me or somebody will.</span> <span id="s410">And he looked at me, and without a word, he signed and gave it back.</span> <span id="s411">I made one turn and I heard again somebody exclaim, "There is another bloody Jew go."</span> <span id="s412">But nobody shooted.</span> <span id="s413">I walked out on the street with a smile, I says, "Hey, now I am going for my apartment."</span></p> <p><span id="s414">NL: So he was bribed too, apparently.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">AA: Oh, they all were.</span></p> <p><span id="s416">NL: They all were.</span></p> <p><span id="s417">AA: And that's why Raoul needed so much money.</span> <span id="s418">Because they don't, you see, he bribed them with alcohol, 'cause the Hungarians are great drinkers, and with cigars, and cigarettes and food.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">NL: He had done that prior to your having met him, I suppose?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">AA: Well, I guess so, I had no idea what they'd done beforehand or whatnot.</span> <span id="s421">But I was his first non-paid employee, because nobody was paid, because constantly you hear and see that he said oh he had paid employees.</span> <span id="s422">He didn't have any paid employees.</span> <span id="s423">No one was paid, not a Christian, not the Jews, we were all volunteers.</span> <span id="s424">No body was paid.</span></p> <p><span id="s425">NL: It's important to know that.</span></p> <p><span id="s426">AA: And I wish that people would listen to it.</span> <span id="s427">Also that he never gave out fake passports.</span> <span id="s428">He never gave out passports.</span> <span id="s429">He never gave out visas.</span> <span id="s430">I still hear people go around saying, "Oh, Raoul Wallenberg, he let people go."</span> <span id="s431">He didn't let them go, because he couldn't.</span> <span id="s432">We were already surrounded.</span> <span id="s433">So those are all lies.</span> <span id="s434">So, anyways, now I had, I go back to my house, and the super, who was really a leech, lived on my father for years, he hated the guts of me that I walked in, and I said, "I'd like to have Papa's apartment back."</span> <span id="s435">And he says, "Oh, no, my daughter already has it."</span> <span id="s436">Well, but his wife said–and I'm surprised that the wife was still alive after–she said, "Oh but our daughter has another apartment already, so give it to Agnes."</span> <span id="s437">So, he, he, he spoke perfect Russian, so he almost killed me two times after that.</span> <span id="s438">But anyways, to be short, he said I should go to the lawyer of the house and it's up to him.</span> <span id="s439">So I went all the way to the lawyer with the same little chutzpah and I said, "I want my apartment back."</span> <span id="s440">And he said, "Well, I'll give it back to you if you promise that when the Allied forces coming you will tell them what a wonderful man I am."</span> <span id="s441">And I said, "Sure I will, jah, just give it to me."</span> <span id="s442">And I walked out, and I walked back and the super was very surprised.</span> <span id="s443">And I will go upstairs, and, only one room was closed.</span> <span id="s444">And I figured what will I find?</span> <span id="s445">Probably everything was stolen.</span> <span id="s446">And on my great surprise when we opened the door that was the maid's room, in the old times, old homes, that's what they had, everything was there–all our furniture from the whole apartment.</span> <span id="s447">All our paintings.</span> <span id="s448">And for a moment, I thought, gee, he isn't as bad as I thought.</span> <span id="s449">Until he said, "I'll get even with you yet."</span> <span id="s450">But anyhow he handed me the keys and I had the apartment.</span> <span id="s451">Then in the meantime Raoul started to give out these Schutzpasses, what are just protec...</span></p> <p><span id="s452">NL: Protective.</span></p> <p><span id="s453">AA: Protective passes.</span> <span id="s454">And of course my parents got two of them.</span> <span id="s455">And I went back to the Jewish house, and I said, "Out!"</span> <span id="s456">And my father said, "But we don't have the papers."</span> <span id="s457">I said, "Out!</span> <span id="s458">You come back to the apartment."</span> <span id="s459">I took them back, took the stars off.</span></p> <p><span id="s460">NL: You took the stars off.</span></p> <p><span id="s461">AA: And nothing happened.</span> <span id="s462">Why?</span> <span id="s463">I can't explain.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">NL: Well, you were protected.</span> <span id="s465">Sweden was a neutral country.</span></p> <p><span id="s466">AA: Protected, my parents weren't.</span> <span id="s467">O.K.?</span> <span id="s468">They would have been protected if they are in the houses what later on also Raoul didn't buy, he was given by the Jewish community and by the aristocrats.</span> <span id="s469">That's why we had 60 houses on the two sides of the Danube, because they were given, and we had the Swedish flag going out.</span> <span id="s470">And we put these people who had these passes in there.</span> <span id="s471">But I didn't let my parents go in there.</span> <span id="s472">Neither did I let my cousin with her San Salvadorian thing.</span> <span id="s473">I said, "You come home to us too."</span> <span id="s474">We all went home to my house.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">NL: You thought they would be safer there?</span></p> <p><span id="s476">AA: I, I, I just played God, O.K.?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">NL: Well, it was your home.</span> <span id="s478">It was your home.</span></p> <p><span id="s479">AA: It was our home, but we could have been killed any moment.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">NL: Of course, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s481">AA: And it was very interesting to see the change in the house.</span> <span id="s482">There was no more of our old neighbors, only one.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">NL: What had happened to them?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">AA: I don't know.</span> <span id="s485">But probably most of the people down there were Jewish people with Christian papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">NL: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s487">AA: And they just moved in.</span> <span id="s488">But I won't tell you the whole story, because you have to read the book, and then you will know who was there and what was there.</span> <span id="s489">It was very interesting people.</span> <span id="s490">A very interesting man was there.</span> <span id="s491">So in any case, somehow we survived.</span> <span id="s492">I went every day to the Swedish Embassy.</span> <span id="s493">I was, all kinds, I was not his secretary, but I was a hostess.</span> <span id="s494">So that the people who came up there to ask for the pass we could give, they brought their pictures and we gave them the pass and, the Ambassador was signing each of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">NL: How did people find out that this was happening?</span> <span id="s496">Word of mouth?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">AA: You know, Budapest is a small, word of mouth.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">NL: Word of mouth.</span> <span id="s499">And such good news and desperate news, you...</span></p> <p><span id="s500">AA: There was a Jewish community of course...</span></p> <p><span id="s501">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">AA: And through them...</span></p> <p><span id="s503">NL: Did they, did they...</span></p> <p><span id="s504">AA: But it was...</span></p> <p><span id="s505">NL: Circularize this information?</span></p> <p><span id="s506">AA: No, no, no, it was just mouth by mouth.</span> <span id="s507">They couldn't have.</span> <span id="s508">It was impossible.</span> <span id="s509">Because in the meantime–you think that all of us lived with Raoul?</span> <span id="s510">Many of us were killed.</span> <span id="s511">Why I wasn't killed I don't know.</span> <span id="s512">Today I say maybe the reason was so that I can go around the world telling about this wonderful man.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">NL: Yah.</span> <span id="s514">Indeed.</span></p> <p><span id="s515">AA: But we were not all that lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s516">NL: So the Arrow Cross was still rampaging on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">AA: Oh, the Arrow Cross, they rampaged all the time.</span> <span id="s518">They killed little kids of, of two or three years old because they had the star on, and they, they, they were terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">NL: Yes, I've read about the atrocities.</span> <span id="s520">Worse than the Nazis.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">AA: They, they were, they were incredible!</span> <span id="s522">They, they, you know and the only way you could fight them was to lie or to, to...</span></p> <p><span id="s523">NL: Bribe.</span></p> <p><span id="s524">AA: Do anything, to bribe.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">NL: Bribe.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">AA: And you know, Raoul's mind was so fast.</span> <span id="s527">He could do things like nobody ever would think.</span> <span id="s528">And of course it was dangerous.</span> <span id="s529">You see his great mind was that he learned names very fast, and he never forgot a name.</span> <span id="s530">Once he learned, he would not make a mistake to call me Ava when I am Agnes.</span> <span id="s531">It didn't happen.</span> <span id="s532">I, I can't do that.</span> <span id="s533">Even today I forget somebody's name five minutes after, but not him.</span> <span id="s534">So he learned every Hungarian Nazi party officer, these Arrow Cross, who were running the several offices around, and one of these officers was right by his hospital, because by that time he had a hospital.</span> <span id="s535">And, he came one day to this hospital in a very snowy and cold day, because it was the coldest winter of the, in 50 years in Hungary.</span> <span id="s536">And he arrived then and he finds these little punks, 12-, 13-year-old kids with a gun, want to shoot the doctor and the patients.</span> <span id="s537">And he walks in, and all he could do is hit them right across the face.</span> <span id="s538">The guns fell down, and he kicked the gun.</span> <span id="s539">And he couldn't speak Hungarian, only a couple of words, "Get out of here and bring me your officer!"</span></p> <p><span id="s540">NL: Well!</span></p> <p><span id="s541">AA: And the kids were so frightened from him, because he was an authority when he wanted to be, y'know?</span> <span id="s542">The kids went out, and in about three minutes this Hungarian Nazi officer walks in, and Raoul looks at his watch and he says, "Simon, what took you three minutes to get here?"</span> <span id="s543">And the man was so surprised.</span> <span id="s544">He knew who he was, and he said, "Mr. Wallenberg, how do you know my name?"</span> <span id="s545">So, one go for Raoul.</span> <span id="s546">He said, "I know everybody's name, and I really don't understand what you're doing, because it's outrageous that you're sending on this Swedish territory three kids to kill my people instead of me bringing the medicine I was asking.</span> <span id="s547">Now get out and bring me the medication!</span> <span id="s548">And then maybe I can help you."</span> <span id="s549">And the officer says, "Why do you want to help me?"</span> <span id="s550">He said, "Because I just heard that by mistake you killed a Gestapo officer, and they're looking for you."</span></p> <p><span id="s551">NL: Oh my goodness.</span></p> <p><span id="s552">AA: And the guy says, "I never did!"</span> <span id="s553">He says, "Oh yes, you did, because he died here in our hospital!</span> <span id="s554">But before he died he sent your name up to the authorities."</span> <span id="s555">So the man turned and went, and the doctor stops there and he says, "Raoul, what did you just do?"</span> <span id="s556">And our friend starts to laugh.</span> <span id="s557">He says, "I didn't do anything.</span> <span id="s558">Look outside.</span> <span id="s559">It's snowing, not a speck of snow on anyone!"</span> <span id="s560">He says, "All right, but how did you know he was Simon?"</span> <span id="s561">He said, "Well, because that's the officer's name who runs this office next to us, and we were lucky it was Simon.</span> <span id="s562">It could have been no Simon, all right?"</span></p> <p><span id="s563">NL: Of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">AA: And he says, "But, Raoul, that's all fine.</span> <span id="s565">But I don't remember having a Gestapo officer here in our hospital."</span> <span id="s566">So what is Raoul doing?</span> <span id="s567">Another person would say, "No?"</span> <span id="s568">No, he said, he sat down on the floor, starts laughing.</span> <span id="s569">He said, "Of course not, but this guy killed so many people; one of them could have been a Gestapo officer."</span></p> <p><span id="s570">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">AA: But you see, you needed luck too, to luck, and the wit.</span> <span id="s572">The wit.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">NL: The wit, to respond so quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s574">AA: You think, it could have been not Simon.</span> <span id="s575">It could have been that the officer takes out and shoots him.</span></p> <p><span id="s576">NL: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">AA: But he had to try.</span> <span id="s578">He had to save the hospital.</span> <span id="s579">He had to save the people.</span> <span id="s580">He had to save his doctors.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">NL: Amazing.</span> <span id="s582">Amazing.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">AA: And he did that all the time.</span> <span id="s584">For him, a human life like, like our friend whom you didn't hear yet, Dr. Goodkin, it was the same thing.</span> <span id="s585">He had to think, how can I, he went, he sent out if he couldn't go, he sent his records people to these camps where they already kept people and he would ask the mothers who would give up their children, to give it to the Red Cross.</span> <span id="s586">And this friend of mine was the only one whose mother shoved her up.</span> <span id="s587">She couldn't understand why.</span> <span id="s588">She was only ten year old, why mother would shove her, but mother wanted her to live.</span> <span id="s589">And in the car going back to Budapest he heard about Raoul, "Raoul would be so glad we bring another child."</span> <span id="s590">And he says, "Who is Raoul?"</span> <span id="s591">He says, "Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s592">He's a Swede."</span> <span id="s593">Then she–was saved second time and then somehow it's an whole miracle.</span> <span id="s594">But, you know...</span></p> <p><span id="s595">NL: Who was Dr. Goodkin?</span></p> <p><span id="s596">AA: Dr. Goodkin–and you should interview her–she, right now she has a lyme disease, so you can't.</span> <span id="s597">She is, Professor of Languages and

is magnificent.</span></p> <p><span id="s601">NL: And this is the doctor?</span> <span id="s602">Doctor, or was it her husband or brother that's a doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s603">AA: No, she–is the doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s604">NL: It was she who saved the children.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">AA: No, no, no, her mother who pushed her out and she was saved.</span></p> <p><span id="s606">NL: She was saved.</span> <span id="s607">But who was the doctor who came to fetch her?</span></p> <p><span id="s608">AA: No, the Red Cross, the Red Cross came.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">NL: Oh, the Red Cross came.</span></p> <p><span id="s610">AA: I'm sorry.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">NL: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s612">AA: But you have to hear her story yourself.</span> <span id="s613">I, I don't want to tell her story.</span></p> <p><span id="s614">NL: Yes, all right, I, I, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">AA: It's a wonderful story.</span></p>

were on television, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">NL: You were on television.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">AA: Because I thought first I wanted only me, and I said, no, I think it is much more powerful if you have someone who was saved by him and someone who worked with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">NL: Excellent.</span> <span id="s624">Surely.</span> <span id="s625">Makes it more dramatic.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">AA: Makes it more dramatic, you know, because it really shows what...</span></p> <p><span id="s627">NL: Dimensions of that whole project, yes.</span> <span id="s628">So, if I could just interrupt for another minute, Mrs. Adachi.</span> <span id="s629">Were you able to learn anything at all about the fate of those of who were deported?</span> <span id="s630">Did you understand what Auschwitz was while you were working with Raoul, with Wallenberg?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">AA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">NL: What did you think...</span></p> <p><span id="s633">AA: First time I really found out what Auschwitz is when I hit Romania.</span> <span id="s634">And there was something...</span></p> <p><span id="s635">NL: After the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s636">AA: No, it was still the war, but some people who did escape from Auschwitz and Belsen-Bergen and so on–That was the first time I heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s637">NL: But now while you were working with Wallenberg, there were, of course, many, many hundreds of thousands of Jews from Hungary who were deported, some 400,000 in a matter of 44 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">AA: Four hundred [unclear] thousand.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s640">Did you, did you hear the word "Auschwitz" at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s641">AA: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">NL: Never.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">AA: None of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">NL: Wallenberg didn't mention that word either to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s645">AA: He might have, but we didn't have time.</span> <span id="s646">We didn't have time.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">NL: So you were totally unaware.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">AA: All we were to try to save...</span></p> <p><span id="s649">NL: Save.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">AA: Those Jews who are still in Budapest.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">NL: Did you know that those Jews who were being deported were being killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s652">AA: That we heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s653">NL: You heard.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">AA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">NL: But, not, not verifiable news.</span></p> <p><span id="s656">AA: Not verifiable.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">NL: And you never heard from those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s658">AA: No, because the BBC never talked about it either.</span></p> <p><span id="s659">NL: So...</span></p> <p><span id="s660">AA: And that was the only one we listened to.</span></p> <p><span id="s661">NL: Yah.</span> <span id="s662">And so, as far as you knew, then, as far as you recall, no one in the Budapest area understood that the deportations were to a death camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s663">AA: Oh, that we knew.</span> <span id="s664">But only after already 400,000 people were taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">NL: It was after the fact.</span> <span id="s666">But as they were being...</span></p> <p><span id="s667">AA: That's why Raoul went after the trains and stopped them, so that they can't take those people.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">NL: Yah.</span> <span id="s669">So, you knew that they were, they might perish...</span></p> <p><span id="s670">AA: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s671">NL: But you didn't know exactly how.</span></p> <p><span id="s672">AA: No, we didn't.</span></p> <p><span id="s673">NL: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s674">AA: And why we all survived we don't know either.</span></p> <p><span id="s675">NL: All right, now, let's go back.</span> <span id="s676">You were snatching people literally from houses and from the streets.</span></p> <p><span id="s677">AA: We were, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s678">NL: Giving them these Schutzpasses.</span></p> <p><span id="s679">AA: Yes.</span> <span id="s680">What, what we did, for instance, one night, you, you, as you know probably that we all who worked for him and the Red Cross, every night we slept somewhere else.</span> <span id="s681">I didn't always sleep home either.</span> <span id="s682">And I had to lie to my parents.</span> <span id="s683">I said we were sleeping at the Embassy, which was a lie, because we had to go from one house to the other, because they were after us, all of us, especially after Raoul they were.</span> <span id="s684">And the one morning again on the radio they said that all women between the age of 15 and 25 have to go to such and such a sports palace and then they will have to clean up Budapest.</span> <span id="s685">What because the bombings were on and it was really shattered, and we knew that they will not clean, but they will put in a wagon and, now by that time we knew that they taking them out and we didn't know the, the names of these gas chamber places like Auschwitz, and Bergen-Belsen, and, and Treblinka and what not.</span> <span id="s686">And of course Raoul immediately said to the whole crew, "All of you must have young sisters, and aunts and what not.</span> <span id="s687">Let's get the pictures."</span> <span id="s688">So we collected pictures for a whole day.</span> <span id="s689">And then we went to Buda.</span></p> <p><span id="s690">NL: Photos?</span></p> <p><span id="s691">AA: Photos from what we put on the Schutzpass.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">NL: The Schutzpass, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s693">AA: And, then we, asked them to sign, and then we have to collect all these and take it to– We were that time over in Buda in a beautiful villa, not far from the bridge.</span> <span id="s694">It was an icy, icy cold but beautiful moon-lit night, and we couldn't figure out why they don't bombing us on a day because we wanted the Americans to bomb, you know, so that we can get over it.</span> <span id="s695">And, nothing, no bombing, and there was a curfew also.</span> <span id="s696">We were not allowed out, nobody, Christians neither, from 9:00 in the evening until 7:00 in the morning.</span> <span id="s697">So, it was sort of dead, and we're sitting there in this beautiful place writing these life-saving passes.</span> <span id="s698">The Ambassador sat there, he signed every one, we put the pictures on.</span> <span id="s699">Around midnight Raoul arrives, unshaven, hungry, who knows where he was saving other people, and he says, "How're you doing?"</span> <span id="s700">And we said, "We are almost finished."</span> <span id="s701">And he said, "Well you better hurry, because by 3:00 we have to deliver each one of these passes."</span> <span id="s702">Nobody ever talked about curfew, you know, we were not allowed out.</span> <span id="s703">And then, as a joke he says to us, "Just keep on working, but I just want to tell you we have new neighbors in the next villa."</span> <span id="s704">And of course we all looked up.</span> <span id="s705">He says, "Don't look up.</span> <span id="s706">It's only the German headquarters."</span></p> <p><span id="s707">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s708">AA: And being like Raoul, who cares?</span> <span id="s709">So it's the German headquarters.</span> <span id="s710">So I remember I was the lucky one who was first ready, and I had to deliver my [inaudible] to the Pest side.</span> <span id="s711">Five hundred of these life-saving papers.</span> <span id="s712">And I walked out.</span> <span id="s713">And when you are young and you see a moonlight and stars, you forget about war, like Raoul Wallenberg, and I smiled to myself, and all I heard is my footsteps.</span> <span id="s714">And I crossed the bridge and I went from one house to the other with the addresses I knew.</span> <span id="s715">Several of them were good friends of mine, and then I rang the bell and they opened the door.</span> <span id="s716">"Aggie!</span> <span id="s717">What you doing out on the street!?"</span> <span id="s718">And all I could say with tears in my eyes, I said, "I am nothing.</span> <span id="s719">Here is a paper an angel sent you, and I hope it will save you.</span> <span id="s720">Goodbye."</span> <span id="s721">And I kissed and went.</span> <span id="s722">And only when I got home, finally, around I think it must have been 2:00, 2:30 in the morning, and I sat down on the bed, and suddenly it dawned to me what I'd just done.</span> <span id="s723">And I said, "Oh, my God, I could have been killed!"</span></p> <p><span id="s724">NL: Indeed!</span></p> <p><span id="s725">AA: There was a curfew!</span> <span id="s726">And then, suddenly I says, "What am I talking about?</span> <span id="s727">Raoul Wallenberg wouldn't like to hear that.</span> <span id="s728">Of course they wouldn't kill us, because the Germans and the Hungarians are great cowards.</span> <span id="s729">They wouldn't dare to be out in a moonlit night."</span> <span id="s730">And I went to sleep.</span> <span id="s731">And 6:00 in the morning I woke up.</span> <span id="s732">My two best girlfriends were kicked out from that camp.</span> <span id="s733">And they, they were born in Hungary, but they were brought up in Germany, so the German officer told them in German what they can do with the paper, but the kids turned around and he never shot after them.</span> <span id="s734">So they ran all the way to our house.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">NL: Oh my.</span></p> <p><span id="s736">AA: And they are in this country today.</span> <span id="s737">They're both grandmothers.</span> <span id="s738">But we are alive!</span></p> <p><span id="s739">NL: Remarkable story.</span></p> <p><span id="s740">AA: So, you see, Raoul gave us such a strength that I think nothing was impossible.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">NL: How many people worked with you and him?</span></p> <p><span id="s742">AA: About 350 altogether, that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s743">NL: 350.</span></p> <p><span id="s744">AA: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s745">NL: That was his core, rescue.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">AA: And a few, maybe there was ten of the Red Cross people, and they were magnificent.</span></p> <p><span id="s747">NL: This was the Hungarian Red Cross?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">AA: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">NL: I wouldn't think so.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">AA: The Hungarian Red Cross were Nazis like the rest of it.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">NL: Swedish Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">AA: Oh, the Swedish Red Cross.</span> <span id="s753">And later on the Swiss helped.</span></p> <p><span id="s754">NL: The Swiss Red Cross.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">AA: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">NL: Or the

big deal for him.</span> <span id="s764">They have a Lutz, that was his name, Consul Lutz, they're having a Lutz Committee in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s765">And when I asked my family could I sell my book in Switzerland, they said, "Nobody would be interested in Wallenberg."</span> <span id="s766">But Lutz only did it because Raoul asked him to.</span></p> <p><span id="s767">NL: He inspired him.</span> <span id="s768">Undoubtedly.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">AA: And he was taken to Russia too, but the Swiss, they called up and they said, "We have three Russians here.</span> <span id="s770">If you want them, give us Lutz back."</span> <span id="s771">And Lutz was home within a week–Raoul Wallenberg, still in jail 44 years after.</span></p> <p><span id="s772">NL: If not

the Ambassador, he said, "If you go, you speak like a diplomat.</span> <span id="s812">And I am not."</span> <span id="s813">And that's why he could do what he had done.</span> <span id="s814">And he

gentleman, who is now the head of the Chicago Wallenberg Committee, a wonderful young man, he was just told that Raoul's diplomatic immunity ran out three days before the Soviets arrived to

<p><span id="s846">AA: To keep our spirits, and I'm sure his too...</span></p> <p><span id="s847">NL: His spirit.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">AA: But you see, he probably, when he came to Hungary first he thought this will be just a little adventure, but then he became like a great chess player.</span> <span id="s849">Now, I step, and I can win!</span> <span id="s850">And he was an excellent chess player.</span> <span id="s851">He could do it with the Germans.</span> <span id="s852">He was not a good chess player with the Soviets.</span></p> <p><span id="s853">NL: With the Russians, or with his own government.</span></p> <p><span id="s854">AA: And with his own government.</span> <span id="s855">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s856">NL: Ah, so tragic.</span></p> <p><span id="s857">AA: It is tragic, because we're not talking about the saints.</span> <span id="s858">I don't think he would ever like, he was also not speaking about the hero, because this wasn't his idea.</span> <span id="s859">His idea was just, "I have to save the people."</span> <span id="s860">He didn't care if somebody was a Jew or a Christian.</span> <span id="s861">"The people needed help, I help."</span> <span id="s862">Because there were thousands, especially in Budapest, mixed marriages.</span> <span id="s863">What he didn't say that, "Hey, I won't save you because you're the Christian part."</span> <span id="s864">What did he care?</span> <span id="s865">"As long as I save the people."</span> <span id="s866">And those people who were in his safe houses, and we had, thirty or fifty or sixty of it; they were crowded, but they had Raoul Wallenberg who came every day when he could, just to see how everybody is.</span> <span id="s867">He sent them food, he sent them medication.</span> <span id="s868">He sent them a doctor, he sent them a nurse.</span> <span id="s869">He was there.</span> <span id="s870">You felt it.</span></p> <p><span id="s871">NL: His presence.</span></p> <p><span id="s872">AA: My mother's friend, who, I think, just died last year, she's, she was 100 when she died, she was outside Budapest in a, a mason factory.</span> <span id="s873">And you probably heard the name of, Susan Tabor [phonetic]?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">NL: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s875">AA: Well, she was one of the survivors, who also, she worked at Yeshiva University, library I believe.</span> <span id="s876">She died, unfortunately, last year in cancer, or two years ago.</span> <span id="s877">Now, she was there with her mother and her husband, and they had, also some Salvadorian paper or something which was really nothing good.</span> <span id="s878">And my mother's friend was there, and this was like a gas chamber.</span> <span id="s879">It was a mason factory where they, in the dark, they made trenches so that people fell in and they died.</span> <span id="s880">They had no food, no water, no toilets.</span> <span id="s881">And Raoul heard about it suddenly, and he went out there with the Red Cross and with hot soup and bread, and he screamed at those people.</span> <span id="s882">She, she told me, "How dare you are to do what you're doing?</span> <span id="s883">How dare!</span> <span id="s884">These are Swedish people!"</span> <span id="s885">And he had papers in his pocket, and my mother's friend said that he walked in in this cold place where they were sitting for weeks already, and there were 300 old people in there.</span> <span id="s886">And he would suddenly change his whole voice.</span> <span id="s887">And he would touch everyone, including my friend, and he said, "Please do not worry.</span> <span id="s888">I will come back.</span> <span id="s889">I'll bring you hot soup and medicine.</span> <span id="s890">But you have to wait, because first I have to save the young.</span> <span id="s891">But I'll come back for each one of you."</span> <span id="s892">And nobody was angry with him for saying that.</span> <span id="s893">They said, "Who is this angel?"</span> <span id="s894">And as he walked out, Susan went up and she said, "Sir,"–she didn't know who he was–she said, "We don't have your paper."</span> <span id="s895">He said, "Never mind, just walk out, walk out with me."</span> <span id="s896">And he walked them right out of the camp.</span> <span id="s897">O.K.?</span> <span id="s898">And the German just stood there, because he was so powerful.</span> <span id="s899">He said, "You will be hanged!</span> <span id="s900">Because I am a diplomat!"</span> <span id="s901">And...</span></p> <p><span id="s902">NL: They were, they were intimidated.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">AA: And he came back and saved those 300 people.</span> <span id="s904">She came out here with her husband eventually.</span> <span id="s905">But people don't believe that these things really happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">NL: Well, I think they do.</span></p> <p><span id="s907">AA: And...</span></p> <p><span id="s908">NL: It's just that it's, it's so incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s909">AA: It is incredible...</span></p> <p><span id="s910">NL: It's so incredible.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">AA: Like it was incredible for us too.</span></p> <p><span id="s912">NL: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s913">AA: You believe it that in Budapest we didn't believe it when these people came and told us the story?</span></p> <p><span id="s914">NL: Yah.</span></p> <p><span id="s915">AA: We said, "Nah, nobody can do things like this."</span></p> <p><span id="s916">NL: Yes.</span> <span id="s917">He was so clever and sharp-witted.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">AA: But you see the problem that, that, the terrible thing is that people don't believe.</span> <span id="s919">In '45, now the war was over in May, in September I was in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s920">June, July, August, September, four months, O.K.?</span> <span id="s921">It was still, the whole world was in a tumult.</span> <span id="s922">And I have a big family there, and I thought, "This is such a wonderful story.</span> <span id="s923">This has to be told.</span> <span id="s924">If the Swiss didn't listen to the people who came out of the camps, maybe I can understand, because how can you even, you know, imagine this?</span> <span id="s925">I mean, for young people too this must be something, how, how can you do this to people?"</span> <span id="s926">But I thought, "This is a story.</span> <span id="s927">It's, it's so gorgeous, it's so wonderful."</span></p> <p><span id="s928">NL: So fresh.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">AA: My uncle, who was a Russian Jew, who came out in 1960 and turned to my aunt and said in German–he forgot that I speak perfect German–he said, "I think we better take her to a psychiatrist.</span> <span id="s930">Her mind must have gotten crazy in the war.</span> <span id="s931">She is lying."</span> <span id="s932">I was devastated.</span> <span id="s933">So I tried to go to newspaper people.</span> <span id="s934">They laughed in my face.</span> <span id="s935">And I did the mistake, I think, that I stopped talking about Wallenberg, because nobody believed me.</span> <span id="s936">I should have never stopped talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">NL: When did you start talking again?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">AA: Eight years ago, nine years ago.</span></p> <p><span id="s939">NL: So late.</span></p> <p><span id="s940">AA: Because, I got to Sweden in October.</span> <span id="s941">Nobody talked about Raoul Wallenberg.</span> <span id="s942">I met the Embassy again, and I said, "Where is Raoul?"</span> <span id="s943">"Raoul didn't make it home.</span> <span id="s944">We don't know where he is."</span> <span id="s945">I said, "What do you mean, you don't know where he is!?</span> <span id="s946">You went through Russia, didn't you pick him up?"</span> <span id="s947">He said, "No, they told us there not to speak about him."</span> <span id="s948">So, then I got a job through the Swedish government, a wonderful job; the other great Swede, Count Bernadotte, you know, he went through Bergen-Belsen and he brought the people in to rehabilitate them.</span> <span id="s949">And they needed someone who would go and speak in three languages.</span> <span id="s950">I couldn't speak Polish, but German, French and Hungarian, and tell them about Sweden and Swedish culture and literature.</span> <span id="s951">And so, I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s952">I had the key to the royal library, because the books were there in German.</span> <span id="s953">And I was sent out.</span> <span id="s954">And I asked them, this is the Svenska Institute, the Swedish Institute, who beforehand they had exchange student programs.</span> <span id="s955">[Tape ends abruptly.]</span> <span id="s956">Postscript: In a follow-up conversation, Mrs. Adachi expresses her belief that Wallenberg is still alive, that she does not believe the statement of Soviet officials that he died in prison.</span></p></body></html>
