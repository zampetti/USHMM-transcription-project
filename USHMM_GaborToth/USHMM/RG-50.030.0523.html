Place.</span> <span id="s21">I’ve been living here for over 55 years.</span> <span id="s22">I bought this about 1950, when I was poor.</span> <span id="s23">The house was built before the war, originally it sold for about 6,000 dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s24">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">A: I had to pay 16,000 and today it’s worth about 800,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s26">Q:

id="s31">And I’d like for you to tell me about your mother and father.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: Well, the t -- the tears are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s34">A: My mother and father were very Orthodox religious people, and they kept the home the same way.</span> <span id="s35">The religion was important.</span> <span id="s36">We were in th -- we had to observe the Sabbath and all the laws.</span> <span id="s37">At the age of 11 I was sent away to the next city to go into a high school.</span> <span id="s38">That was about 1932, and I stayed there for three years til the Nazi regime forced Jewish people to leave the system.</span> <span id="s39">And we had to leave and we did not get any f-further education.</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: What kind of business was your father in?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: My father had a corn business and a textile business.</span> <span id="s42">The corn business was seasonal from about July, August til March.</span> <span id="s43">The farmers -- where we lived was the richest soil in Germany and it produced ber -- beautiful crops.</span> <span id="s44">Wheat and rye that was desirable and it -- it was quality and my father bought it from the farmers and sold it to dealers and they came by a -- a -- boats docked in a little villa -- a little town, Ochsenfurt, and they loaded it in bulk onto the boats and the boats went down the river, into the Rhine river and they usually ended up in Dortmund where -- where -- which had the largest brewery in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s45">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s46">And -- and the name of your town was?</span></p> <p><span id="s47">A: The name of the village was Gaukönigshofen, about twel -- according to the history about 1250 years old.</span> <span id="s48">It came very early, it -- it -- it finally, I think eight -- 17 or 1600 the names were changed and it ended up in Gaukönigshofen.</span> <span id="s49">The hofen means a courtyard and the gau means a district.</span> <span id="s50">And the könig means that it was dominated by the rulers from either the Catholic church, the bishops, or the -- the other rulers in Munich.</span> <span id="s51">At that time Bavaria was independent from Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q: And in this little village, how many people lived there?</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: About 600 at the time when we were there.</span> <span id="s54">Now it’s about 2500 --</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Q: Huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s56">A: -- it doubled its size, it grew and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s57">Q: And tell about your home, where you lived in -- in this little --</span></p> <p><span id="s58">A: I lived -- we lived in a home that was like an old fortress.</span> <span id="s59">It -- originally they ta -- they -- we had a boy in -- in the village, the grandson of the Nazi mayor, he went to a university in Bamberg and he wrote a book about the village, a 700 page book and he researched everything.</span> <span id="s60">And he found out the will -- th-the ha -- the ha -- house was surrounded by water and they used it to -- to buy ha -- hides from the animals and they treated it to make leather out of the hides.</span> <span id="s61">And those treatments developed a certain odor, and there was running water going through the streams around the house and the -- it had like a walk to go in that was supposed to be a bridge that they caw -- pull up if they didn’t want anybody.</span> <span id="s62">When we lived there, there was no running water in the house.</span> <span id="s63">The walls were very thick, at least eight or 10 inches, and all stone, heavy stone.</span> <span id="s64">And finally, in about 1928, the water was -- was put through the village and came into the house.</span> <span id="s65">Cold water, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s66">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s67">A: In front of the house was one of the pumps to pump water from a deep pool.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Was that something that you did as a boy?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: I did some pumping at the pu -- yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s70">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">A: This -- this way -- the village had a pump o-on it -- another part of the village, but we didn’t have to go and use it, we had our own

Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s120">Q: But I would li -- [interruption] Okay, here we’re back.</span> <span id="s121">Tell me what it was like, the small town life, when you were a young boy.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: It was a -- i-it -- it -- a simple life, it’s a religious life.</span> <span id="s123">You -- you obeyed all the rules and regulations, and there was not much social life.</span> <span id="s124">You had relatives in the village and friends, but otherwise it was no big problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s125">Q: And were -- how many Jewish families were in your village?</span></p> <p><span id="s126">A: W-Was about 50 Jewish families, I would say, probably 10 percent of the population was a -- they had their own synagogue and we had a Hebrew teacher who lived in a special house that was built for the religious school.</span> <span id="s127">He had the apartment upstairs, and it was pretty much a normal life.</span> <span id="s128">It was one of the larger congregations in that district that had Jews.</span> <span id="s129">There were three, four other congregations that were much smaller with the Jewish population.</span></p> <p><span id="s130">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s131">So the Jews were in quite a minority at that -- in that part of Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: Yeah --</span></p> <p><span id="s133">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">A: -- we were a minority, but we were respected.</span> <span id="s135">My father was part of the con -- of the -- of the community, of the town council.</span> <span id="s136">He was a member and he had to go to the meetings and debate what was good and bad for the village.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: When you were a young boy in the t -- like in the 20’s and early 30’s, did you feel different?</span> <span id="s138">Did you feel singled out in any way at that time because you were Jewish?</span> <span id="s139">Or did you feel assimilated?</span></p> <p><span id="s140">A: No, I didn’t feel anything til about 1932 when the Nazis came slowly into power.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: Up -- up to that time there was no -- the village was all Catholic and everybody knew everybody and there was no bad -- no bad feelings about anything.</span> <span id="s143">Q: And how did that change, gradually?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: That changed the minute that Hitler was elected as a ma -- as a pr -- chancellor.</span> <span id="s145">Then -- then some people in the village decided they wanted to join him and they started creating problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s147">What were some of the early problems that you experienced?</span></p> <p><span id="s148">A: Well, the -- the government start passing laws and within a few years ya -- Jews couldn’t own a business any more, they couldn’t do anything, they weren’t even allowed -- or anything to normal life.</span></p> <p><span id="s149">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: They were just tr-treated like criminals.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">Q: And you were in the public school?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">A: I was in the public school til I went to the high school in Würzburg.</span></p> <p><span id="s153">Q: And -- and were you -- I’m trying to think, do the math in my head and think what year were you in elementary school.</span> <span id="s154">Were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: About 1933, I was kicked out with all the other Jewish boy.</span> <span id="s156">A friend of mine who went to school with me, his father sent him to Switzerland to finish his education.</span> <span id="s157">He studied and became a -- a physical education teacher.</span> <span id="s158">But h-his family owned some galleries in Holland, and so from Switzerland he went to Holland and when the war started he was not allowed to emigrate any more and he was deported with his parents to one of the c -- camps in the east and exterminated.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s160">What was like for you in school?</span> <span id="s161">Were the other -- were your schoolmates making comments to you, were the teachers making comments to you?</span> <span id="s162">Did it build up?</span></p> <p><span id="s163">A: Not really, but you could feel the tension.</span></p> <p><span id="s164">Q: How?</span> <span id="s165">Did you remember any stories about things that happened to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Not really, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s168">A: Not personal stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s169">Q: But -- but then you and all your siblings were kicked out of school at the same time?</span></p> <p><span id="s170">A: Right, we had to -- we had to -- to -- to go without an education, you can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">A: Those -- those year -- the best years of your education were lost.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: An-And how did you react to that?</span> <span id="s174">Were you afraid?</span> <span id="s175">Were you confused?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Well, you couldn’t do anything about it except emigrate, leave Germany.</span> <span id="s177">And that was not easy, because all -- most countries had no quota for you to come in and get a -- get a visa to settle.</span> <span id="s178">So you had to have -- you have to try to make a-any arrangements you could.</span> <span id="s179">I was trying to get to Israel, and I was not successful.</span> <span id="s180">My brother went to Israel in 1936.</span> <span id="s181">He was the first one to leave from Germany.</span> <span id="s182">And otherwise it was really proble -- problematic, you couldn’t ge -- go anyplace.</span> <span id="s183">Finally, about 1937, I wrote to a relative, a cousin who was living in Omaha, Nebraska and he was kind enough to help me.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">Q: But that took some time, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s185">A: He put a deposit in the bank in my name and sent the receipt to the American consulate, who was at that time in Stuttgart and the consulate registered me and confirmed the receipt and I had to wait for my number to be called, which was about a year or two away.</span> <span id="s186">So the -- when came the bru -- the Kristallnacht and the Nazis put me into Dachau after a few weeks and so.</span> <span id="s187">And while I was there my mother had a relative in London who vouched for me to stay there while I was waiting for my visa to go to America.</span> <span id="s188">That was after I got out of Dachau.</span> <span id="s189">It took me two weeks to pack up and go to London.</span> <span id="s190">And I got there, I think, January 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s191">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s192">Let me ask you, in those years between 1932 and 1936, when your brother left, your parents and other relatives, were they all very keen on having family members leave?</span> <span id="s193">Because so many Jews did not leave, or didn’t --</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Oh no, we were determined to leave.</span> <span id="s195">We-We wanted to leave and we tried everything under the sun to get out.</span> <span id="s196">My oldest brother finally got a visa the day Kristallnacht appeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: Tell me that story about taking him.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">A: He got a -- a -- a visa and he got an invitation to go to the American consulate in Stuttgart and we drove there together on -- we still had our own car.</span> <span id="s199">I even had a driver’s license.</span> <span id="s200">And we went to th -- on the nember -- November ninth he was summoned to the American consulate.</span> <span id="s201">So we went to Stuttgart, we checked into a hotel and he went there in the morning.</span> <span id="s202">And during the day was the destruction of the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s203">I stayed in a hotel and he was in a -- in the consulate getting his -- he had his passport to get his visa entered.</span> <span id="s204">And he stayed there -- they kept him all day and he came out five o’clock at night and we saw the destruction all around us, all the Jewish shops were destroyed.</span> <span id="s205">Where the Jews were living the windows were slashed, the bedding was thrown out through the windows.</span> <span id="s206">It was a mass hysteria.</span> <span id="s207">So at five o’clock he came out and we decided -- he decided, he had his passport, he didn’t have his ticket for the boat.</span> <span id="s208">He had bought it, but he didn’t bring it to Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s209">And he went to the railroad station and bought a ticket to go to Basel in Switzerland.</span> <span id="s210">We had a relative living in Basel.</span> <span id="s211">So he cleared out and I checked out from the hotel and started to drive home.</span></p> <p><span id="s212">Q: What time of day was it?</span></p> <p><span id="s213">A: Five o’clock in the afternoon --</span></p> <p><span id="s214">Q: And with this --</span></p> <p><span id="s215">A: -- it was dark already, November.</span> <span id="s216">So I started to drive home and I got to -- to the -- a city called Wachmergenheim and I stopped, I saw -- I saw a public telephone and I called my father and he said, don’t come home, they’re coming here.</span> <span id="s217">In other words, he knew they were coming to start destroying whatever they wanted to destroy.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: The Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: The Germans, the Nazis, yeah.</span> <span id="s220">So I drove another 20 kilomed and I checked into a farmer I knew well for the night.</span> <span id="s221">I didn’t want to go home and be part of that.</span> <span id="s222">So he le -- he let me stay wi -- in his home.</span> <span id="s223">I put the car inside the court, but in the morning, five o’clock, he said he’s got servants, he will feel better if I would leave because they might report him.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: He wasn’t Jewish?</span> <span id="s225">Was he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">A: No.</span> <span id="s229">No, no, he was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s230">He was a good Christian.</span> <span id="s231">So I left and I went to another village with another farmer whom I knew had no servants.</span> <span id="s232">And he let me stay til seven o’clock.</span> <span id="s233">Then I had no more choice but go home.</span> <span id="s234">And I drove home and I found myself facing the world’s worst.</span> <span id="s235">The house -- the door was broken down, every window was broken, the house was completely demolished.</span> <span id="s236">And before I knew it, one of the officers came and says, you’re the re -- you are arrested and he took me to the gendarme to sit in his office til they had re -- ru -- re -- a way to transport me to the prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s237">Q: And there was nobody there?</span> <span id="s238">Your parents and your siblings, they were gone?</span> <span id="s239">A: My father was gone, my mother was in the house.</span> <span id="s240">That was all.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">Q: What did she say to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">A: She co -- she -- she was all broken down.</span> <span id="s243">Finally a neighbor came in and help with the -- ope -- to lift up some [indecipherable] and fix the house door a little, so she could close it.</span> <span id="s244">It was -- it was the most miserable thing you could have ever experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">Q: Was she able to tell you what had happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s246">A: She wasn’t in no mood to even talk about it, because you saw with your own eyes, it was nothing but destruction.</span> <span id="s247">Every closet had been turned over, everything broken, I -- un-unbelievable.</span> <span id="s248">They were acting like criminals.</span> <span id="s249">And we knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s250">Q: You knew the people who’d come there?</span></p> <p><span id="s251">A: Well, they came from the next town on a truck with wooden sticks to hit the people, and yeah, we knew some of them.</span> <span id="s252">One -- one of them stood in front of my father and said, no-nothing can happen to Mr. Kleeman.</span> <span id="s253">Because he was a -- he owned a -- a -- a [indecipherable] in a village that my father used to go in once in awhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">A: That’s what he said, but it was alright for him to beat up the other Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: So you -- you were arrested and taken into the offices --</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: I was taken into the same prison and put into the room with my father.</span></p> <p><span id="s258">Q: And you were 15 years old?</span></p> <p><span id="s259">A: No, I was 18.</span></p> <p><span id="s260">Q: 18 years old.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: No, 19.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: -- where was that prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">A: That was in Ochsenfurt, was f-five kilometer away, the next small town, which was the -- the regional office, like a county here.</span></p> <p><span id="s266">Q: And who else was in that prison?</span></p> <p><span id="s267">A: All the Jews that they had arrested in the whole county, they had put them into that prison.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">Q: So when you got there, you knew most of the people in there?</span></p> <p><span id="s269">A: Yeah, you knew most of them, but you weren’t able to talk to them.</span> <span id="s270">Each one was locked in this room.</span> <span id="s271">They were allowed 15 minutes in the afternoon to walk around the courtyard, but you couldn't talk to any one of them.</span> <span id="s272">They were s -- they were supervising.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: And what did you know about what was going to happen to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: You knew nothing, because you had no -- you couldn’t get a newspaper, you had no radio.</span> <span id="s275">You knew nothing from day to day what would happen to you.</span> <span id="s276">Nobody knew anything.</span> <span id="s277">They finally took some of the older people, like my father, World War I veteran, and let them go home, discharged them.</span> <span id="s278">But not the younger ones.</span></p> <p><span id="s279">Q: What happened to the younger ones?</span></p> <p><span id="s280">A: Well, after two weeks or so, they took us to another prison in a large city and there we were processed, pictures taken and fingerprinted and prepare to be shipped to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s281">We didn't know what was going on, but that was the rumor.</span></p> <p><span id="s282">Q: At that time in Germany though, you knew that there were concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: Yes, it was known.</span> <span id="s284">There was Dachau, there was Buchenwald.</span> <span id="s285">They were prepared for this.</span> <span id="s286">They were built up and were waiting for the big shipments of Jews.</span> <span id="s287">They brought them in from Austria, they brought them in from -- from all of Bavaria.</span> <span id="s288">Was filled up.</span> <span id="s289">They didn’t care how crowded it was, it was just -- they were the bosses.</span> <span id="s290">Was electric wire fence all around the place so you had no chance to escape, and so on.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">Q: How -- how did you get to Dachau?</span></p> <p><span id="s292">A: On the bus.</span> <span id="s293">They put you on -- there was -- they had four or five buses running, everyone filled with people and lots of policemen.</span> <span id="s294">Took about five to six hours to te -- to -- the ride to Dachau.</span> <span id="s295">You didn’t even know where you were going, you just suspected it.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: And what -- what happened when they -- when you got there?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: In Dachau they started to cut your hair and process you, take your clothes away and give you the minimum, like a pair of pajamas and a pair of fo -- shoes that didn’t fit.</span> <span id="s298">You were stripped of everything you owned, and -- and thrown in with other prisoners.</span> <span id="s299">You didn’t know what was going on.</span> <span id="s300">You were a -- practically, you didn’t exist.</span> <span id="s301">You -- you -- if you got a bowl of soup for day -- for the day, you were lucky.</span> <span id="s302">And they made all the prisoners do the work for them.</span> <span id="s303">They only made themselves as the -- as the guard, as the policemen.</span> <span id="s304">And they had vicious dogs and everything in the camp already.</span> <span id="s305">If you didn’t behave they put the dog on you to tear you to pieces.</span> <span id="s306">People died every day.</span> <span id="s307">In -- in the morning they loaded up the dead bodies and took them out someplace, we don’t know where.</span> <span id="s308">But people were dying from heart attacks, from problems, everything.</span> <span id="s309">I-It was a shameful existence, you couldn't do anything about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">Q: Did you work?</span> <span id="s311">Were you forced to do work there?</span></p> <p><span id="s312">A: You -- no, there was no work.</span> <span id="s313">You had to stand around the parade ground and wait for them to tell you something.</span> <span id="s314">You -- you stood for six hours, eight hours, 10 hours a day in the cold weather.</span> <span id="s315">They didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Did you get sick?</span></p> <p><span id="s317">A: Not -- I didn’t get sick there, no, but you had to s -- keep your health.</span> <span id="s318">You had to try the best to hope to get out sometime.</span> <span id="s319">My day came December 22nd, I believe it was that they told me in the evening that you go home tomorrow.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: And how did they tell you that?</span> <span id="s321">A: I don’t remember how that went, but in the morning you got your own clothes back and get ready to leave and they took you to the railroad and the railroad took you to Munich, which was a -- the nearest city, about 10 to 12 miles away.</span> <span id="s322">And in Munich the Jewish community had a room in the railroad station where they took you in.</span> <span id="s323">You had no money to buy a ticket or anything, so they took care of you.</span> <span id="s324">Next morning I was home.</span></p> <p><span id="s325">Q: When you were -- when you were let out, did they tell you that you had to leave the country, or did they just say go out --</span></p> <p><span id="s326">A: Well they -- they told me I’m le -- being left because I can get out of the country.</span> <span id="s327">I’m being let out because of that.</span> <span id="s328">They also tell you don’t speak about what happened in Dachau, don’t tell anybody.</span> <span id="s329">So that’s -- that’s all.</span> <span id="s330">You were glad to get out and keep your mouth shut for awhile.</span> <span id="s331">You couldn’t say anything til after you left Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s332">Q: And your paperwork had come through then from -- from your relative in Omaha?</span></p> <p><span id="s333">A: Yeah, that paper was coming through, and the -- the consul from Stuttgart sent it to London when I was there and then I had to wait in London about 11 months before my number came up.</span> <span id="s334">You were registered and then in December I was able to -- I get -- went to London in January and in December I was able to go to new y -- to -- to -- to -- on a boat to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s336">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s337">A: I had to buy a new ticket, I had bought a ticket in Germany to go to America before I-I -- before Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s339">A: But it was worthless because Germany was at war.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: We’re going to break and change tapes now.</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s343">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: Okay, we’re back.</span> <span id="s345">When you came back to your home, what did you find when you got home?</span></p> <p><span id="s346">A: I found my mother and father there, the house was fixed up a little, the windows had been replaced and everything -- anything you did was ready to go and leave as fast as you can.</span> <span id="s347">I bought a few things and I was anxious to get out.</span></p> <p><span id="s348">Q: And did -- did your parents think at that time that they were going to help you get out as fast as possible so that -- that you could help them, was that the plan?</span></p> <p><span id="s349">A: Well, they were hoping.</span> <span id="s350">I didn’t know what -- how I -- how -- how I could help til I was able to get to London and meet some people and look for help.</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: But had -- did you all plan that together?</span> <span id="s352">Was that --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: Mentally -- well, no, I didn’t discuss it, but I -- mentally I hoped that I could do something once I get to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: And at this time you -- you had a -- your older brother that was --</span></p> <p><span id="s355">A: He left and he was able to leave.</span> <span id="s356">He took a train from Basel to Le Havre and catched the boat he had a ticket for, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: And where did he go?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: To United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s359">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s360">A: Yeah, he ne-never went back to -- to the home in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s361">Q: Were you in touch with him, did he write?</span></p> <p><span id="s362">A: No, I wa -- there was no way of going in touch with him.</span> <span id="s363">He was just lucky, he was able to -- to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: Mm.</span> <span id="s365">[interruption].</span> <span id="s366">So you were the second one to leave then, in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s367">A: No, I was the third one.</span> <span id="s368">The one to Israel first --</span></p> <p><span id="s369">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">A: -- and then the brother and then me.</span></p> <p><span id="s371">Q: Oh, that’s right, the -- one went in ’36.</span></p> <p><span id="s372">A: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s374">And were you getting -- were you hearing from him?</span> <span id="s375">Was he writing?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Who, the one in is -- yeah, he wrote, but I -- I -- when I came to London I wrote him a letter and I got a reply.</span></p> <p><span id="s377">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">A: Those days there was no air mail, you know, it was boat.</span> <span id="s379">Three weeks for a letter.</span> <span id="s380">You don’t -- you don’t remember those days.</span></p> <p><span id="s381">Q: No, I don’t.</span> <span id="s382">So how -- tell about your crossing -- your leaving Germany and getting to London, tell how you did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s383">A: I -- I bought a railroad ticket and the ticket went from Germany to London.</span> <span id="s384">That included a ferry ride from Holland into England and then another train ride into London.</span> <span id="s385">That was a -- the way of travel, because that -- there was no airplanes, you could say.</span> <span id="s386">There were a few small planes to deliver mail or something, but people couldn’t travel yet by airplane.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">Q: And why did you go to London?</span></p> <p><span id="s388">A: Because the other cousin -- the cousin who helped me lived in London.</span> <span id="s389">And that was the normal procedure to go to.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: And what did your cousin do there?</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: He had a business.</span> <span id="s392">He picked me up at the railroad station and put me into a boarding home.</span> <span id="s393">He paid for -- for two weeks stay and that was my beginning of life in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s394">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s395">And you got work there?</span> <span id="s396">A: I wasn’t allowed to work because I was a -- like a guest, I was transient.</span> <span id="s397">You weren’t y -- officially you weren't allowed to work because the British had [indecipherable] on us.</span> <span id="s398">Was -- was still sort of depression and they didn’t want us refugees to take jobs away from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: So you couldn’t, even if you found a job where to work, it wouldn’t help you because the British were very loyal and they didn’t want you to be in trouble.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: And what did you do while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: I volunteered wer -- to work in the social cl -- like federation in the cl -- British make-up of the so -- of the federation.</span> <span id="s403">And they let you volunteer and work for -- for nothing.</span> <span id="s404">They needed help because there was so much mail coming in to them and so much help needed, that it was easy to get that job.</span></p> <p><span id="s405">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">A: That was my luck.</span></p> <p><span id="s407">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">A: Because once I was in that boarding house, there was a card game every Wednesday night and one of the players heard my name and he says, I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s409">And I waited for the game to be over and then we talked and he told me his name and where he came from, and his father and my father were friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: And what was his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s411">A: Ha -- Norbert Leaman, like the Leaman brothers.</span> <span id="s412">And they also came from a small village, the same village where my father was born.</span> <span id="s413">And he was the Godsend for me.</span> <span id="s414">He offered to help me and this -- this was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s415">The relatives did not offer any help, but he did.</span> <span id="s416">Within t -- week or two he signed an affidavit for my parents and arranged for my brother and sister to get to London and they even came in to learn a profession to work.</span> <span id="s417">He was outstanding.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: From what I know about how much trouble people had getting out of Germany, you were so lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s419">A: I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s420">I was one of the few who was able to save a family.</span> <span id="s421">I was very lucky.</span> <span id="s422">I-It’s hard to describe it.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Because there was -- they f -- they came about three months after I got there and they had to wait in London for the visa to come to America, but that was very, very lucky.</span> <span id="s425">Unheard of, practically.</span> <span id="s426">And luckily my brother in Israel had a little money so he was able to send some money to live on.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: And what was it like when your parents came?</span> <span id="s428">Do you remember meeting them?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Yeah, I met -- I went to the railroad station, and picked them up and I had rented a little apartment where to live in the north section of London near the boarding house where I was first put.</span> <span id="s430">And w-we managed.</span> <span id="s431">My brother and sister got a little job.</span> <span id="s432">He were -- he learned as a carpenter and my sister did some homework, housecleaning and we managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s433">Q: So your brother and sister came with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s434">A: No, they came a week or two later.</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Their papers weren’t ready when my parents came.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">A: But they came within a week or two.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">Q: And your sister was the youngest one, how old was she at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: She was that -- she was born ’23 and that was 1939, so 16.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s442">A: Rough -- rough life.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s444">So you’re all there together in north London?</span></p> <p><span id="s445">A: Yeah, we lived in a small apartment.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: And what were your days like, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s447">A: Oh, I went to work as a volunteer in the -- in the office, I went every day.</span> <span id="s448">I didn’t want to give up my job and I helped quite a few other people to get out from Germany.</span> <span id="s449">I f -- I --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Can you describe the -- did that agency have a name, that you worked with?</span></p> <p><span id="s451">A: Yeah, Bloomsbury House.</span> <span id="s452">It was known as the only agency that controlled th-the -- the German Jews to come to England.</span> <span id="s453">It was called Bloomsbury House.</span> <span id="s454">But they -- they couldn’t employ me, they couldn’t pay me, let’s put it this way, they couldn’t -- they weren’t allowed to -- to hire anybody who came temporarily, which I could understand.</span> <span id="s455">And they -- they had one big banker from London who came every afternoon and signed so many papers that were processed during the day and those papers were sent to the home office and within 10 days or so, the people whose name was on the papers would get the permit to come to England.</span> <span id="s456">That was Sir Otto Schiff, a -- a famous banker in London.</span></p> <p><span id="s457">Q: And wa -- why did his signature mean so much?</span></p> <p><span id="s458">A: He was appointed by the British to handle the immigration of the refugees.</span> <span id="s459">And he had to sign applications every day.</span> <span id="s460">And he had a very good secretary, Ruth Fellner.</span> <span id="s461">She came from Vienna and she prepared all the papers for him, and he came every afternoon, four or five o’clock to sign the papers.</span> <span id="s462">Without his signature the papers wouldn’t have done anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">Q: And how many people do you think were getting out, every day or every week because of that work?</span></p> <p><span id="s464">A: Ma-Maybe between 60 and a hundred.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: A week?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">A: A -- a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: A day?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s469">Maybe.</span> <span id="s470">Well, they -- they -- they spread all over London or Manchester or whatever.</span> <span id="s471">Wherever they had people they knew.</span> <span id="s472">It was a -- a -- a process, a daily process and th-there was lawyers involved and I go -- I got -- I handled a few cases, I had to hire a lawyer to put the applications in.</span> <span id="s473">And one of the lawyers liked me.</span> <span id="s474">He also was a refugee, but he must have been in London five years already.</span> <span id="s475">He was well-mannered, well-dressed and he says to me, I -- I need you.</span> <span id="s476">And he offered to help me.</span> <span id="s477">He says, I’ll give you some money every week, but you have to help me with my cases.</span> <span id="s478">So I watched his cases as they come in and I reported to him once a week and told him ho-how -- how they’re standing, when he can expect the recess.</span> <span id="s479">And he was very good to me.</span> <span id="s480">He gave me a few dollars every week and bought me a lunch.</span> <span id="s481">That was not legal, but he felt he needed me and I did help him.</span> <span id="s482">I helped quite a few other people to come to London.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: And something that I didn’t ask you about, you spoke English because you had learned it in school, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s484">A: Yeah, I had three years English in school, I was able to -- to con -- to converse and listen and have conversation, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s485">Q: Mm, that was fortunate.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">A: That was very fortunate.</span> <span id="s487">That’s why I was able to do things.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: And your parents, what did your parents do all day?</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: Na -- they couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s490">The -- cook three meals, two meals and walk around the neighborhood and do a little shopping.</span> <span id="s491">That’s all.</span> <span id="s492">They couldn’t -- they didn’t know English, they -- they didn't have money to do anything.</span> <span id="s493">You -- you -- you were marking time, if you know what that means.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s495">A: You -- from day to day you were hoping that some -- soon you will be able to leave and get away.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">Q: Now, when you came out and when they came out, what did you bring with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s497">A: Few clothes, fe -- necessary clothes.</span> <span id="s498">Wasn’t important.</span> <span id="s499">You were ready to go without anything worthwhile.</span></p> <p><span id="s500">Q: And did you -- were you able to bring money?</span></p> <p><span id="s501">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s502">T-Two dollars, three dollars.</span> <span id="s503">You weren’t able to bring any money, anything of value.</span> <span id="s504">Th-They searched you at the railroad station before you boarded your train.</span> <span id="s505">You couldn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s506">You weren’t allowed to leave any money -- the opposite.</span> <span id="s507">I was forced to pay 2,000 marks -- money to the Germans for -- for letting me go.</span> <span id="s508">There -- you couldn’t take anything.</span> <span id="s509">My father had money, couldn’t bring any dollar.</span> <span id="s510">You had to give it away to his family and so on before leaving Germany.</span> <span id="s511">Was -- was impossible to bring any money.</span> <span id="s512">They didn’t care.</span> <span id="s513">They -- they were just ready to steal everything so they didn’t want you to take anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s514">Q: Were there a lot of -- were there a lot of Jewish refugees in that part of London where you lived?</span></p> <p><span id="s515">A: Yes, there were -- there were quite a few Jewish refugees, yes.</span> <span id="s516">Who is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s517">A2: Your daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: Want me to stop for a second?</span></p> <p><span id="s520">A2: Hello.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Hi.</span> <span id="s522">[tape break].</span> <span id="s523">Okay, we’re going to roll again.</span> <span id="s524">I asked you about other Jews that had come to London, was there a big community of people there?</span></p> <p><span id="s525">A: Well, they were spread all over London.</span> <span id="s526">They -- there was one section northwest, Hampstead they call it, there were quite a few up there, and they were living all over, wherever they could find cheap accommodations.</span> <span id="s527">Couldn’t live in the west end.</span></p> <p><span id="s528">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s529">A: And everybody that came was hoping to have a -- relatives in America already to send them a few dollars to exist, cause nobody was allowed to work.</span></p> <p><span id="s530">Q: And when you got there, did you immediately make plans to go to America?</span></p> <p><span id="s531">A: Ye -- there’s nothing you could do.</span> <span id="s532">You -- you -- you had to sit and wait and do -- sometime in November, or -- yeah, in November, I got there in January -- November I got a letter from the American consulate in London that I should come and get my visa.</span> <span id="s533">So they -- they s -- that was the -- the consulate, not the embassy.</span> <span id="s534">But the consulate office was in the -- in the same building where the embassy was.</span> <span id="s535">So I went there on a Saturday morning and I got my visa.</span> <span id="s536">And when I had my visa I had to make arrangements for a boat to take me to New York.</span> <span id="s537">And you -- you go to the -- to the sh-ship -- C-Cunard line and they tell you this boat is leaving in a week or so and you can have it, but you have to buy a ticket.</span> <span id="s538">And the ticket in those days was, I believe, 30 pounds and I didn't have the money.</span> <span id="s539">And I didn’t want to take the last dollar from my parents, so I went around people I knew already, English people and I ended up collect -- collecting 30 pounds to buy my ticket.</span> <span id="s540">And wh-what I had was the -- the lowest room in the boat, on the -- way on the bottom, but it didn’t matter.</span> <span id="s541">It was wartime already, war started September first and I left the end of November.</span> <span id="s542">And we weren’t allowed on deck, the boat was all blacked out and everything, but we managed.</span> <span id="s543">We didn’t know if a submarine would hit us or not, because the submarines were out in the ocean already.</span></p> <p><span id="s544">Q: When you got your visa, what had you had -- what did you have to go through to get a visa?</span> <span id="s545">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s546">Nothing, just present my passport.</span> <span id="s547">They had the -- the papers that the man deposited 5,000 dollars in my name.</span> <span id="s548">He didn’t ask any more questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">Q: That was the relative from Omaha?</span></p> <p><span id="s550">A: Yeah, he -- I never was able to go and visit him and he never asked me to come.</span> <span id="s551">But I’m sure after he found I da -- was in America, he took his money back, probably.</span> <span id="s552">I didn’t get it.</span></p> <p><span id="s553">Q: So he had it on deposit in your name, that’s -- that was the procedure?</span></p> <p><span id="s554">A: What?</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: He would put that money on deposit?</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s558">A: That -- that was -- instead of an affidavit he -- he put the 5,000 in my name and -- and the consul recognized that.</span> <span id="s559">Maybe I should have taken it away from the bank, I don’t know, maybe I was too honest.</span></p> <p><span id="s560">Q: Do you remember when you came on the boat into New York harbor?</span></p> <p><span id="s561">A: Yeah, I remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s562">Q: Were you allowed to come up on deck at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s563">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s564">You were allowed to get up and get your little suitcase, whatever you had and get ready to -- to -- you had to go through customs and you had to go -- I forgot, you -- well, you already had a card that you could go to work from the consul in London, he gave you the blue card.</span></p> <p><span id="s565">Q: What time of day did you come into New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s566">A: 12 o’clock in the morning -- 10 o’clock.</span> <span id="s567">Twel -- the boat went up, you passed the Statue of Liberty and we docked about 11 - 12 o’clock.</span></p> <p><span id="s568">Q: What were you thinking at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s569">A: Well, it was freedom.</span> <span id="s570">St -- liberty.</span> <span id="s571">It was a beautiful feeling.</span> <span id="s572">You a -- you achieved something, accomplishment.</span></p> <p><span id="s573">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s574">And when you got off the boat, what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s575">A: Well, I -- I -- I put my head together, I took my luggage and I inquired the subway and I walked to 42nd Street where I finally was able to catch a subway to take to Long Island, because I had a cousin living in Jackson Heights.</span> <span id="s576">And I went there all by myself with my luggage and I got off at the right station and I went up and I knocked at the door, here I am.</span></p> <p><span id="s577">Q: Did they know you were coming?</span> <span id="s578">A: I think they had an idea, but they didn’t know when or anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s579">Q: What di -- what happened then?</span></p> <p><span id="s580">A: Well, they took me in.</span></p> <p><span id="s581">Q: Luckily.</span></p> <p><span id="s582">A: And -- and I stayed it -- a few days later I went to work in long -- in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: How did you get a job?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: I we -- I went -- I walked up and down Broadway looking for a job.</span> <span id="s585">I -- I had to start working to make some money.</span> <span id="s586">So I got settled down fast and I stayed there.</span> <span id="s587">I slept on the living room sofa.</span> <span id="s588">They didn’t throw me out.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: And what was it like those first few weeks there?</span> <span id="s590">What was it like for you?</span> <span id="s591">Were you happy, were you --</span></p> <p><span id="s592">A: I was very happy.</span> <span id="s593">I was free.</span> <span id="s594">I -- I was able to breathe fresh air.</span> <span id="s595">I don’t think it’s very -- it’s not easy to describe what happens those days, but I managed.</span> <span id="s596">That was 1939.</span> <span id="s597">America was in uproar then, the politics.</span> <span id="s598">Some wanted war, some wanted not to fight the Germans.</span> <span id="s599">You know, in Washington was no peace.</span> <span id="s600">Roosevelt already was president for the second term and they were fighting him and there was a lot of uproar in America.</span> <span id="s601">But you didn’t worry about that, you couldn’t change anything.</span> <span id="s602">You just watched it.</span> <span id="s603">But there were a lot of forces who wanted to side with Germany.</span> <span id="s604">That was another chapter.</span></p> <p><span id="s605">Q: Did you get involved in those discussions with people?</span> <span id="s606">A: No.</span> <span id="s607">I tried not to, because I was a guest -- well here I was not a guest any more, but I was very careful.</span> <span id="s608">I couldn’t -- I couldn’t get up in discussions what’s right and wrong.</span> <span id="s609">Was -- it was something and you -- you -- you had to lay low.</span> <span id="s610">But it was an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s611">Q: And what -- what work did you get there on Broadway?</span></p> <p><span id="s612">A: I worked in a department store in the stockroom.</span> <span id="s613">And we were t-tw -- twelve dollars a week for 48 hours, but it was -- it was money.</span> <span id="s614">You could live on it.</span></p> <p><span id="s615">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s616">A: I had to give my cousin eight dollars a week to fi -- to -- to eat and sleep there and I had four dollars to spend.</span> <span id="s617">Was all right.</span> <span id="s618">I didn’t starve.</span></p> <p><span id="s619">Q: And -- and you s -- made plans then to bring your parents, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s620">A: Well, the parents were -- were sitting in London waiting also to -- and they got a -- a month or six weeks later they got their visa to come to America.</span> <span id="s621">And they came on the same boat I came over.</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: And how did they -- did somebody put money in the bank for them?</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: No, they had to -- a -- a relative in Philadelphia who signed the affidavit for them.</span> <span id="s624">A -- a -- widow, very nice lady.</span> <span id="s625">I paid her a lis -- a visit a few years later.</span> <span id="s626">She was very generous.</span> <span id="s627">She paid -- she -- she -- she signed the papers, she didn't give them any money or anything, but she signed the papers to bring them here.</span></p> <p><span id="s628">Q: So when di -- when did they come?</span></p> <p><span id="s629">A: They came about six weeks after I came.</span></p> <p><span id="s630">Q: That fast?</span></p> <p><span id="s631">A: That fast, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: You were lucky, they were lucky too.</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Yeah, I -- and I was lucky to get out from England because the British were starting to take the refugees and sending them either to Canada or to Australia.</span> <span id="s634">They didn’t allow them to st -- to settle in England.</span> <span id="s635">In other words, they were all temporary.</span> <span id="s636">And they started to -- to send them out to their colonies, which they cou -- no one could refuse because they were just told to go -- to get on a boat and go.</span> <span id="s637">They didn’t have to buy a ticket or anything, the British government forced them to go, either to Canada or to Australia.</span></p> <p><span id="s638">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">A: And quite a few left when their visa didn’t come up as fast as mine came up, they went.</span> <span id="s640">They had to go.</span> <span id="s641">I knew -- then later on, some of those people came back to New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s642">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s643">A: We had la -- quite a few people like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s644">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s645">A: But at least they were free.</span> <span id="s646">That -- that’s another story.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: When your parents came, did they come to New York?</span> <span id="s648">Did your parents come into New York?</span></p> <p><span id="s649">A: Yeah, my parents came to New York and I picked them up and took them to the same apartment where I was.</span> <span id="s650">Yeah, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s651">Q: And they all -- and then all of -- and your sister, too, and brother?</span> <span id="s652">A: Yeah, they all -- they came and they went.</span> <span id="s653">They went to Baltimore because my older brother settled in Baltimore and I had aunt who had settled in Baltimore, the family settled in Baltimore, but I stayed in New York.</span> <span id="s654">I figured I’d try to make a go in New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s655">Q: You liked it?</span> <span id="s656">A: No -- no -- never regret it.</span></p> <p><span id="s657">Q: You like New York?</span> <span id="s658">You liked it?</span> <span id="s659">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s660">Q: You liked it right away?</span> <span id="s661">Did you like New York afa --</span></p> <p><span id="s662">A: Yeah, I liked New York.</span> <span id="s663">It was a -- a metropolitan city.</span> <span id="s664">I didn’t have money to see anything, but I liked it.</span> <span id="s665">It was -- after London comes New York.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Yeah [indecipherable] right.</span> <span id="s667">So your parents were in Baltimore and you were here.</span></p> <p><span id="s668">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: And you were working and did you get an apartment of your own?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: No.</span> <span id="s671">I stayed there til I was drafted.</span> <span id="s672">No, I didn't look for an apartment my own, I didn’t have enough money to even consider one and I didn’t need it.</span> <span id="s673">I was taken care of, and so I was da -- wa-was about two years and the war had started November -- December 7th, 1941, and we the -- we were drafted in 1942.</span> <span id="s674">I was drafted in -- it’s in the book.</span> <span id="s675">No, I think it was mo -- May -- May or June 1942.</span> <span id="s676">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s677">Q: And -- and what did you think when you got that notice?</span> <span id="s678">Were you happy, or did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s679">A: Well, I couldn’t fight it.</span> <span id="s680">I had to go, I was at the right age and I was healthy.</span> <span id="s681">And we had to contribute to win the war.</span> <span id="s682">That was all there was to it.</span> <span id="s683">You couldn’t fight it, you had to do your part.</span> <span id="s684">That’s how it started, and to -- we -- we were taken -- you -- you don’t know the routine they had in New York.</span> <span id="s685">You had to go to your draft board, then they took you over to Governor’s Island, which is way down Manhattan, and there they swore you in.</span> <span id="s686">Then they took you to Penn Station, you got on a train and they took you to Camp Upton, way ou -- way out near Riverhead.</span> <span id="s687">And there you changed into uniforms and you got a few tests and you send your clothes home.</span> <span id="s688">And that was the end of being your own boss.</span> <span id="s689">You got your three meals a day and you got medical examinations.</span> <span id="s690">You -- you got -- you were part of the army.</span></p> <p><span id="s691">Q: And by that time did you feel like -- did you feel like an American, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s692">A: Yes, well you were wearing the American uniform.</span> <span id="s693">You were a part of the system.</span></p> <p><span id="s694">Q: But did it feel odd to you?</span> <span id="s695">I mean, didn’t it feel iro --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: No, you felt you were better off being there than being in Germany in a concentration camp.</span> <span id="s697">So you felt good about it.</span> <span id="s698">And you -- yo-you grew up in the army.</span> <span id="s699">You -- you had to learn the slang wen -- language.</span> <span id="s700">You had to do a lot of things you weren’t used to, but you managed.</span></p> <p><span id="s701">Q: Okay, we’re going to switch tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s702">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s705">So you’ve -- you’re inducted into the U.S. Army?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: When was it?</span> <span id="s708">June of ’42?</span></p> <p><span id="s709">A: June of ’42.</span></p> <p><span id="s710">Q: And basic training, what was that like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s711">A: We trained out to la -- to Camp Upton.</span> <span id="s712">We stayed there four or five days to get uniform, to get all -- and certain tests and medical examination, that was -- you were in.</span> <span id="s713">You couldn’t -- you couldn’t run away any more.</span> <span id="s714">You had to send your civilian clothes home.</span> <span id="s715">Y-You were tol -- they told you, not allowed to wear civilian clothes any more.</span> <span id="s716">You -- you’re in for duration plus six months.</span> <span id="s717">So you don’t know duration was a month or a year or five years.</span></p> <p><span id="s718">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s719">Wow.</span> <span id="s720">When you went in, you said it was better -- you know, you prefer to be in the U.S. Army than to be back in Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s721">A: Right, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s722">Q: Did you know about concentration camps in Germany at that time?</span> <span id="s723">Did -- how much did you know about what was going on?</span></p> <p><span id="s724">A: We knew that Dachau had existed and the other camps, because you heard a lot about them.</span> <span id="s725">But you really didn't know what was going on til they finally put you in there and you experienced it.</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: After -- after you arrived.</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: But -- but -- but it -- that was a definite future for them, to use them and to punish people who were -- politically didn’t agree with them.</span> <span id="s728">In other words, people who were more t -- Communists or certain other tribes, they didn’t want them, so they put them in there and controlled them so they couldn’t undermine the Nazi government.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s730">A: That was one of the reasons they built the concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s731">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s732">A: Of course, then they used them to put the Jews in af -- especially after the war started and nobody could leave Germany any more, that was a -- a different story.</span></p> <p><span id="s733">Q: Now your -- your whole family got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">Q: But did you have other relatives who were not able to get out?</span></p> <p><span id="s736">A: Oh yes, I had uncles and aunts and cousins, they weren’t able to get out.</span> <span id="s737">They were -- they became part of the system that were destroyed, yes.</span> <span id="s738">You still got a few letters from them p-pleading with you to help them, but you couldn’t do anything, because first of all we had no money and they had no connections to make to -- to -- to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s739">It was -- it was desperate pleas for -- for them to come and look for help.</span> <span id="s740">I was a rare case that I was able to save my family.</span></p> <p><span id="s741">Q: It must have been hard to get those letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s742">A: It was hard to get the letters, yes.</span> <span id="s743">But th-th -- I had some, my father left some for me, it was heartbreaking, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s744">Even some I -- I had a couple of uncles where the son already was in America and he couldn’t do anything for them.</span> <span id="s745">He had no money and he had no -- no way of anybody signing an affidavit for them.</span> <span id="s746">It was -- and the war came very suddenly, when the borders were closed, if you know what I’m saying.</span> <span id="s747">And like I say to schoolchi -- a friend of mine, whose family was well-to-do with paintings and everything, he -- they couldn’t get out.</span> <span id="s748">They -- they were settling in Holland and nobody realized overnight Holland can be overrun and connected to Germany and there was no mu -- nobody allowed to leave Holland any more.</span> <span id="s749">And some people went into France and they were caught in France.</span> <span id="s750">You -- you don’t know what was -- what -- wha-what was right and wrong.</span> <span id="s751">It was impossible to plan anything.</span> <span id="s752">It’s -- it’s really hard to describe.</span> <span id="s753">And then there were a lot of American relatives who didn’t want to help and didn’t bend over to help.</span> <span id="s754">It’s -- you -- you don’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s755">You don’t know how lucky I was, besides saving myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s756">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s757">A: It’s hard to describe it.</span> <span id="s758">My -- my children always ask me questions about that, because they admired me, the way I was able to handle it.</span> <span id="s759">You read it -- you read it in the book, too.</span> <span id="s760">I was so lucky.</span> <span id="s761">And that’s why I felt I have to give back something, and I did my best in the army to do the right thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s762">Q: Let’s talk about your military service, cause you -- you went in in June of 1942, and where did you go for basic training?</span></p> <p><span id="s763">A: Camp Wheeler, Georgia.</span> <span id="s764">The -- th -- from Fort Upton they put you on a troop train, you don’t know where you’re going, but the train took you to Camp Wheeler near Macon, Georgia.</span> <span id="s765">And it was a big camp that was built up for that purpose and there is 90 days tough training.</span> <span id="s766">An-And -- but no matter what -- how tough it was, you couldn’t compare anything to remind you of the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s767">You had three good meals a day.</span> <span id="s768">It was hot during the summer, but you had to learn to live with the climate, but you managed and you knew it was i -- you were in for awhile.</span> <span id="s769">And from Camp Wheeler I was lucky, I met another friend who was good to me, Freddy Strauss.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: And who was Freddy?</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">Q: Who was Freddy Strauss?</span></p> <p><span id="s773">A: He -- he was an -- his mother was a distant relative of my mother, who came from New York and he was working in Cincinnati and he got drafted and he was in Camp Wheeler a few months before me and he was graduate from New York University, he al -- he al-already was a sergeant and he worked in a regimental headquarters.</span> <span id="s774">So I met him some -- some weekend, Saturday someplace and he took care of me.</span> <span id="s775">He started to take me to Atlanta for a weekend, he -- he took over.</span> <span id="s776">We had good meals in Atlanta, we -- we were like a -- like brothers.</span> <span id="s777">It was unbelievable that I as a trainee was allowed -- he went to the sergeant to get permission to take me and I already was a little bit elevated, if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s779">A: And we stayed friends all our lives.</span> <span id="s780">He passed away very young, in middle of 1955 or ’60.</span> <span id="s781">I still in touch with his three boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s782">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s783">A: Once I make a friendship, it lasts.</span> <span id="s784">They -- they just hang on to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s785">Q: And when did you -- Q2: Could you fix his sweater [indecipherable] on the left side.</span></p> <p><span id="s786">Q: On the left side?</span> <span id="s787">Okay.</span> <span id="s788">I’m going to f -- I’m going to fix your sweater, it’s kind of folded here.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">A: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">Q: There you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s791">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s792">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s793">That look good?</span></p> <p><span id="s794">Q2: Yes, perfect, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s795">A: Is it all right now?</span></p> <p><span id="s796">Q2: Yeah, it’s perfect, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s797">Q: That’s good, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s798">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s799">Q: So you’re in -- you’re in Georgia?</span></p> <p><span id="s800">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s801">Q: And when did you ship out for --</span></p> <p><span id="s802">A: 90 days.</span> <span id="s803">They took you on a truck to Macon, there’s a federal courthouse there and they took you in and the judge swears you in with all the other non-citizens.</span> <span id="s804">There was Italians, there was Greeks, they weren’t all Jews.</span> <span id="s805">And you get sworn in.</span> <span id="s806">After 90 days you become an American citizen.</span> <span id="s807">You didn’t have to wait five years.</span> <span id="s808">They figured -- this is the routine they took.</span> <span id="s809">They didn’t isolate us like they isolated the Japanese citizens and put them in camps.</span> <span id="s810">They gave us the privilege of becoming a citizen so they didn’t have to worry where we would have to go in the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: Did you know about the Japanese being interned in California at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: I may have read something in the paper, I don’t remember.</span></p> <p><span id="s813">Q: Did you ever have any fears or concerns that you would be --</span></p> <p><span id="s814">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s815">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s816">A: Once I was a citizen, I was equal.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: But before that, did you have any?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: Before that?</span> <span id="s819">Well, it was only 90 days.</span></p> <p><span id="s820">Q: No, but you had been in the country for a couple of years.</span></p> <p><span id="s821">A: Yeah, no, then you had your papers to stay.</span> <span id="s822">You were allowed to work.</span> <span id="s823">You --</span></p> <p><span id="s824">Q: But you -- you -- you were never --</span></p> <p><span id="s825">A: I was never in danger, no.</span> <span id="s826">I had papers --</span></p> <p><span id="s827">Q: Or fearful?</span></p> <p><span id="s828">A: -- to wait five years to become a citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s829">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s830">A: But I was never in danger of being arrested or deported or anything like that.</span> <span id="s831">While the Japanese, you know, they weren’t asked questions, it was just a government ruling to put them away.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s833">A: The government was nervous, that’s all I can say.</span></p> <p><span id="s834">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s835">A: Some of them became good soldiers, yo-you -- you understand what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: They didn’t ask for that isolation, but no, we had no problem.</span> <span id="s838">After 90 days you were sworn in, and that was full fledged citizen.</span></p> <p><span id="s839">Q: And then you went to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s840">A: No, they sent me to Augusta to another outfit.</span></p> <p><span id="s841">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s842">A: A regular fort infantry division that th-th-they -- they were filling the army divisions with the new recruits, so so many went here, so many went -- we were sent all over.</span> <span id="s843">I want -- went in a group to go to Augusta, Georgia, and I was put in the fourth infantry division.</span> <span id="s844">And there were problems, but you had to overcome it.</span> <span id="s845">I was a refugee, I was a Jew, I was a -- a Yankee.</span> <span id="s846">I was everything but as -- American.</span></p> <p><span id="s847">Q: To them.</span></p> <p><span id="s848">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s849">Hillbillies.</span> <span id="s850">Hillbillies, some of them, a lot of them had never seen a Jew, they thought that Jews had to grow horns.</span> <span id="s851">And it was a tough life for awhile.</span> <span id="s852">Eve-Even the officers, some of whom were regular army officers, some of them were reserve officers and then a little later came the young ones, the -- what we call the 90 day wonders.</span> <span id="s853">They were the college kids who were sent to some kind of a school in Fort Benning and after 90 days they got sworn in as a second lieutenant.</span> <span id="s854">They were mixed, from all over the country.</span> <span id="s855">But the old-time officers were not too friendly to us refugees.</span> <span id="s856">They were their own -- their own people and they -- they spent every year two weeks in the army reserve for two weeks training and they let you know that they are regular army people.</span> <span id="s857">Th-They felt differently.</span></p> <p><span id="s858">Q: And how many of you were there?</span> <span id="s859">How many refugees were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s860">A: I have no idea.</span></p> <p><span id="s861">Q: But, around the group that you were with, a lot?</span> <span id="s862">Th --</span></p> <p><span id="s863">A: I have no idea how many --</span></p> <p><span id="s864">Q: -- a few?</span></p> <p><span id="s865">A: -- I -- I don’t know how many Jews.</span> <span id="s866">I think we had in the fourth division, six percent Jews in the division, but how many of the Jews were refugees, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s867">It -- it -- we weren’t grouped as a group to associate with one another.</span> <span id="s868">There was too many different units that we were distributed.</span></p> <p><span id="s869">Q: And you didn’t seek each other out?</span></p> <p><span id="s870">A: We didn’t -- we me -- we met.</span> <span id="s871">There was a rabbi in the division and he held the service Friday night and we met maybe 20 - 25 boys there.</span> <span id="s872">But a -- but the-the-they were not refugees, they were Americans.</span> <span id="s873">So you met Jews, but you didn’t know exactly how many.</span> <span id="s874">But we always had the figure of about six percent.</span> <span id="s875">In other words, the division wa -- had about 14,000 people and there was supposed to be about six or 700 Jews amongst -- distributed between the officers and the men.</span> <span id="s876">It i -- it -- it was never an isolated group.</span> <span id="s877">We were always mixed in.</span> <span id="s878">And like I say, after awhile you were respected.</span> <span id="s879">But it was not easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s880">Q: What were some of the difficult things?</span></p> <p><span id="s881">A: Well, you were a minority, you were a refugee, which they all could understand and they just didn’t love you.</span> <span id="s882">When -- when it was time for a detail, they picked on you.</span> <span id="s883">You do this tonight, you do that.</span> <span id="s884">You had no choice.</span> <span id="s885">But sooner or later you grew up and you demanded more respect, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s886">Q: Did you get into fights with people?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: No, no, no.</span> <span id="s888">Never.</span> <span id="s889">No fights with anybody, because I wasn’t made to be a fighting man.</span> <span id="s890">But it was tough.</span> <span id="s891">And we had a rabbi, who was a -- a good man from the seminary and he had a tough job also.</span> <span id="s892">He was part in the chapel to have services Friday night and he had to go to the different regiments to maintain services, and he had to take the interest of the Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s893">It was part of his job.</span></p> <p><span id="s894">Q: So when -- when were you sent to England?</span> <span id="s895">When did you go to England?</span></p> <p><span id="s896">A: To England?</span> <span id="s897">I told you I went to England January 1939.</span></p> <p><span id="s898">Q: No, the second time --</span></p> <p><span id="s899">A: Oh, oh --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: -- the second time.</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: -- wi -- wi -- oh.</span> <span id="s902">That’s something else.</span></p> <p><span id="s903">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s904">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: The second time you went.</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: The army -- the army sent the fourth division from Georgia to Fort Dix, New Jersey, 16,000 men.</span> <span id="s907">In Fort Dix we were supposed to go to Africa to fight the war in Africa.</span></p> <p><span id="s908">Q: That’s what they told you?</span></p> <p><span id="s909">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s910">That’s why they sent us to Fort Dix, Fort Dix was near lu -- near Brooklyn where they loaded up the troops and sent them.</span> <span id="s911">While in Fort Dix they realized they had no facilities shipping to -- to handle us.</span> <span id="s912">So we couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s913">Marking time in Fort Dix, they -- then they sent orders and sent us to Florida.</span> <span id="s914">In Florida they sent us out in the wilderness.</span> <span id="s915">There is a wilderness in Florida, it’s west of sa -- Tallahassee.</span> <span id="s916">It’s on the Gulf of Mexico.</span> <span id="s917">They had little huts there, little barracks, they had floors, rattlesnakes crawling all over.</span> <span id="s918">And there we got our first taste of amphibious training.</span> <span id="s919">In other words, we were marked to partake in Europe at something special.</span> <span id="s920">So they gave us training, small old boats to go out on the gulf, and it -- it was there, Thanksgiving day 1943 and a storm came up and some of the boats turned over and a couple of fellows drowned.</span> <span id="s921">They didn’t care, they said, you got to be trained.</span></p> <p><span id="s922">Q: So you were practicing landing crafts.</span></p> <p><span id="s923">A: Yeah, broken down landing crafts, not the -- not the new ones.</span> <span id="s924">The navy was there, the coast guard was there, there was an island off the coast, it was called Dark Islands.</span> <span id="s925">The air force used it to put their bombs into certain buildings there.</span> <span id="s926">It was -- it was a rough training.</span></p> <p><span id="s927">Q: Was that near Panama City, or pen --</span></p> <p><span id="s928">A: Not too far away.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: -- Pensacola?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: Pensacola.</span> <span id="s931">Tallahassee.</span> <span id="s932">Apalachicola was the next town, if you know the neighborhood.</span></p> <p><span id="s933">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s934">A: It was 50 miles away from Tallahassee.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: 50 miles from Tallahassee.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s937">Anyhow, we stayed there from about September to November -- November, I believe.</span> <span id="s938">Three months or something for training.</span> <span id="s939">And they told you you can’t go home, you can’t get a furlough unless you know how to swim 50 yards.</span> <span id="s940">They had a pool there, you forced yourself to swim it so you get a furlough to go home.</span></p> <p><span id="s941">Q: Did you know how to swim before that?</span></p> <p><span id="s942">A: No, I didn’t, but they gave me a pass anyhow.</span> <span id="s943">Then they loaded us up again on a train and sent us to South Carolina, Fort Jackson.</span> <span id="s944">They -- I was home on furlough when the orders came, don’t come back to Florida, go to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.</span> <span id="s945">So I went there and we stayed there a month for more, what they call strip down and preparation.</span> <span id="s946">Then they shipped us up to New Jersey, Fort ca -- Camp Kilmer, near New Brunswick.</span> <span id="s947">There we had to stay two weeks to get our shots and our overseas equipment and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s948">And then we left early January.</span></p> <p><span id="s949">Q: Early January.</span></p> <p><span id="s950">A: Early January for -- for the s -- trip to lond -- to England, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s951">Q: Crossing the Atlantic in January.</span></p> <p><span id="s952">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s953">And the submarines were out there waiting for us.</span> <span id="s954">You had no choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s955">Q: Did you get fired on?</span></p> <p><span id="s956">A: No, n-no --</span></p> <p><span id="s957">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">A: -- no submarines deta -- was a convoy of about 50 boats and destroyers going around all the time, no, no submarine came, no.</span> <span id="s959">No nothing.</span> <span id="s960">We were lucky, that’s all, because pa -- prior to that they lost boats with troops [indecipherable] on the ocean.</span> <span id="s961">But we were -- we were lucky, nobody actually worried, because they needed us in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Were you excited to go?</span> <span id="s963">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: I couldn’t have.</span> <span id="s965">I want -- I’m glad I went to Europe and not to Pacific.</span> <span id="s966">That -- that feeling I had, because at -- at -- at least I knew I w -- I had a language and I -- I felt I belonged there.</span></p> <p><span id="s967">Q: Did you have a feeling that you wanted to fight Germans, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s968">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s969">Q: You did?</span> <span id="s970">A: Yeah, I had the feeling.</span> <span id="s971">And -- and my break came when they invited me for an interview to go up f -- division as an interpreter.</span> <span id="s972">And that’s when I got a job and I became a mensch.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">Q: When you got to England that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s974">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: When you got to England that happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: Yeah, but when I -- n-no, it happened in March, so it was about a month or two after coming to England that it happened, yeah.</span> <span id="s977">I have the dates down.</span></p> <p><span id="s978">Q: And why do you say that’s when you became a mensch?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: Well, you were with different people, you were doing different things.</span> <span id="s980">I -- I became a -- a Jeep driver, I became somebody that was important.</span></p> <p><span id="s981">Q: You had privileges?</span></p> <p><span id="s982">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s983">Q: You had some privileges?</span></p> <p><span id="s984">A: Yes, privileges, and wi-with a different group of people.</span> <span id="s985">You met officers who were ranking and educated and with entirely different life.</span></p> <p><span id="s986">Q: So you knew then from the spring, from March on, that you were going to be a translator.</span> <span id="s987">If you hadn’t been asked to do that, what would you have been doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s988">A: I have been -- I would have been fighting in the front line.</span> <span id="s989">Would have been one of the first to land on the beach.</span> <span id="s990">And th-the -- the beach we invaded was -- was wa -- lucky, th-they -- they practically walked across.</span> <span id="s991">And was -- was like -- not like a war time.</span> <span id="s992">E-Even Colonel Reider told me he was pulling flags out [indecipherable] and it means wor-worry they’re mines, but there were only flags, there were no mines in the ground.</span> <span id="s993">If there would have been mines, we would have had lots of casualties.</span> <span id="s994">But they didn’t -- either they didn’t have mines or they didn’t want them there.</span> <span id="s995">Rommel might have been da -- may have done it on purpose, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s996">He didn’t live long enough to tell us.</span></p> <p><span id="s997">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s998">When you -- when the invasion was launched, can you tell some stories about preparing yourself the night before -- but you knew you weren't going to go onshore with a gun like in a first wave.</span> <span id="s999">Did you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: No, y-you -- you were out on the water, on the channel for practically four days, because we loaded up on a Friday night and the boat pulled out to make room for another boat.</span> <span id="s1001">There were -- there were 5,000 boats to be loaded, and go out into the channel to prepare.</span> <span id="s1002">And it took time to load these boats, because you had to drive on your equipment, you had to pack it onto the boat so you could drive off.</span> <span id="s1003">Nothing was normal, everything was practically upside-down.</span> <span id="s1004">And in -- in the midst of everything, you looked up in the sky, where are the German planes?</span> <span id="s1005">You worried when they come out and put the bombs on you or anything like that.</span> <span id="s1006">And it didn’t come out.</span> <span id="s1007">And the weather, once we were out on the channel, the weather turned bad.</span> <span id="s1008">Was a big storm coming up, so they -- they decided they couldn’t land that day, on the fifth of June.</span> <span id="s1009">The -- the sea was too rough, they couldn’t unload or anything.</span> <span id="s1010">So they delayed it 24 hours, we were circling more on the water, worried, where are the German planes?</span> <span id="s1011">And they didn't show up.</span> <span id="s1012">So we were more than lucky that there was no interference for -- for the whole fle -- crew.</span> <span id="s1013">The British, the French, the American, everybody was calm.</span> <span id="s1014">And then, finally they decided if they don’t la-land the next day, they have to delay it another two or three weeks, because of the moon and the tide.</span> <span id="s1015">They were worried that it’s high water, to get the boats in closer.</span> <span id="s1016">So they decided to land as -- on June sixth.</span> <span id="s1017">The decision came 24 hours before, that Eisenhower made the decision, this is it, we have to land.</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">Q: Do you remember hearing that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: -- announcement?</span></p> <p><span id="s1021">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1022">So wa -- we were on the boat, the -- the captain of the boat had to know.</span> <span id="s1023">And in a way it -- we felt it was good to get it over with, because if it would have been another day, they would have had to turn around, put more fuel into the boats, because they were going to run low on fuel after circling four days out on the water.</span> <span id="s1024">So the -- June six opened it up, and there still was no German airplanes, which wa-was like a miracle.</span> <span id="s1025">And the German pilots had -- they had moved their -- their airplanes away from the front in France, way back to practically the German border, so they were confused also.</span> <span id="s1026">Rommel had gone home to visit his wife for that week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: It was her birthday.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1029">So, she cooperated.</span> <span id="s1030">[laughter] We should have given her a medal.</span> <span id="s1031">What are you laughing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1032">Q: Was -- so tell me when you personally went on -- on shore?</span> <span id="s1033">What do you remember about when you landed?</span> <span id="s1034">What did you -- what were you doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: I described it in the book.</span> <span id="s1036">I did nothing, I was -- my -- my Jeep was not allowed to be a part of the invasion fleet, it wasn’t deemed necessary enough for me to have it the first week.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">Q: You chief?</span></p> <p><span id="s1038">A: My Jeep, yeah.</span> <span id="s1039">I left it back in England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1040">Q: Your Jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">A: My Jeep, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1042">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: So I went without anything, just my personal equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1044">Q: And you were a translator, but who were you attached to?</span></p> <p><span id="s1045">A: Division -- division headquarters.</span> <span id="s1046">I wa -- I could be shifted around wherever they needed me, but I didn’t have my own Jeep the first two weeks because th-they couldn’t handle all the equipment so they left some transportation behind, and that came in two weeks later when -- when I got my own Jeep.</span> <span id="s1047">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s1048">Q: So when you -- on the first day, what did you do?</span> <span id="s1049">Did you have to translate?</span> <span id="s1050">A: I -- I stayed with my truck where we all were, and we moved inland about five, six miles and we started to eat supper and settle down a little.</span> <span id="s1051">We were eating the box K rations, what they used to call it, and it helped that -- we ate the same food aboard the ship.</span> <span id="s1052">The navy couldn’t feed us, they didn’t have the know-how or the time or the equipment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: What time of day did you go ashore?</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: About four -- five o’clock in the afternoon.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: And the invasion had started that morning?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: The morning, you -- nothing, you stood around and looked over and see if the airplanes are coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s1057">Q: No, but w -- the invasion had s -- already begun that morning, right?</span> <span id="s1058">And you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: Yeah, seven o’clock this morning -- in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1060">Q: -- and you came at five in the afternoon of the same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1061">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1062">The invasion started seven in the morning, clock-wise.</span></p> <p><span id="s1063">Q: Was there still gunfire, shooting going on in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1064">A: You heard gunfire, yes, yeah.</span> <span id="s1065">You had sh -- you had shells coming in and small arms fire, but yo-you -- you didn’t worry, you just went and hoped for the best, that’s all.</span></p> <p><span id="s1066">Q: So that was your first day in combat?</span></p> <p><span id="s1067">A: That was the first day in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s1068">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1069">A: Yeah, you passed, you looked, you read the report how Colonel Gaitling observed the first farmer, how they lead a comfortable life.</span> <span id="s1070">They didn’t know the war was going on.</span> <span id="s1071">You -- you can’t believe everything.</span> <span id="s1072">But it was un-unreal, if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1073">Q: Were you called upon -- okay, we need to take a break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1074">A: When I think back, I -- I -- End of Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1075">Beginning Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1076">Q: Okay, you got something on your lip.</span> <span id="s1077">There you go.</span></p> <p><span id="s1078">A: Wipe off the Chinese food.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">Q: Yes, that’s good.</span> <span id="s1080">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">A: Okay, and thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">Q: You’re welcome.</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Anything else not in order?</span></p> <p><span id="s1084">Q: No, it looks good.</span> <span id="s1085">It’s looking good.</span> <span id="s1086">When we stopped, you had s -- you were telling me about coming ashore in France --</span></p> <p><span id="s1087">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: -- in June of 1944.</span> <span id="s1089">You were a translator.</span> <span id="s1090">How long was it before you got to employ your translator skills?</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: Well, th -- it was either the first or second night, I went out on a patrol by myself and I captured a German soldier; he came out of the woods.</span> <span id="s1092">So I was able to talk to him, he was not really German, he was Czechoslovak, but he -- he knew German.</span> <span id="s1093">That’s when I started using it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1094">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1095">And after that experience, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s1096">A: After that you don’t know when you ran into something.</span> <span id="s1097">I was not in char -- in charge to interrogate prisoners.</span> <span id="s1098">They had special teams on each regiment called interrogation of prisoners of war.</span> <span id="s1099">They had at least three German speaking fellows there, in each team.</span> <span id="s1100">And they took care of the prisoners.</span> <span id="s1101">It was not my responsibility.</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">Q: What kinds of things were you doing?</span> <span id="s1103">What kinds of translation were you doing?</span> <span id="s1104">A: Well, I was doing a ch -- military government and division headquarters if they had problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s1106">And what -- and what would happen?</span> <span id="s1107">Would they call you and say we’re going someplace, we need you to come?</span></p> <p><span id="s1108">A: Yeah, an officer would say, let’s go here and there, that’s it.</span> <span id="s1109">And th -- and then I drove and he sat next to me and when we hit Germans, I talked f-for him and translated.</span> <span id="s1110">That -- that went on all -- all week, all day, every day something special.</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Sunday morning sometimes we went to -- we had to give them permission if they wanted a church service.</span> <span id="s1113">They weren’t allowed to gather without our permission.</span></p> <p><span id="s1114">Q: Who?</span></p> <p><span id="s1115">A: The Germans.</span> <span id="s1116">German civilians.</span> <span id="s1117">So one of the majors always said, let’s check the church service.</span> <span id="s1118">So I -- we drove over to the next village where the church was and went in.</span> <span id="s1119">And that service usually was nine o’clock -- eight o’clock, nine o’clock we went in and we sat in the back.</span> <span id="s1120">And I had to listen to what was going on and tell him.</span> <span id="s1121">So at the end they usually had three Ave Marias for their old people, for their children, for their sick people.</span> <span id="s1122">And when they were finished with that, I got up and I yelled, and one Ave Maria for our liberators.</span> <span id="s1123">And they didn’t like it, but they s -- they sa -- recited it.</span> <span id="s1124">And the major always said, very good, I like the way you did it.</span> <span id="s1125">We had to let them know we are watching.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: Did you -- did you go into Paris when Paris was liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1127">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1129">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: And --</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: My -- the fourth division liberated Paris.</span></p> <p><span id="s1132">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1133">A: We were -- we were hand picked for that beca -- I don’t know -- wa -- wa -- one of the reasons I know, there was a -- a-an -- an officer or a colonel, a very elegant fellow, he spent two years in Paris in the American embassy as military attaché before the war.</span> <span id="s1134">So he knew Paris inside-out.</span> <span id="s1135">So they told his regiment to be the leading regiment into Paris, because he knew every corner -- and I wa -- I was going to say, every elegant woman.</span> <span id="s1136">I think that may have been the reason th -- the for -- not th-the reason, but the regiment was picked as the leading regiment.</span></p> <p><span id="s1137">Q: Because of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">Q: Because of him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1140">A: Because of him, yeah.</span> <span id="s1141">You know, you -- you -- the average officer didn’t know anything about Paris and Paris was a blackout city, no streetlight, no other light, nothing.</span> <span id="s1142">It was daylight or -- or l -- or dark.</span> <span id="s1143">I was having my Major Fissette for three days, we were riding up and down Paris.</span> <span id="s1144">He had to take care of lots of things.</span> <span id="s1145">And they attached a French professor to us to -- to guide us, to help us.</span> <span id="s1146">So this professor, he -- he lived in Neuille, which is north of Paris, elegant sap -- elegant wife, but he would have to sleep home at night.</span> <span id="s1147">He wouldn’t a -- be able to sleep with us.</span> <span id="s1148">So at 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock at night, I had to drive through Paris in a blackout and -- with my major and bring him home.</span> <span id="s1149">And then come back to find our headquarters, which was in a zoo.</span> <span id="s1150">We were sleeping in the zoo in Paris, we didn’t go to the Ritz hotel.</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">Q: I bet you had -- every day was completely different, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1152">A: Every day was a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span id="s1153">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1154">A: E-Even when -- if the headquarters didn’t move, there was always something different to do.</span> <span id="s1155">And of course the first -- the first big challenge came when we hit Cherbourg, 20 -- 24 - 25 days after landing on D-Day.</span> <span id="s1156">That was the -- the first city that came -- that was liberated o -- the mayor may have come in --</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Okay, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1158">A: -- if I heard something.</span> <span id="s1159">And that -- that city was important because they needed the deep dock for the big boats to come in.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1161">A: And the freight and everything.</span> <span id="s1162">So into Paris -- in-into Cherbourg, I was alone, I had no officer with me.</span> <span id="s1163">So I drove in and I -- I didn’t speak French, a few words, and I decided -- I checked myself into the German military hospital.</span> <span id="s1164">I figured some of the bi-big Nazi bastards may put bandages on, or cl -- or -- or -- legs or arms or something, and give themselves up as soldiers so they wouldn’t get arrested.</span> <span id="s1165">But I -- I couldn’t find any in the hospital under that duration, and the smell in that hospital was impossible.</span> <span id="s1166">So after an hour or so I checked out.</span> <span id="s1167">I couldn’t -- I couldn’t find anybody and I didn't -- couldn’t stay any longer, th-the smell -- they had dead people, they buried them in the backyard, and it was miserable.</span> <span id="s1168">So I checked out and I went to the Hotel Atlantic where the division had set up headquarters and I put a blanket on the floor in the lobby and I slept there for a few hours.</span> <span id="s1169">General Roosevelt was -- had been appointed commanding officer of the Cherbourg area.</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">Q: Did you know him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">A: I met him, but I didn’t know him, but Major Fissette worked with him for -- for -- lived with him for three, four months.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: This was President Roosevelt’s son?</span></p> <p><span id="s1173">A: The first president’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1174">Q: Yes, Teddy Roosevelt’s son.</span></p> <p><span id="s1175">A: Yeah, Teddy -- Teddy Roosevelt, yeah.</span> <span id="s1176">The first president’s son.</span> <span id="s1177">He wa -- he was -- what can I say, he was all hepped up to be there.</span> <span id="s1178">He already had fought in Africa and he came to the division.</span> <span id="s1179">They assigned him to help the fourth division and he loved it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1180">Q: Let me ask you this.</span> <span id="s1181">Because you were -- knew the German language and because you grew up in Germany, do you think that you had insight into German soldiers or German movements, or German military operations in any way that was helpful?</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">A: No, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t help the military because I wasn’t supposed to talk to capt -- to -- to prisoners.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">Q: But -- but did you have knowledge of how things worked?</span></p> <p><span id="s1184">A: I had knowledge if I could -- could sit down with them and question them, but I wasn’t supposed to do this, I had to stick to my headquarters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1185">Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1186">A: Because they had special guys in each regiment who were supposed to -- to stick to these soldiers and try to get them to talk and find out.</span> <span id="s1187">That’s why one of the fellows in the 22nd infantry hit a German soldier and he -- he claims, if you give me a map, I’ll show you exactly where Rommel’s headquarters is.</span> <span id="s1188">So he opened up a map and the guy really pointed it out, it was a certain chateau in a small village.</span> <span id="s1189">And that information they gave to the air corps and within a few days they bombed the road leading to the headquarters and Rommel was driving on that road and was wounded very badly.</span> <span id="s1190">He was unconscious for a week.</span> <span id="s1191">Of course, they didn’t know he wanted to be our friend.</span> <span id="s1192">So it shows you what can happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1193">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1194">I want to go back to Paris.</span> <span id="s1195">Any other -- did -- any other good stories from anything that happened to you in Paris?</span> <span id="s1196">How long were you there?</span> <span id="s1197">A: No, I was there three days with a Major Fissette.</span> <span id="s1198">We were together day and night.</span> <span id="s1199">We closed whore houses, we -- we did all kinds of crazy things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1200">Q: Like what?</span> <span id="s1201">Can you remember some of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">A: I have -- I have to read up the book or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1204">A: I -- I know what -- three days we ran at -- back and forth at day -- daybreak and at night to -- to north of Paris to bring the professor home and pick him up in the morning.</span></p> <p><span id="s1205">Q: Were there very many Germans in Paris at that time or had they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1206">A: There were some -- mayb -- I would say between 10 and 15,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s1207">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1208">A: They were -- most of them were taken prisoners and they wanted to be taken prisoners by the Americans because the free French wanted to kill them.</span> <span id="s1209">So they’d rather offered themselves to the Americans to feel more secure.</span></p> <p><span id="s1210">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1211">And after Paris, where did you go?</span> <span id="s1212">That was in the late summer of 1944, right?</span> <span id="s1213">August?</span></p> <p><span id="s1214">A: That was in June -- i-in s -- August 24.</span> <span id="s1215">August 25th Paris was liberated.</span></p> <p><span id="s1216">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1217">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1218">Q: And where did you after that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1219">A: North into Belgium.</span> <span id="s1220">We were in Belgium about s -- about September first, probably.</span> <span id="s1221">I have the history.</span></p> <p><span id="s1222">Q: And it was in the low countries that you met Ernest Hemingway, is that right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1223">A: Ernest Hemingway, we -- he already was in Paris, but I didn't meet him.</span> <span id="s1224">He came in practically before the American soldiers.</span> <span id="s1225">He had his own little army and he was able -- he spoke French, he was able to go wherever he wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1226">He had a Jeep for himself and he had another Jeep for si -- five or six or eight French volunteers from the FFI who protected him and did everything we wanted him -- he was like a general.</span></p> <p><span id="s1227">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1228">A: He was -- militarily he was a big -- a man of lots of experience, and he went in division headquarters, he was allowed into any office, anything, and the generals asked him sometimes for his opinion.</span> <span id="s1229">And he also carried a gun.</span> <span id="s1230">He wasn’t supposed to, but he carried a gun.</span> <span id="s1231">He was nearly thrown out from Europe for that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1232">Q: And where did you meet him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1233">A: I met him the first time in Germany when we liberate -- when we evacuated that town where -- where you have those pictures over there, pu [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1234">It was dec -- September 16th or something we met, and when we evacuated the town, he came in with John Rose tos -- together.</span></p> <p><span id="s1235">Q: An artist, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1236">A: And that’s when he -- when he -- [indecipherable] sat in a bay window and drew pictures all -- nobo -- not talking to anybody, and Hemingway was snooping around for wine, for whiskey.</span></p> <p><span id="s1237">Q: Did you talk with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1238">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1240">A: I wa -- I one time asked him how he made out with the two famous women, Ingrid Bergman and Marla Dietrich.</span> <span id="s1241">He said, I couldn’t touch them.</span> <span id="s1242">[laughs].</span> <span id="s1243">I had guts to ask him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1244">Q: So you knew who he was, he was famous by that time, you knew who he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">A: Oh, he was very famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1246">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1247">A: You could see his -- his build, his uniform.</span> <span id="s1248">He wor -- he wore a German fur lined jacket, a sh -- a sheepskin jacket.</span> <span id="s1249">He wore a big belt.</span> <span id="s1250">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1251">He captured that in an African wars from a German officer.</span> <span id="s1252">You could spot him a mile away.</span></p> <p><span id="s1253">Q: Flamboyant.</span></p> <p><span id="s1254">A: Beard most of the time.</span> <span id="s1255">But very, very humble, very low key and very high class mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s1256">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1257">A: He -- he was a -- and he was liked and they all wanted him to be attached to them.</span> <span id="s1258">So he happened to choose the fourth division, he spent three, four months with us --</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: -- without moving.</span> <span id="s1261">They gave him enough [indecipherable] they gave him enough -- whatever he wanted to drink, they created for him.</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: So, did he spend that winter with you, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Winter -- winter of ’44 - ’45 he was with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Yeah, he was with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: So you saw him regularly?</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: Yeah, he went home i -- I think in January ’45, I think he went home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1268">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1269">A: He had enough.</span></p> <p><span id="s1270">Q: It was a tough winter.</span></p> <p><span id="s1271">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1272">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1273">A: Then he went home to -- I -- I don’t know whether he went to Cuba or whether he went to the -- to Florida, the beach, where he had a house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: And what -- what -- what was the winter like for you?</span> <span id="s1275">What wa -- what kinds of things di --</span></p> <p><span id="s1276">A: It was cold, miserable, snow, rain, everything.</span> <span id="s1277">And then of course was the counterattack from the Germans, December 16th, and that was no picnic for us.</span> <span id="s1278">Was very tough.</span> <span id="s1279">I -- I must tell y -- te-tell you a story.</span> <span id="s1280">We were in Swiya -- in bl -- in Zweifall, a German town, a small town, two, maybe two, 3,000 [indecipherable] south of Aachen.</span> <span id="s1281">Th-The battle of the Huertgen forest, I have the story in German if you want it, I can give you.</span> <span id="s1282">And there, we were in the -- in the town, and it was miserable.</span> <span id="s1283">Water in the foxhole, fog, snow, everything.</span> <span id="s1284">And they made me go out in the morning, eight o’clock to the next -- a big farm, to get milk for the children in the town.</span> <span id="s1285">So every morning I drove out and I got a couple of cans of milk.</span> <span id="s1286">And one time a woman says to me, she wants to talk to an officer.</span> <span id="s1287">I said, I’ll bring you an officer.</span> <span id="s1288">So next morning I said to Fissette, I said, there’s a woman out there on the -- on the ranch, she wants to talk to an officer.</span> <span id="s1289">He says, I’ll go with you.</span> <span id="s1290">So I took him there and I showed him the house.</span> <span id="s1291">I -- I knew she talked English so I didn’t bother going in with him, I sent him in, and he talked to her.</span> <span id="s1292">She asked him if he knew a Major Collin.</span> <span id="s1293">So he said, yes, I know a Major Collins, he is General Collins now, he’s a corps commander, he’s right here in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s1294">Well, she told him her name, I have it written down, ma -- phone so and so.</span> <span id="s1295">He was -- he was her boyfriend in World War I.</span> <span id="s1296">She was looking for him.</span> <span id="s1297">[laughs] You -- you laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">Q: That’s crazy, wow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1299">A: See what a war can do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1300">Q: People are people, huh?</span> <span id="s1301">Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1302">A: So -- so Fissette fixed him up, he -- he -- he made sure the general goes and meets and looks up the old girlfriend.</span></p> <p><span id="s1303">Q: Now, during this time in -- in -- in the -- the winter, you were still translating all the time, did you ever have to fight in a --</span></p> <p><span id="s1304">A: No, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1305">Q: You never did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1306">A: No, the only time I shi -- I was doing a little shooting in Paris.</span> <span id="s1307">I was on a bridge and they were shooting down from a high-rise building and I took my gun and shoot back at them.</span> <span id="s1308">But yo -- I didn’t see anybody, but everybody else was shooting, so I was shooting also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1309">Q: Again you were lucky, huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1310">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1311">Q: Again you were lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1312">A: I was lucky, yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1313">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1314">A: Because I -- I -- I -- I tell you something, I was careful.</span> <span id="s1315">I didn’t stick my neck out when I didn’t have to, because I didn’t see -- I couldn’t see my being shipped home in a box to my father.</span> <span id="s1316">So I did not take any special dangerous missions.</span> <span id="s1317">One time word came around they looking for a German speaking fellow.</span> <span id="s1318">The Germans had demanded that an American pe -- ma -- officer come over and look at an area where there’s a prisoner of war camp so they wouldn’t shoot and kill our own prisoners.</span> <span id="s1319">So I said to myself, it’s not my day.</span> <span id="s1320">You know it, sometimes you wake up in the morning, you have that feeling.</span> <span id="s1321">I took my Jeep and went out hiding for a few hours.</span> <span id="s1322">I figured, this is not for me today.</span> <span id="s1323">Because sometimes if they hit a Jew, they can kill him and to send back and [indecipherable] he was in an accident, or something.</span> <span id="s1324">So I didn’t go that day.</span> <span id="s1325">That afternoon I felt this is not for me.</span> <span id="s1326">I went into hiding for a few hours and then I come back and then I found out they had an officer in one of the regiments, lieutenant something, and they sent him over.</span> <span id="s1327">But he came back all right with the information.</span> <span id="s1328">You know, sometimes you wake up with a feeling, and -- and you have to take care of yourself.</span> <span id="s1329">Another time, when we broke out from Normandy, I was up in a villa -- in an -- in a -- in a town, was just taken.</span> <span id="s1330">There was still fighting there, Saint-Pois, it was right in Normandy.</span> <span id="s1331">And I -- I drove into town like a big shot, and the officer, Captain Walker says to me, get the hell out of here, you have no business being here.</span> <span id="s1332">I was ready to put up proclamations for the -- for the French people.</span> <span id="s1333">So he says, get out.</span> <span id="s1334">So I turned around and I got out.</span> <span id="s1335">I figured if the mayor -- major throws you out, you’re out.</span> <span id="s1336">I went back.</span> <span id="s1337">Next day, I had -- th-the town was taken and I came back with my proclamations.</span> <span id="s1338">And the town was on a little hill and it had -- when you go up it had like an S curve in order to get there.</span> <span id="s1339">So on my way up to the town, I see a Jeep blown up.</span> <span id="s1340">I passed this, and I said to myself, I don’t know what happened.</span> <span id="s1341">When I got up into the town and th -- the regiment from the 22nd infantry was right next on the outskirts, one of the fellows, he knew me, he says, got bad news for you.</span> <span id="s1342">He says, your friend, Feinberg, whatever his name was, was killed last night.</span> <span id="s1343">I said, he was on patrol on a Jeep?</span> <span id="s1344">He said yes.</span> <span id="s1345">I said, I passed the Jeep.</span> <span id="s1346">So I said nothing to -- the bodies were torn to pieces, four of them.</span> <span id="s1347">I said no-nothing and I felt -- I [indecipherable] I was on the road the day before and nothing happened, so I figure the Germans came in during the night, put mines in the road.</span> <span id="s1348">Because that Jeep was hit with a mine.</span> <span id="s1349">So what can -- I could do nothing, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1350">I just had bad news.</span> <span id="s1351">He was a very smart fellow and we were friends, in a way.</span> <span id="s1352">Anyhow, coming home from the war, about -- must have been six, eight years later, I said to myself, I’m going to Brooklyn to visit the family.</span> <span id="s1353">The -- the least I can do.</span> <span id="s1354">Th-Then -- I started out on a Sunday afternoon to go to Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s1355">I had the address.</span> <span id="s1356">Halfway down I said to myself, if I tell them the truth, they’ll be hurt, if I lie to them, they don’t let me go til I break down and tell them the truth.</span> <span id="s1357">I turned around and went home.</span> <span id="s1358">If you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1359">That’s feelings.</span></p> <p><span id="s1360">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1361">Tell me about when -- what -- when the war ended, in April --</span></p> <p><span id="s1362">A: When the -- I was in the hospital when the war ended.</span></p> <p><span id="s1363">Q: Before we -- before we go on, can you sit up a little bit?</span> <span id="s1364">Because when you lean down I can’t see your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1366">Q: Okay, when you lean over like that, I can’t see your face.</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Oh, okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1368">Q: Okay?</span> <span id="s1369">We want to see your face, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1370">A: Okay, you want me to move a little closer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1371">Q2: No, no, no, no, no, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1372">Q: You know what -- you know -- are you with me on that?</span> <span id="s1373">I don’t want him to have -- have to feel so uncomfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Is it -- are you comfortable sitting up?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: I’m comfortable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1377">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1378">A: I just can hear you better when I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1379">Q: Okay, well I’ll try and remember to talk louder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">Q: I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s1382">I don’t -- I just don’t want you to -- I want -- I want us to see your face, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1383">A: Wait a second, let me wipe my --</span></p> <p><span id="s1384">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1385">A: I try to help you.</span> <span id="s1386">[tape break] Go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s1387">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1388">April -- where -- where were you in April?</span> <span id="s1389">When the war ended, where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1390">A: I was in a hospital in Dijon, France, I believe, because I had an o -- in April I had an appendix attack, and I turned myself in-into infirmary and they -- they -- the infirmary couldn’t know much, they were not equipped for it, so they send me to another hospital, another hospital and the -- that la -- the ‘nother hospital sent me down on a troo -- on a hospital train to Dijon, France, which was a general hospital.</span> <span id="s1391">And there they decided I don’t need the operation, I just need a few days rest.</span> <span id="s1392">So I was in that hospital and the guy in charge, the doctor in charge was a -- a -- a big drunk.</span> <span id="s1393">I do -- he came from Detroit, he was a major, but I could see no -- no future.</span> <span id="s1394">He gave me about 40 pills to take in one day, and he just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1395">I think he was filled up with liquor all the time.</span> <span id="s1396">Anyhow, they finally let me go, three weeks later or something.</span> <span id="s1397">And when you go in the hospital you lose yourself.</span> <span id="s1398">You can’t pr -- you can’t take a gun in with you, you can’t take a knife in with you because they are very cautious that -- people go crazy, you -- you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1399">So the -- all that they take away from you.</span> <span id="s1400">Well anyhow, they discharged me and I got a troop train up to cher -- into Germany.</span> <span id="s1401">Worms, a city near the Rhine.</span> <span id="s1402">And that was what’s called a replacement depot.</span> <span id="s1403">And I was in there waiting to get assigned.</span> <span id="s1404">Meanwhile the war had ended, and I forgot to tell you, the fourth division, in October ’44, General Marshall came over to France and he made the speech in division headquarters, I wasn’t there.</span> <span id="s1405">He said, some of you boys will have to go to Japan when you finish the war here.</span> <span id="s1406">So what can you do?</span> <span id="s1407">You’re part of the division, division goes, you have to go.</span> <span id="s1408">Anyhow, I didn’t -- I wasn’t too anxious to go back to the division, so they assigned me to six army group in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1409">From the -- from Worms, I was sent to Heidelberg and I joined -- I was in there, I was driving a Jeep, I was going on a few trips with an officer.</span> <span id="s1410">And I had, from civilian life I had a friend who was stationed in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1411">He worked for the signal corps.</span> <span id="s1412">So I looked him up and we were friends, we were together and so on.</span> <span id="s1413">So sure enough, in June the division was sent home, ready to redo -- regroup and go to Japan.</span> <span id="s1414">They had no choice, General Marshall selected them.</span> <span id="s1415">Yeah.</span> <span id="s1416">Ye-Yeah.</span> <span id="s1417">They took out the German speaking fellows and left them in Europe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1418">Q: Uh-huh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1419">A: They figured they’re no good in Japan.</span> <span id="s1420">Anyhow, that’s what happened, so I stayed in Europe, and I got myself another assignment.</span> <span id="s1421">That’s when I went to another replacement and took off and went to my hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1422">Q: Now, tell me that story.</span> <span id="s1423">Sit up -- sa -- can you sit up -- Q2: No, before you -- we would like to change tapes before --</span></p> <p><span id="s1424">Q: Oh, we’re going to change -- End of Tape Four</span></p> <p><span id="s1425">Beginning Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1426">Q: -- in the role that you had, you had a lot of autonomy.</span></p> <p><span id="s1427">A: I?</span></p> <p><span id="s1428">Q: You si -- it seems like you had a lot of autonomy while you were in the service.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1430">Q: I mean, you -- you were able to -- you had a -- you did a lot of things on your own.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1432">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1433">A: I did.</span> <span id="s1434">I had a Jeep.</span></p> <p><span id="s1435">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1436">A: And I was -- I was not scared, I was courageous.</span> <span id="s1437">I would go out on a patrol, I -- if I don’t have -- i-if I didn’t have to drive an officer, I still went out and looked and see what I can do.</span> <span id="s1438">I-It’s in the book, one time I picked up two officers that were shot through the arm.</span> <span id="s1439">There’s always something coming up you could do.</span></p> <p><span id="s1440">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1441">Now let’s tell the story now about how you ended up going back to your hometown.</span></p> <p><span id="s1442">A: I went back to my hometown the first time I was stationed in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1443">I said to the captain, I need a Jeep and I want to go and visit my hometown.</span> <span id="s1444">He gave me a pass and the Jeep for a day -- for a day and a half.</span></p> <p><span id="s1445">Q: This was in the summer?</span></p> <p><span id="s1446">A: That was in the summer, yeah.</span> <span id="s1447">That was in May a -- probably in June.</span> <span id="s1448">And I drove there and I-I went in.</span> <span id="s1449">I -- I -- I visited a good farmer that I knew was no Nazi and I felt safe to go in and w-we had some lunch and he was glad to see me, he couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1450">So I stayed there and I went to the military government in Ochsenfurt and I told that captain who I am, and I said, I’d like to come and work for you.</span> <span id="s1451">He says, I need you.</span> <span id="s1452">And he was so pepped up, he got into his Jeep and followed me in my Jeep to Heidelberg --</span></p> <p><span id="s1453">Q: Because he wanted --</span></p> <p><span id="s1454">A: -- which was about two to three hour drive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1455">Q: Because he wanted you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1456">A: Yeah, he wanted me.</span> <span id="s1457">And he -- he followed right behind me and he went into the same captain who gave me the Jeep, he says, I need this man.</span> <span id="s1458">And the captain says, I can’t let you have him.</span> <span id="s1459">Just like that he -- he denied it ca -- ca -- I think it was Captain Friedman.</span> <span id="s1460">Anyhow, that was it, so a few days later Captain Friedman says to me, I want you to go out, I need some wine.</span> <span id="s1461">I want you to go and get me a couple of hundred bottles of wine.</span> <span id="s1462">I said, give me a Jeep, I’ll get your wine.</span> <span id="s1463">So I drove down to Mannheim and I see a sign, winery and I went in and I tell guy, I need some good wine.</span> <span id="s1464">He says, I have it.</span> <span id="s1465">He opened up cobblestones in his courtyard and he pulled out a couple of cases of Moselle wine.</span> <span id="s1466">I took 200 bottles, and I paid him a nickel a bottle.</span> <span id="s1467">I didn’t steal it.</span> <span id="s1468">And after that the captain says to me, I’m supposed to tell you the colonel said he never drank wine like that.</span> <span id="s1469">I said, you tell him he’ll never get it again like that.</span> <span id="s1470">And that miserable captain didn’t even say to me, take a bottle for yourself, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1471">I didn't need it, I always had a bottle of wine when I needed one.</span> <span id="s1472">Anyhow, then a-all of a sudden the order came transferring me to a replacement near Frankfurt.</span> <span id="s1473">So I figured this is -- I’m getting away from that captain.</span> <span id="s1474">So I went to Frankfurt, but now -- but -- but now [indecipherable] Hamburg, where the replacement office was and I checked in.</span> <span id="s1475">And when I walked out in the building, my friend Colonel Gaitling walks in the street.</span> <span id="s1476">He had come back from aus -- he had come back from somewhere and was ready for re-assignment.</span> <span id="s1477">So he says, come up to my office, I want to talk to you.</span> <span id="s1478">He had a -- a private room, a -- a major or a colonel gets treated well.</span> <span id="s1479">So I went up to his office, he’s -- tried to hand me a bottle of cognac.</span> <span id="s1480">He says, I want you to come with me, I’ve become security officer in Linz, which was Austria.</span> <span id="s1481">I said, Colonel, as much as I like to go with you, but I won’t -- I have a de -- I have a desire to go to my hometown and take care of things.</span> <span id="s1482">He says, if you feel that way, you go and I get you some other time.</span> <span id="s1483">So next morning I pack my bundle and I go to the information -- no-not information office, the -- the -- the communication office where they handled the mail and so on.</span> <span id="s1484">I said to the guy, a -- e -- a -- are you going out into Germany with your distributings, your mail?</span> <span id="s1485">He says yeah.</span> <span id="s1486">I says, can I come along?</span> <span id="s1487">He says yeah, sit in the back of the Jeep.</span> <span id="s1488">So I had my bundle with me, nothing but a -- in those days you had a ha -- half a duffel bag full.</span> <span id="s1489">A set of underwear, and shoes, nothing much.</span> <span id="s1490">So I sat, and within two hours we were at the very place I wanted to go.</span> <span id="s1491">And I checked in with the captain, I said, I’m here to stay, unofficially.</span> <span id="s1492">No --</span></p> <p><span id="s1493">Q: Where --</span></p> <p><span id="s1494">A: -- no papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s1495">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1496">A: In Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s1497">Q: But --</span></p> <p><span id="s1498">A: No papers, no nothing, I just packed and left.</span> <span id="s1499">I didn't go in the office and tell them nothing.</span> <span id="s1500">I figured, if they find -- if they want me, they’ll find me.</span> <span id="s1501">So I went in and I started working.</span> <span id="s1502">The captain was very happy, I had -- I knew people, I knew information, I knew what was going on.</span> <span id="s1503">So I worked there and I stayed there and nothing happened until about September first.</span> <span id="s1504">Then all of a sudden they sent an order for me to go to Austria.</span> <span id="s1505">I said no more, I had enough.</span> <span id="s1506">I packed my bundle and I went into the next hospital and I told them I feel sick, I’m out.</span> <span id="s1507">And they -- they take me to another hos-hospital and then I got a hospital with a nice Jewish doctor from New York and he says, I’m going to send you home.</span> <span id="s1508">I said, I appreciate it.</span> <span id="s1509">I took him out for -- w-we went back to where I was stationed, I poured some wine for him.</span> <span id="s1510">I had place where the German army had le-leather saddles from the horse ho -- from the cavalry days, and I gave him a -- I opened up the door, I said here, you take yourself a couple -- he had the horse in Central Park at the time, for the wife to ride.</span> <span id="s1511">So I gave him a couple of saddles, he was out of this world.</span> <span id="s1512">Brand new leather saddles, if you know what I’m talking about.</span> <span id="s1513">So anyhow, he sent me home.</span> <span id="s1514">It took two, three months, but I got home on the hospital ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1515">Q: When was it that you went back to your hometown, and wer --</span></p> <p><span id="s1516">A: That was when I -- after I went to the -- to the military government, that’s when I took the time out to go to the hometown and arrest these fellows, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1517">Q: Well, tell me those stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1518">A: Those [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1519">Q: So you -- you told me before that you went to your town for one night.</span></p> <p><span id="s1520">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1521">Q: And then --</span></p> <p><span id="s1522">A: But that was just to acquaint myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s1523">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1524">Then what did you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1525">A: Then -- then when I packed from the replacement depot and got myself a ride with the chief to go, I went for good.</span></p> <p><span id="s1526">Q: To your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1527">A: To the town, to the mili -- military government.</span> <span id="s1528">I slept in their quarters and I worked for them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1529">Q: And what town was that in?</span> <span id="s1530">What town was that in?</span></p> <p><span id="s1531">A: Ochsen -- Ochsenfurt.</span></p> <p><span id="s1532">Q: Which was just close-by to your hometown?</span></p> <p><span id="s1533">A: Yes, it was four kilometer.</span></p> <p><span id="s1534">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1535">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1536">That’s where I settled down.</span></p> <p><span id="s1537">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1538">A: For about six, eight weeks, maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1539">Q: Okay, so in that six or eight weeks then, you went back to your village.</span></p> <p><span id="s1540">A: Yeah, that -- that’s the story written up in the Times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1541">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1542">A: They did a good job.</span></p> <p><span id="s1543">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s1544">But you have to tell me that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1545">A: I -- I -- I started to work there and whatever I -- I -- the captain gave me assignments, do this, do that and do all kinds of things.</span> <span id="s1546">And these people in the military government, they were, in my eyes not good soldiers.</span> <span id="s1547">They were not brought up like -- like we were in the infantry, like real spit and span good soldiers, they --</span></p> <p><span id="s1548">Q: The military government was there to oversee like the occupation.</span></p> <p><span id="s1549">A: To oversee the rebuilding of the German system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1550">Q: Right, it was not the same as the m-military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1551">A: Yeah, yeah, it’s -- it’s part of the military.</span></p> <p><span id="s1552">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1553">A: They wore the uniform, but they were civil service workers, schoolteachers, all kinds of professions, but they were not military --</span></p> <p><span id="s1554">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1555">A: -- to be out fighting and winning a war.</span></p> <p><span id="s1556">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1557">A: They -- they -- they did their own life.</span> <span id="s1558">They were a little bit different from us.</span> <span id="s1559">We all -- us old soldiers, we all felt the same way.</span> <span id="s1560">They -- they took two hour lunch breaks and they lived like kings and the war was over for them, they had all the time in the world to straighten out, to -- what they -- their how -- their main job was to check civilians, who was a party member, who had to be denazified, who had to be sent away to a camp or something.</span> <span id="s1561">That was their main job, and then they started recruiting people to start, if they didn’t belong to the party, to become a -- a lawyer or a j -- court judge or a civil service job to rebuild Germany.</span> <span id="s1562">They had to ra -- to make sure the electric was rebuilt, the railroads were rebuilt.</span> <span id="s1563">Everything was in shambles.</span> <span id="s1564">Nothing was working.</span> <span id="s1565">Because when you fight a total war in your own home, then everything gets destroyed.</span> <span id="s1566">It’s -- it’s under -- you cannot describe it.</span> <span id="s1567">Unless you have seen it and lived through it, you -- you cannot imagine what it is to be in a city, no light, no streetlight, th-the sidewalks was fu-full of sha -- garbage from the bombing, from the walls.</span> <span id="s1568">You can’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1569">And they had to clean up themselves, the Americans were not there to clean up the rubble for them.</span> <span id="s1570">They had to clean it or else it would still be laying.</span></p> <p><span id="s1571">Q: So you were working for the military government in Ochsenfurt?</span></p> <p><span id="s1572">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1573">Q: And did you get assigned to go back to your town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1574">A: Yeah, I had a Jeep there, I was allowed to go anyplace I wanted to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1575">Q: So how did you get to the point where you went back to arrest people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1576">A: Well, wa -- after I worked there for awhile, I figured it was time to -- to look for these fellows.</span> <span id="s1577">And I inquired, I had a German policeman who helped me get the names together, and then I had the names of about 10 or 12 of them.</span> <span id="s1578">And I decided it’s time for me to pick them up and put them in the jail, and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s1579">Q: How did you do this, on what -- did you have some orders that allowed you to do this, cause --</span></p> <p><span id="s1580">A: I cou -- I -- I couldn’t do it as an -- I could do it as an American soldier, but they didn’t commit a crime against the Amer-merican soldier, they committed a crime about civilian -- against civilian people.</span> <span id="s1581">So I was allowed to arrest them and put them into jail.</span> <span id="s1582">But then it was supposed to be that the Germans take over, but there were no Germans in office yet to do that.</span> <span id="s1583">So when I left -- when I re -- was ready to go into a hospital to -- not to have to go to Austria, I let them sit in the jail, but the captain finally got their confessions and he had to do something about them, so he -- he kept the confessions and he let them out to go home.</span> <span id="s1584">And I haven’t heard from it since, except when this fellow wrote the book 20 or 30 years later, he got from the court the papers what happened to them in 1948.</span></p> <p><span id="s1585">Q: How did you find them?</span> <span id="s1586">Were they all living there in that town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1587">A: They were all living there.</span> <span id="s1588">There were some of them that ha -- that were fighting in the war in Russia and hadn’t come back, but the ones I found were all living there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1589">Q: And -- and did you confront them personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s1590">A: I didn’t arrest them, I tra -- I made the German police arrest them and put them into jail.</span> <span id="s1591">And then first I had to change the warden in jail because he was a Nazi, I couldn’t trust him.</span> <span id="s1592">So I had to kick him out and put a new man in.</span> <span id="s1593">Otherwise, he would have let them go anyhow.</span></p> <p><span id="s1594">Q: And did you just stay in your town for --</span></p> <p><span id="s1595">A: I stayed in the town.</span> <span id="s1596">And then I -- I visited a fr -- another friend of mine in my village.</span> <span id="s1597">I had visited him ri-right after I got there and a little later after I arrested them, I paid him a visit and he warned me.</span> <span id="s1598">He said, be careful, they’re after you.</span> <span id="s1599">So I -- I got the message that they were ready to do something to me, so I changed my habits.</span> <span id="s1600">I stayed in at night, I put a German police in front of the entrance, and I didn’t let anybody come in without knowing who they are.</span> <span id="s1601">I was very, very careful, because I had a good warning.</span> <span id="s1602">And if they want to do away with you, they had the power and the weapon to do it.</span> <span id="s1603">So I was very careful, because my life was important to me at that stage.</span></p> <p><span id="s1604">Q: How long did it take you to get all of these men rounded up, arrested?</span></p> <p><span id="s1605">A: Oh that -- that was a few hours, that’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1606">Q: Really?</span></p> <p><span id="s1607">A: Really.</span> <span id="s1608">That was nothing, that was within -- I think they were -- they marched them down to the prison.</span> <span id="s1609">I don’t think we supplied a Jeep or anything.</span> <span id="s1610">Only the one guy I arrested in my village, him I put on a Jeep because it was four or five kilometer to the -- to the jail.</span></p> <p><span id="s1611">Q: So it took you weeks to find everybody, is that why you were there that long?</span></p> <p><span id="s1612">A: No, I took my time.</span> <span id="s1613">I -- I -- I took my time.</span> <span id="s1614">I figured that they can’t run away, and it took me awhile to decide, and I -- I didn’t tell the captain when I was doing it, because he might have stopped me, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1615">There was certain things you had to do on your own, because when you asked too many questions, you get too many answers and too many problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1616">Q: So they were all -- they were all arrested on the same day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1617">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1618">They were all arrested within an -- two hours, all of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1619">Q: And where were you at that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1620">A: I was in my office.</span></p> <p><span id="s1621">Q: You knew what was going on at that moment?</span> <span id="s1622">A: I knew what was going on, yeah.</span> <span id="s1623">And I went right away to the -- to the man in charge of the jail, I said no visitors, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1624">They get 15 minutes to walk in the courtyard in the afternoon and that’s it.</span> <span id="s1625">I said, no packages in, no packages out, I gave him strict instructions, the way we were treated a few years before.</span> <span id="s1626">I -- I was the boss.</span></p> <p><span id="s1627">Q: And how were -- did you feel good about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1628">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1629">Q: Were you feeling good about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1630">A: Yes, I was feeling good about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1631">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1632">A: The Americans would have never arrested them.</span> <span id="s1633">I felt very good about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1634">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1635">A: I -- I feel this is th-the golden opportunity.</span></p> <p><span id="s1636">Q: And did -- did people in the town respond in any way?</span> <span id="s1637">Other people in the town?</span></p> <p><span id="s1638">A: Well, th-the people in the -- the relatives came to my office.</span> <span id="s1639">I didn’t let them in, but they all tried lo, he wasn’t so bad, let him home.</span> <span id="s1640">I said -- I didn’t ackn -- I ignored everything.</span> <span id="s1641">I didn’t listen to anybody.</span> <span id="s1642">I felt, let them know I’m the boss.</span> <span id="s1643">It’s -- it was good feeling.</span></p> <p><span id="s1644">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1645">A: A-And for what I went through, I deserved to be -- to -- to show them where the bo -- who the boss is.</span> <span id="s1646">They never expected this to happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s1647">Q: By that time were there any Jews left in your village?</span> <span id="s1648">A: No, no Jews came back from my village.</span> <span id="s1649">There were some Jews i-in the big city, Würzburg, who had come back, whom I knew from before, and I helped them, I went there at night sometimes to bring them some food or something.</span> <span id="s1650">I bought hundred pounds of flo -- white flour from a mill to bring to them so they could bake some cakes and so on.</span> <span id="s1651">That was a different life, that was not -- not part of my mission, that was human -- humanitarian.</span></p> <p><span id="s1652">Q: And by this time, in the summer of 1945, people knew about the concentration camps --</span></p> <p><span id="s1653">A: Oh yes, by that time they were --</span></p> <p><span id="s1654">Q: -- all of that was public information by that time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1655">A: -- they were already opened and overrun and publicized.</span> <span id="s1656">Oh yeah, they knew.</span> <span id="s1657">In April they overran the first concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1658">I never -- one of the officers said to me, I want to go to Munich and pass the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s1659">I says, I was in there once, I don’t want to see it.</span> <span id="s1660">Th-They wanted me to -- to drive with them I ref -- I refused, I just didn’t need it -- necessary to go back.</span> <span id="s1661">Another guy, he says -- o-oh, one guy says, I need a ca -- every officer’s supposed to have a German car for the weekends when they went socializing.</span> <span id="s1662">So he says, can you find me a car?</span> <span id="s1663">I says, give me a little time, I’ll find you a car.</span> <span id="s1664">I snooped around and I found a beautiful red Mercedes in a vil -- in a town, covered with straw, was hidden away.</span> <span id="s1665">So I told him, we pulled it out.</span> <span id="s1666">The roof had collapsed for over the years with the weight, so I told him I have a mechanic in my village, he can fix it.</span> <span id="s1667">And we put a battery in, we drove the car out and fixed it, and then when the car was fixed he says to me, I’m going to make the first trip to Garmisch where Hitler’s headquarters was.</span> <span id="s1668">You want to come with me?</span> <span id="s1669">I said no thank you.</span> <span id="s1670">[laughs].</span> <span id="s1671">I -- I went to Nuremberg to pick up my friend Raul whose letter is in your book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1672">Q: When -- when those 11 men we-were priso -- imprisoned in your village, what happened to them after --</span></p> <p><span id="s1673">A: They ca -- th --</span></p> <p><span id="s1674">Q: -- ho-how long did you stay there?</span></p> <p><span id="s1675">A: The captain let them go.</span> <span id="s1676">He didn’t have charges against them, he -- they didn’t do anything the Americans.</span> <span id="s1677">So he let them go but the papers must have gone to court that they were tried in 1948, which is about three years later.</span> <span id="s1678">By that time I guess the Americans had built up the German court system enough to handle something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s1679">Q: Waha -- when he let them go, how did you respond to that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1680">A: Wa -- who --</span></p> <p><span id="s1681">Q: When he let them go?</span></p> <p><span id="s1682">A: I didn’t -- he didn’t ask me, I was gone.</span> <span id="s1683">I was on my way home.</span></p> <p><span id="s1684">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1685">A: He didn’t ask me, he didn’t have to ask me, he could do what he wanted.</span> <span id="s1686">Bi -- I -- y-you [indecipherable] when he sent me to the hospital to get quinine tablets, and I played dumb.</span> <span id="s1687">I says, I need a -- a -- a -- a -- a piece of paper telling me to get this, so he signed it for me, and you know what happened to the quinine tablets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1688">Q: Well, I know because I read the book but you should tell the story.</span> <span id="s1689">You need to tell the story for the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s1690">A: Yeah, ta -- th-the -- the nun in charge gave me the tablets and she explained to me how they should be used.</span> <span id="s1691">The -- the girl should sit -- the -- the girl had to be pregnant to take them.</span> <span id="s1692">She should sit in a bathtub with a few inches of water, and practice like riding a bicycle before -- and take the tablets before, and that might help to have like an abortion.</span> <span id="s1693">So I gave it to him with the instructions from the nun.</span> <span id="s1694">But I had it in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1695">Q: So that’s an indication to you of what kind of men these were, these military government officers were.</span></p> <p><span id="s1696">A: Yeah, they didn’t care.</span></p> <p><span id="s1697">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1698">A: They -- they weren’t allowed to fraternize with German women.</span> <span id="s1699">It was still forbidden.</span> <span id="s1700">Eisenhower had three months where no one was allowed to touch German women, so they carried Holland women with them when they came from Holland to Germany, so they were not in bru -- had no problems.</span></p> <p><span id="s1701">Q: And the women just stayed with them in their quarters?</span> <span id="s1702">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s1703">Q: The women just stayed with them in their quarters?</span></p> <p><span id="s1704">A: I don’t know where they put them up, I didn’t look at -- I didn’t check, it didn’t bother me.</span> <span id="s1705">They must have put them up someplace.</span></p> <p><span id="s1706">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1707">A: But they carried their own women from a different country, so they couldn’t be brought up on charges.</span> <span id="s1708">There was ways of doing things.</span></p> <p><span id="s1709">Q: So when you left Germany, you thought those men were all in prison.</span> <span id="s1710">They were in prison then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1711">A: When I left Germany, them -- I think they were still in prison, yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s1712">And I couldn’t care less, I didn’t want to stay around and wait til the German court system was strong enough to take care of everything.</span> <span id="s1713">But th-the -- the papers I made him sign, he must have kept on his desk and eventually give them to the German court system.</span></p> <p><span id="s1714">Q: You made all of those men sign confessions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1715">A: Each one I made sign a confession what he did the night of Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s1716">Yeah, I made the -- I did that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1717">Q: And was one of those 11 men wi -- had one of those people come to your parent’s house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1718">A: Did one of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1719">Q: Did one of those 11 men --</span></p> <p><span id="s1720">A: Yes, they were all there.</span></p> <p><span id="s1721">Q: Were they among the ones that came to your parent’s house and destroyed your house?</span></p> <p><span id="s1722">A: Ye-Yes, they were all -- they were all there in my parent’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1723">Q: Do you know which one it -- oh, all 11 of them?</span></p> <p><span id="s1724">A: Yeah, I think so.</span> <span id="s1725">I also must show you -- how -- how -- how long is this wire?</span> <span id="s1726">Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s1727">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1728">A: Ah, I forgot something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1729">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1730">A: While I was visiting a good German, and -- who was happy to see me, and he went into a room and he came out with a little suitcase.</span> <span id="s1731">And he said, I got something for you.</span> <span id="s1732">He handed me this and this.</span> <span id="s1733">These were -- these were items that were used in the synagogue.</span> <span id="s1734">This is for the wine cup, and this is a spice box with a candle on it that was used Saturday night to end the Sabbath.</span></p> <p><span id="s1735">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s1736">Let me have this paper, let me have this paper.</span> <span id="s1737">You hold that up a little bit, hold that up a little bit.</span> <span id="s1738">Little higher.</span> <span id="s1739">Can you hold it up higher?</span> <span id="s1740">There you go.</span> <span id="s1741">That’s okay, this is okay.</span> <span id="s1742">Okay.</span> <span id="s1743">And he gave those to you?</span> <span id="s1744">And he had saved them?</span> <span id="s1745">Where did he --</span></p> <p><span id="s1746">A: He had saved it.</span> <span id="s1747">I don’t know how he got.</span> <span id="s1748">And with it was an old book, 300 years old, a memorial book from the congregation.</span> <span id="s1749">That he gave me also, it was three items, and I treasured them.</span> <span id="s1750">I treasured them because I felt that was worth the honor to bring them home.</span> <span id="s1751">And I did bring them home, and of course I showed them to my father and i-i-it wa -- it was heartwarming to -- to see -- to get something like this.</span> <span id="s1752">And I -- I w -- never would want to give it away because I felt I deserved it.</span> <span id="s1753">To make the trip and spend two, three years in hell, I mean at least I deserve this, and I -- it should go into a museum, but I feel I let my daughters decide what they want to do with it.</span> <span id="s1754">I will not give it away.</span> <span id="s1755">I cleaned it, I polished it.</span> <span id="s1756">This is silver, this is I don’t know, but --</span></p> <p><span id="s1757">Q: And when you brought those back -- when you came back and you went to see your parents, did you go straight to see your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s1758">A: No, I came back on a hospital ship and I was put in a hospital on Staten Island.</span> <span id="s1759">They were -- all the patients went there, it was called Halloran General Hospital.</span> <span id="s1760">And after being in there a day they tell you you can go home for 30 days.</span> <span id="s1761">So they gave me a 30 day pass, that’s when I went home and so -- start seeing people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1762">Q: And when you went back home, were you able to tell stories right away or did you not want to talk?</span></p> <p><span id="s1763">A: Well, it was emotional.</span> <span id="s1764">You didn’t -- you couldn’t talk, everything was -- too much happened in four years.</span> <span id="s1765">In order to split out everything, and I was very slow, and you -- you were not yourself yet, you had to calm down slowly.</span> <span id="s1766">And th -- all of a sudden you wanted to see ma -- more people that you knew, and you were proud that you came back.</span> <span id="s1767">And so it didn’t -- it didn’t go that easy.</span> <span id="s1768">It was very emotional, but I made it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1769">Q: Were you eventually able to tell your father and mother what you had done, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1770">A: Yeah, eventually I was able to tell them, slowly.</span> <span id="s1771">But I already had told -- I already had told them a lot in letters, because after the war ended, I was able to write home in German.</span> <span id="s1772">And I could write every night or something and s -- tell them what has happened and so on.</span> <span id="s1773">So they knew a lot more already from my letters.</span></p> <p><span id="s1774">Q: And before the -- while the war was still going on you couldn’t write letters that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1775">A: You c -- they couldn’t read English, so I -- that was no s -- a -- a -- I couldn’t write in German because it had to go through a censor.</span> <span id="s1776">So I couldn’t communicate the way you normally communicate.</span> <span id="s1777">That only opened up when the war ended.</span> <span id="s1778">Next day was no more censor.</span> <span id="s1779">That went for the news reporters also.</span></p> <p><span id="s1780">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1781">Okay, we need to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1782">End of Tape Five</span></p> <p><span id="s1783">Beginning Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s1784">Q: -- Congress --</span></p> <p><span id="s1785">Q2: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1786">Q: -- they’ve got everything, but they -- goodness knows who can find it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1787">A: But you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1788">That book is also very valuable.</span></p> <p><span id="s1789">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1790">So you came back -- you came back in the fall of 1945?</span></p> <p><span id="s1791">A: Yeah, but when I came back --</span></p> <p><span id="s1792">Q: You’d been in the service --</span></p> <p><span id="s1793">A: -- I came back it was, I think December ’45 and I had a 30 day fa -- furlough and then I had to go back to the hospital and they decided I was suffering -- besides the hearing I was suffering from arthritis for sleeping eight, nine months on the wet ground and the doctor had diagnosed it and they flew me to Hot Springs, Arkansas for 30 days to take the hot bath.</span> <span id="s1794">Hot Springs, Arkansas was the spa for polio people, and the army, navy had a big general hospital there and they went -- I went there for 30 days to take the bath and it cured me of the arthritis.</span> <span id="s1795">And after that they tent -- they -- they tried to get rid of me to sign out, I said no, I want to help -- I need some help with my hearing.</span> <span id="s1796">And they sent me to a hospital in oklaho -- in Oklahoma, called Borden General Hospital, which was for -- for n-nose, eyes and ears.</span> <span id="s1797">And over there they looked at me, they can’t help much.</span> <span id="s1798">I said, yeah, but I’m here.</span> <span id="s1799">So they also wanted to discharge me.</span> <span id="s1800">I says, I’m not taking a discharge unless you give me a medical discharge.</span> <span id="s1801">Nothing doing.</span> <span id="s1802">So a week later, some young doctor from Saint Louis, fellow looked like 30 years old, one night says to me, tomorrow morning if you come to this room they’ll be a board meeting and I can get you your medical discharge.</span> <span id="s1803">I said, Dr., it’s a deal.</span> <span id="s1804">So I got dressed my uniform, and I appeared and they passed it that I got a medical discharge.</span> <span id="s1805">I wanted a medical discharge because I didn’t want to go to Korea, I didn’t want to go to Vietnam.</span> <span id="s1806">So with a medical discharge I was safe.</span></p> <p><span id="s1807">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1808">A: I figured I’d put in enough time.</span> <span id="s1809">So that’s how I happened, and that’s when a few -- a year or two later they gave me a 10 percent pension for the hearing.</span> <span id="s1810">Which is -- I didn’t fight, I just took it and left them alone.</span> <span id="s1811">Now y -- now you know the story.</span></p> <p><span id="s1812">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s1813">And I know it’s hard to -- and that was -- that was 1945 - ’46, early 1946, and you know, here we are now 60 years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s1814">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1815">Q: And you’ve just written this book about your experience.</span> <span id="s1816">But I know that you’ve also been back to your hometown a couple of times.</span></p> <p><span id="s1817">A: Oh yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1818">Q: And during one of those visits you were asked to speak to the gathered people.</span></p> <p><span id="s1819">A: Yes, they -- they rebuilt the synagogue to -- like a museum and they dedicated it and they invited us to come and partake at the ceremony.</span></p> <p><span id="s1820">Q: Who was invited?</span></p> <p><span id="s1821">A: Me, my brothers from Israel, my brothers from Baltimore.</span> <span id="s1822">They invited all the people they could find who -- who were related to the village one time.</span> <span id="s1823">So we went there and that was already -- the guy who wrote the book about the history, he already had finished the book.</span> <span id="s1824">And a couple of -- a week or two before, they celebrated the dedication of his book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1825">Q: This is the book about the Jews from --</span></p> <p><span id="s1826">A: Yeah, Jews in the village, so I was -- I was invited to that celebration and this fellow had quite a few students from the university come, and a couple of professors, was a little affair.</span> <span id="s1827">And so I stayed for the other celebration and I found out they didn’t invite me to say anything.</span> <span id="s1828">So I-I got upset and I had a conference with this author of his book, what I could do.</span> <span id="s1829">And he wasn’t invited to say anything either, so he says, put your foot down just before and tell Dr. so and so, if he doesn’t give you a chance, you’re going to boycott the affair.</span> <span id="s1830">And I did, and he said, we allow you to say something.</span> <span id="s1831">That’s when I stood up and dashed it out to them in German and in English.</span> <span id="s1832">And they didn’t like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1833">Q: Can you summarize for me what you said that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s1834">A: Y-Yes.</span> <span id="s1835">I said, th-the people you destroyed suffered in the worst way possible.</span> <span id="s1836">None of you stood up to help them.</span> <span id="s1837">I -- I -- I -- I really dished it out very strongly.</span> <span id="s1838">And there were a couple of news reporters, they shook my hands afterwards and congratulated me.</span> <span id="s1839">The people didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1840">Wa -- the priest sent me a letter afterwards, how dare I was to accuse his people of something they had nothing to do with.</span> <span id="s1841">I -- I told him, they were there and they could have helped people.</span> <span id="s1842">And that was it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1843">Q: Mm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1844">A: And as a matter of fact, the -- the Germans were in a building and had machines going to record it.</span> <span id="s1845">And the Americans, NBC was there to record it and the Americans gave me -- the NBC gave me the tapes to take home when I flew home a week or so later.</span> <span id="s1846">And they told me, when you go through the airport, try not to go through the machines, it might destroy them.</span> <span id="s1847">So I passed the tapes outside and when I got to New York I delivered them to NBC.</span> <span id="s1848">About 10 years later the girl from the German station is -- called me in and she says, I got those tapes.</span> <span id="s1849">I said, I’ll take them.</span> <span id="s1850">But I couldn’t play them, their system was different from the American system.</span> <span id="s1851">So I brought them home, three or four tapes, cassettes like yours, and about, I guess eight or 10 years ago, when I got busy with working at Leo Beck, I told them I got some tapes.</span> <span id="s1852">They’re -- they’re very strong, I -- I gave it to them.</span> <span id="s1853">I would have loved to listen to them, but they never invited me down and I never reminded them, but they have them.</span></p> <p><span id="s1854">Q: Leo Beck Institute.</span></p> <p><span id="s1855">A: Leo Beck Institute, because they wanted the history of the German speaking Jews who were chased out of Germany.</span> <span id="s1856">We keep that Leo Beck going.</span> <span id="s1857">And it is a very historic documents they have.</span> <span id="s1858">I gave them a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s1859">They wanted old letters, old photographs, everything.</span> <span id="s1860">They take whatever I could give them.</span> <span id="s1861">That’s how they exist.</span> <span id="s1862">And so now -- now that’s your competition.</span> <span id="s1863">You -- you are -- your museum is only what, 15 years old?</span> <span id="s1864">I know that, I know.</span> <span id="s1865">Wh-When it was first opened, my army outfit had a reunion in Virginia, not far from the museum, and before the reunion I wrote the boys from the fourth division who run the reunion, I said, the museum is opened.</span> <span id="s1866">I’d like for you to get 50 tickets for us to go and see it.</span> <span id="s1867">And they wrote and they got 50 tickets.</span></p> <p><span id="s1868">Q: Great.</span></p> <p><span id="s1869">A: So come Saturday morning, a couple of officers I knew, friends from Colonel Reider, they cornered me.</span> <span id="s1870">We want you to take us to the museum.</span> <span id="s1871">I said, all right, I want to go too, so we go together.</span> <span id="s1872">I think we rode the subway over.</span> <span id="s1873">And going in, you had to go up to the fourth floor and work your way down.</span> <span id="s1874">So they see a -- a big window with shoes and they ask me, what does this mean?</span> <span id="s1875">Yo-You understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1876">They were Christians who had no idea what went on in the camps or anyplace.</span> <span id="s1877">So I spent three hours with them, going through the museum.</span> <span id="s1878">I was new myself, I mean, I knew the rail trucks up on the shelf -- you understand what I mean?</span> <span id="s1879">But I devoted my time to them.</span> <span id="s1880">And they thanked me and we went back to the hotel and ate lunch.</span> <span id="s1881">So now -- so now you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1882">Q: Yeah, well, can I ask you to --</span></p> <p><span id="s1883">A: It was -- that was I -- an early vis -- an early visitor in the museum, unknown --</span></p> <p><span id="s1884">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1885">A: -- if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s1886">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1887">A: But these fellows had no idea.</span> <span id="s1888">They were not o-openly received, there was no one to explain to them.</span> <span id="s1889">And I didn’t know the museum that well, I only knew from what I read and what I saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s1890">Q: Oh.</span> <span id="s1891">When you came back -- when you were back in the States and -- and you were here in New York and you had a business and you were starting to -- you got married and you had a -- raised a family here.</span> <span id="s1892">Did you study a lot about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1893">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s1894">Q: I know that in the 60’s and 70’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s1895">A: -- I didn’t have time --</span></p> <p><span id="s1896">Q: -- people didn’t talk much about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1897">A: -- I -- I needed all my energy to b -- run and build my business.</span> <span id="s1898">That was important to me, I wanted to be successful and I devoted [indecipherable] in my life to the business, until I was a little -- I was more affluent when I was about 65, and then I started traveling.</span> <span id="s1899">My business was slow from December 15th to January fifth.</span> <span id="s1900">The hospitals had parties and they had no room for me and I was able to go to Switzerland for a week, or go to Israel to visit my brother.</span> <span id="s1901">And that’s when I developed socially, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s1902">But during the early years in life, you did not recall the Holocaust so much.</span> <span id="s1903">You did not recall what you did, you didn’t -- you didn’t even feel like talking about it sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1904">Q: But you -- you attended synagogue, your raised your children to be religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s1905">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1906">Q: And among your friends was there much talk --</span></p> <p><span id="s1907">A: Well, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1908">Q: -- or were you one of those people who didn’t want to talk but other people did?</span></p> <p><span id="s1909">A: I -- I didn’t try to talk because like -- like I told you, Colonel Reider said, I -- I -- I is not the word.</span> <span id="s1910">Yo-You understand?</span></p> <p><span id="s1911">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1912">A: And I was very reluctant to speak about it.</span> <span id="s1913">I slowly explained something to my children.</span> <span id="s1914">I -- I did go to army reunions once a year, and when I walked in the hotel -- I usually went Friday mornings or Sunday afternoon.</span> <span id="s1915">And when I walked in the boys looked at me, here comes Dr. Kissinger.</span> <span id="s1916">And I said, but I’m not playing with the same girls he’s playing with.</span> <span id="s1917">It must have been the accent that they got reminded.</span></p> <p><span id="s1918">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1919">A: You know, in those days he was famous.</span></p> <p><span id="s1920">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1921">A: So the boys always reminded me, here comes Dr. Kissinger.</span></p> <p><span id="s1922">Q: During those years, did it ever surprise you how little people knew about Jews in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1923">A: How many people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1924">Q: How little people knew about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1925">A: I think they all knew a little.</span> <span id="s1926">I think they all knew.</span> <span id="s1927">They didn’t want to admit to it that they -- they played holy, holy, holy, as innocent.</span> <span id="s1928">That goes for the -- for the Pope in Rome and all the Cardinals and all the Bishops.</span> <span id="s1929">If they didn’t know they were not human beings.</span> <span id="s1930">They must have known what went on but they were scared and they didn’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s1931">Th-th-the Pope su-supported the criminals and sent them to South America to save their lives.</span> <span id="s1932">I want to know -- I want to send my b -- the Pope is coming next week to Washington, did you know that?</span></p> <p><span id="s1933">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1934">A: He’s get -- being wined and dined at the White House.</span> <span id="s1935">I want to find a way to send him my book.</span> <span id="s1936">I -- I even called last night my friend who runs Der Speigel.</span> <span id="s1937">I want to know if he as a news reporter is invited somewhere where he can hand him my book.</span> <span id="s1938">He is a friend of mine, he was here for a day to -- to tape me.</span></p> <p><span id="s1939">Q: And when -- when was it that you started to get interested in writing a book, and why did you want to write a book?</span></p> <p><span id="s1940">A: Well, the -- why?</span> <span id="s1941">Well, I -- fr-from what my daughters tell me, I was loaded with information.</span> <span id="s1942">I -- I was a -- a walking library, they used to say, which was true.</span> <span id="s1943">I observed and I observed, and I didn’t write it down, but I kept it.</span> <span id="s1944">And they -- they started hinting me why I don’t write things down and one led to the other and sooner or later I gave in.</span> <span id="s1945">But they helped me to hire the right woman.</span> <span id="s1946">Because before I hired her, I became very friendly with a German consul who was stationed in New York, consul number two.</span> <span id="s1947">And he was already two years in Israel and we became very friendly.</span> <span id="s1948">So -- and the wife was a -- a -- a newspaper woman.</span> <span id="s1949">And I -- a -- she invited me to her house for dinner one time, and she lived on -- on the West Side on 66th Street.</span> <span id="s1950">And we sat down and I said to her, how about you writing my book?</span> <span id="s1951">She thinks about it, she says, well -- I must have approached her before because that night I -- I si -- offered her 10,000 dollars if she would write it for me.</span> <span id="s1952">Speaks German, speaks English.</span> <span id="s1953">Educated woman.</span> <span id="s1954">She says no, I’m going back to Germany.</span> <span id="s1955">She wa -- they were transferred back to Berlin and she says even though she was -- quality was there, if you know what I mean, and she was very warm and she was like you, born after the war, had no -- no -- nothing to do with anybody, you know, but she refused me.</span> <span id="s1956">I couldn’t do anything about it, but that’s when I tried, because I felt she was qualified.</span> <span id="s1957">Even if she was back in Berlin she could do it.</span> <span id="s1958">But then my daughter found this one by accident.</span> <span id="s1959">And she came and she sat there and after two hours she says, I’ll take the job.</span> <span id="s1960">And I said, send me a contract.</span></p> <p><span id="s1961">Q: So then you started writing and collecting --</span></p> <p><span id="s1962">A: I already started writing --</span></p> <p><span id="s1963">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1964">A: -- s-stories, three pages, four pages and I started giving -- feeding her with typed stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s1965">Q: Hm, and when you -- when you finished writing, or when you had it all collected, did you understand anything about yourself or about your experience that you hadn’t understood before?</span> <span id="s1966">Did you gain some perspective that you didn’t have before?</span> <span id="s1967">A: Did -- did I do what?</span> <span id="s1968">Q: When you finished writing it --</span></p> <p><span id="s1969">A: Yeah?</span></p> <p><span id="s1970">Q: -- did you -- were you able to look at your experience in a different way?</span> <span id="s1971">Did you gain some new knowledge by writing it down?</span></p> <p><span id="s1972">A: Well, I -- no, I wracked my head to get the old stories together as -- as good as possible, and she trimmed them, and she made questions to add.</span> <span id="s1973">She knew how to handle it, and I was very satisfied.</span> <span id="s1974">I -- now I feel there’s three, four more stories should have been in, but there was a time limit, when she said enough is enough, we’re going to finish it the way it is.</span> <span id="s1975">And that’s when I gave you that big book.</span></p> <p><span id="s1976">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1977">A: She used that, I think.</span> <span id="s1978">She must have sent it to the publisher or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s1979">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1980">A: But I felt it was a good book, but when the letters came in and people come and -- and the most unusual, there’s some Germans here in New York [indecipherable] and other people who got hold of the book and they came and they admired it.</span> <span id="s1981">And when I sent a draft to the consul because I -- I wanted opinions, if you understand what I mean, so the consul came back to America for four years to -- to Houston, Texas, and once -- first time he was here he came to New York, we had lunch together and I sent him a draft.</span> <span id="s1982">And he said it’s beautiful.</span> <span id="s1983">He says, the nicest part is the way you carried yourself when you went back into your home village.</span> <span id="s1984">So everybody picks something different that shakes him.</span> <span id="s1985">So I felt good to get an opinion like that, if you -- you understand.</span> <span id="s1986">Because the German opinion to me is worth also, and they should be heard now, because this is a different generation two generations away from the Nazis.</span> <span id="s1987">And -- and they -- they -- they claim it could never happen again, they say.</span> <span id="s1988">We don’t know.</span> <span id="s1989">There’s still anti-Semitism in Germany today and there’s a new group coming up.</span> <span id="s1990">I got, month ago, a German magazine called Deutsche [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1991">How did I get it?</span> <span id="s1992">I have a friend in New Jersey, he’s like me, he’s practically the same age.</span> <span id="s1993">And some of his friends in Germany sent him the magazine and he went through the magazine and in it he found an article about me, in the magazine, in German.</span> <span id="s1994">So I read it, and I -- I started -- I told my bankers friend from Germany and one of them said, oh I know the magazine, that’s on the right side.</span> <span id="s1995">They are not mine -- they are not broadminded like we are.</span> <span id="s1996">So I already know what he meant.</span> <span id="s1997">He said, they are not leftists, they are rightists.</span> <span id="s1998">So -- but it -- the article is from the wall str -- not the Wall Street there, from the New York Times.</span> <span id="s1999">They -- they practically copied it.</span> <span id="s2000">And I called the guy who wrote the article, he says only the Times can sue him for copyright.</span> <span id="s2001">I didn’t write to the Times.</span> <span id="s2002">But it shows you what goes on and to me, for the Germans, it’s important that they read what goes on.</span> <span id="s2003">Th-They wouldn’t buy this book if a German wrote it, i-if you know what I mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2004">Q: No, explain that.</span> <span id="s2005">Why is that?</span></p> <p><span id="s2006">A: Because they feel that he was on D-Day, he’s an American, he knows what he is talking about.</span> <span id="s2007">I feel that’s why they want to buy it.</span> <span id="s2008">The ber -- Bavarian government’s supposed to buy it and put it in some of their libraries.</span> <span id="s2009">A woman I spoke to but so far she hasn’t cal-called me and t -- how many copies she wants.</span> <span id="s2010">But for th -- for them it’s important to -- to have the relations warm up again.</span> <span id="s2011">They invited me, they dedi -- dedicated the Jewish museum in Nuremberg, 1987 they invited me and sent me books and everything.</span> <span id="s2012">And so they -- they recognize that they need us to help them, if you understand what I mean.</span> <span id="s2013">The -- the -- the -- the people -- the Bavarian government, about six, eight months ago, wrote me -- I wrote to them, they wrote me a letter back and they sent me a booklet about Dachau.</span> <span id="s2014">All th-the pictures, everything about Dachau.</span> <span id="s2015">I -- I got excited and I said to myself, I’m not keeping this in my house, I don’t want my daughters to see it.</span> <span id="s2016">I took it to the local congressman and told him he can put it in any library he wants, I don’t want to see it.</span> <span id="s2017">Now, he refuses to give me a receipt for it that I can take a tax deduction.</span> <span id="s2018">I also gave him a copy of my book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2019">Q: Why don’t you -- why didn’t you want your daughters to see that book?</span> <span id="s2020">They know what you --</span></p> <p><span id="s2021">A: I -- I felt -- it excited me so much, they shouldn’t see it, what I went through.</span></p> <p><span id="s2022">Q: But they know?</span></p> <p><span id="s2023">A: No, I didn't tell them that I got that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2024">Q: But do they know what you went through?</span></p> <p><span id="s2025">A: Well, they know I was in concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2026">Q: But that’s all?</span></p> <p><span id="s2027">A: That’s all, yeah.</span> <span id="s2028">But that book described to -- the meat hooks, everything.</span> <span id="s2029">Shows you everything in the place, and I just couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s2030">That’s how I felt.</span> <span id="s2031">I -- if you want the book I give you the address in Germany where you can a -- write for a copy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2032">Q: Well, I’m curious about your experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2033">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2034">Q: It’s interesting to me about your experience with that book.</span></p> <p><span id="s2035">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2036">But I couldn’t stomach it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2037">Q: Because it brought back memories?</span> <span id="s2038">Were those things you knew about?</span></p> <p><span id="s2039">A: Too -- too many memories.</span> <span id="s2040">Wh-When you see the barracks and everything, I couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s2041">I didn’t want to keep it in my house, not even a week.</span> <span id="s2042">So I’m telling you the truth.</span></p> <p><span id="s2043">Q: You wrote a long book, but is there a lot that you left out?</span></p> <p><span id="s2044">A: Is there long --</span></p> <p><span id="s2045">Q: Is there a lot that you left out of your book?</span></p> <p><span id="s2046">A: There is enough for another book, but I’m not ready for one.</span> <span id="s2047">I feel that there’s some -- some good stories that only wake up after the book was out, if you know what I mean.</span> <span id="s2048">But it -- it’s -- it’s not that important that I write it down.</span> <span id="s2049">I wrote up enough the important parts.</span> <span id="s2050">Like now I have to do work with the lady whose letter I showed you.</span> <span id="s2051">I could put in more in her book if I wanted to.</span> <span id="s2052">Th-That will be an important book, if you know what -- I feel that she might give me half of the book if I let her.</span></p> <p><span id="s2053">Q: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s2054">A: I might need your help.</span></p> <p><span id="s2055">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2056">Okay.</span> <span id="s2057">[indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s2058">A: She would love -- I think she would love to sit in here.</span></p> <p><span id="s2059">Q2: [indecipherable] minutes left on this tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s2060">A: Do you hear what I said?</span></p> <p><span id="s2061">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2062">A: I would like -- I think she would love to sit here and watch us.</span></p> <p><span id="s2063">Q: And listen, yeah, maybe.</span> <span id="s2064">Maybe.</span> <span id="s2065">We’re going to stop now and do the photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s2066">Q2: And, anytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2067">Q: Okay, this is our first photograph.</span> <span id="s2068">Can you tell me who is in this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s2069">A: My oldest brother Siegfried, my --</span></p> <p><span id="s2070">Q: Don’t -- can you not use your hand?</span></p> <p><span id="s2071">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2072">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2073">Just -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2074">A: My -- the second brother, Theo, I’m on the right side.</span> <span id="s2075">Left one is my younger brother and that’s a sir -- the sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s2076">Q: And you look to be what, about 10 years old here?</span></p> <p><span id="s2077">A: No, about eight, seven.</span></p> <p><span id="s2078">Q: So this would have been around what year?</span></p> <p><span id="s2079">A: Oh, ninet -- born 1919, about 1927, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s2080">Q: And where do you think this photograph was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2081">A: In front of the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2082">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2083">A: That’s yi -- that’s where phot -- the photographer came.</span></p> <p><span id="s2084">Q: You all have -- look pretty nice there, pretty nice, pretty happy.</span></p> <p><span id="s2085">A: It look -- it looks antique, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2086">Q: Pretty happy kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s2087">A: You s -- you see, they look like -- what can I say, like uniforms a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2088">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2089">Q2: It’s a -- let me -- yeah, we have to put a little tape on.</span> <span id="s2090">And, anytime.</span></p> <p><span id="s2091">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2092">Who is this fellow?</span></p> <p><span id="s2093">A: That’s my father.</span> <span id="s2094">That must have been when he came home from the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s2095">Q: Can --</span></p> <p><span id="s2096">A: Maybe during the war, World War I.</span></p> <p><span id="s2097">Q: Can you tell me his full name?</span> <span id="s2098">A: It’s also in front of the house, because we had two or three steps going up to get into the house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2099">Q: Can you tell me his name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2100">A: Louie Kleeman.</span></p> <p><span id="s2101">Q: Louie?</span></p> <p><span id="s2102">A: Louie, yeah.</span> <span id="s2103">He was born 1882.</span></p> <p><span id="s2104">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2105">Okay, next one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2106">A: This is Werner Kleeman, immediately after release from Dachau.</span> <span id="s2107">You see the haircut, which was this [indecipherable] the -- the identification that you were a prisoner in a concentration camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s2108">Q: Because people wouldn’t have worn their hair like that?</span> <span id="s2109">A: I didn’t hav -- never wore hair like that.</span></p> <p><span id="s2110">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2111">A: Not -- not even in the American army.</span> <span id="s2112">They also wanted it short, but not that short.</span></p> <p><span id="s2113">Q: And do you remember where this was taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2114">A: Right -- probably in Ochsenfurt where the passport was made out, because we did not have a photographer in the village, so I -- it ha -- I’m sure it had to be taken there.</span></p> <p><span id="s2115">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2116">Q2: You know, we need to change tapes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2117">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2118">End of Tape Six</span></p> <p><span id="s2119">Beginning Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2120">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2121">A: This is the p -- the p -- the passport that I got after being released from the concentration camp in order to leave Germany.</span> <span id="s2122">The -- the man who signed it, who had the power, was very miserable, and he looked for all kinds of excuses not to give it to you, even though the consul had written that they want me to appear with a passport.</span> <span id="s2123">When I came back and was stationed in the town, I sent people up to tr -- and I needed a bed to sleep in, and had them remove his own bed to bring to my new quarters in Ochsenfurt.</span> <span id="s2124">I didn’t care if he slept on the floor or not, but I fixed him up then.</span></p> <p><span id="s2125">Q: And describe what i -- the red --</span></p> <p><span id="s2126">A: The K is that you’re a Jew.</span> <span id="s2127">The red K, they put that in every passport so you couldn’t say you’re -- it’s not yours.</span> <span id="s2128">That was only done -- about 1938 they started to issue a red K into every Jewish passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s2129">Q: And your name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2130">A: My name is Kleeman, and they add -- added Israel to every Jew, that was an -- a state l -- a state law, so you couldn’t sneak out an-and not be identified as a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s2131">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2132">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2133">Q2: All right, any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2134">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2135">A: This is the house, it used to be called a castle.</span> <span id="s2136">I believe it was built 1717.</span> <span id="s2137">It had a weapon at the front entrance and it was originally surrounded by water.</span> <span id="s2138">There were a couple of little streams going around the building, and they -- the village bought it from my father for a very low price.</span> <span id="s2139">They wanted to put the schoolhouse -- a school in there.</span> <span id="s2140">And then the war started, they didn’t do anything with it except they rented out the rooms.</span> <span id="s2141">And then, after awhile, they used it to put in 50 French pe -- Frenchmen who were forced to work on the farms.</span> <span id="s2142">And they were locked in at eight o’clock at night and the gendarme came in the morning to open it up to go to work.</span> <span id="s2143">They were very badly treated by the farmers and I don’t know what they did when they were free, but from what I understand they killed a couple of pigs and started to live up a little bit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2144">Q: Hm.</span> <span id="s2145">And this is the house that the Nazis came to on Kristallnacht?</span> <span id="s2146">A: Yea, this is the house they came, they destroyed every window, every closet, every bed was slice -- slit open.</span> <span id="s2147">That was completely in shambles.</span></p> <p><span id="s2148">Q: And do you know when this picture was taken, this photograph?</span></p> <p><span id="s2149">A: No, this was right after the war.</span> <span id="s2150">It looks very dilapidated and it must have been taken after the war ended, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s2151">Maybe I took it, because I had a camera with me sometimes.</span> <span id="s2152">It’s very possible that I took this picture myself.</span></p> <p><span id="s2153">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s2154">Did this house have a name?</span> <span id="s2155">A: No, no --</span></p> <p><span id="s2156">Q: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s2157">A: -- the house didn’t have a name.</span> <span id="s2158">It was part of a -- some kind of a family and they had 16 small homes around it, where poor people were living.</span> <span id="s2159">First there were the Jews in -- it’s writ -- it’s written up in this fellow’s book, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s2160">Q: So this would have been -- it really was a castle, then?</span></p> <p><span id="s2161">A: It was a castle, yeah, and the walls were thick tha -- you couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s2162">All brick -- heavy stone, no brick, no veneer.</span> <span id="s2163">Everything was heavy.</span> <span id="s2164">And the windows were big and it was a very strong house.</span> <span id="s2165">And there were 16 smaller homes around it and some of them fell apart, but the Germans rebuild them the way they were hundred years ago, and the people are living in them now.</span></p> <p><span id="s2166">Q: Did you have your own room in this house?</span></p> <p><span id="s2167">A: Yes, I had my own room in the house.</span> <span id="s2168">The upstairs was no heat.</span> <span id="s2169">It was cold in the winter with one big stove downstairs in the living room and one bedroom, and the kitchen had the stove to cook on.</span> <span id="s2170">It was not the most comfortable house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2171">Q: But it was a big house.</span></p> <p><span id="s2172">A: It was a big house, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2173">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2174">A: The rooms were big, was solidly built.</span> <span id="s2175">Very big house.</span> <span id="s2176">And then after the war, maybe eight or 10 years later, the Germans re-bought it, and they paid more money to my father and they tore it down and put a schoolhouse up on that place.</span> <span id="s2177">That’s how it worked.</span></p> <p><span id="s2178">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2179">Okay.</span> <span id="s2180">Tell us about this photograph.</span></p> <p><span id="s2181">A: Aft-After the -- we finished the basic training, that was nine -- three months, 90 days, w-we -- we were a group of non-citizens, we were aliens and they took us -- loaded us on a truck and took us to Macon, Georgia where there was a federal court building and we were taken into a room and there appeared a judge who swore us in as American citizens.</span> <span id="s2182">You didn’t have to pass any tests or anything, the uniform was your weapon that you will pass.</span> <span id="s2183">That was the happy moment in the life of being in the American Army.</span></p> <p><span id="s2184">Q: Which one is you?</span> <span id="s2185">A: The wa -- the -- on the right, the per -- per -- the one behind the first person.</span></p> <p><span id="s2186">Q: And do you remember any of the other fellows?</span></p> <p><span id="s2187">A: No, no, I didn’t know their names, I didn’t know whether they were Greeks or Italians or Jews, I didn’t know.</span> <span id="s2188">You didn’t have that much social with them, time to ask questions.</span> <span id="s2189">You can be assured, when the government took you there, they were non-citizens.</span></p> <p><span id="s2190">Q: Yeah, okay.</span> <span id="s2191">Okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s2192">Q2: Okay.</span> <span id="s2193">And any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2194">A: Ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s2195">Q: Okay, yup.</span></p> <p><span id="s2196">A: This is Colonel Gaitling, we became very good friends.</span> <span id="s2197">This was in a rough time of the winter, I can see the boots he was wearing.</span> <span id="s2198">They were hard to get by, but it probably was in Huertgen forest, it looks like all -- all trees around it.</span> <span id="s2199">He was a gentleman and very human and very kind and very considerate.</span> <span id="s2200">I never forget that we -- we broke out of Normandy and we hit the first French town and there was a little restaurant on the side, and he sent me in to buy a lunch.</span> <span id="s2201">He was outside on the bench and ate a K-ration.</span> <span id="s2202">And when I got inside I found my friend Salinger and John Keenan sitting at the counter eating already, so I joined them.</span> <span id="s2203">We were at home, we were cle -- happy together.</span> <span id="s2204">This colonel was a very outstanding soldier.</span> <span id="s2205">He -- he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute, which is as good as West Point.</span> <span id="s2206">Then he graduated Columbia Law School and he was working for a big law firm, a [indecipherable] law firm on broad -- on Wall Street in New York.</span> <span id="s2207">He never told us where he was working.</span> <span id="s2208">The boss at the Wall Street firm became Secretary of the Army under President Franklin Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2209">With one letter he could have been sitting in Washington for the duration, but he was too much of a soldier to let anybody know who he was.</span> <span id="s2210">He st -- he was British descent, and he was very, very warm with you.</span> <span id="s2211">You couldn’t help it but respect him.</span> <span id="s2212">The first or second night in France, he went on a -- he went to visit Sainte Mère Église, the first [indecipherable] where the paratroopers had dropped in, and while he was gone, I started t-to dig a foxhole for him, I was finished digging mine.</span> <span id="s2213">And when he came back midnight, he scolded me because he doesn’t allow me to big -- dig a foxhole for him, he’s digging his own foxholes.</span> <span id="s2214">So I apologized and I said, next time I know.</span> <span id="s2215">He was very, very considerate.</span> <span id="s2216">He want to make sure you eat and you clean and everything that needed for you to be care of.</span> <span id="s2217">He never cared about anything special in his uniform.</span> <span id="s2218">He wore the same clothes we were wearing, and every time we got into a new command post what [indecipherable] being called, he walked around and looked if there was a little stream.</span> <span id="s2219">When he found one, he found a -- a private corner, he took his uniform off and gave himself a -- a bath in the ice cold water.</span> <span id="s2220">I couldn’t have done that, but he did every time we hit a new som -- CP.</span> <span id="s2221">He was very articulate and he was very easy and warm to be with.</span> <span id="s2222">Fortunately, I was able to contact him after the war.</span> <span id="s2223">When I bought my house, I approached him and he ba -- he made the contract and title for me.</span> <span id="s2224">He hardly took any money.</span> <span id="s2225">And then, of course, we were -- became friends.</span> <span id="s2226">We stayed together til he passed away in 1980-something.</span> <span id="s2227">I went to his house three, four times a year for dinner.</span> <span id="s2228">We had wonderful times together.</span> <span id="s2229">And I went down to the Wall Street firm and we had lunch together.</span> <span id="s2230">It was an unusual friendship and we always find something to discuss and -- and -- and -- and enlighten us about things what have happened.</span> <span id="s2231">One of the big things that happened was in my -- when I was in a K company, 22nd infantry, there was a big fuss, to-do, north against south.</span> <span id="s2232">The southern boys, the hillbillies accused a couple of northern fellows for not leading a normal life, sexually.</span> <span id="s2233">And they accused them, and the -- the company commander was brainwashed by those fellows, and he more or less listened to them.</span> <span id="s2234">So he -- he took the accused fellow and put him into a stockade, and started bringing charges.</span> <span id="s2235">Another sergeant whom I knew very well, of -- a very good friend of mine who was supply sergeant, he was a friend of the accused and he went to another regiment to find a lawyer to sup -- to s -- defend this fellow.</span> <span id="s2236">So he went to the 12th regiment and found Colonel Gaitling.</span> <span id="s2237">He was then a captain, I believe, but he was a lawyer and had th-the best of degrees.</span> <span id="s2238">So Colonel Gaitling took the case and they brought in a very g -- big court martial.</span> <span id="s2239">They came down from corps to handle it, they had armed guards around the building and everything.</span> <span id="s2240">And when he did his research, he found a woman in Augusta who would swear and had the experience that she slept with that fellow.</span></p> <p><span id="s2241">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2242">A: I don’t want to mention his name, there may be relatives listening to it.</span> <span id="s2243">And whenever I asked the colonel to write this down for me because my language was not ready for a s -- a -- a s -- a case like this, he always told me, Kleeman, it is too spicy.</span> <span id="s2244">I -- I reminded him every time I came to his house to please write it down for me, and he said it’s too spicy.</span> <span id="s2245">He refused, he -- he kept a diary of his life in the division and he did not write this accident into his diary.</span> <span id="s2246">I -- I couldn’t get angry at him, but he was just too much.</span> <span id="s2247">He produced a woman at the court martial that testified she slept with this fellow and the case was dismissed.</span></p> <p><span id="s2248">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2249">A: The captain was sent out to Fort Benning as a punishment and the first sergeant was removed from the company, and there was a big shake-up in the regiment, because he knew how to handle it.</span> <span id="s2250">He was a de-definite fine lawyer and he knew that this -- the fellow was not guilty.</span></p> <p><span id="s2251">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2252">A: You can’t believe what went on in the army.</span> <span id="s2253">I told you many times I said, the -- the Caine Mutiny was a case like this and they brought a film out of it, why can’t you write it up?</span> <span id="s2254">He says, too spicy.</span> <span id="s2255">He never told his wife about it, he never told his son and daughter about it.</span> <span id="s2256">I’m the only man who questioned him about this all the time.</span> <span id="s2257">But I was not a -- I was not successful.</span> <span id="s2258">I -- I feel to this day it should have been publicized.</span> <span id="s2259">Th-The -- the fellow eventually got a discharge and got home and everybody was fine.</span> <span id="s2260">We got a new captain in the army, a young fellow, and he’s -- he’s -- when he came in he says, I’m a tough son-of-a-bitch, you boys better behave.</span> <span id="s2261">[laughs]</span></p> <p><span id="s2262">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2263">A: You’re laughing.</span></p> <p><span id="s2264">Q: Well, you’re making me laugh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2265">A: Well, it’s better to make you laugh than to cry.</span></p> <p><span id="s2266">Q: Right.</span> <span id="s2267">Okay, good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2268">A: There’s a [indecipherable] Theodore Roosevelt, he is the son of the first President Roosevelt.</span> <span id="s2269">He was 57 years old and didn’t have to be in a war, but he insisted on being there.</span> <span id="s2270">He was first serving in Africa and then he came back to England and they assigned him to help guide the Fourth Division.</span> <span id="s2271">He was a down to earth soldier who was in World War I already, and he was a regular fellow.</span> <span id="s2272">He never wore unif -- leggings or anything like that.</span> <span id="s2273">He did not want to show off that he is anything different.</span> <span id="s2274">He always walked with a cane and was a very unusual man.</span> <span id="s2275">He insisted on landing on the beach in -- in Normandy, or -- in the first hour to guide the boys.</span> <span id="s2276">He felt his presence there would stimulate them to go and march in -- into the country fast.</span> <span id="s2277">So he was there from the morning on and when them -- there’s a gu -- fellow lawyer I know who wrote a book about him, and in a letter home he wrote to his wife, I must have hiked 20 miles the first day up and down the beach to get the boys to move inland.</span></p> <p><span id="s2278">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2279">A: For his work there he got the Congressional Medal of Honor, but he didn't live to see it because he died in Normandy of a heart attack about five or six weeks after the landing.</span> <span id="s2280">His son was the captain in the First Division and also landed on D-Day.</span> <span id="s2281">And it was when the Utah beach was hooked up with Omaha beach, the son came over to visit the father in the evening -- afternoon about six o’clock.</span> <span id="s2282">And they spent two hours together and this must have excited the father so much that within an hour he had a heart attack and passed away.</span> <span id="s2283">A very s-sad story, but it so happened wi -- and about 10 - 12 years ago I got an invitation for a Kristallnacht celebration in Brooklyn and the invitation said, the German consul will be there, and re -- ru -- Teddy Roosevelt the fourth will be there.</span> <span id="s2284">So I packed up my history books with him in it and my two daughters and we traveled to Brooklyn and I met the fo -- the -- both the consul and this -- the -- the grandson.</span> <span id="s2285">I opened my books for him and he couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s2286">When he passed away, they never sent any material home what he possessed.</span> <span id="s2287">And I le -- gave -- I told him I would take care of him.</span> <span id="s2288">I finally got a history book, a D-Day book and a -- and I -- th-the Gaitling children gave me his map from D-Day, which I should show you a copy of it, which was a masterpiece, and I donated that map to the Roosevelt Museum in Oyster Bay, which is the home of the first president.</span> <span id="s2289">The grandson couldn’t believe all this happening and we have been good friends ever since.</span></p> <p><span id="s2290">Q: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s2291">A: He’s a very fine gentleman.</span> <span id="s2292">He’s a partner at Leaman Brothers and if I have time and need a free lunch, I can go.</span></p> <p><span id="s2293">Q: That’s good.</span></p> <p><span id="s2294">A: You know?</span> <span id="s2295">They’re not fantasies.</span></p> <p><span id="s2296">Q: Every one of your stories had a beginning, a middle and an end.</span></p> <p><span id="s2297">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2298">Q: And that’s wonderful.</span></p> <p><span id="s2299">A: But they’re not fantasies --</span></p> <p><span id="s2300">Q: No, I know they’re --</span></p> <p><span id="s2301">A: -- they’re -- they’re experiences.</span></p> <p><span id="s2302">Q: -- yeah.</span> <span id="s2303">But they’re stories, you know, they’re a good -- okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2304">A: Yeah, I know what you mean.</span></p> <p><span id="s2305">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2306">Okay.</span> <span id="s2307">Any time.</span></p> <p><span id="s2308">A: See, he never even wore a steel helmet, he used to wear a knit cap.</span> <span id="s2309">But that first day or two he had to wear a helmet.</span></p> <p><span id="s2310">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2311">A: He didn’t know what was coming.</span></p> <p><span id="s2312">Q: Hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s2313">A: And always had a cane.</span></p> <p><span id="s2314">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2315">Next picture.</span> <span id="s2316">This one.</span></p> <p><span id="s2317">A: Ready?</span> <span id="s2318">Q: Yes, we’re ready.</span></p> <p><span id="s2319">A: This is a picture when I got married, in 1948 at the Park Avenue synagogue.</span> <span id="s2320">This is my wife Laura and her parents.</span> <span id="s2321">Sh-She -- she was a young girl, she also came from Germany for about three -- the parents had a flour mill about three miles away from my hometown and we were friends through -- while she was growing up.</span> <span id="s2322">So I married her in 1948 and she produced two nice girls for me, which I -- wonderful children and very kind and good to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s2323">Q: And what was her last name?</span> <span id="s2324">A: Her maiden name was Hyman.</span> <span id="s2325">Yeah, she was very nice lady, but unfortunately she got sick after awhile and couldn’t cope with life the way she should have.</span> <span id="s2326">But thank God we have two beautiful children who are the best in the world, and -- and we have four grandchildren that are also very, very warm and -- and ho -- chil -- good children, good grandchildren.</span> <span id="s2327">You can’t find any better.</span></p> <p><span id="s2328">Q: What year did she pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2329">A: She had nervous breakdowns.</span></p> <p><span id="s2330">Q: What year did she pass away?</span></p> <p><span id="s2331">A: About se -- I -- ’78, I think.</span> <span id="s2332">I have it written down.</span> <span id="s2333">I believe it was 1978.</span> <span id="s2334">Yeah, the girls were already 20 and 22 years old, right.</span></p> <p><span id="s2335">Q: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s2336">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2337">A: Okay, this is a picture of my parents.</span> <span id="s2338">They pro-probably were i-in the 70’s when this picture was taken because I can tell from th-the looks of my father.</span> <span id="s2339">But they were -- they -- they considered themselves very lucky that their -- I was able to save them and bring them out from Germany at a time when it was practically impossible.</span> <span id="s2340">But we wer -- God was with us and I -- somewhere along the line I met the right people to help me and everything worked out fine.</span> <span id="s2341">Unfortunately, it was only the family that I could le -- save.</span> <span id="s2342">It -- I couldn’t save any of the uncles and sisters because I -- I didn’t have the money.</span> <span id="s2343">Even if I had the know-how, I had no money to help them.</span> <span id="s2344">This was a time when you had just to look for yourself in order to survive.</span> <span id="s2345">It was -- was unconditional life to exist, and -- and hope from day to day that better things will happen.</span></p> <p><span id="s2346">Q: Where was this picture taken?</span></p> <p><span id="s2347">A: I would say they died in si -- 1980 - ’78, probably about 1970.</span></p> <p><span id="s2348">Q: Where at?</span></p> <p><span id="s2349">A: Where?</span> <span id="s2350">I think it was taken in their home.</span></p> <p><span id="s2351">Q: In Baltimore?</span></p> <p><span id="s2352">A: Yeah, in Baltimore, it looks like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s2353">Q: You want to say your mother’s name?</span></p> <p><span id="s2354">A: My mother’s name was Lina, L-i-n-a, and her maiden name was Bamburger.</span> <span id="s2355">She was a very warm woman, very caring woman and she always con-concerned about the children and grandchildren.</span></p> <p><span id="s2356">Q: Mm-hm.</span> <span id="s2357">So your children knew her?</span></p> <p><span id="s2358">A: My children knew her.</span> <span id="s2359">They knew th -- my gra -- my father and grandfather, yeah.</span> <span id="s2360">Oh yeah, they knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s2361">Q: Good.</span> <span id="s2362">Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2363">A: My children are lucky, they -- [tape break]</span></p> <p><span id="s2364">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2365">A: I have to think for a minute.</span> <span id="s2366">The community college, the name -- this is the picture taken at the book signing at the community college

was instrumental that this organization was making the party.</span> <span id="s2367">Mr. Padavan wrote them a letter, Dr. Fluff was the administrator and he came over here for an interview and he stayed two hours and he said, I’ll make the party for you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2368">Q: Nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s2369">A: And the party was a great success.</span> <span id="s2370">This is

id="s2388">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2389">A: This is a picture of the cover of my book.</span> <span id="s2390">The lady that helped me designed it.</span> <span id="s2391">It’s all scenes in

what was going on and that’s -- when they read this, they bought the book.</span> <span id="s2392">They wanted to know what I wr -- what I had to say about it.</span> <span id="s2393">And the cover is very impressive and very, very natural.</span> <span id="s2394">It shows me, my passport, some church buildings, some -- some uniforms that the women were wearing.</span> <span id="s2395">It’s a very

Manfred Rommel was the mayor in Stuttgart.</span> <span id="s2414">When I used to go to Switzerland, Stuttgart and where I s -- wa-was in Switzerland was an hour and a half by train, so one time I sent him a couple of documents about his father and the Fourth Division and before I knew it, his assistant sent me an invitation when there was a meeting that Mr. Rommel would be able to s -- to meet me and say hello to me.</span> <span id="s2415">So --</span></p> <p><span id="s2416">Q: Say who his father was.</span></p> <p><span id="s2417">A: His father was the general commanding the western front.</span> <span id="s2418">At first he was commanding the Africa corps, where he got beaten by the Americans and the British and then he took over the -- the -- the east -- the western defense, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland.</span> <span id="s2419">That was all under his command, and he tried to do whatever e-equipment and men he had available.</span> <span id="s2420">At the -- he always bragged that he is going to throw any invader back into the sea within 24 hours and we were afraid he might have power.</span> <span id="s2421">But they didn’t give him enough troops to really defend that coast, and Hitler had three or four Panther Divisions about a hundred miles away from the front, and he didn’t release them the first or second day, and no general had the power to order them to come to the beach.</span> <span id="s2422">So what really happened, the German command failed to realize that the allies are -- are going to be there to stay, and that the -- the tanks from the German army were sitting in the mi-middle of France someplace and they couldn’t move.</span> <span id="s2423">When they did start moving, the American Air Force came and put the hell out of them as they were traveling on a highway.</span> <span id="s2424">It was so bad that they gave up and only traveled at night.</span> <span id="s2425">And they -- when they finally reached the front, the Americans had enough anti-tank guns and everything to fight them.</span> <span id="s2426">It was Rommel that I wrote to, that is the reason why his father had no chance.</span> <span id="s2427">As a matter of fact, when I -- when I got the book from the Gaitling family about the history of the 12th infantry regiment, I sent it to Rommel with the remark, if he reads this he’s going to know why his father could never win against the Americans.</span> <span id="s2428">That must have impressed him so that he wanted to meet me.</span> <span id="s2429">And it’s -- we became friends and every so often he sent an nice -- End of Tape Seven</span></p> <p><span id="s2430">Beginning Tape Eight</span></p> <p><span id="s2431">Q: Okay, now you said that you sent him a copy of Gaitling’s --</span></p> <p><span id="s2432">A: Yeah, I sent him -- I sent him documents sometimes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2433">Q: Uh-huh.</span> <span id="s2434">And you sent him a -- a draft of your book?</span></p> <p><span id="s2435">A: I sent him a draft of -- of s-something, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2436">Q: And in this note he’s writing back to you, thanking you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2437">A: Yeah, yeah, I -- I read the note.</span></p> <p><span id="s2438">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s2439">A: Ready?</span></p> <p><span id="s2440">Q: Yep.</span></p> <p><span id="s2441">A: “Dear.</span> <span id="s2442">Mr. Kleeman, Many thanks for your letter and the two manuscripts, which I have read with compassion and -- and pride.</span> <span id="s2443">They are really indeed to be published.</span> <span id="s2444">I was so impressed by your -- your letter from 204 that I quoted it in my last book.</span> <span id="s2445">I send you a copy of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s2446">Write me again.</span> <span id="s2447">Wishing you very much, your family, Sincerely yours, Manfred Rommel.</span> <span id="s2448">My handwriting is very, very bad and sl-slow because of my Parkinson’s Disease.”</span> <span id="s2449">He was very impress and he always admired that I was lucky to be part of the force that helped wipe out the German army and the German Nazi regime.</span> <span id="s2450">He said, “Th-The landing in Normandy was a strategic success, and in the world history, a -- a turning point.</span> <span id="s2451">You should be proud of contributing tha -- tha -- to this.</span> <span id="s2452">With many green -- greetings, Manfred Rommel.”</span></p> <p><span id="s2453">Q: That’s quite extraordinary.</span></p> <p><span id="s2454">A: Huh?</span></p> <p><span id="s2455">Q: I think that’s quite extraordinary that you got that letter from him.</span></p> <p><span id="s2456">A: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2457">Th-Then I wrote him again in -- in -- in -- in 2-0 -- 2004.</span> <span id="s2458">My daughters and I and the newspaper man from Germany, we traveled to Normandy to s -- to partake on a 60th anniversary.</span> <span id="s2459">And there we -- we had the newspaper man from Germany, who did the driving and we went into -- into Normandy and we spent a -- a day at the beach, we ate lunch at the Café Roosevelt, and it was very exciting and very -- very much history involved.</span> <span id="s2460">My daughters decided to take their shoes off and hang their feet into the water of the channel.</span> <span id="s2461">They decided and tell me the water wasn’t so cold.</span> <span id="s2462">So I sent the story to Rommel and he sent an answer back, but it was cold on June the sixth, 1944.</span> <span id="s2463">By that time he was still able to write the book and he mentioned this in his book, an-and we are very proud of it that he sent a [indecipherable] of his remarks that he described that I, as a Jew who left Germany in 1939 and were part of the force that started to defeat Germany.</span> <span id="s2464">He was -- he was a wor -- a man of the world.</span> <span id="s2465">He was really a historic mayor and very kind and of course he suffered.</span> <span id="s2466">He was 16 years old when he had to take his father to the hospital where he was poisoned and lost his life.</span> <span id="s2467">So this was his --</span></p> <p><span id="s2468">Q: So he was just a l --</span></p> <p><span id="s2469">A: -- an experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2470">Q: -- just a little bit younger than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2471">A: Pardon?</span></p> <p><span id="s2472">Q: He was just a little bit younger than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2473">A: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s2474">Q: A few years younger than you.</span></p> <p><span id="s2475">A: I said this was a great experience and the man had a lot of confidence and trust and he rebuilt the city of Stuttgart, it’s a beautiful city today and I wish he wouldn’t be so sick, otherwise I would have paid him another visit.</span></p> <p><span id="s2476">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2477">Well, thank you, thank you, those are wonderful memories.</span></p> <p><span id="s2478">A: Wonderful experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s2479">Q: Yeah.</span> <span id="s2480">Well thank you so much for all of your time today.</span></p> <p><span id="s2481">A: You -- you have these pictures somewhere?</span></p> <p><span id="s2482">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s2483">A: In a
