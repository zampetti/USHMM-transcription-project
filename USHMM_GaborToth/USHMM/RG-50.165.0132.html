<html><body><p><span id="s1">Jack &amp; Millie Werber, 12-6-89</span></p> <p><span id="s2">WH: What does the society do?</span></p> <p><span id="s3">JW: The Radomer Cultural Center takes members from the New York Metropolitan Area, including Connecticut and Jew Jersey.</span> <span id="s4">Then there is United Radomer Relief, started 60 years ago to help Radomer all over the world.</span> <span id="s5">Now nobody is left from these old-timers.</span> <span id="s6">So we are the ones who did it.</span></p> <p><span id="s7">WH: Did the society welcome you when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s8">MW: There were seven Radomer organizations here when we came.</span> <span id="s9">There were 35,000 in Radom before the war.</span> <span id="s10">Each immigration brought in a new group.</span> <span id="s11">Each new group couldn’t understand the one before.</span> <span id="s12">There were also political differences.</span> <span id="s13">There was no religious group that was separate.</span> <span id="s14">Those that came in the 20s and 30s weren’t religious.</span> <span id="s15">They were to the left, like the Bund.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">WH: Are you religious?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">MW: No.</span> <span id="s18">We sent our kids to the Sholom Aleichem schools.</span> <span id="s19">We came from religious backgrounds but after the war we couldn’t be religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">JW: We saw too much.</span> <span id="s21">We saw too much.</span> <span id="s22">We’d like to believe, but we can’t.</span> <span id="s23">I spoke to tens and tens of rabbis.</span> <span id="s24">Why did they kill the children?</span></p> <p><span id="s25">WH: Does it bother you that the religious seem so stubborn in their beliefs?</span> <span id="s26">Does it get on your nerves?</span></p> <p><span id="s27">MW: Very much so.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">JW: Both our sons are religious.</span> <span id="s29">We’re happy about that because it means they stay Jewish.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">MW: A few years ago we made the kitchen kosher for the grandchildren.</span> <span id="s31">David’s wife, Ellen, went to Stern College and it began with her.</span> <span id="s32">Martin had something in him.</span> <span id="s33">He went to yeshiva in Brooklyn.</span> <span id="s34">The boys are in business with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">WH: When were you born?</span></p> <p><span id="s36">JW: In 1914.</span> <span id="s37">I’m 75.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">MW: I was born in 1927.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">WH: What business are you in?</span></p> <p><span id="s40">JW: Real estate.</span> <span id="s41">Apartment houses in Queens, many of which we build ourselves.</span> <span id="s42">I had a brother here before I came; he was 32 years older than me.</span> <span id="s43">He had factories that made uniforms.</span> <span id="s44">I was liberated in Buchenwald where I was for 5.5 years.</span> <span id="s45">Of the 3,200 that came in our transport, eleven remained.</span> <span id="s46">I wasn’t the smartest or the strongest.</span> <span id="s47">it was coincidence.</span> <span id="s48">I did a little but I was lucky.</span> <span id="s49">They gave us three months to live when we came.</span> <span id="s50">They gave us bread to eat with glass in it.</span> <span id="s51">They told my father I had died and they could pick up the ashes by paying for it.</span> <span id="s52">My father buried me and a little later he died, maybe from the aggravation.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">WH: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">MW: In Birkenau-Auschwitz, for six months.</span> <span id="s55">We came as ammunition workers.</span> <span id="s56">I never thought I’d be free.</span> <span id="s57">I just thought about how I was going to die.</span> <span id="s58">I didn’t expect to live through it.</span></p> <p><span id="s59">WH: So when you came here, your brother was a successful manufacturer of uniforms.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">JW: He lived in Beacon, N.Y.</span> <span id="s61">He gave us the affidavit and we came on the second boat, the Marine Perch.</span> <span id="s62">He waited for us with a sign: “Werber.”</span></p> <p><span id="s63">MW: And I didn’t have a good impression of America because we heard that HIAS sold tickets to people to come see us at the pier, like we were in a zoo.</span> <span id="s64">I also remember we went to Beacon and it was very hot.</span> <span id="s65">So we stopped to get something to drink and we felt he was very uncomfortable going out with us.</span> <span id="s66">When we arrived at his house, his wife looked me over and they didn’t give us anything to eat.</span> <span id="s67">They sent us to make the beds.</span> <span id="s68">I was taking a bath and I saw that they put in a disinfectant like we had lice, in the tub.</span> <span id="s69">I knew this because he said: “Don’t wash your face with this water because it has medicine in it.”</span> <span id="s70">When I heard that I felt very bad.</span> <span id="s71">They had a fifteen room house and they were only a couple.</span></p> <p><span id="s72">JW: I had brought presents for them----a camera, a gold cigarette case, a good ring.</span> <span id="s73">When they showed up the next morning in bathrobes, I felt they didn’t think much of us.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">MW: We stayed there for three weeks but it felt like thirty years.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">JW: My brother drank a lot.</span> <span id="s76">And when he introduced me, he said: “This is my brother who came over from the other side.</span> <span id="s77">He cost me four bottles of whiskey already.”</span> <span id="s78">In other words, he had to listen to my stories so much.</span> <span id="s79">And he always introduced us as greenhorns.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">MW: And these people looked at us, as if to say: “How come my brother didn’t survive and you did?”</span> <span id="s81">In other words, we had to apologize for surviving.</span> <span id="s82">So I didn’t want to talk about it; so I put a bandage on my number so I wouldn’t have to talk about it.</span> <span id="s83">They were so ignorant; they asked such stupid questions.</span> <span id="s84">My sister-in-law asked me if they gave us orange juice in Auschwitz!</span> <span id="s85">And she never even asked what happened to her family.</span> <span id="s86">She had a whole family in Europe.</span> <span id="s87">So maybe, I think now, their conscience bothered them.</span> <span id="s88">Then, because I knew I had an accent and everything, we moved to an all-Jewish neighborhood in the Bronx.</span> <span id="s89">And one time I went into a bakery and asked for sponge cake and I didn’t know the right word.</span> <span id="s90">And right away she said: “Greenhorn!”</span> <span id="s91">It was on Charlotte Street.</span> <span id="s92">You heard of it (Jimmy Carter visited it.)</span> <span id="s93">And were we lived, we did everything in this room.</span> <span id="s94">It was the living room, bedroom, and dining room.</span> <span id="s95">It was a very small room.</span> <span id="s96">Then we took an apartment on Lewis Street.</span> <span id="s97">There the bathtub was in the kitchen.</span> <span id="s98">There was no hot water or heat.</span> <span id="s99">We bought two electrical heaters.</span> <span id="s100">We put the baby when he was first born, in a drawer with a pillow.</span> <span id="s101">We didn’t get a crib until later.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">WH: Where did you work?</span></p> <p><span id="s103">JW: I went to the fur market on Seventh Ave and 30th St. i learned from the camps that it didn’t matter if you were a doctor or a lawyer.</span> <span id="s104">I look for the person themselves.</span> <span id="s105">A truck driver can talk with anybody.</span> <span id="s106">With a trade person you can have a favor.</span> <span id="s107">The professionals in the camps were the most selfish, they were the squealers.</span> <span id="s108">They sold you out.</span> <span id="s109">They didn’t wash themselves.</span> <span id="s110">They couldn’t take chances.</span> <span id="s111">It wasn’t like here where a boy from any home can become a professional.</span> <span id="s112">In Europe only someone from an affluent family could become a professional.</span> <span id="s113">The professionals were the dirtiest people among us.</span> <span id="s114">When they got a job, they were more likely to become murderers.</span> <span id="s115">The plain people, if they were kapos, they took chances and looked away.</span> <span id="s116">This is a proven thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s117">WH: Was there a difference among nationalities?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">MW: We personally had difficulties with the German Jews.</span> <span id="s119">They told us that they suffer because of us.</span> <span id="s120">They said the immigrants who came to Germany from Poland were the worst.</span> <span id="s121">There was also not a good relationship with the Hungarians but with the German Jews it was worse.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">WH: Let’s go back to the work question.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">JW: I began doing piece-work with muskrats.</span> <span id="s124">it was so hard at first with the unions and the prejudice against the greener, that I would have gone back to, say, a Western European country if I could have.</span> <span id="s125">I didn’t like to work for a boss, for someone standing over me.</span> <span id="s126">Those who had a trade stayed still.</span> <span id="s127">A tailor remained a tailor.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">WH: How strongly do you support Israel?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">MW: We go every year.</span> <span id="s130">We’ve already built four clinics there.</span> <span id="s131">We’ve built them in Ramat Chen, Moshava Germanit in Jerusalem on Rechov Ruth 6.</span> <span id="s132">We also built a clinic in Kiryat Motzkin.</span> <span id="s133">The Radomer gave the money.</span> <span id="s134">We give a part of it and we also work with the Histadrut.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">JW: I’m President of the Radomer Relief, the umbrella organization of all Radomer organizations in the U.S. and Canada.</span> <span id="s136">We have groups in L.A., Miami, Toronto, Montreal.</span> <span id="s137">We collect money to send our old sick Radomer landsleyt money in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">WH: Are all of your four best friends survivors?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">JW: Mostly.</span> <span id="s140">We have new friends, but they’re not the same.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">WM: You asked about the Radomer.</span> <span id="s142">When we came here, there were seven Radomer societies, but they thought we were less than them because they were here longer.</span> <span id="s143">But these people actually didn’t know anything.</span> <span id="s144">They only knew how to go from their houses on the Lower East Side to work and back.</span> <span id="s145">When they saw we were going to Times Square after one week, they said: “Look at the greenhorns.</span> <span id="s146">They travel already; they know how to go already.”</span> <span id="s147">They saw us as being brighter or more intelligent, I don’t know what.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">WH: Did they offer to help you when you came here?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">JW: Naw.</span> <span id="s150">The Relief group, they gave some people, maybe a couple of dollars.</span></p> <p><span id="s151">WH: When you get together with the Radomer, what do you talk about?</span></p> <p><span id="s152">JW: Oh, we remind ourselves about the war, about before the war.</span> <span id="s153">We feel like family with them.</span> <span id="s154">When we make a bar mitzvah or a wedding we invite them.</span></p> <p><span id="s155">MW: When we get an invitation from them, there is no such thing that we wouldn’t go because we know they need us.</span> <span id="s156">We can talk open with them, I don’t even know how to put it.</span></p> <p><span id="s157">JW: We understand each other.</span> <span id="s158">We have a special room in Beit Hatfutsot.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">WH: How come your society is so successful?</span></p> <p><span id="s160">JW: Because in our society most of the people, not me, they suffered together in the Radom Ghetto.</span> <span id="s161">Other societies came from here, from there.</span> <span id="s162">There are people from around Radom who also belong to our society.</span> <span id="s163">Every month except January, February, July, and August, we have a meeting.</span> <span id="s164">The best attended one is when we go out to the Montefiore Cemetery between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we have a monument.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">MW: We don’t have graves but all the names are on the monument.</span> <span id="s166">And you have to see how when we go over and we touch the names on the monument, we feel a connection.</span> <span id="s167">We brought some soil from Auschwitz and put it there.</span> <span id="s168">Our regular meetings are held on the West Side Jewish Center, on 34th Street, between 8th and Ninth Avenues.</span> <span id="s169">We have the meeting in the synagogue.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">WH: Do you have Orthodox people in the society?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">MW: Yes, they’re not too involved, but they come.</span> <span id="s172">And we serve kosher food at the meetings.</span> <span id="s173">And we have a paper called The Voice of Radom.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">WH: So what happened with the business?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">JW: I took my own place on Ave C making trimmings on collars.</span> <span id="s176">I borrowed $1,000 dollars and my partner, an American, also put in $1,000.</span> <span id="s177">Then we sold earmuffs.</span> <span id="s178">It was a big struggle.</span> <span id="s179">I worked 25 hours a day.</span> <span id="s180">I never saw the children awake.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">WH: What did you say to all this?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">MW: What could I say?</span> <span id="s183">I knew we had to do it.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">JW: Then came Davy Crockett, we started with the coonskin caps.</span> <span id="s185">I was the Davy Crockett King and Daniel Boone also.</span> <span id="s186">We were looking for ways because the trimming business was no good.</span> <span id="s187">We took different lofts.</span> <span id="s188">They came with trucks, they were selling like hot potatoes.</span> <span id="s189">We couldn’t make them fast enough.</span> <span id="s190">I found different methods to do it, not like a furrier is doing it.</span> <span id="s191">When we didn’t have the fur for the whole hat, I took plastic tops, made a picture of Davy Crockett, printed it in gold....we did a lot of things.</span> <span id="s192">I was the packer, the sender; we took in girls, Puerto Ricans, they didn’t know anything about furs.</span> <span id="s193">Then there weren’t enough raccoons.</span> <span id="s194">So we found them in warehouses, where they had old raccoon coats that were lying around from the 1920s, when they were in style.</span> <span id="s195">We bought and cleaned them.</span> <span id="s196">We sold the hats at twelve dollars a dozen.</span> <span id="s197">And then I invented a mouse in box with a hole at the bottom of the box.</span> <span id="s198">Then you put your finger in the hole, and you moved the mouse.</span> <span id="s199">It was made from rabbits.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">MW: And you make mink coats for dogs.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">JW: Yeah, for dogs.</span> <span id="s202">I also invented a method using a shoemaker’s machine instead of a furrier’s machine to make what looked like the head of a fox but was really a rabbit, as a hat.</span> <span id="s203">We invented a machine that put both eyes in at once.</span></p> <p><span id="s204">WH: How many Davy Crockett hats did you sell?</span></p> <p><span id="s205">JW: We made a thousand dozen a week, 12,000 to 20,000 hats a week.</span> <span id="s206">After a while we used rabbits and we made the tails from rabbit skins.</span> <span id="s207">We couldn’t get enough raccoons.</span> <span id="s208">We painted them.</span></p> <p><span id="s209">WH: I’m trying to remember if the one I had was real.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">JW: You see, we are raised to do a job that we don’t like, to make a living.</span> <span id="s211">Here in America, people do what they like.</span> <span id="s212">They go to school.</span></p> <p><span id="s213">MW: And the Davy Crockett business didn’t end good.</span> <span id="s214">The whole thing stopped and we got stuck with a lot of hats.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">JW: Then we moved to Jackson heights and we bought a house.</span> <span id="s216">A friend lent me the money and we bought a three family house there and we rented the apartments out.</span> <span id="s217">Then I saw it was a good business and I thought why should I struggle with the furs?</span> <span id="s218">We rented to the stewardesses and the pilots.</span> <span id="s219">Then friends came to me to buy for them.</span> <span id="s220">In a short time we had maybe 32 houses.</span></p> <p><span id="s221">MW: They trusted him and they made money on it.</span> <span id="s222">It was an investment for them.</span> <span id="s223">There were 51 partners.</span> <span id="s224">Today we own 25 apartment buildings and a shopping center in Armonk.</span> <span id="s225">We sold the private houses because it was too much work.</span> <span id="s226">The children manage the business and they’re building; they’re building hotels.</span> <span id="s227">They built a hotel on Greenpoint Avenue from an old school.</span> <span id="s228">It’s now a Best Western across from a cemetery.</span></p> <p><span id="s229">WH: To what do you attribute your success?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">JW: Hard work and good luck and good friends.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">MW: Our people are very cautious people.</span> <span id="s232">Their money is their security and they don’t part with it so easily.</span> <span id="s233">So it was very gratifying to us that they supported us.</span> <span id="s234">But the survivors did well because they took chances.</span> <span id="s235">There was no help from anyone.</span></p> <p><span id="s236">WH: What about the Russians who come here?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">MW: They don’t come poor.</span> <span id="s238">They all come with money.</span> <span id="s239">They have businesses and they know how to do business.</span> <span id="s240">And they don’t practice as Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s241">WH: Do you belong to survivor groups?</span></p> <p><span id="s242">JW: Yes.</span> <span id="s243">I’m on the committee with Ben Meed’s organization but they don’t do much.</span></p> <p><span id="s244">MW: They don’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s245">JW: The few gatherings they made were very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">MW: I don’t believe in him because it’s an ego involvement.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">JW: He didn’t go through the whole camps.</span> <span id="s248">He was outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s249">[Sonia Pilcer’s hierarchy]</span></p> <p><span id="s250">MW: And he is quite a dictator.</span> <span id="s251">he wouldn’t let anybody next to him.</span> <span id="s252">He pushes away a lot of people that want to work with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">JW: I wouldn’t fight with him.</span></p> <p><span id="s254">MW: He’s not doing anything.</span> <span id="s255">When he made the gatherings in Israel and Washington, that was wonderful.</span> <span id="s256">But when he started to go to Philadelphia and Canada, it made no sense.</span> <span id="s257">In Israel it was wonderful.</span> <span id="s258">Begin spoke to us at the Wall and this was a night to remember as long as I live.</span> <span id="s259">For the first time I didn’t feel a need to explain why I survived.</span> <span id="s260">he said that we don’t owe anyone an explanation.</span> <span id="s261">He was a beautiful orator.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">WH: What is the most significant thing you did in your lives?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">JW: That we had children.</span> <span id="s264">Who would have imagined that we would have grandchildren forty years later?</span></p> <p><span id="s265">MW: And that my grandchildren are religious; that’s unimaginable.</span> <span id="s266">It’s easier to believe than not to believe.</span> <span id="s267">Any many times I want to but I can’t.</span> <span id="s268">I listened as my granddaughter read the story in synagogue of how the whale spit up Jonah after three days and, of course, I couldn’t say anything to the children about what a stupidity this is, that after we were in such fire, in Auschwitz, there was no sky, everything was black from the people burning.</span> <span id="s269">There were a few Jews who tried to revolt; so they pushed them into the ovens alive.</span></p> <p><span id="s270">So couldn’t there have been just one little nes (miracle), or something to show that there is justice in the world?</span> <span id="s271">So I should believe this: I was sitting there and it turned my stomach.</span> <span id="s272">The children.</span> <span id="s273">j What they did to children.</span> <span id="s274">They were learning how to shoot with children.</span> <span id="s275">So that’s why I never believed.</span> <span id="s276">There were no miracles.</span> <span id="s277">There were no miracles.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">WH: How does all this have a permanent effect on you?</span></p> <p><span id="s279">MW: I promised myself that no one will ever walk out of my house hungry.</span> <span id="s280">I’m obsessed in this way with food.</span> <span id="s281">We don’t throw out food.</span> <span id="s282">And when we serve, it’s too much food and I know it’s too much food.</span> <span id="s283">We pushing the kids too much.</span> <span id="s284">They say I stretched their intestines; maybe I did.</span> <span id="s285">When we made a wedding for the kids, we made everything big, everything big.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">WH: Do you know anything about kapos in this country?</span></p> <p><span id="s287">MW: Yeah, there are plenty of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s288">JW: We know from Radom too.</span> <span id="s289">They have thousands of Jews on their conscience.</span> <span id="s290">And they came here under a different name and we went to immigration about them, but you can’t do anything about them here.</span></p> <p><span id="s291">MW: We know someone like this here.</span> <span id="s292">He doesn’t show himself anywhere.</span> <span id="s293">he has two children.</span> <span id="s294">They are doctors.</span> <span id="s295">he has no conscience.</span> <span id="s296">I told his wife what her mother said.</span> <span id="s297">He was a squealer and he did a lot of wrong.</span> <span id="s298">He lives in New Jersey and he has friends, but mostly American friends.</span> <span id="s299">There are surely hundreds here.</span> <span id="s300">Maybe another nation would be even worse, but we had enough bad people.</span> <span id="s301">I wouldn’t say about other people maybe; you shouldn’t judge.</span> <span id="s302">But I would say about this person because I suffered directly because of him.</span></p></body></html>
