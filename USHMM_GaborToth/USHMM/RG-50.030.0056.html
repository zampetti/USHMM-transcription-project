<p><span id="s13">01:00:18</span></p> <p><span id="s14">Q: Could you tell us your full name please?</span></p> <p><span id="s15">A: Yes, my name is Eva Cooper.</span> <span id="s16">My maiden name was Eva Brust and I was born in Budapest in Hungary.</span></p> <p><span id="s17">Q: And when were you born?</span> <span id="s18">A: I was born in 1934.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: And could you tell us a little bit about your life before the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: My life before the war was very, very nice.</span> <span id="s21">I remember living in a very nice house, actually an apartment on the Pest side of Budapest.</span> <span id="s22">You probably know the city is divided by the Danube and the part that I lived in we had mostly apartment houses as opposed to the other part which was private homes.</span> <span id="s23">And I was...uh...besides my parents, obviously, I had...uh...nannies and governesses and we led a very, very comfortable life with lots of vacations and...uh.</span> <span id="s24">.</span> <span id="s25">parties and I went to elementary school.</span> <span id="s26">And... uh...in school we had...uh...we had religious education in the public school system...uh...besides the languages, arts, geography, history and math, everybody went to their own religious classes during that particular period so as Jewish children went to a class where a Rabbi taught Jewish history, Hebrew, whatever.</span> <span id="s27">Catholics went to Catholic class and Protestants went to Protestant class and everybody mingled and got along very well and I was never aware of Jewish or not Jewish or anything else pertaining to religion until much later.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">01:01:52 And until 1944, which was when I was 10 years old, I really don't recall anything particularly disrupting my life.</span> <span id="s29">In retrospect, now I understand that many things were going on since 1939.</span> <span id="s30">I was aware that my father was in labor camp, but I thought that was just being a soldier and he always came back.</span> <span id="s31">Uh...He went several times and came back and I..</span> <span id="s32">.</span> <span id="s33">my mother did go help my father...run my father's business.</span> <span id="s34">My father was in paper...wholesale paper manufacturing business.</span> <span id="s35">Uh...But otherwise I, personally, was not aware of having to be afraid or being concerned until 1944.</span> <span id="s36">And that was a particularly special day in my life because my birthday is March 18th and I was having my 10th birthday party in my...my home with all my friends.</span> <span id="s37">They were really my parents' friends, children who I was brought up with, as well as some of the mothers and a lot of the nannies or governesses.</span> <span id="s38">And it was an early evening party of hot dogs, and...uh...we lived on a fairly main street.</span> <span id="s39">We heard marching of soldiers and we looked out the window and the German army at that point, to my recall, was occupying Budapest.</span> <span id="s40">Hungary was the last of the Eastern European countries to be occupied.</span> <span id="s41">Poland and the other countries had already had German troops in them.</span></p> <p><span id="s42">01:03:25 And everybody started running around and there went my party.</span> <span id="s43">Everybody went home.</span> <span id="s44">And the reason being that they were all afraid and that the Germans at that time were occupying Budapest and...uh...that's when our whole world really fell apart.</span> <span id="s45">Uh...There were a lot of negotiations.</span> <span id="s46">I didn't really know what was going on.</span> <span id="s47">Everybody tried to keep the children from worrying and...uh...we lived in...uh...a designated house that was called the Jewish house...uh... which happened to have been the building which we were in.</span> <span id="s48">What that meant is that several houses, apartment houses, were designated Jewish houses where the Christians had the option to stay or go.</span> <span id="s49">In a Jewish house, the Jews stayed and the ones that were not the Jewish houses, the Jews had to leave.</span> <span id="s50">Also we had a fairly large apartment, and we were only allowed to live in one room.</span> <span id="s51">But because my father was fairly active in the Jewish community, we were able to pick the families to move into all the other rooms.</span> <span id="s52">So we had friends and family move in.</span> <span id="s53">Uh...My parents' bedroom because our...our room.</span> <span id="s54">We had friends in the living room and somebody else in the dining room and somebody else in my...in my old room.</span> <span id="s55">Uh...That's when I first was aware of the fact that things were not quite the same.</span> <span id="s56">Also, one of the laws that came to pass at the time was that Jews could not have help, servants or whatever you want to call them.</span> <span id="s57">And...uh...so all our so-called staff, which consisted of my governess and a cook and a maid, had to leave.</span> <span id="s58">Uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s59">01:05:14</span></p> <p><span id="s60">Q: What were the sanitary facilities like?</span></p> <p><span id="s61">A: Uh...Well, it was difficult because we had bathrooms and all that but it was a..</span> <span id="s62">.</span> <span id="s63">it was really really interesting from a child's point of view.</span> <span id="s64">It was a time of sharing and pulling together.</span> <span id="s65">I was an only child, so I thought it was just terrific to have all these children running around and I was always brought up very properly, to behave myself and speak when I was spoken to, and here they were all these people running around.</span> <span id="s66">And one of my father's very good friends who was a lawyer and had a great deal of...a tremendous sense of humor wrote poetry for the bathroom, to the effect that the men were to put the toilet seats down after use and all sorts of funny things.</span> <span id="s67">We just thought that this was great fun and we played jokes...uh...on the grownups and...uh...but things did progressively get worse because... And one of my first personal experiences as a child was when a little girl who lived in the building, who stayed in the building...all the Gentiles chose to stay in the building in their own apartments, but they kept the whole apartment.</span> <span id="s68">And one little girl said...I asked if I could play with her in that afternoon as we usually had, and she said no, she couldn't play with me.</span> <span id="s69">I said, "Well, how about tomorrow?"</span> <span id="s70">And she said, "No, she can't play with me tomorrow either.”</span> <span id="s71">And I said, "Well, why not?"</span> <span id="s72">And she said, "Because you're Jewish.”</span> <span id="s73">And I said, "Well, I don't really understand what that means or what does that have to do with anything anyhow.”</span> <span id="s74">And she said well, she didn't know either, but her parents said that she couldn't play with a Jewish child.”</span> <span id="s75">So...</span></p> <p><span id="s76">01:06:48</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: What was a typical day like for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s78">A: Well, by this time we weren't going to school.</span> <span id="s79">We were only ...Jews were only allowed to shop and market in the stores late in the afternoon.</span> <span id="s80">They were only allowed on the street ...uh...for an hour or so, when the produce and most of the stuff was gone and what was there was not terrific.</span> <span id="s81">Uh...my father would go to the Jewish Community Center to see what he could do.</span> <span id="s82">Uh...My father was a prominent person in the Jewish community so that the wealthy Jews still had some influence and were able to do such things, such as acquiring the...the Star for our building to remain in our house and...uh...to get much more information than we would have gotten otherwise.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">01:07:41</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Tell us about the Star.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: There was a Star outside the house that designated being a Jewish building so anybody that would pass by that was not Jewish building would know that this was a Jewish Star...Jewish house and...uh...the Jews had to wear yellow Stars.</span> <span id="s86">Had to be exactly put on each item of clothes as a certain measurement that had to be...and it had to be put on the left upper shoulder of each garment.</span> <span id="s87">In other words, that when you went out on the street, you should always be identified and if somebody wanted to spit on you, kick you, shoot you, take you away, that's what you were to do.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: Did you go out on the streets?</span></p> <p><span id="s89">A: Yes, I did go out on the streets.</span> <span id="s90">We did go out.</span> <span id="s91">I have this...my...my little boyfriend who is 11, and he and I would go out and do some stuff in the neighborhood.</span> <span id="s92">We would also buy newspapers and sell them within the building.</span> <span id="s93">And...uh...we also, I remember...nobody in my family smoked, but people did.</span> <span id="s94">Europeans smoked a lot.</span> <span id="s95">And we would pick up cigarette butts from everybody...wherever we could find them, take out the leftover tobacco and roll them in tissue paper.</span> <span id="s96">I have no idea where we got the tissue paper.</span> <span id="s97">And sell them to the smokers, because there was a shortage of all things.</span> <span id="s98">And so having this and, of course, the fact that we were children everybody bought it for us and we decided that we would support our parents because we did realize that nobody was working.</span> <span id="s99">And I'm not sure we supported them, but it was again great fun.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">01:09:19</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: Did you have any frightening instances on the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s102">A: No, I never had any frightening instances on the street.</span> <span id="s103">No.</span> <span id="s104">Uh...I did have...uh...a lot of fun things in the... in the apartment as a I said because we were friends and we had all the people.</span> <span id="s105">We played tricks on people and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s106">But, it was getting to be frightening because you ...you had sense of doom.</span> <span id="s107">You had a sense that there was... there was a lot of whispering going on, and sometimes not knowing what is going on is almost as bad as sharing and being told that okay, these are the things that can happen.</span> <span id="s108">Uh...There were a lot of trucks...uh...obviously, going on the street with lots of people in it, and everybody was making up stories about where they were going.</span> <span id="s109">Labor camp, to the country, all sorts of things, but it was...it was getting obvious even at my age that people were being picked up, but I didn't know why.</span> <span id="s110">And this lasted from about the middle of March until...uh...the fall in October.</span> <span id="s111">And in October, the Jewish houses did no longer protect the people that were there.</span> <span id="s112">Uh...my parents were able to...uh...get the Wallenberg protection papers.</span> <span id="s113">Raoul Wallenberg, under the Swedish king, was able to protect and save a lot of people.</span> <span id="s114">They were designated Swedish houses, protectorates, where they claimed that Jews could be saved and we did go to such a house...uh...for one night and they had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people.</span> <span id="s115">I don't know how many.</span> <span id="s116">But my parents decided that there were just two many Jews under one roof and if the...if the Germans really wanted to get rid of a whole bunch at a time, we would be better off going somewhere else where...where it would not be so obvious that we're together.</span> <span id="s117">I think that night that we left our home in October was the first time that I was really scared and I think that was the experience that, as a young adult, stayed with me for a long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s118">01:11:23 I was very attached to a pillow that I carried.</span> <span id="s119">We had no suitcases to take with us because we had to travel light.</span> <span id="s120">Uh...we were dressed, all of us, in several layers of clothes so as to have some warmth and have some change and I did take my pillow.</span> <span id="s121">And...uh...I also had long...long hair.</span> <span id="s122">I had long braids which were cut in case the sanitary facilities were non existent and I shouldn't get lice.</span> <span id="s123">And I remember asking my parents...uh...where're we going to sleep that night.</span> <span id="s124">And my parents said, "We didn't know.”</span> <span id="s125">We were just hoping that somebody would take us in.</span> <span id="s126">I said, "But we have to have a bed.</span> <span id="s127">We have to sleep.”</span> <span id="s128">And that was really very upsetting and as I said that took me a long time.</span> <span id="s129">I always like to know where I'm going to sleep.</span> <span id="s130">I don't like to go.</span> <span id="s131">I have to know where my bed is going to be.</span> <span id="s132">And we went to somebody's house who took us in for one night, that night, and again everybody whispered and it was really scary.</span> <span id="s133">People were being picked up on the street.</span> <span id="s134">And from then on, we went to several places.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">01:12:33</span></p> <p><span id="s136">Q: Did you actually see people being picked up?</span> <span id="s137">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s138">Q: And what were your thoughts as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s139">A: That I didn't know where they were going, and I didn't really get a lot of answers.</span> <span id="s140">I mean I was asking questions, but I guess my parents were...this was not the time for the truth.</span> <span id="s141">It was just time for me to be quiet and do what I was told.</span> <span id="s142">I remember very distinctly once taking issue with something that I had seen, and my mother gave me a very stern lecture and she said that if she says it's black and if I know that it is white, but if she said that it is black, it is black and I am never, ever to question because that's how people get killed.</span> <span id="s143">And this was not a time that people came up and said, "Are you Jewish," and my parents obviously were going to say no, and if I would have answered, "Oh, yes, we are Jewish.</span> <span id="s144">Why are you telling a lie?"</span> <span id="s145">That could get you into a lot of trouble.</span> <span id="s146">So I was really at a very young age told...was told to just do what I'm told and not to ask questions.</span></p> <p><span id="s147">01:13:28</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: Were you still wearing your star?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span> <span id="s150">No.</span> <span id="s151">At this time we were so serious.</span> <span id="s152">This was not admitting to being a Jew.</span> <span id="s153">This was hiding...uh...and my mother did not look Jewish.</span> <span id="s154">My father did.</span> <span id="s155">And, of course, it's very easy to determine if a man is Jewish or isn't, especially in those days so that my mother always did all the talking.</span> <span id="s156">And...uh...she was very competent and very strong willed and...uh...was able to handle these situations.</span> <span id="s157">We did go to somebody's house where we stayed for two weeks.</span> <span id="s158">Uh...A man worked for my father and my father gave him the position as superintendent of one of the houses, apartment houses, that my father owned, and he let us stay in the basement...uh...for a couple of days, and brought us food whenever he could.</span> <span id="s159">And a very nice family who I think was aware that something that was going on, told the superintendent...uh...that they were going to be away for quite awhile and sort of insinuating that without their knowledge but it's okay, if we stayed in their apartment.</span> <span id="s160">Uh...I don't think we ever met them, but that's what the superintendent told us, that it's okay for us to be taken to this spot.</span> <span id="s161">He would bring us a tray.</span> <span id="s162">There was a radio.</span> <span id="s163">Uh...We listened to...uh...Radio Free Europe, and this lady happened to have had the best collection of child...of children's books, and I remember reading Little Lord Fauntleroy and a lot of the children's classics.</span> <span id="s164">I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s165">I was a avid reader, and that was the only place during the war that there were books that I read.</span> <span id="s166">I used to remember taking a bath.</span> <span id="s167">I was too hot and I almost passed out.</span> <span id="s168">And one of the things that happened that I recall very clearly...and it's interesting because my mother just finished her interview and she didn't mention it...my father was having a kidney stone attack or had...we thought he had a kidney stone, and he was having an attack.</span> <span id="s169">And he had no choice.</span> <span id="s170">He had to go to a doctor.</span></p> <p><span id="s171">01:15:27 So he went and he left...uh...quite late in the afternoon so as...so as to be dark and my mother and I sat there wondering if he would ever return, if he was going to be caught or what.</span> <span id="s172">But he had to go because he had I guess ...I'm not sure but he must have had a kidney problem before because the choice was not to stay.</span> <span id="s173">It was not going to go away.</span> <span id="s174">Anyhow, he returned.</span> <span id="s175">I don't know what happened to the kidney or the stone, but he came back.</span> <span id="s176">And from then on, we went to a place in the country, a very beautiful house.</span> <span id="s177">And by this time, there was a lot of bombing going on because the Russians and Americans were bombing.</span> <span id="s178">The Germans were starting to lose the war, so their interest in the Jews were getting less except if they happened to see any, they shot them.</span> <span id="s179">But I mean, it was not as active involvement in killing the Jews as to save their necks because they were losing the war.</span> <span id="s180">I remember somebody being shot.</span> <span id="s181">I think it was a Russian or a German.</span> <span id="s182">I'm not sure.</span> <span id="s183">But I know there was a dead body, and somebody went out and stole their shoes or whatever they could off the body.</span> <span id="s184">But I don't really remember the details.</span> <span id="s185">I just know that this was a body and people went and stole things off the body because peple were now at this point didn't have shoes, didn't have clothes.</span> <span id="s186">The food situation was terrible.</span> <span id="s187">And I was an obnoxious, terrible eater.</span> <span id="s188">I still am.</span> <span id="s189">I don't eat if I don't like it.</span> <span id="s190">And most of the children just ate whatever there was to eat, including horsemeat off dead horses, but I was not having anything to do with that.</span> <span id="s191">So I had a hard time being fed because sometimes when something was found that was edible I save it up for a week and chop up little pieces of it and I would just eat it because I wouldn't eat if I didn't like it.</span></p> <p><span id="s192">01:17:16</span></p> <p><span id="s193">Q: What was your contact with other children then?</span></p> <p><span id="s194">A: Very little.</span> <span id="s195">At one point, we were being hidden and there was another child there.</span> <span id="s196">And that's when I was told that I was not to say that we were in hiding, that we were friends of the family.</span> <span id="s197">And I really don't remember too much about that.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: What were the living conditions at that point?</span> <span id="s199">A: Terrible.</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Can you describe them?</span></p> <p><span id="s201">A: We slept on the floor...on beds...as groups of people, together.</span> <span id="s202">I don't remember the sanitary conditions as far as baths or showers.</span> <span id="s203">I remember my mother mending things when they were torn.</span> <span id="s204">Wearing the same dress, you know, over and over again.</span> <span id="s205">Sometimes rinsing things out in little pails if there was enough time for it to dry to wear again.</span> <span id="s206">And then as the bombing got worse and worse, we moved.</span> <span id="s207">We didn't move, we walked to the countryside.</span> <span id="s208">I wouldn't call it a suburb.</span> <span id="s209">It was really countryside, village, peasants, a lot of poor people lived there.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">Q: Before we go into that, is there any story about your mother making a cake?</span> <span id="s211">01:18:30 A Oh, yes.</span> <span id="s212">This is as a matter of fact happened in the country.</span> <span id="s213">I was, as I said, a very bad eater and my mother, some way or other...out on a walk, saw some people that had some food and stole an egg.</span> <span id="s214">And out of this egg, she whipped up a I guess what you could call yellow cake thing and there was the one egg and I guess she had the other ingredients.</span> <span id="s215">So I ate that for a very, very long time.</span> <span id="s216">And then this...this was in the country and there was a lot of bombing going on.</span> <span id="s217">It was sort of getting towards the end of the war.</span> <span id="s218">We all slept on the floor.</span> <span id="s219">Usually I slept between my parents.</span> <span id="s220">The toilets there I remember, they were on the outside.</span> <span id="s221">We used to take trips to go to...to an outhouse kind of a thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: About how many people were with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: I don't know, but a lot.</span> <span id="s224">I think maybe a dozen or...I mean, not fifty or a hundred but maybe a couple of dozen people.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">Q: All Jews?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: No.</span> <span id="s227">Not Jews.</span> <span id="s228">At this point there was a mixture of people because the war was ending and people were hiding.</span> <span id="s229">There was...at this point in the war, people tried to keep alive from bombings that were going on.</span> <span id="s230">There were a lot of shooting and bombs and this all sorts of things going on as far as our physical safety.</span> <span id="s231">And at one point I remember and I was going to ask my mother and I don't remember but we were in front of the firing line.</span> <span id="s232">We Were lined up to be shot and I think they were by Russians, but then something happened and we all walked away.</span> <span id="s233">But I remmeber thinking that we were going to be shot.</span> <span id="s234">I mean, I was aware of the fact that there was a lineup and there were guns.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">01:20:20</span></p> <p><span id="s236">Q: Can you tell us a little bit about how you got into the line?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: We were...we were walking.</span> <span id="s238">We were walking from one place to another place, and we were caught.</span> <span id="s239">And whoever was with us...there were other people with us...</span></p> <p><span id="s240">Q: Who caught you?</span></p> <p><span id="s241">A: The...the soldiers.</span> <span id="s242">And...uh...and that's really all I remember.</span> <span id="s243">I don't really remember...I know there were bad guys, but I don't know whose side they were on.</span> <span id="s244">By this time, the Russians started coming.</span> <span id="s245">And they kept saying that they were winning the war, and there were not too many Germans around.</span></p> <p><span id="s246">Q: Do you remember being in the line?</span> <span id="s247">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s248">Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">Q: What...do you remember your feelings as a child?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s251">I was scared.</span> <span id="s252">I mean, I don't know if I thought about death as far as that's concerned, but I know that it was bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: How many people were in the line?</span> <span id="s254">A: I think two dozen.</span></p> <p><span id="s255">Q: And what were their feelings there?</span></p> <p><span id="s256">A: I mean, there was a lot of, you know, crying out and talking and negotiating and foreign languages and stuff like that.</span> <span id="s257">And then all of a sudden it was dispersed and we just walked away.</span> <span id="s258">And then we stated walking back toward Budapest because we were told that the Russians and the Americans and the English, liberation had occurred and that the Germans were gone.</span> <span id="s259">And it took a long time to come back because the roads were bad.</span> <span id="s260">There were a lot of bodies and still there was still some bombing going on because there were still groups of Germans all over the place.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">01:21:41</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: What was your reaction when you would see a dead body?</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: I just wanted to...oh, I think we were all very happy to see them, especially if they were German.</span> <span id="s264">I mean, there was like...like almost a game of...of Germans.</span> <span id="s265">I remember later when we were back in Budapest.</span> <span id="s266">I was back in school.</span> <span id="s267">The Germans were being hung outside on trees and stuff, and I remember everybody was very joyful and as a child, you just sort of go along with it and just...it almost becomes meaningless.</span> <span id="s268">You just walk through the bodies, and you're just happy you're alive.</span> <span id="s269">And we walked back...</span></p> <p><span id="s270">Q: Do you remember the physical exhaustion?</span></p> <p><span id="s271">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s272">Especially with a child, you know.</span> <span id="s273">You're always tired and you want to stop and you couldn't stop.</span> <span id="s274">You had to go to the next destination.</span></p> <p><span id="s275">01:22:30</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: What condition were your clothes in at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s277">A: Not very good.</span> <span id="s278">Funny, I don't remember anything about shoes.</span> <span id="s279">But I..</span> <span id="s280">.</span> <span id="s281">I..</span> <span id="s282">.</span> <span id="s283">just...I don't know.</span></p> <p><span id="s284">Of course, we were also cold, because by this time, you know, we had gone through the winter, and I remember being cold.</span> <span id="s285">I still am.</span> <span id="s286">I'm always cold.</span> <span id="s287">My hands are always cold.</span> <span id="s288">And my hands and feet were frozen and...</span></p> <p><span id="s289">Q: Did you ever leave your parents' side at this point?</span></p> <p><span id="s290">A: No.</span> <span id="s291">No.</span> <span id="s292">At one point, I was supposed to be sent to a convent.</span> <span id="s293">And also some arrangements were made.</span> <span id="s294">A lot of Jewish children were being sent to convents because the nuns were going to take care of them and save them.</span> <span id="s295">And then...I don't think I wanted to go and my parents just decided that we would all get through the whole thing together or...or not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s296">Q: Any question of conversion for you?</span></p> <p><span id="s297">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s298">Actually, before all this, we were told that...that...if you had non-Jewish papers, Catholic papers...by a certain date that you would be...considered a half-Jew and possibly not be taken to concentration camp or whatever.</span> <span id="s299">So we did acquire Catholic papers and my father didn't.</span> <span id="s300">My mother and I went to church and we learned whatever it is.</span> <span id="s301">I don't...Cath...whatever you call it.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Catechism.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: Catechism and the beads and all that kind of stuff.</span> <span id="s304">And we actually had to take a test or at least I remember taking one, and I remember reciting the...uh...what everyone recites, and so we had papers.</span> <span id="s305">I don't know of my mother still has them, but we had papers saying that we were converted.</span> <span id="s306">My father wouldn't do it, but he thought it would be a good protection for us.</span> <span id="s307">Subsequently it didn't help anybody anyhow because it was just another gimmick, but we did have the papers.</span></p> <p><span id="s308">Q: What was the attitude of priests and nuns during your classes and learning?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">A: Fine.</span> <span id="s310">They were happy to convert, and I guess they were hoping maybe ultimately that people would remain.</span> <span id="s311">And a lot did.</span> <span id="s312">A lot of people who came to this country when we came...families of my parents I knew had converted when they came to this country, raised their children as non-Jews.</span> <span id="s313">Well, we always remained Jewish and after the war was over the paper that was just a piece paper that may have saved our lives at the time, but it probably wouldn't have.</span> <span id="s314">So it sort of served its purpose.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">01:25:00</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: When you were out of the country, were you aware of what was happening in other parts of Europe and the work camps?</span> <span id="s317">Do your parents talk to you about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s319">Yes.</span> <span id="s320">By that time we were aware of concentration camps.</span> <span id="s321">I don't know if I personally knew what that meant and I think the grownups had difficulty acknowledging that there could be such a thing as...as...as ovens where they...where they gassed people.</span> <span id="s322">I mean, to comprehend that whole thing is...is very, very difficult.</span> <span id="s323">And a lot of people who should have at the time believed that it existed refused to believe it because it was so mind-boggling and I don't reallythink I had any particular feelings or total awareness of just exactly...I knew we were in hiding and I knew we were running away from being taken away.</span> <span id="s324">And then as we started coming back, I remember my father saying that if there was anybody in our home he would just kill them.</span> <span id="s325">Which is most unlikely because he was a very, very gentle man.</span> <span id="s326">But you do get angry.</span> <span id="s327">But I think it was when it was all over for us, I think it was a relief that it was over and some of the anger kind of went away.</span> <span id="s328">And I am an only child and since my parents and I survived together, that was already a good beginning.</span> <span id="s329">A tremendous amount of our relatives were gassed in Auschwitz.</span> <span id="s330">Most of these relatives being my grandmother's sisters, brothers, and their children.</span> <span id="s331">Then after the war were the horrors of identifying people.</span> <span id="s332">Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s333">Q: What were your thoughts as you were coming back to your apartment?</span> <span id="s334">A: I just wanted to go home.</span> <span id="s335">I had enough of all this.</span></p> <p><span id="s336">Q: So you went back to your apartment.</span> <span id="s337">What were your feelings?</span> <span id="s338">A: I went back to the apartment.</span> <span id="s339">Glad to be home.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">Q: What did you do when you got back?</span></p> <p><span id="s341">A: The apartment was a mess.</span> <span id="s342">Interestingly enough, the furniture and all, that was there.</span> <span id="s343">It was not totally destroyed.</span> <span id="s344">Windows were gone from bombings.</span> <span id="s345">This had nothing to do with the Germans.</span> <span id="s346">This was, you know, the shooting.</span> <span id="s347">And...life just short of started all over again.</span> <span id="s348">I went back to school.</span> <span id="s349">People found whoever they found.</span> <span id="s350">People cried.</span> <span id="s351">They cleaned up...the cleanup process was really the bodies and they were just all over the place.</span> <span id="s352">At our temple...in the backyard of the temple -- the court I guess is what you would call it -- became a graveyard for those who could not be identified or they were such...they were so totally disfigured that they were not recognized.</span> <span id="s353">My father went to identify people and, you know, one of the ways to identify these bodies that were practically not recognizable through their teeth, through dental something.</span> <span id="s354">I'm not sure what, but it was like their teeth or through birthmarks, stuff like that.</span> <span id="s355">So that was a horrible experience.</span></p> <p><span id="s356">01:27:59</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: This is something you witnessed?</span> <span id="s358">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s359">And...uh...</span></p> <p><span id="s360">Q: And your thoughts when you would see sights like this?</span></p> <p><span id="s361">A: Scared.</span> <span id="s362">And...but I guess it's interesting, you know, from a child's point of view, because I..</span> <span id="s363">.</span> <span id="s364">I was with my parents.</span> <span id="s365">I always felt a certain amount of security and that I really think is what helped me come out of it fairly well-adjusted, I guess.</span> <span id="s366">For a long time as an adult in this country or as a young adult, I never wanted to go anywhere without knowing where I'm going to sleep and I do not like sirens because we always ran to the shelter and I always knew that when the bombing started that there was the potential of being killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s367">Q: What kind of shelters did you go to?</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: Well, when we were still living in our house, there was...the basements, became bomb shelters ad they were not set up with first aid.</span> <span id="s369">There were underground facilities under the building, and whenever the bombings and sirens went off, everybody ran to the shelters.</span></p> <p><span id="s370">Q: What did you take with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s371">A: Nothing.</span> <span id="s372">Just whatever we had.</span> <span id="s373">Some food, if there was any to be had.</span> <span id="s374">A flashlight, that kind of thing.</span> <span id="s375">As a child, you were just sort of dragged along to go and be quiet, and that was a safe place to be and when the...uh...when it was over, then you came back up again.</span> <span id="s376">And at this point it was obvious that many buildings were bombed out and sometimes people died.</span> <span id="s377">So, you know, toward the end of the war, you didn't know if you were going to survive because...or not survvie because you were a Jew or just because you could get killed from the bombs.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Did you ever talk about not surviving with your parents?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: No.</span> <span id="s380">No.</span> <span id="s381">And so by 1945 we were back home.</span> <span id="s382">My father tried to get his business back and for a while it looked like everything was going to go back to normal, but then the Russians sort of started taking over what the Germans had taken over before.</span> <span id="s383">And my grandparents had come to this country in 1939 to visit the World's Fair and my grandfather I guess he was smarter than most of us, had planned to stay.</span> <span id="s384">He just didn't tell my grandmother because she wouldn't have left.</span> <span id="s385">And so we came out here to this country in 1947.</span> <span id="s386">It took a while to get papers and visas and all that kind of stuff.</span></p> <p><span id="s387">01:30:30</span></p> <p><span id="s388">Q: When you first came back to the apartment, did you try to look up friends?</span> <span id="s389">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s390">Q: Some survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">A: Oh, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: What did you talk about with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: Most of my friends were children of my parents' friends and they all survived.</span> <span id="s394">And I think we were just really talking about all the things that happened and busy listening or not listening to each other's stories.</span> <span id="s395">A lot of these youngsters...well, they're not youngsters any more, they're my age.</span> <span id="s396">A lot of them are in the States and Canada.</span> <span id="s397">Somehave stayed in Budapest.</span> <span id="s398">I have not stayed in touch with any of them.</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: What are some of your feelings about leaving Budapest to come to this country.</span> <span id="s400">A: I didn't want to leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s401">Q: Why not?</span></p> <p><span id="s402">A: Well, that was my home.</span> <span id="s403">I mean, after...after the war was over, there were my friends.</span> <span id="s404">There was my family, whatever there was, and it was an adventure coming here and we came through Paris and then we went to England and we sailed on the Mauretania, which doesn't exist any more, but it was a Cunard Line and we travelled first class.</span> <span id="s405">It was a wonderful trip.</span> <span id="s406">And then when we came here, it was a very, very new life for everybody.</span> <span id="s407">But a child adjusts very quickly.</span></p> <p><span id="s408">01:31:47</span></p> <p><span id="s409">Q: Did your father have any experience with Adolph Eichmann?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s411">My father, because he was an important person in the Jewish community, met anybody and everybody that came to do any kind of negotiating and basically Eichmann wanted money from the Jewish community and the wealthy Hungarian Jewish Community had a great deal of money and he made all sorts of deals to promise to release some people or take less people to prison camps for money.</span> <span id="s412">So it was a trade.</span> <span id="s413">And my father was in on some of the negotiations.</span> <span id="s414">They were not intimate friends, but as my mother told the story, that he was a perfect gentleman and elegantly dressed, as all Germans were, as opposed to the Russians, who were boors and did not, you know, their uniforms were not as the Germans' were.</span> <span id="s415">The Germans always were saluted and were, you know, in their own horrible way were always perfectly behaved.</span> <span id="s416">Such as Eichmann who obviously was not a perfect gentleman otherwise.</span> <span id="s417">And the Russians were...were just the opposite.</span> <span id="s418">But when the war was over, there were a lot of American soldiers were and my parents became quite friendly with some of them.</span> <span id="s419">And the, as I said, the wheels started working...to my father, was not really thrilled about coming to this country in the beginning.</span> <span id="s420">I mean, he thought that everything was just...that was his home, and...</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: What were your feelings to go out on the streets as a child when the freedom came about?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">Were you...did your parents let you go out after the war was over?</span></p> <p><span id="s423">01:33:36</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s425">No...after the war was over, for your own personal safety, there was no...there was no more problem.</span> <span id="s426">Very slowly it was really the government, because of the Russians, the Americans left and and the Russians stayed.</span> <span id="s427">But that took a while.</span></p> <p><span id="s428">Q: Did you go back to school?</span></p> <p><span id="s429">A: Oh, yes, I went back to school.</span> <span id="s430">01:34:00</span></p> <p><span id="s431">Q: And what were your experiences with your non-Jewish classmates?</span></p> <p><span id="s432">A: It all passed.</span> <span id="s433">As a matter of fact, one of my best friends was non-Jewish, and at one point after coming out to this country, I tried to bring her out because she was having hard times there.</span> <span id="s434">And I tried through a Jewish agency and through a Catholic agency to bring her out and then I lost track.</span> <span id="s435">But I never had any...my only experience with...with so-called anitsemitism besides the large scale of things was with one child who said she couldn't play with me because I was Jewish.</span> <span id="s436">But otherwise, it was not a one-to-one thing.</span> <span id="s437">It was the whole world was collapsing and being Jewish I was part of that world.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: But you didn't feel singled out at school after the war was all over?</span> <span id="s439">A: No.</span> <span id="s440">Not at all.</span></p> <p><span id="s441">01:34:50</span></p> <p><span id="s442">Q: And then what were your thoughts as you were travelling from city to city to come to the United States?</span></p> <p><span id="s443">A: Well, that part was really...again, it was a very nice trip.</span> <span id="s444">It was a pleasure trip coming out.</span> <span id="s445">I mean, we weren't running away with...with clothes on our backs.</span> <span id="s446">By this time, my father had acquired some of his properties back.</span> <span id="s447">We weren't penniless.</span> <span id="s448">We weren't escaping.</span> <span id="s449">We packed our belongings and we were taking a trip.</span> <span id="s450">We had left options that if my parents didn't like it here to come back, to go back to Budapest.</span> <span id="s451">Things were packed, ready to be shipped if we had said to ship it or not.And as I said, wecame out first class and my grandfather was here.</span> <span id="s452">My uncle was here.</span> <span id="s453">We had relatives here.</span> <span id="s454">It was a difficult adjustment for my parents.</span> <span id="s455">New language.</span> <span id="s456">New country.</span> <span id="s457">Different lifestyle.</span> <span id="s458">My father was a very prominent person in Budapest, and here he wasn't.</span> <span id="s459">So it took a long time for him to adjust...and probably a little bit faster for my mother.</span> <span id="s460">But I went to school.</span> <span id="s461">I literally got off the boat, went to camp, and then went to school.</span> <span id="s462">And except for the fact that I spoke with an accent and I was probably a little embarrassed that my parents did, I just became an American teenager.</span></p> <p><span id="s463">01:36:10</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Where did you settle?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: In New York.</span> <span id="s466">I lived in New York all my young and old adult life.</span> <span id="s467">I went to schools in Manhattan and I have one daughter and three grandsons.</span> <span id="s468">And that's the story.</span> <span id="s469">I think that I got involved with the Holocaust Musuem...actually, my daughter had pointed out to me about a year ago a New York magazine had written an article about the Hidden Children Conference that had taken place last year in the summer, and she thought it would be something...something I should look into.</span> <span id="s470">And I did.</span> <span id="s471">And I did attend the Conference and I realize that with my generation...it's kind of the end of the road for the people that have been there, that participated.</span> <span id="s472">That after me it's just history, which is very different from having been there.</span> <span id="s473">And I think that's for us who...whatever way participated in the war, it's very important to record the history, to tell our children and their children.</span> <span id="s474">And when I attended the Conference, I went with mixed feelings, thinking, you know, the war is over.</span> <span id="s475">This was fifty or forty years ago.</span> <span id="s476">What am I doing here?</span> <span id="s477">And I found the Conference very, very moving.</span> <span id="s478">I found a lot fo Hungarians.</span> <span id="s479">Some from similar and some from different backgrounds.</span> <span id="s480">A lot of the nationalities formed support groups within themselves.</span> <span id="s481">The Hungarian women of my generation formed a group.</span> <span id="s482">The Hungarian women that have been meeting monthly and during the Conference besides meetings and people still searching for each other and people finding each other...there was also a large library of books on the Holcaust.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">01:38:17 And I bought one book: the name of it was Remember Never to Forget.</span> <span id="s484">And it was a book written for children in a very simplistic way with pictures, black and white barbed wire, but nothing particularly scary, certainly if you don't know what it's all about.</span> <span id="s485">And I bought the book thinking that one of the days when my grandchildren are old enough, I will read it to them.</span> <span id="s486">And I forgot all about it.</span> <span id="s487">And this summer I took my oldest grandson who is six and a half to the train to pick up somebody and as we were standing at the train station, he raised his right hand in sort of a Hitler salute and said, "Heil Hitler."</span> <span id="s488">And I was very upset and I tried very hard not to scare him.</span> <span id="s489">He didn't think he was doing anything bad.</span> <span id="s490">And we sat down on a bench and I said, "Adam, I don't ever want you to say that again, and I want to tell you a little bit about who Hitler was, what he did, and how it affected me."</span> <span id="s491">And he really was fascinated.</span> <span id="s492">He's a very bright little boy and he's very curious.</span> <span id="s493">And I said, "When we go home, I have a book that I'm going to read to you," which I subsequently did.</span> <span id="s494">But the reason he did this "Heil Hitler", because we had been watching "The Sound of Music", and he loved the music and that was one of the salutes.</span> <span id="s495">So that's where it all came from.</span> <span id="s496">But the concept was still there and I had to get rid of his other brothers, because they really were too young, and he and I went into a room and read this story.</span> <span id="s497">And since then he has very often asked me to tell him stories.</span></p> <p><span id="s498">Q: Any other final message you would like to leave?</span> <span id="s499">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s500">It should never happen again.</span> <span id="s501">That's it.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s503">Well, thank you very much.</span> <span id="s504">A: Thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s505">01:40:07</span></p></body></html>
