that?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">A: Let me write it down.</span> <span id="s14">It was a nickname, Dzidzia, something like this.</span> <span id="s15">It was quite popular nickname in Poland and I was known as Dzidzia from my schooldays till before the war.</span> <span id="s16">For a long time, I was an only child and I loved the status of being the only child and loved by everyone, the center of attention, of course.</span> <span id="s17">I had a small puppy that I loved but she passed away as a puppy.</span> <span id="s18">But later on I had a sister.</span> <span id="s19">My sister was, in my life, played a special role because she was nine years younger than me.</span> <span id="s20">I treated her something between my toy and between my child.</span> <span id="s21">It was very, very, very nice feeling.</span> <span id="s22">My mother was wise enough to keep me believing that I’m the one who is responsible for my sister.</span> <span id="s23">My friends at school were very jealous.</span> <span id="s24">Nobody had such a small sister or brother around.</span> <span id="s25">I could tell you about my childhood.</span> <span id="s26">It was a very happy childhood, nothing ---</span></p> <p><span id="s27">Q: Did you live in a suburb of Warsaw or in the city?</span></p> <p><span id="s28">A: No, I lived in the center of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s29">My father was a lawyer and we lived in a big, big apartment.</span> <span id="s30">Those old days, everybody had maids, everybody who -- middle-class people had maids.</span> <span id="s31">It’s such a distant and different life.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Your parents -- you came from a Jewish family?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: It’s very, very hard to say about -- that my family was a Jewish family.</span> <span id="s34">We were Jewish because my parents were converts.</span> <span id="s35">So it wasn’t strictly Jewish family.</span> <span id="s36">I was raised more in Christian traditions than Jewish tradition.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">Q: Your family --your parents had both converted to Catholicism?</span></p> <p><span id="s38">A: My father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant.</span> <span id="s39">On my father’s family was a family of assimilators.</span> <span id="s40">Is that the right word?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">Q: Were they assimilated?</span> <span id="s42">But the father’s parents were Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s43">A: Well, it takes some more explaining.</span> <span id="s44">They were, by faith they were Jewish, my father’s family.</span> <span id="s45">My father’s family was quite known and I would even say my famous father in Poland.</span> <span id="s46">My ---</span></p> <p><span id="s47">Q: The name was Winawer?</span></p> <p><span id="s48">A: Winawer.</span> <span id="s49">My father’s cousin was a very well known writer, a play writer My father’s grandfather was, oh my goodness, famous chess player.</span> <span id="s50">He won a --, He was best in Europe.</span> <span id="s51">He won a tournament -- how do you say it?</span> <span id="s52">He was a ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">Q: Champion?</span></p> <p><span id="s54">A: Champion, maybe once, maybe.</span> <span id="s55">But he was a European champion.</span> <span id="s56">But he felt Polish because in those old years, it was a very strong movement of assimilation.</span> <span id="s57">Jewish intelligentsia, you know the word?</span> <span id="s58">-- was very Polonized</span></p> <p><span id="s59">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">A: So on my father’s side it was very natural that he felt more Polish than Jewish and his change of -- conversion didn’t bother anybody.</span> <span id="s61">I think.</span> <span id="s62">But on my mother’s side, it was a different story because her family was more Jewish, more traditional and more Jewish.</span> <span id="s63">There were some misunderstandings between my mother and her mother but ---</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Did you ever see them?</span></p> <p><span id="s65">A: Well, I, yes.</span> <span id="s66">My grandmother lived in Lodz.</span> <span id="s67">It’s a big, big city.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: Oh, sure I know Lodz.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: Big Jewish and German population.</span> <span id="s70">She used to come over for to visit us twice a year.</span> <span id="s71">Stay for a few weeks.</span> <span id="s72">There was always some misunderstanding about synagogue, about Christmas, about something.</span> <span id="s73">I felt it.</span> <span id="s74">It wasn’t very open but I felt there was some tension about religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s75">Q: Did you have any religious instruction, any formal --?</span></p> <p><span id="s76">A: No, because my parents weren’t very religious people.</span> <span id="s77">They -- it’s really hard to understand in America why people change the faith.</span> <span id="s78">Only to show that the sort of belonging to Polish society or something.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: I think it was in Europe and in Poland especially, it was a form of social mobility.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Maybe.</span></p> <p><span id="s81">Q Definitely, definitely.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">A: For my father, it was sort of patriotism.</span> <span id="s83">Maybe, he was very young, it was very naïve, it wasn’t very wise, what he did.</span> <span id="s84">On my mother’s side, it was because she -- my father wasn’t Jew.</span> <span id="s85">I don’t how the situation was between Jewish and not Jewish marriage but I think that my mother wanted to -- wanted some change, wanted to confirm to my father’s standards or something like this.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: But it’s interesting then, that number one, that she chose Protestant, and number two, that he wasn’t a Polish Pole, he was formerly of a Jewish --.</span> <span id="s87">You know they still had --.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: Difference of religion, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s89">Q: They still came from that background and that’s --.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">A: It was some but it --.</span> <span id="s91">The times were utmost political, atmosphere and social atmosphere changed do quickly in Poland so some things that in 1921 or 1920 were appropriate might be less appropriate in 1927 when my mother got married.</span> <span id="s92">I never asked my parents; I just accepted the situation that my father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant and children were Protestant too.</span> <span id="s93">So I --.</span> <span id="s94">We had two Jewish, two Jewish girls in our class.</span> <span id="s95">They were taught religion by a rabbi and I was taught religion by pastor.</span> <span id="s96">Jews didn’t, Jewish girls didn’t feel, felt ill at ease being Jewish.</span> <span id="s97">It was such an atmosphere in Poland.</span> <span id="s98">I don’t know why it was like this but it was like this.</span> <span id="s99">We used to go to Protestant school.</span></p> <p><span id="s100">Q: And you didn’t feel different?</span> <span id="s101">I spoke with Jana in Boston.</span> <span id="s102">She said even though she was raised with these Catholic parents, she knew they were different.</span> <span id="s103">She knew something about her family was different than all the other Catholic people, you know.</span> <span id="s104">Did you have a sense of that?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Well, something was different but it wasn’t different because of religion.</span> <span id="s106">It was different because of, I don’t know, because of what.</span> <span id="s107">Because I think that my parents were more independent people than most people around.</span> <span id="s108">More free-thinking, free- thinkers, more -- well, better educated or something like this.</span> <span id="s109">More open mind.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: What was your mother’s education</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: My mother’s formal education wasn’t very, very high.</span> <span id="s112">She was an orphan, well not complete orphan.</span> <span id="s113">Her father died when she was thirteen.</span> <span id="s114">My grandmother married at the age of sixteen with no education at all so when she widowed, she was widowed at the age of 33 with three teenager, or two teenagers and one small girl.</span> <span id="s115">It was the end of the war, end of the First World War in 1917 and they went through a real terrible poverty.</span> <span id="s116">My mother was extremely brave and industrious and ambitious and beautiful.</span> <span id="s117">You can see now that she was a --.</span> <span id="s118">She didn’t accept -- she was more like American women, not Polish.</span> <span id="s119">She was -- she didn’t accept the whole situation of being poor and poorly educated and living in lower middle class family.</span> <span id="s120">She, as an extern, she tried to -- she got a high school diploma but she didn’t finish high school.</span> <span id="s121">She had diploma, went for exams, extern, is this the right word?</span> <span id="s122">No, you don’t say this.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">Q: External student or something --?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Something like you can say.</span> <span id="s125">She took any chance she had in life to be among interesting people, to learn things and to see the world.</span> <span id="s126">She spent few years in France.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: How did she do that?</span> <span id="s128">She just --?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: She was a student.</span> <span id="s130">She gave lessons, she taught, she worked as a tutor, she sometimes -- she was a tutor, living with a family, she was very popular with people, very, very easy to make friends.</span> <span id="s131">When she married my father, she had some few years of college but she didn’t finish college.</span> <span id="s132">But she had many talents, many interests.</span> <span id="s133">She was interested in art.</span> <span id="s134">She was a -- she became a real -- she got a real knowledge in art, especially in china, in oriental rugs.</span> <span id="s135">During the war, when we were alone and my father went to the army, she started buying and selling things.</span> <span id="s136">She sort of entered, this is how we survived the war because she was able to earn money.</span> <span id="s137">After the war when it was forbidden and very, very dangerous, she did the same.</span> <span id="s138">So my parents were well-to-do people.</span> <span id="s139">I never went through, never is not the right word, but most of the war, most of the time, the wartime, we were well to do.</span> <span id="s140">We were well-to-do in the sense that we weren’t hungry.</span> <span id="s141">We and friends of my parents and relatives of my parents had always at least one meal fixed at my parent’s table.</span></p> <p><span id="s142">Q: Can we back up a little bit?</span> <span id="s143">I have --.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Yeah, sure because I --.</span> <span id="s145">It’s the -- if you start the story of your life, you are extremely poorly organized, unorganized.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: That’s fine because we’ll just jump a little, no problem.</span> <span id="s147">What about your schooling?</span> <span id="s148">Where did you go to school?</span> <span id="s149">Did you go to private school?</span></p> <p><span id="s150">A: I went -- it was a private school and the name of the school was -- very long name.</span> <span id="s151">It was a private school supported and -- not supported by --</span></p> <p><span id="s152">Q: It was run or founded by --?</span></p> <p><span id="s153">A: Founded from and something more.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: You want to look it up?</span></p> <p><span id="s155">A: No, I can’t because I don’t remember even in Polish, the right word.</span> <span id="s156">Under the help, under the supervision and help of Lutheran, Lutheran Church.</span> <span id="s157">There were two schools, one Rey school, that school was old, very well known in Poland, in Warsaw for boys.</span> <span id="s158">After the First World War, there was parallel school for girls opened by the same Lutheran Church, Ana Vasa School.</span> <span id="s159">She was a sister of Polish king from 16th century.</span> <span id="s160">They were Protestants and they patronized, the patron of the school was that Protestant princess of the past.</span> <span id="s161">The school, Rey High School was very well established and often very high -- highly accepted school.</span> <span id="s162">The Vasa School was more for girls but it was okay, was okay.</span> <span id="s163">The atmosphere was very liberal.</span> <span id="s164">Everybody was well bred, tactful and I didn’t feel I felt at home there.</span> <span id="s165">I didn’t feel any of that I didn’t belong; I belonged.</span> <span id="s166">I belonged perfectly well.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: The education there, was it equivalent or better than a gymnasium?</span> <span id="s168">Or is it at the level of a gymnasium?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: I didn’t go that far because when the --.</span></p> <p><span id="s170">Q: When the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s171">A: Yes, I finished -- I was in elementary school.</span> <span id="s172">It was fifth grade, I finished fifth grade and I started sixth grade.</span> <span id="s173">Then the trouble started.</span></p> <p><span id="s174">Q: Now, can I ask --?</span> <span id="s175">Did you have any -- did you take ballet lessons, or any music lessons or anything like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: Music lessons, not ballet because I had no talents.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Me either.</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: Very poor ear for music, no talents for dance, nothing for drawing.</span> <span id="s179">I had only very bad marks in all of those subjects.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">Q: Did you enjoy to read or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Read, yes.</span> <span id="s182">I was good in reading, in history, in writing.</span></p> <p><span id="s183">Q: Okay, well--.</span></p> <p><span id="s184">A: I had extremely nice, sweet teacher of religion.</span> <span id="s185">She was a saint.</span> <span id="s186">She never, ever --.</span> <span id="s187">Sometimes Christianity is in conflict with Judaism but it wasn’t the case.</span> <span id="s188">I never felt that something against Jews in my teaching of religion, what I learned in my religion lessons.</span> <span id="s189">I didn’t feel anything, anything wrong about my double person, my double personality at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: You didn’t even feel that it was a double one, it was --?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: No, I knew it wasn’t a secret.</span> <span id="s192">It wasn’t a secret, it wasn’t anything to keep in hiding, the past.</span> <span id="s193">My family was very proud of being part of -- of being one of the Winawers.</span> <span id="s194">It was very special thing that my father tried to explain me before he -- when he visited me before he died.</span> <span id="s195">It was a last visit like saying goodbye, and we were very open with each other.</span> <span id="s196">He told me, it’s very hard to explain but I felt more Polish than Jewish.</span> <span id="s197">It didn’t have anything to do with my religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s198">Q: That’s understandable.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: It wasn’t like trying to hide whatever you were.</span> <span id="s200">My parents were Jewish friends and the best friends didn’t feel like my parents.</span> <span id="s201">They felt very, how to say it --, rebellious.</span> <span id="s202">They felt Jewish and rebellious.</span> <span id="s203">It wasn’t to conform to Polish standards.</span> <span id="s204">It wasn’t done to conform to anything, it was sort of emotional attitude.</span></p> <p><span id="s205">Q: Did your family ever -- your parents’ best friends then were Jewish?</span> <span id="s206">Did they ever spend any holidays or anything like that with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s207">A: No, they weren’t that religious, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: Oh, okay.</span> <span id="s209">I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s210">A: It was young generation.</span> <span id="s211">You never, ever saw in Poland any Jewish holiday, any Seder, any Passover or anything like this.</span> <span id="s212">I’m sorry.</span> <span id="s213">I’m very sorry.</span> <span id="s214">I wish I knew more about Jewish tradition but I had no chance to.</span> <span id="s215">People, young people weren’t religious.</span></p> <p><span id="s216">Q: They were being progressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s217">A: They were progressive.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Okay, I understand.</span> <span id="s219">We’ve established a little bit about your childhood.</span> <span id="s220">Did you play with your friends?</span> <span id="s221">Your sister was so much younger, I assume she was just a baby when most of this started.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">A: She was a baby.</span> <span id="s223">I had a grandaunt, takes long time.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: I just keep an eye on it so when I need to switch it --.</span></p> <p><span id="s225">A: Don’t let people talk.</span> <span id="s226">When they start talking, they can’t stop.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: That’s what I want.</span> <span id="s228">I want you to talk.</span> <span id="s229">I have five tapes here.</span> <span id="s230">If you want to fill them up, go ahead.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: I talk --.</span> <span id="s232">I had an aunt in Warsaw suburbs, in Podkowa Lesna.</span> <span id="s233">It was something like _________place we are living here.</span> <span id="s234">Every Sunday, she wasn’t married, she lived with her old charming father.</span> <span id="s235">I was the only child in the family and I used to go to visit her from almost every Saturday and Sunday.</span> <span id="s236">From Saturday to Sunday evening, and I had friends over there.</span> <span id="s237">We played together.</span> <span id="s238">Of course, I had other friends in the town too but it wasn’t like American suburban life.</span> <span id="s239">Visiting friends was a big happening because big city, long distance to go everywhere.</span> <span id="s240">So it was always planned, planned event.</span> <span id="s241">Mostly planned for two days, usually from Saturday to Sunday with -- oh, it was very exciting.</span> <span id="s242">I had some friends in my building too.</span> <span id="s243">We played together.</span> <span id="s244">Before the war, there wasn’t --.</span> <span id="s245">I didn’t go downstairs to play in the yard but I visited my friends in my building.</span> <span id="s246">It was such a typical life of a child, nothing --.</span></p> <p><span id="s247">Q: Nothing out of the ordinary?</span></p> <p><span id="s248">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s249">QL Would you like to discuss then about what happened to your family when -- in 1939 when the war broke out?</span></p> <p><span id="s250">A: The first thing happened it was raining like this, just before the -- like today, the night before the war, maybe two nights earlier, maybe three nights earlier.</span> <span id="s251">I was stupid enough to leave a book that I was reading, to leave my book outside and the rain damaged the book.</span> <span id="s252">The book didn’t belong to me; it belonged to my mother’s friend’s daughter and I was so scared, I didn’t know what to do to hide the book but those people didn’t let me go without returning the book, I knew that.</span> <span id="s253">They were very strict.</span> <span id="s254">So war broke out and I was so happy now, I’m saved, I’m saved.</span> <span id="s255">And no school, no school because --.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: That was good, you liked that?</span></p> <p><span id="s257">A: Oh, it was great!</span> <span id="s258">It was fantastic!</span> <span id="s259">It was extremely exciting happening but before this great, fantastic thing happened, some bad things happened before.</span> <span id="s260">In August 1939, last month before the war broke out, my parents went for vacation for a week or two.</span> <span id="s261">Left my grandmother, the grandmother that I told you about, from Lodz, me, my little daughter and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s262">Q: Your little sister.</span></p> <p><span id="s263">A: My little sister and some, oh, some maid who worked for --.</span> <span id="s264">But my mother had a younger sister.</span> <span id="s265">She lived in France.</span> <span id="s266">My mother always worried about her because she married very young.</span> <span id="s267">She didn’t finish any school.</span> <span id="s268">She was very unbalanced, emotionally unbalanced.</span> <span id="s269">She had a very bad marriage.</span> <span id="s270">They were -- her husband was communist and they were deported from France to Poland.</span> <span id="s271">My mother’s sister with her small son, Claude came to stay with us for two weeks, for three weeks.</span> <span id="s272">Part of the time my parents were out.</span> <span id="s273">This was the only time in my life, I met my cousin Claude.</span> <span id="s274">He came from France.</span> <span id="s275">He hated everything Polish.</span> <span id="s276">He -- looking at them I had a premonition of what will happen to us because they were so poor, so -- they were deportees.</span> <span id="s277">They had no work -- his; Claude’s parents, had no work.</span> <span id="s278">They didn’t belong anywhere because they didn’t belong to France, they didn’t belong to Poland.</span> <span id="s279">They were victim of some social forces that we became later.</span> <span id="s280">They perished in the, perished in Holocaust.</span> <span id="s281">They were in Lodz ghetto and they perished and they probably were the first to die from hunger because they were not able to work.</span> <span id="s282">They were not able to work in normal conditions not only in Lodz ghetto which was terrible place to live in.</span> <span id="s283">That small child, that Claude and my aunt, whom I didn’t like and I didn’t know well; I hardly knew them, never -- are still with me.</span> <span id="s284">I -- did you see the picture of Mr. Lanzmann from Shoah?</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: Oh yes, Shoah.</span></p> <p><span id="s286">A: Shoah and they look --.</span> <span id="s287">His name is Claude and he looks exactly like my cousin Claude because they were the same age, the same family, the same -- very similar kind of family, Polish emigrants.</span> <span id="s288">It’s such a similarity between them.</span> <span id="s289">I can’t ever forget them.</span> <span id="s290">My grandmother lived with is in Warsaw and during the time, wartime, she didn’t get any letter from her daughter in Lodz ghetto.</span> <span id="s291">It was sort of constant, constant tragedy that was killing her.</span></p> <p><span id="s292">Q: Can I ask you what type of awareness did you have of the rise of Nazism in Germany and Austria?</span> <span id="s293">Did you have a sense of danger?</span></p> <p><span id="s294">A: I had something before my aunt Helenka and Claude came to visit us.</span> <span id="s295">I had another experience with Nazism, not with Germans but Nazi Germany deported Jews who were born in Poland in 1937.</span> <span id="s296">It was sort of obligation, sort of moral obligation of everybody who belonged to the Jewish, somehow to Jewish community, to help them.</span> <span id="s297">My mother took a young girl, was maybe 19, maybe 20, gave her a job of teaching me in German and sort of like being governess.</span> <span id="s298">It wasn’t exactly governess but something like teacher and governess, something in between.</span> <span id="s299">She was boring, stupid and I didn’t want to learn German but she was -- on the other hand, I knew she was so poor, she was so troubled.</span> <span id="s300">She didn’t feel happy, she was so out of place.</span> <span id="s301">It was bad experience but I thought that it’s my fault.</span></p> <p><span id="s302">Q: Did she live in your home with you?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: No, she used to come over well, twice a week or so.</span> <span id="s304">That -- our relation didn’t last long because we didn’t -- it didn’t work at all.</span> <span id="s305">She didn’t, she wasn’t born to be teacher or governess or anything like this.</span> <span id="s306">She wasn’t any companion to me either.</span> <span id="s307">I didn’t -- but I know that was something, always sort of talking about helping those people.</span> <span id="s308">I had, in my school, the school wasn’t anti-Semitic, in my school, there was a girl -- too long?</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: No, a few more minutes and I’ll flip it.</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: There was a girl from -- deported from Austria.</span> <span id="s311">Her name was Ingeborga.</span> <span id="s312">Her parents didn’t speak Polish at all; they spoke German.</span> <span id="s313">She was very poor and during the war, I had a special relation with her but this is the story later.</span> <span id="s314">I will tell you later on.</span> <span id="s315">It was only two people I knew, two deportees I knew from Germany.</span> <span id="s316">I didn’t know, I didn’t, we didn’t, we children didn’t take German seriously.</span> <span id="s317">There was something so -- Poland was strong and prepared for war and the whole world was supposed to help Poland.</span> <span id="s318">No, Germans were something to make fun of.</span> <span id="s319">I was only ten and eleven.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Did you know, did your parents have a sense of the German racial laws and things like that?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: You are kidding!</span> <span id="s322">Of course they did!</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: I mean, they felt -- they knew that the extreme danger that was posed by --?</span></p> <p><span id="s324">A: They knew but somehow people didn’t know -- there was some blockage in the heads.</span> <span id="s325">Your imagination can’t go that far.</span> <span id="s326">You have to have some experience to imagine things.</span> <span id="s327">If you don’t experience things like that, you can’t --.</span> <span id="s328">They knew that life would be very hard but there was always hope that the war won’t break out.</span> <span id="s329">There was always hope that Hitler will stop.</span> <span id="s330">This was sort of loyalty.</span> <span id="s331">You can’t escape from place where the others have to live, you know.</span> <span id="s332">This is something not honorable.</span> <span id="s333">My father was, it was so romantic generation, not --.</span></p> <p><span id="s334">Q: Well, I’m going to put the tape over and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s335">(End of Side A, Tape 1)</span></p> <p><span id="s336">A: Away from returning the book because my father, try to think of, the war broke out, my father was in Warsaw because we were on vacation in the suburbs in Podkowa Lesna and my father used to come over for, in the evening or sometimes for weekends only.</span> <span id="s337">On the 4th of September, my father came over in his small, very, very small car, small Fiat, very small.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: You had a car?</span> <span id="s339">That’s a sign of affluence.</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: Yes, yes.</span> <span id="s341">My parents were, my father was a lawyer.</span> <span id="s342">It was -- he was in his late thirties at the time.</span> <span id="s343">He was born in 1899 so he was forty the time.</span> <span id="s344">He was in peak of his career; he was very well --.</span> <span id="s345">He had big clientele, he was very well known lawyer, hard working lawyer and very clever.</span> <span id="s346">My father said we have to go back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s347">Things are getting dangerous.</span> <span id="s348">So he packed all of us into the small car.</span> <span id="s349">We left everything that we had at home.</span> <span id="s350">Wasn’t anything very valuable and we went back to Warsaw.</span> <span id="s351">Next day, my father said to my mother, I love you all but I love my country more; or something like this.</span> <span id="s352">He kissed us goodbye and went to fight for the country.</span> <span id="s353">He left my mother with two years old and me and everything -- no money because somehow people weren’t prepared.</span> <span id="s354">If he had anything, he didn’t have it home -- maybe in bank, maybe clients were --.</span> <span id="s355">It was a normal, regular life like every day, day like every day from financial point of view.</span> <span id="s356">It was a -- the war started this way for almost everybody with not mentally prepared for it, for the change.</span> <span id="s357">My mother and -- the bombardment started and there was no food in the stores.</span> <span id="s358">The stores were shut closed.</span> <span id="s359">Well, every day was worse than the day before.</span> <span id="s360">My sister became ill, sick and she got a very high fever and she was dying.</span> <span id="s361">She was dying and I don’t know how far you want to go into gossip, into small things.</span></p> <p><span id="s362">Q: This is fine, this is fine.</span></p> <p><span id="s363">A: We lived on, I didn’t give you my address.</span> <span id="s364">But you don’t want it --.</span></p> <p><span id="s365">Q: I’m sure.</span> <span id="s366">Why don’t you tell me?</span> <span id="s367">Tell it on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s368">A: It was Kapucynska Street.</span> <span id="s369">I lived on Kapucynska 15 in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s370">It was a very small street with dead end so the traffic was limited.</span> <span id="s371">It was inhabited mostly by lawyers because the court was very close --- the court and a land registry.</span> <span id="s372">I don’t know how you -- or whatever it is the place I --.</span> <span id="s373">Can you stop?</span></p> <p><span id="s374">Q: Yeah, sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: There was a --.</span> <span id="s376">Can you stop again?</span> <span id="s377">I have this --.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: Sure. . . .</span> <span id="s379">Okay so you were telling me about --?</span></p> <p><span id="s380">A: About that strange street we lived on with historic monuments, with monastery, Capuchin.</span> <span id="s381">Capuchin monastery with big, big garden; so it was very quiet place.</span> <span id="s382">I don’t remember why I told you that.</span> <span id="s383">I had some idea but I forgot so you can forget what --.</span> <span id="s384">But we came back home and -- oh, I know.</span> <span id="s385">On the first floor of the same building, lived our aunt, my father’s aunt.</span> <span id="s386">She was old lady with, widow with two daughters.</span> <span id="s387">They had no children because she didn’t like children and when my small sister, Kieia; she had nickname Kieia.</span> <span id="s388">Kieia became ill and we lived on the third floor and bombardment became very frequent, we were forbidden to live upstairs.</span> <span id="s389">We couldn’t stay in the basement all the time because of the small sick child so we asked that aunt to let us stay with her.</span> <span id="s390">She lived on the second floor and she said no because I don’t like children and sick children is something that I really hate.</span> <span id="s391">I couldn’t believe she was my father’s aunt.</span></p> <p><span id="s392">Q: Nice lady.</span></p> <p><span id="s393">A: But before the war, she was extremely nice.</span> <span id="s394">She became -- she was very nice as long as everything was planned and organized.</span> <span id="s395">She loved guests from five till seven every Tuesday and that’s it.</span> <span id="s396">My mother was absolutely astonished .</span> <span id="s397">It was something unbelievable so we went down to the first floor to the neighbors who were very unfriendly but he couldn’t; he had no guts to say no.</span> <span id="s398">We spent part of the September of 1939, this terrible -- you know what was September of ’39 in Poland, in Warsaw?</span></p> <p><span id="s399">Q: It was the beginning of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">A: It was the beginning of the war.</span> <span id="s401">It was the bombardment of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s402">We spent in -- partly in the basement, partly in that neighbor’s apartment.</span> <span id="s403">In the basement, people prayed all the time and there I felt very tension between my mother and my grandmother.</span> <span id="s404">She was strongly against accepting and being part of the prayers.</span> <span id="s405">She felt it was a time of trial and she felt that she is Jewish and she didn’t want to stay with these praying people.</span> <span id="s406">When the -- after the -- after Warsaw came into hands of Germans, my grandmother went back to Lodz.</span> <span id="s407">She came, she was evacuated, deported in very brutal manner.</span> <span id="s408">She, some, not all Jews, but some, I don’t know why my grandmother, maybe old people, were deported from Lodz, took to small towns.</span> <span id="s409">Because she had Jewish -- gmina, Judenrat, you know the word Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">Q: Yeah, the Jewish council.</span></p> <p><span id="s411">Q: The Jewish council used to find place for those deportees but my grandmother didn’t need any place because she had her daughter in Warsaw.</span> <span id="s412">She came to us.</span> <span id="s413">But when she was in Radom, she had such an experience, that it’s worth telling and worth remembering.</span> <span id="s414">Those poor ,poor deportees were placed among people by Jewish council.</span> <span id="s415">There were many in one building.</span> <span id="s416">In the evening, one of the German, captain or lieutenant or something, used to gather them.</span> <span id="s417">They stayed there for a few days.</span> <span id="s418">He gathered, the German captain gathered them and wrote Bible to them and told them that monster and anti-Christ will be punished by God and that something will happen.</span> <span id="s419">You know who I am talking in, anti-Christ and monster was Hitler in his --.</span></p> <p><span id="s420">Q: His theology.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s422">That he will be punished and that everybody has to keep faith and hope.</span> <span id="s423">He gave them extreme consolation.</span> <span id="s424">He was sort of saint but he was taken next day.</span> <span id="s425">Some evening he didn’t come and those people asked what happened to him.</span> <span id="s426">Some were told that better not to ask because he was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s427">Q: He was a German officer?</span></p> <p><span id="s428">A: A German officer.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: So it was something that doesn’t happen very often and something that shouldn’t be forgotten.</span> <span id="s431">My grandmother came to us and stayed with us and went to ghetto with us.</span></p> <p><span id="s432">Q: You were sent to the --?</span></p> <p><span id="s433">A: We went to ghetto in October of 1940.</span></p> <p><span id="s434">Q: How did that happen?</span> <span id="s435">You were deported to the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: No, because it wasn’t deportation or anything like this.</span> <span id="s437">The ghetto was built, the place was, the place for Jewish population was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: It was marked out?</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Was marked out.</span> <span id="s440">The wall was started to be built and the deadline was set.</span> <span id="s441">We were in trouble because my parents had beautiful apartment with beautiful furniture and charming place and everything.</span> <span id="s442">Somehow they couldn’t find anybody to --.</span> <span id="s443">Jewish population outside the ghetto had to find place in the ghetto district.</span> <span id="s444">People from Polish population from ghetto used to trade their apartments.</span> <span id="s445">It was very unpleasant time because it was time for very easy quick bucks for, mostly for Polish people who lived in ghetto quarters.</span> <span id="s446">It was big, big, tension, big, big -- the deadline was very close and we didn’t have place to live.</span> <span id="s447">But at last, in last minute, in the court, one of the -- well, clerks, law clerks told my father, this judge who lives in ghetto, one of judges who lives in ghetto and who is in the same situation.</span> <span id="s448">He has to go out of ghetto and he has no place to live.</span> <span id="s449">He was very impractical man.</span> <span id="s450">We quickly changed apartments -- traded apartments among ourselves.</span> <span id="s451">We moved into Nowolipie 48.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">Q: Did your parents ever consider trying not to go?</span></p> <p><span id="s453">A: They were -- do you have my parents’, my father’s picture?</span> <span id="s454">He looks like, absolutely, he’s the quintessence of Jewish --.</span></p> <p><span id="s455">Q: Yeah, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s456">A: More than me.</span> <span id="s457">I’m Jewish enough but he was more than me.</span> <span id="s458">He had too many acquaintances.</span> <span id="s459">He was well known among the people and it was too risky, absolutely.</span> <span id="s460">They didn’t take the -- it was a chance.</span> <span id="s461">They considered it but they decided not.</span> <span id="s462">At the same time, my grandmother, I have two grandmothers; one from Lodz that I told you about, and the other is my father’s mother.</span> <span id="s463">She lost her mind, she was very seriously mentally ill, very dangerous for herself.</span> <span id="s464">It was something very, very acute, acute illness.</span> <span id="s465">She -- you ask me about family?</span></p> <p><span id="s466">Q: Yeah, this is important.</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: Well, on my father’s side, his mother’s family was manufacturers.</span> <span id="s468">Her father, because of -- it’s too long story to go that far.</span></p> <p><span id="s469">Q: Well, whatever you want to tell me.</span></p> <p><span id="s470">A: He had to quit Poland because of -- as a young boy fourteen years old or in some cases eleven years old, in others fourteen years old because the Russians deported Jewish young boys to make them -- young, strong, healthy boys to make them, to take them to army and make them something, of special guards, special, completely, well -- I don’t even understand it myself.</span> <span id="s471">It was something very dangerous and he had to escape at night, go through border.</span> <span id="s472">He lived in a small town, the borders with Austria.</span> <span id="s473">His father got information by policeman that that night there will be hunting for Jewish boys.</span> <span id="s474">In 15 minutes he left home with a few rubles, whatever he had, they had at home.</span> <span id="s475">He went through the border and he started his independent life and he worked for farmers.</span> <span id="s476">He works -- at last he worked in a manufacture of ribbons.</span> <span id="s477">When he grew up at the age of twenty and something, he returned home.</span> <span id="s478">But he didn’t speak Polish, I don’t know about his Jewish but he spoke only German that time.</span> <span id="s479">My grandmother’s family was bilingual.</span> <span id="s480">They spoke German at home and my grandmother was very, very fluent in German.</span> <span id="s481">Being so sick and out of mind, she used to open the windows and start the very, very convincing speeches to German people, to get rid of Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s482">Q: Oh my God.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">A: It was very dangerous.</span> <span id="s484">It was very dangerous so my parents need to get to wire the windows and she had to be put under constant supervision.</span> <span id="s485">But she didn’t trust anybody except me so I stayed with her day and night.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Was she dangerous?</span> <span id="s487">I mean, was she --?</span></p> <p><span id="s488">A: She was dangerous, she was dangerous.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: I mean physically dangerous?</span></p> <p><span id="s490">A: Physically dangerous.</span> <span id="s491">She had hallucinations.</span> <span id="s492">She had some -- when something came into her mind, she was dangerous because she believed that -- like seriously, mentally ill people, she was very --.</span> <span id="s493">It happened very sudden.</span> <span id="s494">After the whole --.</span> <span id="s495">Because my father went for a war and there was no information what happened to him for long time.</span> <span id="s496">My grandmother was pledged not to eat until he comes back.</span> <span id="s497">I don’t know if she was sick then or she became sick because of emotions and -- or of her pain but we had --.</span> <span id="s498">We stayed with grandmother.</span> <span id="s499">We had to keep her separated from the world and at last, we had to put her into a hospital because the place we got in, in ghetto, we divided with other relatives; another family of five people.</span> <span id="s500">We had no room to keep grandmother safely.</span> <span id="s501">She went to hospital in Sofiowka.</span> <span id="s502">It was in suburbs of Warsaw, Jewish hospital for mentally ill.</span> <span id="s503">Before the hospital was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">Q: Liquidated?</span></p> <p><span id="s505">A: Liquidated, she took away her life.</span> <span id="s506">She died in December of 1940.</span> <span id="s507">We went to ghetto.</span> <span id="s508">The first year of war was still normal life for me.</span> <span id="s509">I used to go underground, no it wasn’t even underground, to school.</span> <span id="s510">Because children in that time were -- there was no statute to forbid children, Jewish children, to go to school so I used to go to regular school.</span> <span id="s511">From 1940, from the summer of 1940, the real war life started to me.</span> <span id="s512">Because everything changed.</span> <span id="s513">First with illness of my grandmother, later in ghetto everything was completely different.</span> <span id="s514">In ghetto, when it came to ghetto, we started our -- went to the -- started meeting people from over there.</span> <span id="s515">We learned that that judge who lived in, who we traded apartments, was a special person and his family was very, very unusual.</span> <span id="s516">They were owners of the possession, of the land, owners of the building.</span> <span id="s517">They were owners of the lumber that was in, behind the building.</span> <span id="s518">It was very unusual and it’s important to the part of my story.</span> <span id="s519">We moved Nowolipie.</span> <span id="s520">Around, we have regular buildings, three-four-story buildings like in crowded city streets but our building was completely different.</span> <span id="s521">We had three courts, very long three courts.</span> <span id="s522">It was very old part of farm, of plantation that existed in Warsaw few hundred years ago.</span> <span id="s523">The people, the owners who were owners of plantation; they had plantation in the eastern part of Poland but they lost everything because of revolution, the Russian revolution in 1917, they returned to Warsaw and they treated the place they lived like their plantation.</span> <span id="s524">They took care of people who lived there.</span> <span id="s525">They didn’t expect to be paid for rent because they treated them like --.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">Q: Serfs?</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: Like serfs, no, they didn’t expect any work.</span> <span id="s528">They had mentality of people of plantation.</span> <span id="s529">In the best sense of that word.</span> <span id="s530">You take care, they are your people, you take care of them.</span> <span id="s531">They teach them, they give them help they need.</span> <span id="s532">If they need medication, the mistress is there to --.</span> <span id="s533">They were absolutely crazy people.</span> <span id="s534">They lived in poverty.</span> <span id="s535">Their apartment was never painted, nothing was repaired for probably -- oh more than years.</span> <span id="s536">There was plenty of space but on the right side of those courts were sort of buildings two, three-story buildings; very primitive but buildings.</span> <span id="s537">On the left side was sort of barracks.</span> <span id="s538">Like in the country, in the poor country dwellings.</span> <span id="s539">Keep it in mind because this is important.</span> <span id="s540">Lumber factory in the back.</span> <span id="s541">When my father learned who the place belonged to; saint people who took care of all poor, terribly poor Jewish, the poorest of the poor who lived in this building, was sort of obligation, sort of challenge for us.</span> <span id="s542">In the same apartment with us lived our, moved into the same apartment, moved our family.</span> <span id="s543">Two doctors, my father, two doctors and my father organized sort of community association you can say it.</span> <span id="s544">It wasn’t association but he was so convincing that everybody tried to take care in improving our life in our building.</span> <span id="s545">He built some grass, some places to play for children.</span> <span id="s546">He organized kitchens soup-kitchens soup.</span></p> <p><span id="s547">Q: Soup kitchens.</span></p> <p><span id="s548">A: Soup kitchens for poor people.</span> <span id="s549">There was one prostitute who lived in the attic of --.</span> <span id="s550">Because it wasn’t a building, it was something like rural, like rural house.</span> <span id="s551">The prostitute came once, I remember, she said, I earn money very easily so I can have money easily too but I can’t have people to feed them.</span> <span id="s552">Because I work at my apartment; this is my place of work.</span> <span id="s553">I will give money, whatever you need, but I can’t take people to, for dinners.</span> <span id="s554">Because people first sort of obligation and my father was -- gave initiative to that everybody has to give once a week dinner for at least one person.</span></p> <p><span id="s555">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s556">A: Or give money, they can do it.</span> <span id="s557">I taught children, two girls from the -- I taught program of third class.</span> <span id="s558">I was then in high school.</span> <span id="s559">I should be in high school.</span> <span id="s560">So I told them some, gave them some elementary program teaching.</span> <span id="s561">We became very, very friendly with -- very, very close to those people in our building, in our neighborhood.</span> <span id="s562">We had books or some young people used to come over to borrow books.</span> <span id="s563">Doctors used to give medical help to people who lived in those barracks.</span></p> <p><span id="s564">Q: About how many people was this altogether?</span></p> <p><span id="s565">A: I tried to figure out but it is impossible.</span> <span id="s566">There were at least two parts of one -- maybe 12 apartments, 12 regular apartments, middle-sized, three, four rooms.</span> <span id="s567">Probably about 10 small apartments, one room, one kitchen in the barracks for ten families.</span> <span id="s568">Maybe, one or two small stores or -- but people were crowded.</span> <span id="s569">There were many, many people.</span></p> <p><span id="s570">Q: Probably couple hundred people, I would say.</span></p> <p><span id="s571">A: Probably couple hundred people but there weren’t that many apartments.</span> <span id="s572">One of those girls that I taught, her name was Fajga but I didn’t feel Jewish.</span> <span id="s573">I, my mission was to keep those kids Polish.</span> <span id="s574">I didn’t know Yiddish, I didn’t, so one of the girls promised to teach me Yiddish because some people didn’t speak Polish.</span></p> <p><span id="s575">Q: They speak Yiddish?</span></p> <p><span id="s576">A: They speak Yiddish because they were very, very poor.</span> <span id="s577">Poor Jewish population of uneducated Jewish populations.</span> <span id="s578">Some blahas (?)</span> <span id="s579">or I remember but I don’t know what the word -- let me check.</span> <span id="s580">They discussed politics and everything in Yiddish and they were different type than I knew before because they were real Jewish population, Jewish proletarian.</span> <span id="s581">We were very, very close friends especially with that girl, Fajga.</span> <span id="s582">Tinsmiths’s work, tinsmiths, we don’t, tin man, zinc, I don’t know what the, they probably fixed pots, something like this, this kind of people.</span></p> <p><span id="s583">Q: So not a full-fledged tinsmith?</span></p> <p><span id="s584">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s585">They were extremely poor, extremely smelly, extremely ----.</span> <span id="s586">They were always hungry, I know.</span> <span id="s587">I remember that my student, my pupil Fajga, how hungry she was.</span> <span id="s588">How thin she was, how pale.</span></p> <p><span id="s589">Q: How did you manage to get food in the Warsaw ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s590">A: It was, if you had money, it wasn’t hard to get food.</span> <span id="s591">My mother was a business woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s592">Q: So she managed?</span></p> <p><span id="s593">A She managed and she didn’t have any other ambition.</span> <span id="s594">She didn’t have ambition to gather money; she had ambition to buy food and let people, let people, help some people with feeding them.</span> <span id="s595">We had three meals daily.</span> <span id="s596">Not everybody was hungry in ghetto.</span> <span id="s597">There were people who were very rich in ghetto too.</span> <span id="s598">So we had three meals and we had always two, three, four people who were regular boarders.</span> <span id="s599">Two uncles of my mother and I don’t remember all of them because it changed but we had always 12 people for every meal.</span> <span id="s600">Most of them were regular boarders.</span> <span id="s601">They didn’t live with us but they used to eat with us.</span> <span id="s602">It was sort of help because it was fixed and it was -- they could trust.</span></p> <p><span id="s603">Q: They could rely on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s604">A They could rely but there were tragic situations.</span> <span id="s605">Behind every jolly and cheerful meal that we tried to keep, there was always tragedy.</span> <span id="s606">One of my mother’s uncles had grown-up son who was mentally ill and not able to work and to do anything.</span> <span id="s607">He had a -- my uncle had a girlfriend, not a wife, but sort of wife.</span> <span id="s608">He had a, we call it, common-law-wife.</span></p> <p><span id="s609">Q: Common-law?</span></p> <p><span id="s610">A: She didn’t come over for meals with us.</span> <span id="s611">I don’t know -- it was impossible to feed everything, just impossible.</span> <span id="s612">It was very, very unpleasant situation of making choices.</span> <span id="s613">It was a very bad part because my grandmother had bad feelings.</span> <span id="s614">Give this, give him for Vera.</span> <span id="s615">Vera was the common-law wife.</span> <span id="s616">Give some food for Julek, his son.</span> <span id="s617">So whoever used to eat at our table had many people who should be fed too.</span> <span id="s618">It was absolutely, it was absolutely impossible.</span> <span id="s619">It was always a choice of every day.</span> <span id="s620">One day you could give them and other day you couldn’t.</span> <span id="s621">It wasn’t pleasant situation.</span> <span id="s622">It wasn’t pleasant situation even for my mother’s uncle because he wasn’t hungry.</span> <span id="s623">I don’t know but the art of life, of living in those days, was not to talk about everything, to avoid negative talking.</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: What type of goods were available though?</span> <span id="s625">You said that food was available, I assume --.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">A: Of course, it wasn’t any problem if you had money.</span> <span id="s627">It was a big market.</span> <span id="s628">The problem was to get food in the nearest store.</span> <span id="s629">We had a very small store.</span> <span id="s630">In our home, or maybe in the neighboring homes but the problem was, the art, the challenge was, to buy a loaf of bread and take it home.</span> <span id="s631">Because the moment, the very moment you left your -- the store, the beggars, the hungry people tried to ---.</span></p> <p><span id="s632">Q: Take it away?</span></p> <p><span id="s633">A: Take it away and they did.</span> <span id="s634">Most of the time, they did.</span></p> <p><span id="s635">Q: I assume that you did go out of this little enclave during your time in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s636">Do you want to discuss any of the things you might have seen?</span> <span id="s637">I mean anything you witnessed while you were there?</span></p> <p><span id="s638">A: In the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Well, I want to tell you about two things.</span> <span id="s641">One about Fajga, I called her Frania but she accepted it.</span> <span id="s642">I felt Polish and I tried to -- well I didn’t understand the Jewish-Polish problems in those days.</span> <span id="s643">Eventually because her uncle was so poor, she had to be taken to Korczak Orphanage.</span> <span id="s644">I was over there and visited her.</span> <span id="s645">They didn’t -- it was the most, most remembered by me experience, very, very touching thing to do.</span> <span id="s646">I don’t know, I don’t use the right word but something very inspiring going to Korczak Orphanage and taking --.</span></p> <p><span id="s647">Q: It was worth it.</span></p> <p><span id="s648">A: It was absolutely -- it was the place like a -- well, how do you call the place where Eve and --.</span></p> <p><span id="s649">Q: Garden of Eden.</span></p> <p><span id="s650">A: Garden of Eden, Garden of Eden.</span> <span id="s651">So it was the last time I saw my Fajga, was in the orphanage.</span> <span id="s652">Another thing I wanted to tell you was the girl from Austria.</span> <span id="s653">The girl from Austria somehow lost her parents in, during the, in ghetto.</span> <span id="s654">She was my classmate before the war.</span> <span id="s655">Her name was Ingeborga.</span> <span id="s656">We had friends, a few friends who lived in ghetto tried to help her by making cigarettes and selling cigarettes and giving money to her.</span> <span id="s657">But any time I saw her, she was more like ghost than not like living person.</span> <span id="s658">She didn’t look like a living person.</span> <span id="s659">She went though typhus, she went through hunger like it was in ghetto, it wasn’t in a camp.</span> <span id="s660">But there were places where people lived like, looked like skeletons.</span> <span id="s661">Her mind was almost gone.</span> <span id="s662">But otherwise, there were some people who lived regular life more or less.</span></p> <p><span id="s663">Q: I want to change tapes if that’s okay with you.</span></p> <p><span id="s664">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s665">(End of Tape 1, Side B)</span></p> <p><span id="s666">A: There were stores full of food but food was very expensive.</span> <span id="s667">When I tell you that we have three meals doesn’t mean that we have meat every day.</span> <span id="s668">We didn’t --.</span></p> <p><span id="s669">Q: That’s what I was wondering.</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: It was a very simple food like -- but, well, comparing to people in the wartime, it was food.</span> <span id="s671">There was always soup, there was some kasha, there was bread.</span> <span id="s672">You could eat as much bread, as many slices as you like to.</span> <span id="s673">There was milk and butter only for my father who had tuberculosis and for my small sister.</span> <span id="s674">But nobody was hungry, nobody was hungry and you had very, very --.</span> <span id="s675">From my point of view, the life was very, very --.</span> <span id="s676">I can’t say it because it can be misunderstood by people but I enjoyed life.</span> <span id="s677">I was thirteen years old, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.</span> <span id="s678">I turned 14 in July of 1942 and those two years were very happy years for me.</span> <span id="s679">I had the best friend across the street.</span> <span id="s680">We spent most of the time together.</span></p> <p><span id="s681">Q: The images that I’ve heard from anybody who’s in the Warsaw ghetto was of leaving bodies out in the street, covered with newspaper and all that, I mean --?</span></p> <p><span id="s682">A: If you kept, well if you hear --.</span> <span id="s683">You ask the same question as my sons.</span> <span id="s684">How could you say you were happy?</span> <span id="s685">I was happy.</span> <span id="s686">If you see something every day, every minute, you are smart enough to turn your head away.</span> <span id="s687">The people who live in Washington, who get out of Metro every day are unhappy because they look at homeless people?</span> <span id="s688">Are you unhappy because of that?</span> <span id="s689">It doesn’t -- it make --.</span> <span id="s690">You learn to keep your mind away from unpleasant things and think of that only on special occasions.</span> <span id="s691">You do whatever you can do but you don’t torture yourself thinking about it all the time.</span> <span id="s692">It was the same with me.</span> <span id="s693">I -- that’s not that I was neutral, that I didn’t see things.</span> <span id="s694">I see them all the time.</span> <span id="s695">I hear voices; I still hear voices from beggars from ghetto and small dying children but at the same time I was a happy child, very happy.</span> <span id="s696">I had my sister who was left to me and I used to take her on long walks to discover the town.</span> <span id="s697">Ghetto was like Jerusalem.</span> <span id="s698">Ghetto was very exotic place if you had some imagination, you were very young.</span> <span id="s699">You saw so many different quarters, different people, different language that people spoke.</span> <span id="s700">I used to take her to very dangerous place, to Jewish cemetery.</span> <span id="s701">There was place of trade between Aryan part of the town and Jewish part of the town, that was what people called “szmugiel”.</span> <span id="s702">You know what’s that --?</span></p> <p><span id="s703">Q: What is that?</span> <span id="s704">No.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">A: It’s a word that I probably won’t find here.</span> <span id="s706">It’s a trade between, illegal trade between --.</span></p> <p><span id="s707">Q: Like the English word, smuggle?</span></p> <p><span id="s708">A: Smuggle, yes, oh the same word.</span> <span id="s709">But it was a very dangerous smuggle because was constant shots with police, Jewish police and Polish police and German gendarmes chasing people.</span> <span id="s710">It was very dangerous but I didn’t tell anybody and I used to take her.</span> <span id="s711">We had a great time, it was sort of excitement, of danger, of excitement.</span> <span id="s712">We had a great time but one day she came home and she told.</span> <span id="s713">He was taken to the Russian --.</span></p> <p><span id="s714">Q: We’re talking about your father now.</span> <span id="s715">I just want to make it clear on the tape.</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: Okay, okay.</span> <span id="s717">Now this is -- I will explain what happened.</span> <span id="s718">The history of my father.</span> <span id="s719">He went to the army, he was in reserve.</span> <span id="s720">He didn’t have to go but he wanted to.</span> <span id="s721">He was taken by Russian army in the eastern part of Poland and when he was in convoy, the guard, the Russian officer or soldier, I don’t remember who, told him; you look Jewish to me.</span> <span id="s722">There’s one thing I want you to know.</span> <span id="s723">This is not Russia.</span> <span id="s724">Russia comes POW?</span> <span id="s725">(Intent is to say that it was the Russian guard who told my father that Russian authority was prejudiced against Jews and therefore helped my father escape the convoy.)</span></p> <p><span id="s726">Q: POW, the labor camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s727">A: No, for soldiers, for army people.</span></p> <p><span id="s728">Q: I believe there are POW camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s729">A: POW camps.</span> <span id="s730">He had something to this effect in very, very short words because he was -- my father was in convoy and he was a person who had kept convoy in order.</span> <span id="s731">In very few words, he said, you better escape.</span> <span id="s732">Go slower, slower and escape.</span> <span id="s733">So my father escaped and he --.</span> <span id="s734">We learned about that.</span> <span id="s735">He sent a letter to us and he stay on the Russian side of occupied Poland, in Lvov, in some places in that -- that were taken by Soviet Union.</span> <span id="s736">But he was very unhappy and very, very lonely and in New Year’s Night of 1939, he returned home.</span> <span id="s737">He went through, illegally through the border, passed the border and he returned home.</span> <span id="s738">When he came in into our apartment.</span> <span id="s739">My mother, instead of being happy, almost passed away from fear.</span> <span id="s740">Because it was the worst place to be for my father, was Warsaw.</span> <span id="s741">That night, or maybe the night before, eighty lawyers were arrested and sent to the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s742">In the beginning they arrested people from lists not from --.</span> <span id="s743">My father came back and couldn’t go out in street because his features were so Jewish.</span> <span id="s744">He didn’t want to wear Jewish armband.</span> <span id="s745">Every Jew was obligated to wear the armband.</span> <span id="s746">So he mostly stayed home and was very, very depressed, extremely depressed.</span> <span id="s747">But coming back to my father, when we were in --.</span> <span id="s748">Well, there’s nothing more to tell you about the life in the ghetto because I would go on --.</span></p> <p><span id="s749">Q: How about if I ask you?</span></p> <p><span id="s750">A: If you ask, I will answer, of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s751">Q: Are there any other episodes or incidents beside from the two that you, the specific two, that you told me that made such an impression on you?</span> <span id="s752">Any other image that sand out in your mind of the time that you spent there.</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: Well, once --.</span> <span id="s754">There were many but if I try to --.</span> <span id="s755">Well, the wailing of dying people on the street; some beggars that were more -- they appealed more to my imagination.</span> <span id="s756">There was a father and two girls, two small girls and they begged together.</span> <span id="s757">They danced and they --.</span> <span id="s758">He looked like a well- educated person and sort of desperation.</span> <span id="s759">There were many things but I --.</span> <span id="s760">I remember my last birthday party.</span> <span id="s761">My last birthday party was on July 10.</span> <span id="s762">It was 16 days before the information of, before the decision of the liquidation of ghetto.</span> <span id="s763">But somehow most people who came for my birthday party, my parents’ friends, were fully, fully aware of things that will happen very soon.</span> <span id="s764">It was very nice, very quiet, very friendly, the real party.</span></p> <p><span id="s765">Q: Was it your 14th birthday?</span></p> <p><span id="s766">A: Yes, but it was, first time I notice that people talk about things that they usually didn’t talk.</span> <span id="s767">They talk about our last meeting, about things that were nice in life, about --.</span> <span id="s768">It was something like you go for burial and you are in funeral home, and you are smiling but everything is very, very --.</span> <span id="s769">If you go for a funeral, a very sad funeral, you know that it was not a regular funeral, but something like special tragedy.</span> <span id="s770">You try to pretend that everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s771">It was my last birthday party.</span> <span id="s772">I was, then, I was treated like a grown-up person.</span> <span id="s773">First time in my life, I remembered that they didn’t treat me like a child.</span> <span id="s774">It was then, no --.</span> <span id="s775">few days later, my mother had a friend from her childhood.</span> <span id="s776">That friend had a younger sister who was paralyzed after that influenza.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Typhus?</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: No.</span> <span id="s779">Childhood, you know --.</span></p> <p><span id="s780">Q: Oh, polio.</span></p> <p><span id="s781">A: Polio.</span> <span id="s782">In ghetto and she constantly had to eat something, to bite on something constantly.</span> <span id="s783">She had some very, sort of --.</span> <span id="s784">She couldn’t keep her mouth shut.</span> <span id="s785">It was something that they had to put something into her mouth.</span> <span id="s786">They didn’t have anything.</span> <span id="s787">They were three women; mother, that friend of my mother, and that sick sister.</span> <span id="s788">They decided that since you get a loaf of bread for every, for each person if you go from your own will to Umschlagplatz for so-called deportation, how did they call it, not deportations, they called it change of place.</span></p> <p><span id="s789">Q: Yes, relocation.</span></p> <p><span id="s790">A: Relocation, she will do that.</span> <span id="s791">She came to say goodbye because we never see each other again.</span> <span id="s792">Because she couldn’t leave that sister without food so she had to eat until she died.</span> <span id="s793">She put it very openly and said, oh my dear what are you talking.</span> <span id="s794">Why are you talking such a nonsense?</span> <span id="s795">Everything will be okay.</span> <span id="s796">She looked at my eyes and she treating me like a grown up person and she said, Dzidzia, don’t be a child, don’t be stupid.</span> <span id="s797">She tried to push me to do something, to open my eyes to the real life.</span> <span id="s798">From that time on, I remember that very well.</span> <span id="s799">I know that we have always lived with open eyes because if you let our eyes to be naïve, the life is so terrible.</span> <span id="s800">Things are happening everywhere, it’s so terrible.</span> <span id="s801">It doesn’t matter if it was in Holocaust.</span> <span id="s802">It might happen in China, everywhere.</span></p> <p><span id="s803">Q: Yugoslavia?</span></p> <p><span id="s804">A: Yugoslavia, everywhere.</span> <span id="s805">Well, there are many, many things, of course that I remember but some -- they come and they go away.</span> <span id="s806">They don’t stay with me all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s807">Q Do you want to discuss what __</span></p> <p><span id="s808">A: And what happened, what happened?</span> <span id="s809">The great, great action started in ghetto.</span> <span id="s810">My father didn’t come back home in the evening of August 3, or maybe -- because I’m not sure.</span></p> <p><span id="s811">Q: In ‘42?</span></p> <p><span id="s812">A: Forty-two.</span> <span id="s813">I’m not sure about dates.</span> <span id="s814">This is one thing.</span> <span id="s815">I read that book.</span> <span id="s816">It was a -- this is a -- it was written in when the things happened.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Yes, do you want to mention it in the tape?</span></p> <p><span id="s818">A: No, oh no.</span> <span id="s819">You don’t have to, no.</span> <span id="s820">This is to tell you that I can’t, he gives different dates than I remember.</span> <span id="s821">He’s probably right because he used to write day after day and I --.</span> <span id="s822">But in my memory, I’m talking about things that happened on August 3.</span> <span id="s823">My father didn’t come back home.</span> <span id="s824">That evening, people on our street were surrounded, rounded up and taken to Umschlagplatz but only people from street.</span> <span id="s825">They didn’t go to houses, they didn’t pick up people from the buildings, just from the street.</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: Took them off the street?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: From the street.</span> <span id="s828">It was the beginnings, it was the sort of --.</span> <span id="s829">It was the tenth day of “great action”.</span> <span id="s830">They call it in English, great action?</span></p> <p><span id="s831">Q: No, but I know what you’re --.</span></p> <p><span id="s832">A: Because in Polish, it’s -- has it’s name.</span> <span id="s833">My father didn’t come home.</span> <span id="s834">My mother was devastated.</span> <span id="s835">The whole night she waited and packed things and knew things are going to the end.</span> <span id="s836">The end is very close.</span> <span id="s837">Next morning, my father came back.</span> <span id="s838">The same thing happened to him when he was in a column.</span> <span id="s839">He was caught and he was directed to Umschlagplatz in column of other people.</span> <span id="s840">When he passed the last building, the street in front of him was deserted and he was close to pass the last building; he decided to escape.</span> <span id="s841">I think there was sort of discussion between him and the Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s842">The Jewish policeman helped him.</span> <span id="s843">He closed his eyes and my father escaped.</span> <span id="s844">He came back home and there was day almost like any other day.</span> <span id="s845">We started, was 2:00 or 2:30 in the afternoon and our house, or maybe more houses but I know only about our house, was surrounded by --.</span> <span id="s846">There was a whistle, very, very loud whistle in the courtyard and voice very, very harsh, and very, very loud ordering people to take his belongings, to take small belongings, going down to the court.</span> <span id="s847">My father said that absolutely --.</span> <span id="s848">My father, when he came home, he had some conversation with my mother that I picked up; that this is obviously the end.</span> <span id="s849">This is no, there is no doubt, they don’t, the destination of people is this.</span> <span id="s850">What I saw yesterday was like hell, it was obviously something --.</span> <span id="s851">People can’t, you can’t get caught and --.</span> <span id="s852">Well, we were ordered to go down.</span> <span id="s853">My father was very quick not -- to call everybody in the house, all the relatives and tell to follow him.</span> <span id="s854">He started to -- but most of the people, they were old people and there were at least ten people in the household.</span> <span id="s855">They didn’t want to be sent over to my father.</span> <span id="s856">They had good “ausweisses”, good documents or they didn’t want to take any risk.</span> <span id="s857">They didn’t go with us but my father took mother, me, my mother, my sister, my grandmother and we all started to get out of the stairs.</span> <span id="s858">We met a Jewish policeman.</span> <span id="s859">Jewish policeman wanted to follow him, asked us to follow him.</span> <span id="s860">Asked !</span> <span id="s861">well I call it asked.</span> <span id="s862">He gave orders and my father said something brutal, in brutal way, fuck off or something like this.</span> <span id="s863">He tried to pretend to be strong man and my father said I will kill you right here if you don’t let me pass you and he gave up.</span> <span id="s864">But it was only the beginning of hunting.</span> <span id="s865">There were one or two policemen in this building; the rest was coming but they weren’t there.</span> <span id="s866">So my father took us to those barracks.</span> <span id="s867">I told you that in the same courtyard were small, small barracks.</span> <span id="s868">There was a ceiling, underground ceiling, like in the peasants’ homes in old days.</span> <span id="s869">We all -- he opened the _____.</span> <span id="s870">Opening in the floor.</span> <span id="s871">The floor was wooden.</span> <span id="s872">He opened it.</span></p> <p><span id="s873">Q: A trap door?</span></p> <p><span id="s874">A: A trap door, yes.</span> <span id="s875">He tried to put us into that cellar.</span> <span id="s876">Was very, very small; of course, very small.</span> <span id="s877">There were 16 people already so it was --.</span> <span id="s878">People started to fight back.</span> <span id="s879">They didn’t want us but my father was so determined with them like with the policeman before.</span> <span id="s880">So we all went down and we settled down.</span> <span id="s881">My grandmother was sick; she had asthma.</span> <span id="s882">She couldn’t -- they were so, so crowded and no ventilation at all, no fresh air.</span> <span id="s883">My grandmother said, no I can’t.</span> <span id="s884">I can’t stand any moment longer, no more.</span> <span id="s885">She left the place but everything was decided in a second.</span> <span id="s886">It’s much shorter period of time, moments.</span> <span id="s887">So grandmother went out, the trap went back.</span> <span id="s888">Somebody, I don’t know who, I don’t know if, somebody was supposed to put a rug on top of that door trap.</span> <span id="s889">We stayed there, the air was stale.</span> <span id="s890">Little by little, people fainted.</span> <span id="s891">My sister fainted, my mother almost fainted.</span> <span id="s892">We heard voices, we heard shots.</span> <span id="s893">It was long, long day.</span> <span id="s894">After many, many hours, it was quiet.</span> <span id="s895">My mother with her head, opened the trap a little bit to let the air come in.</span> <span id="s896">We spent there six or seven hours and in the evening somebody came and started to call us to get out because everything is over.</span> <span id="s897">The building was empty, almost nobody survived, everybody was taken.</span> <span id="s898">We went upstairs and the whole apartment was looted.</span> <span id="s899">There was no food.</span> <span id="s900">My mother had some food stocked but there was no food.</span> <span id="s901">The prospects weren’t very bright.</span> <span id="s902">This manner, we spent three weeks.</span> <span id="s903">We had the last telephone in our -- well, this is what I know about.</span> <span id="s904">This is not what I find in different --.</span></p> <p><span id="s905">Q: Accounts?</span></p> <p><span id="s906">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s907">But -- oh, something happened very important to us in history of our surviving.</span> <span id="s908">One day there was telephone from telephone company.</span> <span id="s909">Young girl with very small, shy low voice told my father she wanted to talk to my father.</span> <span id="s910">She told him somebody has to pay a bill.</span> <span id="s911">If the bill won’t be paid today, I will have to turn off the telephone.</span> <span id="s912">The bill, it was sort of interesting thing for history of ghetto, the bills were not paid from ghetto because the post office didn’t exist anymore.</span> <span id="s913">So it was a trap, Catch 22.</span> <span id="s914">My father called his friend out of ghetto and he went and paid the bill so we had a telephone.</span> <span id="s915">The telephone saved the life of many people.</span> <span id="s916">Because people could contact the outside world and make contacts, make arrangements and save their life.</span> <span id="s917">It saved our loves too by -- just by sheer accident.</span> <span id="s918">Somebody called -- people made the meeting place in our house.</span> <span id="s919">Meeting place and they waited for message from outside world that were supposed to come through our telephone.</span> <span id="s920">It was crowded, our house became very crowded then.</span> <span id="s921">Nobody from our family except us were still living but new people came from all over ghetto, whoever knew that there’s such an apartment with telephone.</span> <span id="s922">So we lived with strangers and once somebody called to -- somebody called somebody who was supposed to be in our home but he weren’t and talked to my father.</span> <span id="s923">They were old colleagues, old friends, lawyer friends.</span> <span id="s924">That father’s old friend told my father, if you get, find a way to get out of the ghetto, the rest leave to me.</span> <span id="s925">I will give you a helping hand but I can’t help you to get out of ghetto.</span> <span id="s926">It was some hope for my father who looked like 100 Jews in one, you know, in person.</span> <span id="s927">Little by little, we left the ghetto through groups who worked outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s928">They were counted by people and they were able to manage, to leave somebody outside.</span> <span id="s929">They bribed Polish policemen or whoever, I don’t know exactly.</span> <span id="s930">It was a big business.</span> <span id="s931">They made, it was a way of making money in those days.</span> <span id="s932">First they took my sister, One worker who worked outside, in the group outside the ghetto, took my sister as his daughter.</span> <span id="s933">Then I left.</span> <span id="s934">That’s the end of my life in ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: Where did you go?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: Where I -- I think --.</span></p> <p><span id="s937">Q: This was all in August, 1942?</span></p> <p><span id="s938">A: I left on August 16.</span> <span id="s939">It was August 16.</span> <span id="s940">I am sure about the date, My sister left a few days earlier, Any time there was -- the Germans, not the Germans, mostly the --.</span> <span id="s941">Close the --.</span> <span id="s942">From raids, there were raids on the big scale, at least three in those days between August 4 and August 16 when I left.</span> <span id="s943">In the beginning, we used to go to the same ceiling where we stayed first time.</span> <span id="s944">Later on it was, oh, later on, we, for some reason, I don’t remember why, those small ceilings became dangerous.</span> <span id="s945">My father, maybe there was no time.</span> <span id="s946">We spent nights at home without light, only in the dark to wash ourselves, to get something to eat.</span> <span id="s947">In daytime, we didn’t stay in our apartment.</span> <span id="s948">We stayed in the lumber factory.</span> <span id="s949">The lumber factory was in the back of the courtyard, our lot.</span> <span id="s950">Whoever survived those first -- whoever was alive stayed there.</span> <span id="s951">People talked and people -- I met very, very interesting people over there.</span> <span id="s952">They were always in love, I was fourteen and I was always in love.</span> <span id="s953">Since young men were mostly militia men so I was always in love with some militia man.</span> <span id="s954">I found, since I was only 14 and not a woman but a child, we were very good friends.</span> <span id="s955">They used to talk to me about this all.</span> <span id="s956">They were very strange people.</span> <span id="s957">You don’t know how far hypocrisy can go into the soul of people, they were murderers.</span> <span id="s958">They were helping hands of murderers.</span> <span id="s959">Every day they murdered hundreds of people but they didn’t feel guilty.</span> <span id="s960">They always did it for some better reason, to save their mother, to save their somebody, to help someone survive.</span> <span id="s961">It was interesting experience to talk to those people.</span> <span id="s962">One day I was very close to death, the closest in my life, I never was so close o be caught like that.</span> <span id="s963">The raid came suddenly with no -- we had no time to hide.</span> <span id="s964">Somebody took my sister, a four- year old child with me and put lumber in front; put me between lumber, between boards, lumber boards.</span> <span id="s965">The Germans or Ukrainians whoever they were, chasers, came and one board after another, they took away.</span> <span id="s966">They were very, very close and my sister didn’t, she fell asleep.</span> <span id="s967">She could wake up any second and they were so -- only one board was between us and them.</span> <span id="s968">They went away and it was over.</span> <span id="s969">Once one of those, I don’t know who were, who exactly who were, nationality is the wrong way to tell about them because they were from many, many nationalities.</span> <span id="s970">There were, most of the time there were non-Germans but from some groups from different, many, many countries.</span> <span id="s971">Sort of, do you know something about who they were?</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: Yes, these fascist groups, well I imagine many of them were Ukrainians.</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: But not all of them, not all of them.</span> <span id="s974">This one whom I will talking about was probably German, was probably some German soldier.</span> <span id="s975">He found, this was a very, red-haired, big blue-eyed girl who survived the first round-ups.</span> <span id="s976">She hid in a special kind of folding bed that don’t exist any more.</span> <span id="s977">He opened the bed and the eyes met, big blue eyes and nobody was in close vicinity.</span> <span id="s978">He shut that bed closed and said nobody’s there and went away.</span> <span id="s979">It was interesting happening too.</span> <span id="s980">She didn’t know why, she couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s981">It was she herself who told us the story.</span> <span id="s982">It was something she couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s983">So, now I’m out of the ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s984">Q: Okay, I would like to know what happened for the rest of the war.</span></p> <p><span id="s985">\</span></p> <p><span id="s986">A: Rest of the war.</span> <span id="s987">For next few months, I changed places.</span> <span id="s988">Nobody -- it was hard to find any place to be safe for longer than a few weeks, or a few months, there was always something.</span> <span id="s989">January 17 of 1943, our friends found places for us with a family who kept us from -- till the end of the war.</span> <span id="s990">So we spent there two years.</span> <span id="s991">I lived like Anne Frank, in the hiding.</span> <span id="s992">I didn’t go out, I didn’t see; we saw only people who -- very, very, selected people who could come over and visit us.</span> <span id="s993">Our contact with the outside world was very limited.</span> <span id="s994">We had one room, we lived together in one room, my parents and me.</span> <span id="s995">My sister was with foster family if you can call it.</span> <span id="s996">Some friends of our family took my sister and she lived like -- almost normal life in the suburban, in Milanowek, in the suburbs of Warsaw.</span> <span id="s997">With small children around because her foster parents had small children.</span> <span id="s998">First six months that I lived out of ghetto --.</span> <span id="s999">The worst thing was my contact, my encounter with the Aryan world, with the Warsaw that didn’t exist for me, with the normal people, normal life, normal life.</span> <span id="s1000">People who had different scale value and different needs.</span> <span id="s1001">I couldn’t, it was very hard to adjust.</span> <span id="s1002">People who took me, the first people who took me and I spend few weeks with them, were cousins of my --, the nearest cousin of my mother.</span> <span id="s1003">But they were transformed, they were different people.</span> <span id="s1004">They pretended not to be Jewish; they still pretend.</span> <span id="s1005">They were completely different people.</span> <span id="s1006">I had nothing in common with them.</span> <span id="s1007">Everything turned, our friendship, our love, didn’t survive the war.</span> <span id="s1008">We didn’t, we are not friends any more.</span> <span id="s1009">It’s hard to say what happened, what happened was that they tried to become like other people.</span> <span id="s1010">They tried to live in petty, small, petty problems.</span> <span id="s1011">I left my parents in ghetto and I didn’t know if they were still alive.</span> <span id="s1012">I couldn’t care for small things, I was one important burden that I --.</span> <span id="s1013">Well, I wasn’t alone over there because cousins, our cousin took another cousin who was young; I was 14, he was 17.</span> <span id="s1014">Since the life, normal life and sun and smiling people and chitchat and things like that didn’t -- were so distant to us, we used to keep together.</span> <span id="s1015">We tried to be, well, there was --.</span> <span id="s1016">They lived in the attic, they had very nice apartment in the upper --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Penthouse, for instance?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: Yes, for, for --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">(End of Side A, Tape II)</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">A: I will finish with that story about our cousins.</span> <span id="s1021">There was an attic and we used to go up to that attic.</span> <span id="s1022">We didn’t talk much but we just stayed, sit and be quiet.</span> <span id="s1023">I don’t remember any conversation, any special conversation with him.</span> <span id="s1024">My cousin, my aunt or my cousin told me that this is a very inappropriate thing for a young girl to be alone with a young man with no --.</span> <span id="s1025">It was such a stupid thing.</span> <span id="s1026">I was really -- I felt terribly isolated.</span> <span id="s1027">I felt terribly isolated because I didn’t belong to the world that she wanted to belong.</span> <span id="s1028">Her father was in ghetto and he was one of those constant boarders who always used to spend days with us.</span> <span id="s1029">She never asked about him.</span> <span id="s1030">She wasn’t interested.</span> <span id="s1031">It was sort of self -- self defense.</span> <span id="s1032">I am sure now she wanted to be like other people.</span> <span id="s1033">She didn’t want to have father in ghetto dying in there, or maybe already dead, or in a transport in a - to Treblinka.</span> <span id="s1034">She didn’t want it but I didn’t want to listen about her new dress or a new fur or something like this.</span> <span id="s1035">So I was very, very unhappy.</span> <span id="s1036">I was unhappy but I don’t think I had the courage to say something.</span> <span id="s1037">I really don’t know.</span> <span id="s1038">A few weeks later, they found a place for me to stay.</span> <span id="s1039">It was in the Warsaw suburbs; I don’t remember even the name of the -- I forgot the name but it doesn’t matter.</span> <span id="s1040">The man who took me, took me only for money.</span> <span id="s1041">He was an alcoholic.</span> <span id="s1042">He treated his family very badly.</span> <span id="s1043">They lived in very bad -- they were very primitive people.</span> <span id="s1044">But I don’t think they were -- they weren’t brutal, they didn’t do anything bad, anything cruel for me.</span> <span id="s1045">They were such a simpleton.</span> <span id="s1046">My mother visited me there.</span> <span id="s1047">My mother didn’t talk _______ and didn’t trust, instinctively didn’t trust our cousins.</span> <span id="s1048">She noticed the transformation; they were different people and she didn’t know how far they are able to go.</span> <span id="s1049">Something opened, something different; they were very close relatives and very close friends.</span> <span id="s1050">But something strange, strange feelings and mistrust, opened between my mother and my cousins.</span> <span id="s1051">So they didn’t want to tell my mother where I am.</span> <span id="s1052">At last my mother came.</span> <span id="s1053">I have to tell you about how my mother left ghetto.</span> <span id="s1054">I will finish this, okay?</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: My mother came and I went to meet her.</span> <span id="s1057">It was only three weeks after I left ghetto, three or four, very short time.</span> <span id="s1058">We met on the road and I was like dead inside.</span> <span id="s1059">I couldn’t even be happy.</span> <span id="s1060">It was -- I didn’t feel my mother was coming.</span> <span id="s1061">I was like a living -- like somebody sucked away my feelings.</span> <span id="s1062">It took some time, not very long, maybe half an hour, maybe 15 minutes, before I started to feel happiness and then it was absolutely great feeling to have my mother again.</span> <span id="s1063">Because I didn’t think that we could survive.</span> <span id="s1064">I left, no.</span> <span id="s1065">This is something that I never told anybody.</span> <span id="s1066">It’s something that I’m not sure if it’s very loyal to tell about other people.</span> <span id="s1067">To tell how disaster makes people, divide people, divide close people --.</span> <span id="s1068">When I was in my cousins’ apartment, it wasn’t -- not very big apartment; other people helped my parents to get out -- of ghetto.</span> <span id="s1069">They -- the telephone -- I said that the telephone was still working.</span> <span id="s1070">The ghetto almost didn’t exist but the telephone was working.</span> <span id="s1071">So one of my father’s, my parents’ friends came over and told me Dzidzia please, I want to talk in private with Lilusia.</span> <span id="s1072">Lilusia was cousin.</span> <span id="s1073">I don’t want you to be here because I have to tell something.</span> <span id="s1074">We have some things that grown-up people have to talk.</span> <span id="s1075">I left the room but I knew that it was about my parents.</span> <span id="s1076">I put my ear into a lock and I heard everything.</span> <span id="s1077">He told, Mr. ---- I am saying his words.</span> <span id="s1078">He said “Wladek, (my father) he’s crazy.</span> <span id="s1079">They don’t have any valuables, they don’t have any valuable things.</span> <span id="s1080">They have little money, he looks like he looks and he want to leave the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1081">He’s absolutely crazy.</span> <span id="s1082">I don’t know what, I can’t figure out the way of his thinking.”</span> <span id="s1083">It was quite cruel but it was the -- his intentions were good.</span> <span id="s1084">He didn’t say this because he had something against my father’s survival but he knew it was unrealistic.</span> <span id="s1085">At least I knew my father, my parents were alive.</span> <span id="s1086">By the same way, the same groups who worked outside ghetto, were still working outside ghetto, were working for quite a long time, few months longer.</span> <span id="s1087">First my mother, then my father were transported through ghetto borders and they were also in the working place outside the ghetto.</span> <span id="s1088">Some friends of my parents came over and took them to their house.</span> <span id="s1089">It was act of courage like absolute heroism.</span> <span id="s1090">They were heroes because it was obvious for people outside the ghetto, who my parents were -- the way they looked and the sort of the way they were dressed, it was absolutely obvious.</span> <span id="s1091">But from where my parents were outside in the safe place, the other friend made first contact, who talk on the phone with my father and who gave him the idea that there’s a chance for my father, took things in his hands and found a place in Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs.</span> <span id="s1092">My parents were in Milanowek; I moved from one place to another for a few months.</span> <span id="s1093">Some people were nice, some people were scared; some people had tried but couldn’t manage, it was too risky Sometime people around started to talk about me; that there is something strange with me, who I am, it’s obvious who I am.</span> <span id="s1094">It was obvious who I am.</span> <span id="s1095">At last, from January 17, 1943, we were together for two years, together with my parents.</span> <span id="s1096">Those two years weren’t bad.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: Where were you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: In Milanowek, in Warsaw suburbs.</span> <span id="s1099">We spent two years in relative quiet, quiet environment, relatively quiet.</span> <span id="s1100">We --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">Q: Your sister was there too?</span></p> <p><span id="s1102">A: No.</span> <span id="s1103">My sister was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1104">Q: Oh, she was with the other people?</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">A: The other people.</span> <span id="s1106">On some occasions when there was some danger around, other people used to take my sister to our place because it was in the same small town.</span> <span id="s1107">But it was rather rare.</span> <span id="s1108">Most of the time, my sister was with, in the other place.</span> <span id="s1109">We weren’t -- the people, Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski is this name, they are both dead by now, only their daughter is alive.</span> <span id="s1110">Their daughter was my friend.</span> <span id="s1111">She4 was -- we were of the same age so we --.</span> <span id="s1112">Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski put some conditions.</span> <span id="s1113">They took us under some conditions.</span> <span id="s1114">We were not supposed to have guests, nobody was supposed to know our address and we were not supposed to leave the place.</span> <span id="s1115">We had some false documents but my father when he got his -- you know what kennkarte was?</span></p> <p><span id="s1116">Q: Yes, passport.</span></p> <p><span id="s1117">A: When my father got his passport, his kennkarte, that was very hard to get one.</span> <span id="s1118">At last he received one, he had to sign it.</span> <span id="s1119">He signed Wladyslew Winawer.</span> <span id="s1120">His kennkarte was for different name but he -- it was disaster.</span> <span id="s1121">But at the same time, we knew that my father couldn’t use that kennkarte, he simply couldn’t use it.</span> <span id="s1122">Nobody would believe he was --.</span></p> <p><span id="s1123">Q: Now this is a personal --.</span> <span id="s1124">Was he circumcised?</span></p> <p><span id="s1125">A: Yes, he was.</span></p> <p><span id="s1126">Q: He was?</span> <span id="s1127">So that would have been a problem?</span></p> <p><span id="s1128">A: No, it couldn’t have been any problem to know that more.</span> <span id="s1129">It was sort of, really, no false hope.</span> <span id="s1130">It’s obvious that we can’t lead any official life.</span> <span id="s1131">There’s no way for us to pretend that we live here, live there as tenants or something like that.</span> <span id="s1132">But our Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski didn’t believe, didn’t, took us knowing that we are a -- wait a second -- it was a death sentence.</span> <span id="s1133">So thy built something sort of, the same thing that we had in our small barracks.</span> <span id="s1134">They built sort of trap with covered entrance and any time they kept the house gated.</span> <span id="s1135">The gate was always locked and any time somebody suspicious appeared at the gate, we’re supposed to hide in the trap.</span> <span id="s1136">We did it; we learned how to do it very quickly.</span> <span id="s1137">It was like a drill, like a military drill.</span> <span id="s1138">They were, they weren’t like Polish people, Polish people are emotional, poorly organized.</span> <span id="s1139">This is typical, this is what is typical in Polish culture and Polish --.</span> <span id="s1140">But they were completely different.</span> <span id="s1141">They had a very strong sense of responsibility and they knew the risk they taking and everything was perfectly well organized.</span> <span id="s1142">Little by little, we had more and more things to take with us, a radio and arms and many, many things because we were the safest people to keep dangerous things.</span> <span id="s1143">Because we weren’t supposed to be taken to Gestapo or to be tortured because Jews were killed on the spot.</span> <span id="s1144">Since we, little by little we had more important things to hide with us, we felt more -- our life had more value.</span> <span id="s1145">We did something, we did something more than try to save our lives.</span> <span id="s1146">Comparing to the other people our life in hiding was very, very quiet and uneventful.</span></p> <p><span id="s1147">Q: Were you in hiding, did you have any part in the Warsaw uprising towards the end or --?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: No, because we were in hiding.</span></p> <p><span id="s1149">Q: So what happened?</span> <span id="s1150">How were you liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s1151">A: When we liberated; we --.</span> <span id="s1152">A few days later, my father was very sick.</span> <span id="s1153">Well, those -- my father was depressed.</span> <span id="s1154">He, in his character, he was able to do heroic acts but he had no discipline like my mother, to stay quiet, to wait, to do routine things; he became depressed, he became so depressed, he didn’t get up, he stayed in bed for weeks on.</span> <span id="s1155">What turned out to be great, great help for his tuberculosis because this is the way that tuberculosis can be cured.</span> <span id="s1156">So he survived.</span> <span id="s1157">There were some bad times, sometimes he was very sick but all in all he, in the end of the war, he was much better than a few years earlier.</span> <span id="s1158">He survived; I think what he did, he opened sort of Jewish ;place of Jewish, not council; Jewish, not gathering place; place that you learn about other people who survived.</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">Q: Oh, I see.</span></p> <p><span id="s1160">A: Something, it wasn’t any, it was spontaneous, it was something, it wasn’t any organization in -- but it was the place where many people --.</span> <span id="s1161">We moved from that, our hiding place.</span> <span id="s1162">We found an apartment very, very close, close by.</span> <span id="s1163">People who came from Russia, people who was leaving the hiding places, people who came from camps, they came en masse to our place to talk about the way they survived, what happened to them, to ask about other people.</span>

Poland but they liberated us, that’s for sure.</span> <span id="s1171">It was exactly two years of living in the Mr. and Mrs. Sokolowski’s house.</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">Q: After having escaped

much more precise than mine.</span> <span id="s1180">Because he heard voices, he saw things that I didn’t.</span> <span id="s1181">I know it was, according to his memory, it was something you can’t forget.</span></p> <p><span id="s1182">Q: Maybe he’d like to talk about it some time.</span></p> <p><span id="s1183">A: But well, this is nothing, nothing special because he didn’t, he’s contacted his

id="s1200">I wanted to be like other girls, I didn’t want to be so wise and experienced and remember.</span> <span id="s1201">I didn’t want to remember anything for years.</span></p> <p><span id="s1202">Q: You didn’t talk about it afterwards?</span></p> <p><span id="s1203">A: Well, I talked.</span> <span id="s1204">I didn’t -- I talked.</span> <span id="s1205">I didn’t like to talk about

id="s1218">Comparing to American girl, living in American suburb, it was tragedy but you have to always, always compare to something.</span> <span id="s1219">It was mild.</span> <span id="s1220">I didn’t know a fear of death.</span> <span id="s1221">Since I didn’t, I had only a fear of being alone, not being with my parents.</span> <span id="s1222">I was afraid of brutal people, of primitive people more than of execution.</span> <span id="s1223">I remember that moment close to death, it wasn’t a moment of fear.</span> <span id="s1224">It was sort of moment of expectation, not of fear.</span> <span id="s1225">I don’t know if I hadn’t -- if execution squad will shot me, I will be hero, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s1226">As far as I know, I wasn’t afraid of death and in some

price.</span> <span id="s1232">We lived selling those lots.</span> <span id="s1233">My parents didn’t have, didn’t have, really didn’t have any money to live on.</span> <span id="s1234">It was almost day-to-day survival.</span> <span id="s1235">We didn’t have much hope but we --.</span> <span id="s1236">I can tell about my father because my father helped us out of his difficult streak in him; but my mother and me were quiet.</span> <span id="s1237">We were always quiet.</span> <span id="s1238">My father was a hero but couldn’t stand the passive life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1239">Q: Do you want to discuss any of your experiences after the war?</span> <span id="s1240">Your studies or anything, or your life, or coming to America, or anything?</span></p> <p><span id="s1241">A: My life.</span></p> <p><span id="s1242">Q: Only if you’d like to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1243">A: Well, okay.</span> <span id="s1244">Can we take some break.</span></p> <p><span id="s1245">Q:

behind my peers.</span> <span id="s1250">I thought at the age of 17, if you are two years older than your classmates, you feel terrible.</span> <span id="s1251">(?)</span> <span id="s1252">It’s completely different, different world.</span> <span id="s1253">With my experience, I was more distant, more different than -- to my peers than even if I were two years older but --.</span> <span id="s1254">I couldn’t find a place.</span> <span id="s1255">I didn’t belong anywhere.</span> <span id="s1256">In those days, it was only once in my years that I found the victim of anti-Semitism.</span> <span id="s1257">After the war, there was very strong anti-Semitic attitude, especially among the young people, among kid at school.</span> <span id="s1258">Maybe not only, but I felt it at school.</span></p> <p><span id="s1259">Q: You still didn’t really feel Jewish or did you by this time?</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">A: Well, I felt the same.</span> <span id="s1261">No, I

after the war, to make evening classes for working people.</span> <span id="s1267">But my parents didn’t accept it and I was -- I was, somehow, I depended on my family more than seventeen-year-old depends in normal times.</span> <span id="s1268">If they say no, I accepted it and I used to go to regular school.</span> <span id="s1269">The school was so bad and they treated me so unfairly that I moved to another school.</span> <span id="s1270">I changed schools and in that school, in another place, another town, I felt --.</span> <span id="s1271">It was a good school and everybody liked me and everything was okay.</span> <span id="s1272">Little by little, I returned to normal life.</span> <span id="s1273">When I finished school, I started to study law and the new calamities, how do you say it in English, disaster came?</span></p> <p><span id="s1274">Q: Calamities.</span></p> <p><span id="s1275">A: The calamities came, Stalinism, communism.</span> <span id="s1276">Whatever happened during the Hitler era had some good followers during the Stalin era.</span> <span id="s1277">Little by little, I was more involved in rebellion against Stalinism than thinking about my past.</span></p> <p><span id="s1278">Q: Did your parents consider leaving Poland after the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">A: My -- many friends begged them to leave Poland.</span> <span
