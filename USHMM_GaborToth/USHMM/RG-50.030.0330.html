1995</span></p> <p><span id="s11">Q: Can you describe the setting of your childhood?</span></p> <p><span id="s12">A: I was born in the countryside, the real countryside in a small island and my father was my teacher.</span> <span id="s13">It was a certain circle where the people thought the state should mix in as little as possible.</span> <span id="s14">The state should have nothing to do with religion, therefore they had their own church, built their own church and had their own priest.</span> <span id="s15">Also, they made their own school, and my father was chosen as the teacher.</span> <span id="s16">We were not allowed say , as people usually do.</span> <span id="s17">It was two fine words.</span> <span id="s18">About 75 children went to my father and only nine children when to the official school.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">Q: Your father was a teacher?</span></p> <p><span id="s20">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s21">He started being a teacher of the first high school.</span> <span id="s22">That's different from a high school.</span> <span id="s23">The first high school were usually young people come to learn.</span> <span id="s24">But when they had no school at this free school, they asked my father to take it over and he did.</span></p> <p><span id="s25">Q: How many children were there in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s26">A: Twelve.</span> <span id="s27">My father's first wife died when she had borne three children.</span> <span id="s28">And my mother had nine children, and when we were 12 years old we had to go out to work, to work for the farmers.</span> <span id="s29">That meant in a way, even if my father would protest, that our childhood was taken from us.</span> <span id="s30">To go in the fields and here other children of our age were playing.</span> <span id="s31">That was awful.</span></p> <p><span id="s32">Q: Why did you have to go to work at 12?</span></p> <p><span id="s33">A: Because we were poor.</span> <span id="s34">My mother said sometimes to my father who was educated and a school teacher, that he should leave this free school and he could earn double.</span> <span id="s35">But he was an idealist.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: What were the strong ideals that he believed in beyond the state not intervening.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: It was only that people should choose their own priest, choose their own teacher.</span> <span id="s38">That was a personal question.</span> <span id="s39">That is called in Denmark after the famous poet .</span></p> <p><span id="s40">Q: You went to work in the fields when you were twelve, then how long did you continue to work?</span></p> <p><span id="s41">A: From 12 to 18, and then people told my father that this intelligent boy, that's what they called me, he ought to be a priest.</span> <span id="s42">That is the place they always used for studying.</span> <span id="s43">I never thought of being a priest, but I would like to study.</span> <span id="s44">That was impossible when I worked on the farms.</span> <span id="s45">But then I worked for a community making ditches and they would stop when it suited me and go to the only person in the village who could teach me foreign languages.</span> <span id="s46">That was the doctor.</span> <span id="s47">There I learned English and German so much that I could start in the gymnasium in .</span> <span id="s48">That was the nearest place at that time.</span> <span id="s49">They laughed at little old me and said that my pronunciation was rather different than what they used there.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: And you went to gymnasium at what age?</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Eighteen.</span> <span id="s52">I was 22, I could not get into the gymnasium.</span> <span id="s53">We had to take something called before that.</span> <span id="s54">So, I went four years to school and then I went to to study, and what interested me is what I would call the history and ideology something like that.</span> <span id="s55">I wanted to study literature.</span> <span id="s56">What interested me was the ideology in different times.</span> <span id="s57">The development of the human spirit.</span> <span id="s58">So, I started with something called comparing literature.</span> <span id="s59">Comparing all the different cantors literature.</span> <span id="s60">Then I was in love with a young lady and all told me that this would not give me an earning.</span> <span id="s61">Only if you should be a professor and that would be two places in Denmark.</span> <span id="s62">So, I started to study as other people two literatures and that was German and Danish.</span> <span id="s63">And I finished that.</span> <span id="s64">My first book was comparison between and who are completely different ideas but who psychologically are very alike.</span> <span id="s65">They don't like the people as they are.</span> <span id="s66">, you would say that it was first an ape then it was a mensch, and then the next step must be an mensch.</span> <span id="s67">And in the same way but his mensch was the real Christian.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">Q: In your studies and in your growing up, did you know any Jews, or did you know anything about the Jewish religion?</span></p> <p><span id="s69">A: We had as much bible history as Danish history, so of course we did.</span> <span id="s70">We learned that the Jews were the chosen people, and they the Danish could only be number two.</span> <span id="s71">There were no Jews in .</span></p> <p><span id="s72">Q: When did you meet Jews for the first time?</span></p> <p><span id="s73">A: When I went to Copenhagen and was a leftist in the students assembly of leftists.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">was the leading figure and later came a problem that Hitler took the power in Germany and so many Jews came from Germany and communists and social democrats and I was very anti-Nazism and asked what can I do and they told me that great problem was that nobody knew what happened in Germany.</span> <span id="s75">Whether Hitler really had all the people behind him or the secret groups worked.</span> <span id="s76">I said I'm willing to go as a for -- it was his best Trotsky, there's a certain history because we have Trotsky to speak here in Copenhagen in '32.</span></p> <p><span id="s77">Q: Had you been to Germany before this?</span> <span id="s78">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">Q: When was your first trip to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s80">A: Oh, my when I went to school on the vacations I always went -- rode on my bicycle.</span> <span id="s81">My first trip was around England and then I went on bicycle to Rome and on bicycle to Paris, and I had to go through Germany and I slept in .</span> <span id="s82">There I have memories in Berlin when I wrote my name Jakobsen some guy said Jackobsen and I found that I would fail in my duty to the Jews if I told them I am no Jew.</span> <span id="s83">In Denmark there were many Jakobsen who were not Jewish so I let them believe I was a Jew instead of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s84">Q: Did they treat you badly?</span></p> <p><span id="s85">A: They were about to throw me out, the leader of that thought he could not throw me out into the street in the middle of the night.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">Q: When did you begin these vacation travels to England and to Rome and to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s87">What years are we talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s88">A: I work from when I was 12 until I was 18 and I was born in '06, so it must have been in '25.</span> <span id="s89">And in '25 there was still so much unrest and little bureaucracy in Germany so I was told that it would be too dangerous to go to Germany and therefore I went to England the next time.</span></p> <p><span id="s90">Q: Did you only spend vacations in Germany or did you ever study in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: I had not studied in Germany, only vacation.</span> <span id="s92">But I studied German and if I choose between taking English and Danish and German and Danish I preferred the Danish literature.</span> <span id="s93">People like .</span></p> <p><span id="s94">Q: The German?</span></p> <p><span id="s95">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s96">I think I can more than 100 verses by heart.</span></p> <p><span id="s97">Q: Can you tell me a bit more about the experiences with Trotsky and then going to Germany to find out what's going on there?</span></p> <p><span id="s98">A: The difference between Stalin and Trotsky must be the first thing.</span> <span id="s99">Stalinism says you can build socialism in one country.</span> <span id="s100">And Trotsky said if you do that this country will be surrounded by enemies and there would be so many enemies our socialism within that country and therefore it would be a dictatorship and he learned permanent revolution and that means not as some people believe that yes there will always be a revolution but that if there was not a revolution in Germany or in other more progressive states then the revolution in Russia would fade.</span> <span id="s101">Also, according to Marxism the revolution should come in the most industrial states and areas, not in a state like Russia.</span> <span id="s102">And it failed in Russia.</span> <span id="s103">Different from what people believe I could see this plan had not led to anything.</span> <span id="s104">That Russia is much backwards.</span></p> <p><span id="s105">Q.</span> <span id="s106">Did you meet Trotsky?</span> <span id="s107">Did Trotsky come to Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s108">A: We had a great meeting made by the social democratic students of Trotsky, and I heard him there.</span> <span id="s109">He spoke German and his German was not as good as I believed.</span> <span id="s110">The day afterwards I went to see him and there I was forced away by his .</span></p> <p><span id="s111">Q: The people close to him?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s113">They were so afraid that he should be killed.</span> <span id="s114">At that time I thought it was exaggerated, but a couple years later he was killed in that way.</span> <span id="s115">But I felt so much for Trotsky that I visited his home in , but that was when he was killed.</span></p> <p><span id="s116">Q: The trip that you took to Germany to find out what was going on, occurred in what year and what did you see in Germany?</span> <span id="s117">What did you report back?</span></p> <p><span id="s118">A: That those groups, there were so many different groups Trotsky and Stalin and social democratic, there were really very few people, when I was in Hamberg they told me to go to Berlin and meet him there.</span> <span id="s119">They were very weak.</span> <span id="s120">He had really a dominant position, and also many people who had been socialist were now in favor of national socialism.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: Did you see or were you aware of what Hitler was doing as far as the Jews were concerned?</span></p> <p><span id="s122">A: No, there were no Jews in Germany.</span> <span id="s123">Q: In the 1930s?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s125">I went to political groups, and the political groups found that it only endangered their position if they had Jews in leading positions.</span> <span id="s126">Some of the people who sent me had been leading, and in Hamberg and Berlin they told me that all the Jews were dropped in their leading positions because of the Hitlerism that told that the Jews dominated the Germans through their Marxist organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s127">Q: So, therefore when you went to access the political conditions of the left of the social democrats and the Trotskyots, you didn't meet Jews because they had been removed.</span> <span id="s128">Were you aware of the general conditions of Jews in Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s129">A: I met Jews in because I had married a German Jewish refugee but she was unpolitical but she had friends in Hamberg, of course not Jews, but also met them privately.</span> <span id="s130">But they were very cautious of course.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: When did you meet your wife?</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: My wife came here as .</span> <span id="s133">I think you know what it means, but I think I have to explain it.</span> <span id="s134">The British had Israel as and they would not allow Jews to go to Israel if they had not learned something agricultural.</span> <span id="s135">The Jews are not very agricultural but she chose to learn poultry farming.</span> <span id="s136">She went to Sweden to learn poultry farming.</span> <span id="s137">And one day when one of my Jewish friends from Hamberg proposed that we should make a trip to Sweden and meet one of his Jewish friends in Hamberg who was working poultry farming there.</span> <span id="s138">And so we met.</span> <span id="s139">I like to come to Denmark and that could only happen if we also married.</span> <span id="s140">Also the Danish government did not want to take all the Jews from Germany to Denmark, but when we married there was no problem.</span></p> <p><span id="s141">Q: What was her name?</span></p> <p><span id="s142">A: .</span> <span id="s143">The family is still in Germany and they change the name Goldstein, because anybody can hear that it's Jewish to Gotten.</span> <span id="s144">Even in Germany after the war, they found it better to hide that they are Jewish.</span> <span id="s145">They call themselves Gotten.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">Q: So they went back after the war?</span> <span id="s147">A: They didn't leave.</span></p> <p><span id="s148">Q: They were hidden?</span></p> <p><span id="s149">A: No.</span> <span id="s150">They were half Jews and the half Jews were soldiers.</span> <span id="s151">They had been fighting the Russians in eastern Germany.</span> <span id="s152">In the start Hitler took half Jews in his army but when they have success he thought he did not need half Jews and then they were sent back.</span> <span id="s153">He had hoped that when he fought in Poland he would be acknowledged as a real German, but he was not.</span></p> <p><span id="s154">Q: How many trips to Germany did you make in the 1930s?</span> <span id="s155">A: I can't tell.</span></p> <p><span id="s156">Q: Were there many?</span></p> <p><span id="s157">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s158">Because I do not make distinction between those before Hitler and after Hitler and meeting the family and political trips.</span></p> <p><span id="s159">Q: Was her family becoming more and more afraid as the years progressed?</span> <span id="s160">A: In the end they also preferred to immigrate and came to Denmark.</span></p> <p><span id="s161">Q: Her family did?</span></p> <p><span id="s162">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s163">Only one brother was left and that was because he had been a German soldier.</span> <span id="s164">He could stay there.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: Let me ask you about your deep interest in German literature and German ideas.</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: It is not deep interest in German literature and German ideas, it is a deep interest in literature and ideas.</span> <span id="s167">But it is correct in that way that once I had to decide where I would choose English and Danish as my fields at the university or German and Danish and I chose German, and that was because I preferred to Dickensian.</span></p> <p><span id="s168">Q: Why did you prefer and ?</span></p> <p><span id="s169">A: Because I thought that ideologies, how the people have thought so different movements.</span> <span id="s170">There was much more of this sort in German.</span> <span id="s171">It is quoted</span></p> <p><span id="s172">.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: When you talk about movements can you describe a little more what you mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s174">A: Well, the first through the office catholic church, catholic means they said no church.</span></p> <p><span id="s175">Q: Can you describe a little more about the ideas of - and that so much interested you?</span></p> <p><span id="s176">A: is not so much his own ideas as his formulations and they met in Paris but is a great poet in that way that he can formulate things and Shuller's ideas that is old ideas about thought, the unreal things, the immaterial things, the unreal things that are very far from people today.</span></p> <p><span id="s177">Q: Did Shillar thought affect your moral judgments?</span></p> <p><span id="s178">A: I think I would be moral before I knew Shillar.</span> <span id="s179">I like Shillar it his pathos.</span></p> <p><span id="s180">, that is Shillar and that is the same as the Christian that if you will not risk your life you will lose it, but if you risk your life you will keep it.</span></p> <p><span id="s181">Q: As you made your trips to Germany in the 1930s did you sense that war was coming?</span></p> <p><span id="s182">A: Oh, it was a usual idea among the people against Hitler that it would mean war and it was really clear it would mean war.</span> <span id="s183">One of the reasons that Hitler could take power in Germany was that Germany felt that it had been badly treated after the last war in 1918, and they spoke about it.</span> <span id="s184">The and they would have back what they had lost.</span> <span id="s185">I think where people knew German, I know this fairly well because I was a delegate to the Council in Europe in and they really speak German but they are not German speaking and Denmark had also taken part of old Danish part of .</span> <span id="s186">Hitler would restore the old strong German.</span> <span id="s187">Q: So you felt the war coming?</span> <span id="s188">You felt almost the inevitability of it?</span> <span id="s189">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s190">Q: How did this affect your career your thinking about what you would do with your life?</span></p> <p><span id="s191">A: In April 1940 I had to make a great decision.</span> <span id="s192">In April 1940 my first book came out and that was a comparison between and whose ideas are very different but whose psychs are very much alike.</span> <span id="s193">It was accepted very good and I was told that that was the beginning of a university career.</span> <span id="s194">Berlin also I learned that that can't be no great difference between what you say and write and what you do.</span> <span id="s195">And it would be against my own philosophy if I would sit quietly studying philosophy when what I love was and what I hated.</span> <span id="s196">Therefore my philosopher would tell me that now it was time to go out and take a knife if necessary and I did.</span></p> <p><span id="s197">Q: How did you start to resist?</span> <span id="s198">What happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s199">A: The first thing was that the political parties who made this agreement and told us to do nothing I thought that was only --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">Q: Let me ask a question.</span> <span id="s201">Where were you when the invasion took place?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I was sleeping in my bed in Copenhagen and then I said I heard so much flying and I said to my wife do you think they are British or do you think they are German.</span> <span id="s203">Whenever I said that if it was not because I was sure they were Danish, but then we heard so much noise in the streets, people talking and we came to the windows and we heard that they were Germans.</span> <span id="s204">And we heard that some Germans were landing in and I took my bicycle and out I went.</span> <span id="s205">Then also I knew at once that it would change my life completely and I could hope I could return to my studies.</span> <span id="s206">That is what I wanted since I was a boy but had to watch the cattle in the fields.</span> <span id="s207">That is what I felt was a sacrifice ending my studies and going into politics.</span></p> <p><span id="s208">Q: How did you being to participate in the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s209">A: I knew many political names especially social democrats and radicals and I went with them and said I was willing to use all my time for building up something.</span> <span id="s210">One of those I went to was , who was a conservative and he said oh, that's fine I have some money for that work.</span> <span id="s211">I can give you and I said you can't take money for that work, and he said if you can't take money then he's not serious because you have to stay in hotels and eat in restaurants all the time, and he convinced me that was necessary.</span> <span id="s212">And he sent me to and said I could go there and he would give me money and I did.</span> <span id="s213">I never thought of them because they were very conservative, and I was very much to the left.</span> <span id="s214">And that was the order, and they told me when they gave me 3,000 and that was much money at that time, and I was told it would come again when I had more money.</span></p> <p><span id="s215">Q: What did they want you to do?</span></p> <p><span id="s216">A: First of all I had a of names and I got them from people, members of parliament and people with whom I had studied and who were now teachers at gymnasiums, etc.</span> <span id="s217">I had first a meeting with one person who taught with him about what would you do and then we agreed that he should find more persons and I should find five persons who differed so I covered this part of the country.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: What were you telling these people?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: First I had I could tell many things which could not be bought in a newspaper.</span> <span id="s220">The truth was forbidden and it could not be told in newspapers, and it could not be told at the big meetings, but we could make small in the evening newspapers.</span> <span id="s221">They made local newspapers and I came and told them what ought to be in.</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: What did you tell them.</span> <span id="s223">What was the truth?</span></p> <p><span id="s224">A: It was different at each time, each month.</span> <span id="s225">What was happening, what the Germans demanded and who made resistance, who had many no resistance of the politicians.</span> <span id="s226">When I talked about this then I some times met people who thought it was not enough to know.</span> <span id="s227">We should also do something and told about several and I thought it was a good thing to support local sabotages as much as possible.</span></p> <p><span id="s228">Q: Did you help make sabotage possible?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: I could tell what ought to be sabotaged and once I felt I had to see it myself and I went .</span> <span id="s230">That was not a very good exercise, and I rode down the ditch when the Germans came.</span> <span id="s231">But I felt that when you asked people to be sabotage, you ought to see the ones that are sabotaged, but I was told you should not do that anymore because it would not be good if I was taken.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: Your opposition was to the Germans and to the Danes, the Danes who had made the agreement with the Germans to become collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I could not talk to people who were collaborators but the Danish government were not collaborators, you could appeal.</span> <span id="s234">The collaborators that were the Nazi people, and I had three surrounded by Nazis already and they knew.</span></p> <p><span id="s235">Q: You spoke of the government that was neutral in terms of the Germans.</span> <span id="s236">Did the government think you were in opposition to it?</span></p> <p><span id="s237">A: The government chose to make no resistance and in that way could count economically better.</span> <span id="s238">If you open a war the who fought with the Germans had no sympathy for the Nazis of the Germans, not at all, but thought that we spoiled their policy and the difference was not that both our wanted the best for our people.</span> <span id="s239">The difference was what we considered to be the best.</span> <span id="s240">They thought that it couldn't be with so little sacrifices economically.</span> <span id="s241">We thought that we should not be ashamed afterwards was the most important thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s242">Q: Were you at all part of the policy the Danish policy to the Jews of the attitude that was taken to protect the Jews who had been threatened by the Germans every other place.</span></p> <p><span id="s243">A: We did not fight the Nazism because of the Jews.</span> <span id="s244">That was one thing.</span> <span id="s245">Many things we didn't like of the Nazis.</span> <span id="s246">It was democracy and dictatorship and we heard that the Jews would be captured, taken.</span> <span id="s247">We must do all that we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s248">Q: Can you describe that?</span></p> <p><span id="s249">A: The first thing that we did was to tell the Jews, the Germans that we come and take you and you shall not be at home.</span> <span id="s250">The first thing was to tell the Jewish people that they should not be at home that and that night because they will come.</span></p> <p><span id="s251">Q: How did you find out the roundup was going to take place?</span> <span id="s252">A: I do not remember exactly.</span></p> <p><span id="s253">Q: Did you expect it to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s254">A: It was a part of Nazism and we had wondered that it did not happen before.</span> <span id="s255">But the first thing was that they shall not be taken in their homes, and the next thing was to find fishing boats to bring them to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s256">Q: How did you find the Jews to tell them to go into hiding?</span> <span id="s257">A: We went to the Rabbi.</span> <span id="s258">He knew them.</span></p> <p><span id="s259">Q: And he gave you the addresses?</span> <span id="s260">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s261">Q: When you went to the Jews, did they resist?</span></p> <p><span id="s262">A: Some people wouldn't believe and some people stayed home.</span> <span id="s263">I think we brought seven or eight thousand and that about six that would not believe us and stayed at home and wait there until they hear a shot.</span></p> <p><span id="s264">Q: Was this operation to save the Jews to rescue them and to hid them and then to send them to Sweden, was this one of the largest efforts that was made before 1944?</span> <span id="s265">Was this a major effort on the part of the resistance?</span></p> <p><span id="s266">A: The meaning of resistance was that the Allies should win and we should be one of the Allies and Germans should lose.</span> <span id="s267">The other thing was a thing of sympathy.</span> <span id="s268">That has nothing to do with the end of the war, the Germans.</span> <span id="s269">The to win the war was not diminished by news.</span> <span id="s270">That was a humanitarian thing.</span> <span id="s271">In Denmark we have a distinction where some of our friends were Jews and who were not.</span></p> <p><span id="s272">Q: You had many Jewish friends such as Eric Kone and Joseph and Fanny Davidson, what happened to those people?</span></p> <p><span id="s273">A: There were many Jews in the leftist front in Denmark, and my friends were there and I belonged myself.</span> <span id="s274">We were many called themselves Trotskys.</span> <span id="s275">There were many sects among the communists, but many Jews were on this leftist part politically and then of course the Jews -- but those who I knew personally they were from the leftist Jewish organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">Q: Did that make them doubly vulnerable because they were Jews and leftists?</span> <span id="s277">A: All those who had been in Nazism all the time.</span></p> <p><span id="s278">Q: How did the rescue, the hiding of the Jews actually take place?</span> <span id="s279">Were there doctors who hid the Jews.</span> <span id="s280">Whom did you turn to.</span> <span id="s281">Whom was the network?</span></p> <p><span id="s282">A: There were all sort of people.</span> <span id="s283">It is true that the doctors in one hospital, a big hospital because they were my friends and I told them about it and mainly Jews who were told not to stay at home were sent to the hospital and people believed that they were ill, and they stayed there until was there and somebody came and took them to the shore.</span> <span id="s284">First was a Doctor -- this would be a hospital where I corroborated before, and he had played a very great part in helping.</span></p> <p><span id="s285">Q: You had worked with him in the resistance is that right?</span> <span id="s286">A: I knew him in the resistance.</span></p> <p><span id="s287">Q: Can you describe for me the various parts of the resistance movement, the freedom council and the groups that made up the freedom council?</span></p> <p><span id="s288">A: About Christmas '42 I knew that now we have come so far that there were four organizations that covered the whole country.</span> <span id="s289">Two political parties, the communist party and the party and then which was people from all parties, but I knew they were dominated by government, which was not dominated by the communist, we had nothing against the communist.</span> <span id="s290">And the I felt it would be very important if we could make a common organization.</span> <span id="s291">We could prevent shoulders from the different organizations and the men who I had to go was .</span> <span id="s292">He was a member of the communist party and he was the leading figure in .</span> <span id="s293">And I had to talk with him and we agreed that either no should political parties be in this organization or this should be the both of them.</span> <span id="s294">That is something that I said.</span> <span id="s295">In the beginning we said, Anna Shotts, who was the leader of the party would not be a member because his .</span> <span id="s296">People knew him and we were not as well know.</span> <span id="s297">But when we came to Christmas he was in .</span> <span id="s298">Then we was eager to remember himself that we accepted it.</span></p> <p><span id="s299">End of Tape #1</span></p> <p><span id="s300">Tape #2</span></p> <p><span id="s301">Q: What was your life like during this period?</span> <span id="s302">I assume that the government was not happy with the activities that you were engaged in?</span></p> <p><span id="s303">A: The government told us that it would be great unhappiness.</span> <span id="s304">We felt that the great danger was that when Germany lost the war, which we hoped then we would be considered as the people who helped Nazism.</span> <span id="s305">Usually when three people are fighting for the freedom on Europe, it also means the freedom of Denmark, it would not be acceptable to sit and doing nothing when our people were losing their lives to win for our freedom.</span></p> <p><span id="s306">Q: Did you have to move around a great deal?</span></p> <p><span id="s307">A: Already in the first summer in '40, and it came so that we were told that the offices would be central Germany, the military offices.</span> <span id="s308">And they came to me and asked me if I could find hiding places, and I had a list of 5,000.</span></p> <p><span id="s309">Q: You were saying that you found 5,000 hiding places?</span></p> <p><span id="s310">A: For the offices, the military offices, but I could use it freely and I was realistic enough to take some of the best for myself.</span> <span id="s311">But I never spent more than a week at a place.</span> <span id="s312">If I observed the first time that there were some Nazis in the same house, then I left at once.</span> <span id="s313">But even if there were no signs of that, I never remained in one place more than one week.</span></p> <p><span id="s314">Q: Did you wear different disguises?</span> <span id="s315">Did you change your appearance?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: Not very much.</span> <span id="s317">At that time there were very few people yet and I thought that wearing a beard was almost to tell you that you were working underground, so I did not.</span> <span id="s318">But I had a very big hair, completely straight and short.</span> <span id="s319">And you expect this which was only usual -- I had no reason.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">Q: Were there many other resistance people who led the same kind of life that you did?</span> <span id="s321">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s322">People who are less known than I was, many people knew me before from books, they were not nearly to take so much caution.</span></p> <p><span id="s323">Q: Did you come into very dangerous contact with the Nazis?</span> <span id="s324">Did they ever get close to you?</span></p> <p><span id="s325">A: I was arrested by Nazis.</span> <span id="s326">I was in , or and it was in Springtime and the birds do not leave the land until they are forced to do it.</span> <span id="s327">So, in Spring time they get in formation and I was looking for birds there and I had been out and at the same time I saw a German patrols, it was on the way to protect their way to</span></p> <p><span id="s328">.</span></p> <p><span id="s329">Q: What happened to your wife during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s330">A: When the Jews were persecuted, she was sent to Sweden like the Jews.</span> <span id="s331">She got work in Stockholm as a photographer, what she had been in Germany.</span> <span id="s332">She had worked in the famous House in Hamberg founded by .</span> <span id="s333">And she got work in the same sort here and even she went to Sweden and her sister also and her sisters become Swedish.</span> <span id="s334">She is a sculpture.</span> <span id="s335">She did youth work.</span> <span id="s336">She has become Swedish.</span> <span id="s337">They didn't come back.</span></p> <p><span id="s338">Q: How did you actually arrange for her wife and her sister to go to Sweden?</span> <span id="s339">Can you recreate how they did that?</span></p> <p><span id="s340">A: She went in a great boat, not with a fisherman, a great boat from and I drove her myself and that she should be hidden.</span> <span id="s341">I remember very well when I came there and a man should be standing at a certain place and he would show me which ship to bring her.</span></p> <p><span id="s342">Q: Were there other Jews on that same boat?</span> <span id="s343">A: Not that I know.</span></p> <p><span id="s344">Q: When did this happen?</span> <span id="s345">Was this in October?</span> <span id="s346">Was this right when the roundup was taking place, when it began?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: It was when they started to tell that half Jews, because she was a half-Jews would not be taken, and Jews married to a Dane, would not be taken, so in that way she should be secure.</span> <span id="s348">But we did not believe the Nazis and it also came so.</span> <span id="s349">She would have been taken had she remained here.</span> <span id="s350">There were two reasons.</span> <span id="s351">It was much as you would be taken as hostage from me.</span> <span id="s352">The Germans had sought me already for more than a year and they took hostages, and I could not let her sit as a hostage and I could not go to the Germans to get her free.</span></p> <p><span id="s353">Q: What was she doing when you were living underground, when you were moving place to place all those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s354">A: She had her work and that was as a photographer in a hospital.</span> <span id="s355">Q: How did you keep in touch with her?</span></p> <p><span id="s356">A: In other places where we would meet our friends, but we did not see eachother so much and therefore when it was for her it was no problem to go to Sweden.</span></p> <p><span id="s357">Q: What was the relationship of the Danish police and the resistance movement?</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: The Danish police is not one person.</span> <span id="s359">They had different attitudes.</span> <span id="s360">The Danish police of course had to obey the Danish government, that's the usual attitude.</span> <span id="s361">But as the military people in the summer of '44 came to us and said they would acknowledge us as the underground government and obey us.</span> <span id="s362">The resistance was very much against it and in the same bed later they could .</span> <span id="s363">The police were, in my opinion, more loyal to the freedom council than the office.</span></p> <p><span id="s364">Q: So you felt that you could rely upon them, you could work with them?</span></p> <p><span id="s365">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s366">But their job was more, not the actual sabotage, but if it should end in a real fight in Denmark, Denmark was divided into six regions and the military man had the command in each of them.</span> <span id="s367">That was for fighting.</span> <span id="s368">We believe a long time that the British would go ashore in .</span> <span id="s369">It came in another way.</span> <span id="s370">We didn't know that and as late as the 2nd of May we were not sure who would come first, the Latvians, or the rest of the powers.</span> <span id="s371">The Latvians were at .</span> <span id="s372">I have the impression that even many communists would prefer that the western powers would come first.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: So, then the resistance prepared many different eventualities, one was, as I understand, one was the military engagement when the invasion came.</span> <span id="s374">What about sabotage?</span> <span id="s375">Was that a different part of what the resistance did?</span></p> <p><span id="s376">A: Sabotage was the main thing all the time.</span> <span id="s377">We start with information but when I came out of those people and told them about this information and asked them to make local newspapers, somebody wanted to do something more.</span> <span id="s378">And we talked about sabotage and some were ready for that.</span> <span id="s379">Later we made what we called the military force.</span> <span id="s380">That was when Germany was about to lose if there should be fighting in Denmark.</span> <span id="s381">Sabotage came very early.</span> <span id="s382">There had been sabotage in May 14, and the Germans came in April 14.</span> <span id="s383">But in the beginning it was very often only some boys, some very good boys.</span></p> <p><span id="s384">Later there were two big sabotage organizations, which was organized by the communist and , which was organized by the party.</span> <span id="s385">At one time the people came to me and said that they had been organized by , but he made it his policy and not -- he was more interested that it would support him when freedom came that it would be and they would prefer to be under me.</span> <span id="s386">He was very bitter against me because of that.</span> <span id="s387">I, of course, was very glad.</span> <span id="s388">That was the largest, most effective was the largest sabotage organizations.</span></p> <p><span id="s389">Q: Did you influence the choices for sabotage?</span> <span id="s390">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s391">Q: How did you decide?</span></p> <p><span id="s392">A: First we had to know and that was through the ministers where many of my friends were.</span> <span id="s393">What the Germans were doing there and there, what was important, who sent their wares to Germany was very important.</span> <span id="s394">I could always -- I had some people who were working all the time and ministers who knew everything about that.</span> <span id="s395">They could tell us what was important to sabotage.</span></p> <p><span id="s396">Q: The trains, the factories, what?</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: The train was a late thing, but very important.</span> <span id="s398">The train was not just delivering wares to Germany.</span> <span id="s399">The train was when Hitler needed troops more on the western front, Holland, Belgium and Norway.</span> <span id="s400">Then they went through and it was important to make sabotage in the start some trains were blown up but then also some innocent people were killed, and we forbid that and made only railway sabotage.</span> <span id="s401">So, the railways when the trains came and had stopped troops for a couple weeks.</span> <span id="s402">Sometimes it was</span></p> <p><span id="s403">.</span></p> <p><span id="s404">Q: Was there sabotage on the coast also, boats, Danish ships, any of that?</span> <span id="s405">A: I do not know.</span></p> <p><span id="s406">Q: Were any of the Danish boats --?</span></p> <p><span id="s407">A: At one time, and this is a very great thing, one time we knew that the Germans would take the complete Danish fleet and the high marine officer did sink them.</span> <span id="s408">That was for only people who knew about it, something.</span> <span id="s409">They were sunk.</span> <span id="s410">That was a very important thing.</span> <span id="s411">That was at .</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: The rescue of the Danish-Jewish community or the Jews in Denmark, has promoted a great feeling of sympathy towards Denmark, do the Danes deserve this great honor and sympathy?</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: We would have done the same.</span> <span id="s414">We did not make that distinction, but we were certain if we had been told that the Danish teachers would be taken to Germany then we had done something for the Danish teachers.</span></p> <p><span id="s415">Q: The Danish Jews were welcomed back into Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s416">A: Oh yes.</span> <span id="s417">There never had really been anti-semitism in Denmark, only in this small net of socialist party.</span> <span id="s418">In the Danish parliament there were 150 members and three of them belonged to the national socialists.</span> <span id="s419">Only once did they get anybody elected during the German occupation but it was 150.</span> <span id="s420">It never was a big party.</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: Why is Denmark different from other European countries in regard to anti-semitism and what happened during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: I don't think we are different from Norway or Sweden.</span> <span id="s423">Not at all, and I do not know the relationship.</span> <span id="s424">The Jews helped the in a difficult position many years ago.</span> <span id="s425">They were not allowed to have land, so they couldn't be farmers.</span> <span id="s426">They were not allowed in the guilds, so they had to be merchants.</span> <span id="s427">They could lend money.</span> <span id="s428">So, many people became very angry at the Jews.</span></p> <p><span id="s429">Q: But not in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s430">A: Also in Denmark.</span> <span id="s431">Less perhaps because there were fewer, but it has in the middle ages something to do with history that the Jews killed Jesus, and that is not true.</span> <span id="s432">They didn't kill him.</span> <span id="s433">When the Jews killed people they stoned them.</span> <span id="s434">When the Romans killed people they had different methods, but one was crucification.</span> <span id="s435">In that way you can see it was not the Jews, but the Romans who killed Jesus.</span> <span id="s436">Jesus, was after all, a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s437">Q: There is some thinking now that the Germans looked the other way when the Jews were being rescued.</span> <span id="s438">They didn't arrest the Jews when they could have.</span> <span id="s439">Do you feel the Germans eased the way for the Jews to escape?</span></p> <p><span id="s440">A: I don't think it has any importance, but of course there were German soldiers who were against persecution of Jews.</span> <span id="s441">Like there were German soldiers who were not national socialists.</span> <span id="s442">But we did not feel anything of that therefore we had to hide the Jews as the first step.</span></p> <p><span id="s443">Q: And you didn't feel that the Germans made it a little bit easier?</span></p> <p><span id="s444">A: No.</span> <span id="s445">I'm sure there were many German soldiers who were against Hitler.</span></p> <p><span id="s446">Q: There's another part of the reconsideration of the rescue, and that is the Danish some of them asked to be paid a great deal of money to take the Jews to Sweden.</span> <span id="s447">Do you feel that was a big factor?</span></p> <p><span id="s448">A: The rescue boats and many lost their boats and fishermen with a boat is in a difficult position.</span> <span id="s449">Of course they took money for the risk, but I don't know.</span> <span id="s450">I have not found that they behaved badly.</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: Did you help to raise money or dispense the money for these fishermen?</span> <span id="s452">A: The Jews paid themselves.</span> <span id="s453">The Jews never a politariat.</span></p> <p><span id="s454">Q: Did you go to Sweden many times during the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s455">A: No, only one time.</span> <span id="s456">I went to Sweden to help Denmark acknowledge as Allies, also by Russians.</span> <span id="s457">We did not know who would be first at our friendship.</span> <span id="s458">The Russians were very quickly forged through all of Germany and even the Navy could not know.</span> <span id="s459">The Danish government had joined the anti-communist pact with Italy and Germany and Spain so we were afraid whether the Russians would consider us helping the Germany.</span> <span id="s460">Therefore I proposed in the freedom council that we should take up the relationship with the Soviet Union, which Denmark had broken itself and sent back the ambassador.</span> <span id="s461">I proposed who was a friend of mine a little family man and they agreed and so I went to Sweden as a fisherman and went through the British Embassy.</span> <span id="s462">The Russian Embassy did not know me, the British did, and they told the Russians I was good enough and the Latvians would accept a representative for Denmark, not simply Denmark.</span> <span id="s463">Then I told them we would send an ambassador who was not very political or we could send a man who had not been an ambassador but who had played a role in the resistance movement and the could prefer whom they wanted.</span> <span id="s464">They preferred a man who had been in the resistance movement and he was sent Sweden and was accepted.</span></p> <p><span id="s465">Q: What was the policy of the freedom council to collaborators.</span> <span id="s466">How did you feel Denmark should treat the collaborators?</span></p> <p><span id="s467">A: The Danish freedom council had made a great complex of laws, who regulates, he was of an organization of all lawyers.</span> <span id="s468">He had made that and the political parties also made it and when we compared they were not so different.</span> <span id="s469">There was a question of death sentence.</span> <span id="s470">We were all against death sentence and it was not within but before we agreed we also had politicians and what these politicians did and I had to go around all Denmark and show it to resistance people.</span> <span id="s471">When they heard that there was no death sentence then they said I think we must kill that person before that law is made.</span> <span id="s472">I am sure that more people had been killed if I had not returned and told them we have this sentence.</span> <span id="s473">As a consequence of judgments and not what we call the the long knives night.</span></p> <p><span id="s474">Q: What was that long knives night?</span></p> <p><span id="s475">A: That was when people killed the people who helped the Germans, especially what we called , in English, informers.</span> <span id="s476">If we had not had this sentence many informers had been killed by the resistance people.</span></p> <p><span id="s477">Q: How many collaborators were sentenced to death?</span></p> <p><span id="s478">A: I think about 90 were sentenced to death and about half of them were executed because in the summer of '45 it was necessary if people should not do it themselves without judgment but already in the autumn of '45 it was not like that.</span> <span id="s479">As a matter of fact we were against death sentences and nobody was killed after that.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Why were you against that?</span></p> <p><span id="s481">A: If people are imprisoned they can be .</span> <span id="s482">If people have been executed, you cannot give them life again.</span> <span id="s483">That's a big difference.</span> <span id="s484">But I'm sure we're all against death sentence in Denmark today.</span> <span id="s485">There is no -- it was only in this law against , it is not been outlawed in other sorts of criminality.</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: Were there an unusually large number of collaborators, that is people who joined the German army or fought with the Germans on the eastern front?</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: I cannot compare relations.</span> <span id="s488">It was very few compared with the French.</span></p> <p><span id="s489">Q: The king has received an enormous amount of credit for the story about wearing the yellow star in order to befriend the Jews.</span> <span id="s490">Do you know where that story came from?</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: No, and I do not know whether it is true or it is untrue.</span></p> <p><span id="s492">Q: If you're not sure about whether the king wore the star or didn't wear the star, what do you think happened?</span></p> <p><span id="s493">A: The king was very popular and he was much against the German occupation, and it was a great help to many people when he rode through Copenhagen completely unprotected, and I believe that this star that is a myth sprung out of this popularity which really deserved.</span></p> <p><span id="s494">Q: After the war, the knowledge of the extermination camps became wide spread.</span> <span id="s495">When did you first learn about the camps.</span></p> <p><span id="s496">A: Long before the occupation.</span> <span id="s497">Haven't I told that I had a career already in '33 through Germany as a career from 40 German refugees here, communists, Trotskys, social democrats.</span> <span id="s498">And there of course I heard everything they knew in Germany.</span> <span id="s499">That was in the summer of '33.</span> <span id="s500">I had that relationship all the time and I heard that somebody had disappeared in Hamberg and never seen anything more.</span> <span id="s501">How we lived there you couldn't know anything about that, but they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">Q: And disappeared into concentration camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s503">A: We did not know the concentration camps.</span> <span id="s504">I'm sure it was something like that because people disappeared completely.</span> <span id="s505">They could sit and know them there and one day they're away.</span></p> <p><span id="s506">Q: Did you have knowledge of the extermination camps before the end of the war?</span></p> <p><span id="s507">A: I did not make the distinctions.</span> <span id="s508">We knew that many of our friends disappeared from Hamberg or Berlin and how it became, only that they disappeared.</span></p> <p><span id="s509">Q: So when the Jews were rescued in Denmark there was no sense that you were saving them from extermination camps but just from capture by the Germans?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: We sort of saved them and found some things, that was enough.</span> <span id="s511">What that would be we couldn't know better than that.</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Were there women who were leaders of the resistance in Denmark?</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: No.</span> <span id="s514">But we were all in the resistance.</span> <span id="s515">The resistance means many things.</span> <span id="s516">There are sabotages and there are what we call the illegal army, illegal newspapers and I'm sure many women worked in the newspapers.</span></p> <p><span id="s517">Q: And in hiding people?</span></p> <p><span id="s518">A: We had lived in the underground for several years and when I had lived in one place one week, I left it because somebody might have seen me too many times there and they very, very often knew we went and did could tell us a good hiding place.</span></p> <p><span id="s519">Q: As I understand it, there were some disagreements in the freedom council between the parties on the right and on the left between Helga and the social democrats.</span> <span id="s520">Did these ever affect the rescue of the Jews, these differences, or was there?</span></p> <p><span id="s521">A: I can't answer that.</span> <span id="s522">There was no difference.</span> <span id="s523">In the freedom council we never thought of who was a social democrat.</span> <span id="s524">There were two parties, the communist and the and we were unpolitical.</span> <span id="s525">I knew the Jews because I was a social democrat but we never spoke of such things.</span></p> <p><span id="s526">(viewing pictures)</span></p> <p><span id="s527">A: This is my first wife.</span> <span id="s528">She was born in Hamberg and she wanted to go to Israel, but Israel was a British mandate, and to go to Israel they demanded that you have learned an agriculture thing.</span> <span id="s529">She was a photographer of x-rays in hospitals.</span> <span id="s530">Then she chose to Sweden and learn poultry farming.</span> <span id="s531">And one day one of my friends from Hamberg who had come here as a refugee asked me if we should not make a trip to Sweden and there we could meet one of his friends from Hamberg.</span> <span id="s532">In that way I met Goldstein.</span> <span id="s533">She is called , but the two middle things she did not like especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: Can you explain this picture?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: That is a picture of my wife and me.</span> <span id="s536">She speaks as well Swedish as Danish because she immigrated from Denmark to Sweden and when my first wife died, we were married.</span> <span id="s537">We had no children together.</span> <span id="s538">I have two children and she has two children and that is one good family.</span></p> <p><span id="s539">Q: This is about your .</span> <span id="s540">Can you say something about your love for birds?</span></p> <p><span id="s541">A: It is not a special love for birds, it is love of nature, but there are very few memories in Denmark and the insects are small but after all I have a collection of insects, but the main thing are the birds in a country like Denmark.</span> <span id="s542">There is much listening of birds and knowing their voices as recognizing them and seeing them.</span> <span id="s543">This is from the council in Europe at Strassburg.</span> <span id="s544">The church is one of the main figures.</span> <span id="s545">When the European movements started I went to the park and was a Danish member of the first European movement and what we demanded was a council for Europe that came later in Strassburg.</span> <span id="s546">My father was really against it and he called it the Church Party and aptly warned against it.</span> <span id="s547">As I often did my own things during the war, I went there and later were very eager to build.</span> <span id="s548">This is a picture of my father.</span> <span id="s549">He is much older of course, but more than usual.</span> <span id="s550">He was born in 1854 and he remembered the war in Germany in '64 when he was 10 years old when we lost a certain part of .</span> <span id="s551">He belonged to those people who found that the state should not play too great a role in people and families should decide for themselves.</span> <span id="s552">He was against what we call , the people's church.</span> <span id="s553">Even the words, he called it and he was also against people going to school.</span> <span id="s554">People should choose whom they wanted to teach their children so it's a circle of people in my island where I had born had him as the teacher.</span> <span id="s555">At one time there were 65 children going to school in this unofficial school and only nine going in the official school.</span> <span id="s556">No person has had more importance for me than he and I think it's a very good thing when a son can say about his father that no person has meant more to him particularly.</span></p> <p><span id="s557">End of Tape #2 Conclusion of
