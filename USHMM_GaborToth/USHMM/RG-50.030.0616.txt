BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: That's okay. It's okay.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I did find out her grandmother's name. Your grandmother's name was Sarah.
A: Lindau had so many Jewish people and they associated.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Who did you go to the community center with?
A: We did not associate with Gentile people. I had no Gentile friends.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Who did you go to the Jewish community center with? What were your friends' names that you went to the community center with?
A: Oh, for heaven's sake, don't ask me anything like that.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: You don't remember. Okay.
A: I don't know anymore.
BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: That's okay. That's okay. Did you go to school, public school or a private?
A: Public school.
Q: Were there German Gentiles in that school?
A: Yes.
Q: Do you remember what your school years were like? Did you enjoy going to school?
A: I had two Gentile friends and associated with Jewish people, you know, Lindau had, I remember, about five Jewish kids in one class, six, you know.
Q: Do you remember the names of those two Gentile friends?
A: Oh, God.
Q: Do you remember what they were like? Were they nice? Were they -- did they stay your friends?
A: What?
Q: Were these two Gentile friends, did they stay your friends later or not?
A: No, no. ______ + before my parents.
Q: I see. Tell me --
A: We had pretty good friends, but since Hitler came, it was -- I had -- I had a boyfriend and he was not Jewish. And when Hitler came, he said, I'm sorry, I cannot see you anymore.
Q: That must have been hard.
A: Yes. And I left any way. Hitler came January and I left January 5th. I said I'm not going to stay here, I'm leaving. And I left and went to France to my relatives.
Q: It's very unusual that in -- so Hitler came to power in 1933. It's very unusual that a young woman, because, I take it, in 1933 you were almost 20 years old, would have --
A: 18.
Q: 18, 19, yeah.
A: Well, I had my French relatives. Nobody had French relatives. My grandmother was French, was in Alsace-Lorraine.
Q: But what I want to say is what is so unusual in what you are telling me is that somebody who was your age at that time would have said, I'm leaving. Most people didn't – they didn't like him, but they didn't think he was that dangerous.
A: I said I'm not going to stay. I'm leaving.
Q: And why? Why did you do that at that moment?
A: Because I didn't -- I didn't like what happen with Hitler. Our maid protected us, but -- and I had my French relatives, so --
Q: You had somewhere to go?
A: Sure. I had -- I didn't -- there are parts of Kindertransport --
Q: That happened much later.
A: It happened later.
Q: Later. In 1933, that wasn't happening yet.
A: No, no. But I did say I'm not going to stay. I go to my relatives in France.
Q: What did your parents say when you said that?
A: They didn't like it, but they said go, they said have a life.
Q: Was your brother there?
A: And I got French citizenship because my grandmother was in Alsace-Lorraine and I got my French citizenship, so I went back and forth.
Q: Oh, so from 1933, back and forth?
A: I was a French citizen.
Q: So it wasn't the last time you were in Lindau?
A: No, no.
Q: Oh, I see. So when you left in '33, you went to Alsace-Lorraine, back and forth?
A: Back and forth. And I immigrated, I got my Visa in Stuttgart as a German citizen.
Q: And you immigrated to where, to Alsace-Lorraine?
A: To -- where did I go? Gosh.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Homburg?
A: Homburg, from Homburg to --
BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: France?
A: New York.
Q: I see. To the United States?
A: And to the United States. My brother was a doctor and he say -- I say don't go to the United States because you have to work housework and I'm not doing anybody's housework. And he told me I don't have to. He was working in hospital and he said he would find some work at the hospital.
Q: And did he?
A: No, I didn't. And Hilda came.
Q: Who is Hilda?
A: A girl my brother met when he was five years old.
Q: Oh, the one where he --
A: And she was married to a very, very rich man from Klingsbow (phonetic) and her mother came and she said if I would take care of her mother. And I said, what do you have to do? I don't do any housework. She said I don't have any housework. I have a maid.
Q: Okay.
A: And we went for three months, I don't know if you know, to the Grove Park Inn in Asheville.
Q: In Carolina?
A: Yeah.
Q: Is that North or South Carolina?
A: It's a very fancy hotel. My daughter could stay last year one day. And I stayed for three months.
Q: Okay. And you were taking care of this lady?
A: And I went back and forth to Greensboro.
Q: To Greensboro?
A: Yes.
Q: I see. So when was it that you actually left Germany for the United States? What year was that?
A: 1933, 5th January, 1933.
Q: But you had left for France then to Alsace-Lorraine?
A: I went to France.
Q: And then after that you went back and forth to Germany?
A: Always I went to France. And there was one day you could go to Germany without any passport. And I went. I went as a French citizen, but I immigrated as a German from Homburg, you know.
Q: And did you leave Homburg in 1933, as well?
A: No, no.
Q: When was it that you left Homburg?
A: 1938.
Q: So it was five years between going to France and going back and forth?
A: Yeah.
Q: And then immigrating. So you saw a lot during those five years?
A: But I was --
Q: In France?
A: -- in France in Strasbourg for three years and then I went to Paris.
Q: I see.
A: And in Paris, I had a very rich cousin. I had cousins all over in France.
Q: Did you study there? Did you work? Did you go to school?
A: No. I went to school. And one cousin said, he says, some people came from Shanghai and he said there's a committee and some people came from Shanghai, what do you want do? Do you want to stay here, do you want to go there? What can you do and stuff like that?
Q: So these must have been refugees from Shanghai?
A: Yeah. I did not work.
Q: Were you fluent in French?
A: Yes.
Q: How many languages do you speak?
A: Now I forgot.
Q: But at one time, how many languages did you speak?
A: French and German.
Q: And then later you learned English?
A: And of course, English. But my cousin -- I had a lot of cousins in France and in Paris. My cousin said I'm not supposed to work and I worked at the committee. And when some people came from Shanghai, I asked them, well, what do you want to do?
Q: Tell me, when did your brother go to the United States?
A: He came five years before me.
Q: So he came in 1933?
A: Yeah, we had money, our relatives always had, when they came and visited, they took money along.
Q: I see.
A: And so he studied partly in Germany and finished his studies Switzerland because in Germany it was acknowledged.
Q: By whom?
A: By the United States.
Q: I see. By studies, you know, the degrees?
A: So he studied in --
Q: In Switzerland?
A: In Switzerland and used that money.
Q: What was going on with your parents? Did your father still have the tobacco company?
A: No. He had to stop it.
Q: When did that happen?
A: Pretty much after Hitler came.
Q: So soon after?
A: 1933, 1934.
Q: What did he do after that time when he no longer had his company?
A: We had money. And since it was last the last boat --
Q: Your parents?
A: -- to the United States.
Q: When was that last boat? Was it after '39?
A: '38.
Q: Yeah. You don't -- you're not sure, though huh? Was your father or mother, when they were left in Lindau, and you were gone and your brother was gone –
A: They didn't stay in Lindau. They couldn't stay there.
Q: What did they do?
A: They went somewhere else, to a cousin of my mother. And when my dad -- my dad was in the concentration camp.
Q: Which concentration camp was he in?
A: In Dachau.
Q: He was in Dachau?
A: He was in Dachau but not for too long.
Q: How did that happen? Did he tell you how he ended up there?
A: Somehow, somehow. And when he came out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mom was because she could not stay in Lindau anymore.
Q: So he had been arrested from Lindau?
A: He was, yes, but then when he got out of the concentration camp, he didn't know where my mother was, you know.
Q: How did he find her?
A: Well, he saw a few cousins and he knew where one was and he thought maybe she was there. And she was there. And then I don't know how long it took until they came to the United States.
Q: Was he -- did he ever talk about what happened to him in the Dachau?
A: No, we never talked about it. I didn't.
Q: I have the impression, correct me if I'm wrong, that as you were growing up, you didn't see much of your parents; you mostly had interaction with your nanny?
A: That's right. And that's why when I came to the United States, I said I was so little with my parents, I go one year. My brother was a doctor in Queensborough, near Albany. So I say I go there. For one year, I stayed with my parents.
Q: Was that the first time you were really close with them in the same area?
A: Yeah.
Q: What was that like because you were already a grownup lady?
A: I was glad to be with my parents. I was with my parents -- I was 18 when I left. And, you know, I just have to go because I was in Queensborough and I said I have to go one year, I have to go to my parents.
Q: But this must have been when your father had left Dachau. Did he seem a different person because of that? Had he been -- did he seem like he was older or sicker?
A: I hadn't seen him for so many years, I wouldn't know.
Q: You wouldn't know.
A: No. My parents had a very, very, very good life. The minute they came to the United States, they never had to work and my mother had her maid and they lived with my brother.
Q: In Albany, or near; in Troy?
A: Well, it's between Troy and Albany. He had his office there.
Q: Did he still have something with tobacco businesses, your father?
A: No, no. He was a doctor.
Q: Your brother, I know, but your parents, did your father--
A: He didn't have to work.
Q: He didn't have to work?
A: No.
Q: Okay.
A: No. My parents did not have to work. Only thing was he had a dog, he brushed him and they had a good life. They never had to work. And my brother did it so he made a checking account and another account and put money into it, so they never had to ask.
Q: That's very thoughtful. That's very thoughtful.
A: Because they came out of -- they came to Seattle when my daughter was born and they came and they never had to ask for money. They never had to ask for anything. So they were very fortunate because there were very few people who were independent with enough money.
Q: That's true.
A: And my brother always put money in the checking account and when the account got less, he put more in.
Q: That's a good son.
A: There was never any question.
Q: It's more than money. It is also a sign of love and respect.
A: That's right. And I was, how shall I say it? My sister-in-law, her mother came from Shanghai and she asked, I went to dental school and I was dental assistant. She asked me if I would take care of her mother because she doesn't speak English, she doesn't -- and so forth. I say, what do I have to do? I don't do housework. She said I don't have to do housework. So we went to our Palm -- our house was in Palm Springs, but it was too early to go to Palm Springs. It was too hot. So we went to Asheville, North Carolina at the Grove Park Inn and stayed there for three months at the Grove Park Inn.
Q: So this lady that you were taking care of, was this your future mother-in-law?
A: No.
Q: This was somebody else?
A: It was my brother's -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Future sister-in-law.
A: Nobody's mother-in-law.
BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: No.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: No.
A: But I -- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Your daughter.
A: She couldn't speak English. I could speak English. We were in Asheville.
BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: How did you meet your husband?
A: Huh?
Q: How did you meet your husband?
A: Oh, God.
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Let me just interject one thing. The daughter of the -- Margaret, listen to me for one minute.
BY INTERVIEWER:
Q: Hang on a second. I just wanted to establish that relationship. So now I have -- I think I've got it clear, that the lady you were taking care of was your brother's future mother-in-law. That's who she was, because Hilda eventually became your brother's wife?
A: Yeah, yeah.
Q: And --
A: And they met when they were five years old.
Q: That's right. And they had met at age five. It's amazing. It's amazing those kinds of coincidences. So tell me now, I had asked you before, how did you meet your husband?
A: Well, I was in Jones Beach with a cousin of my sister-in-law.
Q: So in Jones Beach, Long Island, New York?
A: Yeah. And she said she writes a card to a friend of hers, she's going to marry. So they left, and said why write. So I said to a guy I don't know. So I wrote something. How did we start corresponding? I don't know anymore. Oh, yeah, the people from the Shanghai came.
Q: To New York? To San Francisco?
A: No. They came to San Francisco to Seattle or to Los Angeles.
Q: And who are the people from Shanghai? Were friends of yours?
A: I do not know.
Q: Oh, you don't know?
A: Oh, God, no.
Q: Okay.
A: And my husband's mother was on that boat and he wrote and send -- says you go to -- you go to Seattle and pick up. I said, I'm not going to Seattle and pick up. I said, I know a guy in Seattle. So I told my husband such and such a lady comes, if he would pick up at the boat and put up at a nice hotel and any expenses she has, I will --
Q: You will cover?
A: Yes, because money was no problem -- was no --
Q: Problem?
A: No. I had a good job and I didn't -- I didn't -- money was no problem.
Q: Okay. What was your job?
A: What?
Q: What was your job? You say you had a good job?
A: I was a dental assistant and I worked at a hospital.
Q: In what place?
A: In New York.
Q: In New York City?
A: Yes.
Q: And were you married by then?
A: No.
Q: Okay. So as far as meeting your husband, what I understood is that you met him --
A: It goes that way. We met at Jones Beach and she wrote a card and so had a little bit left over, said, why don't you write something. I said, why should I write to a guy I don't know. And she said she's going to marry him.
Q: She said that she was going to marry him?
A: Yeah.
Q: I guess she didn't.
A: No. I did.
Q: And so where was he when you wrote that card?
