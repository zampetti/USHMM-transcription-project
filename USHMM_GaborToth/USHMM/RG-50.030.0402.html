<p><span id="s12">Question: Can we begin by having you tell us your full name at birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s13">Answer: Okay.</span> <span id="s14">I like to talk.</span> <span id="s15">Like -- we -- we lived in Germany, very, very nicely in Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s16">Q: Can I get you to say your full name?</span></p> <p><span id="s17">A: Oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s18">Q: Your name.</span></p> <p><span id="s19">A: My name is Ruth Zellner.</span> <span id="s20">I was born in Germany, Breslau, which now is Polish, called Wroclaw.</span> <span id="s21">Poland always moved around after each war.</span> <span id="s22">That’s why my father, who was born in Germany, in Posen, also his hometown became Polish and we ended up on the Polish quota for the United State, which made all the difference in the world.</span></p> <p><span id="s23">Q: Can you tell us when you were born?</span></p> <p><span id="s24">A: If I have to.</span> <span id="s25">I was born in 1920, which makes me now almost 79, I have a birthday pretty soon.</span> <span id="s26">So I’m not so young any more.</span> <span id="s27">But I’m one of the few who was old enough to know what was going on, and then still around.</span> <span id="s28">The little kids, the American newcomers, but they don’t remember.</span> <span id="s29">The old people are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s30">Q: Can you tell us the exact date of your birth?</span> <span id="s31">The exact date of your birth?</span></p> <p><span id="s32">A: We moved in --</span></p> <p><span id="s33">Q: Of your birth.</span> <span id="s34">The -- the day you were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s35">A: Oh, the birth.</span></p> <p><span id="s36">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s37">A: December first, 1920.</span></p> <p><span id="s38">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">A: My parents had married after the war.</span> <span id="s40">My father had been a front soldier.</span> <span id="s41">And of course when Hitler came, he said that some soldiers, Jewish men who had fought for the Fatherland, they would be not hurt in any way, which of course was a lie.</span> <span id="s42">My father was a very prominent lawyer, made a lot of money, we lived very nicely and comfortable.</span> <span id="s43">He was also, as a lawyer, not prepared to move to a different country with different law.</span> <span id="s44">A doctor can move anywhere, learn the language and check the people.</span> <span id="s45">My father, by the time we got here was 60, and he -- he did -- his English was pretty grim.</span> <span id="s46">So there he -- we all had to start over.</span> <span id="s47">Now, before we get here, let me tell you where it began.</span></p> <p><span id="s48">Q: Could we begin also by having you say the -- the name of your mother and the name of your father.</span></p> <p><span id="s49">A: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s50">Q: The full name --</span></p> <p><span id="s51">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s52">Q -- and your mother’s maiden name, if you know it.</span></p> <p><span id="s53">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s54">My father was Mac Zellner.</span> <span id="s55">My mother’s name was Gertrude Markus, M-a-r-k-u-s.</span> <span id="s56">She was one of the first women who got a doctor’s degree, at a time when most of them didn’t even have high school, she started at the University of Breslau, and had a PhD.</span> <span id="s57">She never used it, too bad, but she -- she was a very intelligent woman, and that helped.</span> <span id="s58">My father studied law in Germany, and he was just a young lawyer when he was drafted into the army.</span> <span id="s59">After he came back, he met my mother and they were married very shortly after.</span> <span id="s60">You know, after the war, there’s always -- the men come home, the same thing after this war, they want to settle down.</span> <span id="s61">We were two children, I am Ruth, my sister who was younger, was Margaret.</span> <span id="s62">And we lived in a plain place in the beginning, because you couldn’t get anything.</span> <span id="s63">Then we had a very beautiful home.</span> <span id="s64">And we were beginning to look to come to the United State.</span> <span id="s65">We did get a visa from my father’s cousin, whose parents had come to the States already, we didn’t know her.</span> <span id="s66">But, as I said, the Polish quota was oversubscribed by that time in ’37 or so when we started looking.</span> <span id="s67">You just couldn’t get on it any more.</span> <span id="s68">So we looked around to see if there was any place that we could wait, like for instance, Cuba.</span></p> <p><span id="s69">Q: I-I want to spend a little more time on your childhood.</span> <span id="s70">Do you know anything about your grandparents from either side?</span> <span id="s71">Do you remember them, do you know their names?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">A: My father’s parents had died long before me.</span> <span id="s73">I somewhere have a little family tree, but it’s not very helpful.</span> <span id="s74">They must have been born early in the previous century.</span> <span id="s75">My mother’s parents I knew, but they too -- my grandfather died very early of a gallbladder operation.</span> <span id="s76">My grandmother, we had to leave her behind, because she was old and a little weak.</span> <span id="s77">We couldn’t have left with her.</span> <span id="s78">So wi -- my parents took her into a Jewish home in Breslau, paid forever, and one thing I really like to mention that, we had a lovely cook with us forever, she was a very devoted Catholic lady.</span> <span id="s79">And when my grandmother went to that home, she rearranged for her to have a job there, so my grandmother had somebody who was familiar.</span> <span id="s80">What we were told is that she died in the home.</span> <span id="s81">I hope it’s true.</span> <span id="s82">I come back to that life -- cook of ours later.</span> <span id="s83">As a -- my childhood was all right.</span> <span id="s84">When things became difficult, I left the school where I was, because these were the daughters of the big shots of Nazis, and my parents sent me to a school run by the church.</span> <span id="s85">The teachers were not nuns or anything, but they were [indecipherable] with everybody was from the church.</span> <span id="s86">There were quite a few Jewish kids there.</span> <span id="s87">In the beginning when we came, the teacher would come in [indecipherable] crystals, I don’t know if you understand that.</span> <span id="s88">When Hitler came, heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s89">So that wasn’t so great after awhile, but they were very dedicated to helping the Jewish kids.</span> <span id="s90">But in ’37, things became too uncomfortable, and I went to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s91">I still measure [indecipherable] I don’t know what -- if you know what that is, it’s a little more than the metric.</span> <span id="s92">Some of my children from my school got two years credit in college here for what -- our exam.</span> <span id="s93">Yeah.</span> <span id="s94">Many of those who got a lot of credit were veterans.</span> <span id="s95">So they, of course, they were very helpful.</span> <span id="s96">When I sent my paper to Washington, or Albany I think it was, they didn’t get too hysterical about it.</span> <span id="s97">I didn’t get credit, but I never studied for credit.</span> <span id="s98">I only took the courses I needed for my work.</span> <span id="s99">[indecipherable] jumped ahead.</span> <span id="s100">Then, in ’39, we were told that the -- no, I think I want to tell you about the 10th of November, that was the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s101">Q: But before we get there, I’d like to spend a little bit more time on your childhood, and your schooling.</span> <span id="s102">You just mentioned that when you were younger, you went to -- you implied that you went to a mixed school of Germans that were non-Jews, and Jews.</span> <span id="s103">Could you tell us more about that?</span> <span id="s104">How did the children get along?</span></p> <p><span id="s105">A: Before Hitler, fine, they didn’t know the difference, you had friends all over.</span> <span id="s106">Once Hitler came, those who were your friends, were your friends, but they wouldn’t invite you any more, you wouldn’t invite them.</span> <span id="s107">It was difficult, it got stranger.</span> <span id="s108">The last year that I was in the Catholic school, I was the only Jewish girl in my class.</span> <span id="s109">Lunchtime, nobody talked to me.</span> <span id="s110">I was -- it wasn’t that they didn't like me, but they were afraid.</span> <span id="s111">Their fathers had positions in the Nazi party, and she has a Jewish girlfriend?</span> <span id="s112">They couldn’t take the chance.</span> <span id="s113">But by that time, I was 17, and I really didn’t like it there any more.</span> <span id="s114">As a matter of fact, there was a school in Berlin where the children of the em-embassies, American, English, would go and learn English, and speak -- get their own education, the British education.</span> <span id="s115">And I wanted to go there.</span> <span id="s116">I thought that would be the right thing to do.</span> <span id="s117">My parents didn’t want me to do that because they thought if there’s a quick emigration, I’d be in Berlin, they’d be in Breslau.</span> <span id="s118">They said, if you don’t want to be in the -- in the Catholic school, go to the Jewish school.</span> <span id="s119">I was very happy there, I was one -- one among equals.</span> <span id="s120">I was relaxed, we had a lot of fun, until th-the Kristallnacht.</span></p> <p><span id="s121">Q: H-How did you -- how did you understand what was beginning to happen?</span> <span id="s122">Did your parents speak to you about it?</span> <span id="s123">Did you speak with your parents when you got home, for instance from the school?</span></p> <p><span id="s124">A: I had the papers.</span> <span id="s125">They said this paper is not in the national interest, it will be suspended for two weeks.</span> <span id="s126">Well the two weeks are 60 years now.</span> <span id="s127">So I mean, I saw what’s going on.</span> <span id="s128">Also, you had all these Hitler talks on the radio, and were -- this was a very noisy way of controlling people, they were marching along.</span> <span id="s129">But it did not really affect me so much.</span> <span id="s130">And when I was in the Jewish school, we had our own swimming pool.</span> <span id="s131">So what did I care?</span> <span id="s132">And that -- there was a -- a th-theater group, Jewish, concert Jewish.</span> <span id="s133">So the last year, when Hitler really was getting going, it was a cocoon, a ghetto.</span> <span id="s134">Which I didn’t even mind, I was too young, I was happy.</span> <span id="s135">There were nice boys, there were nice girls.</span> <span id="s136">So what’s wrong with that?</span> <span id="s137">And as I said, y -- that came to the Kristallnacht.</span> <span id="s138">Until that time, life was okay, I knew I would be leaving Germany, and everybody wanted to.</span> <span id="s139">But there was no hardship yet, thank God, that came after we left.</span></p> <p><span id="s140">Q: C-Can you talk a little bit about homelife, even before Kristallnacht, really, the early 30’s, the mid-1930’s.</span> <span id="s141">Wh-What was it like to be in your house?</span> <span id="s142">What was your mother like?</span> <span id="s143">How -- how did your family spend time together?</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: It’s -- to tell you the truth, I took it so for granted, that I can hardly tell you.</span> <span id="s145">I went to school in the morning, I came home.</span> <span id="s146">It was a big nice apartment, and I -- in -- I remember once I left Germany, I had a shock.</span> <span id="s147">When you took your dirty boots off, they didn’t come back clean by themselves.</span> <span id="s148">The cook did it, so -- I took that for granted.</span> <span id="s149">Th-There were so many things that I later thought, gee whiz [indecipherable] spoiled.</span> <span id="s150">I was not spoiled, because we were told to clean our room, to do this and that.</span> <span id="s151">But still and all, I remember one of the girls, one Jewish said to me, “This is a nice pin, is it real?”</span> <span id="s152">“I wouldn’t wear costume jewelry.”</span> <span id="s153">And you know, these things stay with you.</span> <span id="s154">And one of the girls -- and also, as I said, before Hitler, invited me to her home.</span> <span id="s155">And I said, “Mom, you say these people are poor, they have five rooms, we only have six.”</span> <span id="s156">So my mother said, “How big were the five rooms?</span> <span id="s157">As big as our living room?”</span> <span id="s158">I learned.</span> <span id="s159">You know, it -- that’s why when you asked me, it seemed so terrible away from it.</span> <span id="s160">I lived in the moon.</span> <span id="s161">And of course, anything I wanted I had.</span> <span id="s162">When te -- again my parents trained me.</span> <span id="s163">I know I wanted to have a writing thing like this, you know, with envelopes and everything.</span> <span id="s164">I bought it.</span> <span id="s165">But it was 15 marks maybe.</span> <span id="s166">My father said, “No.</span> <span id="s167">Poor children have to live on that for a week.</span> <span id="s168">You return it, and you get your money back.”</span> <span id="s169">So I knew you can’t just buy anything you wanted.</span> <span id="s170">But what you needed, you got plenty.</span> <span id="s171">So if you must -- if you remember my life before Hitler, if somebody who lived not on Park or Fifth Avenue, but on the Upper East Side, going to the schools that you knew and knowing the people you were supposed to know.</span> <span id="s172">But when you are 12 - 13, you are not [indecipherable] very often, nowadays they are more than then.</span></p> <p><span id="s173">Q: Can you tell us some about your father?</span> <span id="s174">A-A-A-Again, during this pre-Hitler time, before a lot of anxiety had come about for the Jewish community?</span></p> <p><span id="s175">A: Well, my father was very well known.</span> <span id="s176">He wrote a column for the newspaper about anything new in laws.</span> <span id="s177">When the laws was the -- not Hitler law, he had a reserved column, whenever he wanted to write.</span> <span id="s178">He had the clients from here to there, very important cases.</span> <span id="s179">He was a very charming man, and a very good speaker.</span> <span id="s180">So he would tell socially anecdote about all the doctors and lawyers in Breslau.</span> <span id="s181">He was very well known at the -- by the judges.</span> <span id="s182">His word counted.</span> <span id="s183">I don’t know if I should tell you one case that’s really -- by that time Hitler was [indecipherable] already.</span> <span id="s184">There was a couple, an Austrian woman and a German man, and the laws were that -- I have to get this -- they wanted to get married.</span> <span id="s185">And the laws are, you have to go by the marriage laws of your home country.</span> <span id="s186">The woman was Austrian and Catholic, and couldn’t divorce and marry that man.</span> <span id="s187">So they had many cases, I mean, they tried it, no.</span> <span id="s188">Then my father got the case, and my father, as a Jew said, I think I have an angle.</span> <span id="s189">It is important to the German country to have strong German children.</span> <span id="s190">If you keep that woman from marrying the man, having children, then it is against the national interest and the Austrian law should not apply.</span> <span id="s191">My father won the case.</span> <span id="s192">The judge said, “As a Jew, you really made a case.”</span> <span id="s193">My father said, “I’m a lawyer.”</span> <span id="s194">The joke was, she was over 45.</span> <span id="s195">No children.</span> <span id="s196">It’s just one of the stories that I remember.</span> <span id="s197">But I mean, he had an angle.</span> <span id="s198">He knew what -- and it -- he wasn’t sarcastic, he had a client and he worked for it.</span> <span id="s199">He also said -- and that is very different from lawyers here, for every marriage, divorce, he reunited half the people.</span> <span id="s200">He said it is not right to take money if you can protect a life.</span> <span id="s201">Another thing I remember from my father as a young lawyer, he worked -- he was associated with a much older man.</span> <span id="s202">They went for a com -- how shall I say?</span> <span id="s203">It was -- it [indecipherable] of a contract they were working on.</span> <span id="s204">They spent five hours on that.</span> <span id="s205">Eventually they hashed it out.</span> <span id="s206">My father and his mentor went back to the office.</span> <span id="s207">The older man opened the drawer, took out the contract which was almost exactly what they came to.</span> <span id="s208">He had written that before.</span> <span id="s209">And he said to my father, when you argue with people, or have a contract with them, you’ve got to remember their point of view.</span> <span id="s210">You don’t say it in the beginning, but you have to know how far you can come to make them meet.</span> <span id="s211">I wish they had it now in a few places.</span> <span id="s212">So, I mean, my father had a very solid background, but my mother said she used to go to court when he was pleading, sit in the back and monitor it.</span> <span id="s213">She would tell him what the reaction was of the people, also whether his voice carried.</span> <span id="s214">I was too young.</span> <span id="s215">I would have loved to go because I was always fascinated by the law, and as a kid I was reading all his law books.</span> <span id="s216">Some of them weren’t so kosher.</span> <span id="s217">I mean, some of them had things there that [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s218">So I learned a lot.</span> <span id="s219">I used to tell the other kids what was going on, you know, things that nowadays you read it in every book, but in those days -- my parents didn’t mind.</span> <span id="s220">They always felt that what I can learn, okay.</span> <span id="s221">As a matter of fact, I had a reputation.</span> <span id="s222">My mother used to say -- and then 40 years later the people in my office said it, you cannot keep secrets from Ruth.</span> <span id="s223">My mother said to my father, “If -- she will always find out and tell everybody.</span> <span id="s224">But if you tell her it’s a secret, she not say peep.”</span> <span id="s225">And that was from when I was 12 til I was 80.</span> <span id="s226">Well, it was funny.</span></p> <p><span id="s227">Q: Can you speak some about the role of faith in your family?</span> <span id="s228">The role of religion in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s229">A: The what?</span></p> <p><span id="s230">Q: The role of religion.</span></p> <p><span id="s231">A: Oh, religion, all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s232">Q: H-How -- how -- h-how did it play a part in your family?</span></p> <p><span id="s233">A: I see, yeah.</span> <span id="s234">Well, I tell you, my father had been -- I mean, everybody came from a religious family, that really -- they were.</span> <span id="s235">My father, as a student had been at the fraternity that was not Jewish.</span> <span id="s236">Most of the Jewish professionals, lawyers, had belonged to -- I forgot the name, what -- casaya, I think.</span> <span id="s237">My father was not.</span> <span id="s238">I don’t know if you know then, students fought with [indecipherable] and he had a star.</span> <span id="s239">As a matter of fact, when my father died here, he had collapsed and was in the hospital, and a very nice doctor took care of him, but he was very aloof.</span> <span id="s240">They thought he was a German Nazi.</span> <span id="s241">As it turned out, when we -- when my father died, they asked if we would allow an autopsy, and my sister said, “Yes, but the funeral mustn’t be delayed because we are Jewish.”</span> <span id="s242">That man fell over.</span> <span id="s243">He said, my God.</span> <span id="s244">I mean, he had been professional, but he’d rather not.</span> <span id="s245">But I [indecipherable] get into details about it.</span> <span id="s246">But this was -- my father didn’t look Jewish, he had a very -- I wouldn’t say arrogant, but dominating.</span> <span id="s247">When he came in, you knew it.</span> <span id="s248">And one time that I was still in Breslau, a woman came up to me and said, “Are you Ruth Zellner?”</span> <span id="s249">And I said yes.</span> <span id="s250">She said, “I recognized you by your father’s walk, and by your mother’s red hair.”</span> <span id="s251">This was red.</span> <span id="s252">So you know it -- people knew us.</span> <span id="s253">My mother came from a much more Orthodox background.</span> <span id="s254">My great-grandfather, her grandfather was a cantor and very -- very well known too.</span> <span id="s255">So when they married, of course as a student, my mother was free will -- I mean, a respectable lady, but it was unusual to be a student.</span> <span id="s256">But she said she wanted a Jewish home, so we had a kosher home.</span> <span id="s257">Passover dishes and all this.</span> <span id="s258">And I hated Passover because my grand -- great-grandfather, the cantor, made it last forever.</span> <span id="s259">And I couldn’t understand.</span> <span id="s260">He [indecipherable] the maid took me home early, but not early enough for me.</span> <span id="s261">Then my father come back the Seder after my great -- great-grandfather died, then he made it very interesting.</span> <span id="s262">And he -- sometimes in -- you know, during the end of the -- rather the beginning of the Hitler time, many people realized that there were Jews who hadn’t much of an idea.</span> <span id="s263">So we would invite these people to let them join in a Seder, they’d never seen such a thing.</span> <span id="s264">And my father always -- he doesn’t just [indecipherable] down this thing, he would stop and make very interesting comparison, so it was a very nice Seder.</span> <span id="s265">He died right after the Seder on Passover many years later.</span> <span id="s266">So Seder has -- now I don’t like it so much any more.</span> <span id="s267">So the -- otherwise, my parents were members of the Jewish community.</span> <span id="s268">There were Jewish clubs, even before Hitler.</span> <span id="s269">The B’nai Brith, and the Society of [indecipherable] and of course on the high holiday, people went to synagogue or dressed up with their prayer books, until Hitler came.</span> <span id="s270">Then you didn’t dress up, you didn’t have -- show your prayer book, you just sort of sneaked in into a little something.</span> <span id="s271">There were several synagogues in Breslau, Orthodox, I don’t think you would call of a member of the Reform -- not even Conservative, it was a Modern.</span> <span id="s272">Very nice rabbis and a beautiful building, burned down.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: Do you remember the name?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: Of the synagogue?</span></p> <p><span id="s275">Q: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s276">A: New synagogue.</span> <span id="s277">And the old one, I don’t know why, it was called the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s278">It’s -- that’s animal.</span> <span id="s279">I don’t know, maybe it was the shape of it.</span> <span id="s280">They could not burn that down because too many Nazis lived around the houses there.</span> <span id="s281">But ours -- I may even have a picture.</span> <span id="s282">Gee, I didn’t think of it.</span> <span id="s283">Maybe when we have a lunch break.</span> <span id="s284">What a beautiful building.</span> <span id="s285">And weddings, I remember the older sister of a friend of mine, who had a wedding that was still before Hitler became to -- too much of a nuisance, with the long, white velvet gown, marching down for a mile, like Saint Patrick’s.</span> <span id="s286">This -- but of course, that stopped too.</span> <span id="s287">Otherwise -- I mean, we were part of the Jewish community, and there was a Jewish community paper, and I remember they had a lot of family announcement of course, you know how it is, it is like patting on your shoulder, the big shot this and the big shot that.</span> <span id="s288">And they also lived that, the little boys who became Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s289">And when I saw the big brother of my girlfriend was listed, I was so grown up.</span> <span id="s290">Then, after awhile, the older sisters of my friends got engaged, more grown up.</span> <span id="s291">I must have 10 years [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s292">And these papers were very nice.</span> <span id="s293">I don’t know if you’ve heard of the Aufbrau.</span> <span id="s294">That was formed here in the early 30.</span> <span id="s295">And here too, they had announcement of things that happened in the Jewish immigrant community, and people -- also after the war -- I want to go ahead on that now, when people came over from the camps, they would have long lists of newcomers, where relatives could meet again.</span> <span id="s296">Well, now they have a few obits.</span> <span id="s297">And that’s just the way it goes, it’s also 60 years.</span> <span id="s298">But I remember the Jewish -- Breslau Gemeindeplatt.</span> <span id="s299">It meant, the community, the Jewish community of Breslau.</span> <span id="s300">That was pretty cohesive.</span> <span id="s301">I’m not sure how many people were there, but it was a lot.</span> <span id="s302">They are gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s303">Q: Do you know anything about where your father fit politically in the Jewish community?</span> <span id="s304">Was he a member of groups, was he ever called on to -- to mediate things?</span> <span id="s305">Was your father --</span></p> <p><span id="s306">A: No, my father was involved in Jewish thing, as I said, the B’nai Brith, and the other organization.</span> <span id="s307">Otherwise, before Hitler it didn’t matter whether people were Jewish or not.</span> <span id="s308">That -- you see, in many ways the German Jews, of the educated, professional class were so integrated, much more even than here.</span> <span id="s309">You just didn’t know.</span> <span id="s310">And you didn’t ask, I mean, Dr. Zellner, who -- what are you, Catholic, Jew?</span> <span id="s311">Nobody cared.</span> <span id="s312">But that came down with a bang.</span></p> <p><span id="s313">Q: What language did you speak at home?</span> <span id="s314">What language was spoken at home?</span></p> <p><span id="s315">A: In Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s316">Q: Yes.</span> <span id="s317">In Breslau.</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Yeah, German.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: German.</span></p> <p><span id="s320">A: No, I don’t even understand Yiddish.</span></p> <p><span id="s321">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s322">A: I can dope it out when I see it, because you know, German people thought Yiddish was vulgar.</span> <span id="s323">It was bad German.</span> <span id="s324">It isn’t, it’s a language in its own and they bring it up again.</span> <span id="s325">But the only language we spoke was German.</span> <span id="s326">And it what they call high German.</span> <span id="s327">I -- I personally was very good.</span> <span id="s328">I remember when I wrote essays in school.</span> <span id="s329">One day we had to write one -- that was the -- not Nazi school, it’s one of the earlier ones, I was maybe 13.</span> <span id="s330">The teacher gave us [indecipherable] of paper and said, I want to read to you a story, how that subject should have been addressed.</span> <span id="s331">So how interesting, she read my story.</span> <span id="s332">I was so surprised.</span> <span id="s333">And when I had -- you may not know when -- you have [indecipherable] too, as you have a choice subject.</span> <span id="s334">You are being examined in three or four things, and one you can choose because you think you are most interested in.</span> <span id="s335">So I had chosen German literature.</span> <span id="s336">And by that time the Jewish school was not allowed to conduct its own exams any more.</span> <span id="s337">We had to have one of the Nazi big shots supervise the whole thing.</span> <span id="s338">He was great.</span> <span id="s339">He was wonderful.</span> <span id="s340">You know, that was always -- they were such nice people, but they -- most of the time they’re afraid to come out.</span> <span id="s341">Now this one examined me, and everybody was laughing because I really felt so at home with [indecipherable] and Schiller and all that stuff.</span> <span id="s342">I don’t know how much you know about them.</span> <span id="s343">So I’m saying that to show how integrated we were.</span> <span id="s344">And the -- some of the Nazi -- none of the Nazi teachers I had in the Catholic school were evil, because the religion balanced that.</span> <span id="s345">They were high in the party because they had to be, but when they could help you, they did.</span> <span id="s346">But God forbid it would come out.</span> <span id="s347">That would have hurt them, and also their families.</span> <span id="s348">So that was one of the reason that people went along.</span> <span id="s349">They did try to have -- when I get to the -- the 10th of November, I’ll tell you some of that.</span> <span id="s350">Do you have enough of my first chapter?</span></p> <p><span id="s351">Q: Pretty much.</span> <span id="s352">I do have a few more questions I would --</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I talked more about it than I had planned, but if you have any other questions on my old past.</span></p> <p><span id="s354">Q: Well you’ve s -- you’ve talked about being very integrated, the -- the -- the Jews and the non-Jews.</span> <span id="s355">What did your parents teach you about being German?</span> <span id="s356">Did they talk to you about that -- that you are a German citizen, that you’re a patriot?</span> <span id="s357">Wa -- this is when you’re younger.</span></p> <p><span id="s358">A: I don’t think my parents made speeches, they lived it.</span> <span id="s359">We knew the Jewishness by being kosher.</span> <span id="s360">We knew the non-Jewishness by having books, all the German literatures, and we were supposed to read it.</span> <span id="s361">I mean, they didn’t sit down and say this is that and this is this.</span> <span id="s362">A few weeks ago, I saw an obit in the Times that a man [indecipherable] died.</span> <span id="s363">He was the son of a very important Weimar official.</span> <span id="s364">I don’t think he was the president, but he was a chancellor or so.</span> <span id="s365">[indecipherable] all the Jews voted for him.</span> <span id="s366">There was some [indecipherable] who was a Jew, and had -- I don’t remember which position.</span> <span id="s367">So they were in the highest government position between ‘24 and ‘33.</span> <span id="s368">I don’t know if you know about the inflation.</span> <span id="s369">After the war, the German money wasn’t worth anything, if you had a suitcase full of money.</span> <span id="s370">My father said he would get paid with shoes for me, because when people got paid, they went to the bank, it wasn’t worth anything, million, billion.</span> <span id="s371">Then von Schacht, who was later on a Nazi, straightened things out and in ’24 it stabilized, and between ’24 and ’32, there were many important Jews in the government, in art, in the Berlin, the plays, the music, many names that came over here eventually.</span> <span id="s372">It was a very blooming, blooming positive thing, and we were part of it.</span> <span id="s373">My mother and father went to the theater, they told us what the big plays were.</span> <span id="s374">So we were never -- we never sat down and got told the facts of life, I don’t mean that this way, but we just lived it.</span> <span id="s375">I don’t know how that is here with the rich people, but we were very close.</span> <span id="s376">My parents were not -- I mean, they had the big social life, but we were part of that [indecipherable] their children.</span> <span id="s377">So they knew who we were dealing with.</span></p> <p><span id="s378">Q: A-And can you tell us just a bit more about what your father did during World War І?</span></p> <p><span id="s379">A: He was at the Belgians [indecipherable] and he said he -- well, I don’t know what you know about Germany.</span> <span id="s380">Gerta had the [indecipherable] the [indecipherable] was the Easter walk, a very famous part of it, and my father told me, as a young s-soldier, on Easter Sunday there was no shooting, and he walked along the demarcation reading that part of the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s381">You see, that came through.</span> <span id="s382">I mean, I still can recite [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s383">And that how we were integrated, Gerty, Schiller, all these things were part of everyday life.</span> <span id="s384">He came -- that’s something he told me too, he was a young soldier, I have to really remember that.</span> <span id="s385">And a soldier was supposed to salute an officer.</span> <span id="s386">He wasn’t paying attention, he was walking when an officer -- that was not at the front, it was -- he was on furlough.</span> <span id="s387">And the officer said, “Soldier, why didn’t you salute me?”</span> <span id="s388">My father said -- he was quick thinking, “We were under an overpass.”</span> <span id="s389">In a covered room, the soldier doesn’t salute.</span> <span id="s390">So the officer said, “What were you in private life?”</span> <span id="s391">Father said, “A lawyer.”</span> <span id="s392">Figures.</span> <span id="s393">You know, I haven’t thought of [indecipherable] thing, but you sure brought them out.</span> <span id="s394">But this gives you a picture of the atmosphere, which changed.</span></p> <p><span id="s395">Q: Can you think back to when you begin to be aware of some of the first changes?</span> <span id="s396">Was -- was there some day your father came home and talked about something that had happened, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s397">A: No.</span> <span id="s398">As a matter of fact, I remember I said to my father once, if you -- if they don’t want Jewish law you have to work any more, how will we live?</span> <span id="s399">And my father says, “I still have some client.”</span> <span id="s400">Also my father had -- board renter apartments, and we will live on that.</span> <span id="s401">And I’ll be writing articles for the paper.</span> <span id="s402">I was reassured, of course none of it worked.</span> <span id="s403">He didn’t have any clients any more, the papers wouldn’t publish him any more, and they took the houses away.</span> <span id="s404">As a matter of fact, we got the list when we were here, what had happened to all the houses [indecipherable] bomb, and taken away.</span> <span id="s405">And my father gave it to my brother-in-law, and said, “This is your dowry.”</span> <span id="s406">So we survived it.</span> <span id="s407">But --</span></p> <p><span id="s408">Q: Are you -- you’re referring, I think, to that you heard a-at -- at a certain point, the Nazi party went into the courtrooms and said that Jewish lawyers and Jewish judges could no longer practice.</span> <span id="s409">So you must have heard about that and you asked your father about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s410">A: Well, as I said in the beginning, there was no interfering, because when you had the -- the -- were a front soldier, you had bled for the Fatherland.</span> <span id="s411">Even peop -- later on, even people with the Iron Cross and all the decoration, the wounded one, they were kicked out.</span> <span id="s412">It was limited.</span> <span id="s413">Eventually my father closed up his office and moved into our apartment.</span> <span id="s414">Then, when he took down the shingle, he wasn’t -- he was rather depressed.</span> <span id="s415">And my mother said to him, better you take it out than I do afterward.</span> <span id="s416">So -- but I -- when that came to that point, we were looking for emigration, and of course I noticed that.</span> <span id="s417">But until I think I was about 14, I wasn’t too much involved.</span></p> <p><span id="s418">Q: What did your mother mean, better that you do that than I do it afterward?</span> <span id="s419">What did your mother mean?</span></p> <p><span id="s420">A: My --</span></p> <p><span id="s421">Q: About the shingle, when your father took the shingle down, and then your mother said, better you do it then I do it afterward.</span></p> <p><span id="s422">A: After you’re dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s423">Q: Oh, after you’re dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s424">A: She’d rather have a living husband who took down the shingle, depressing as it was after 30 years, than for her as a widow having to taking it down.</span> <span id="s425">She felt, as long as we are together.</span> <span id="s426">My mo -- you know somebody said to me once here, in this country, “Now that your father is doing all kind of work, is he still the same man he was as a lawyer?”</span> <span id="s427">And I said “Yes, in my mother’s eye, yes.”</span> <span id="s428">And you know, many refugee families broke up.</span> <span id="s429">You know, the big shot wasn’t so big any more.</span> <span id="s430">And my parents had a very good marriage.</span> <span id="s431">Very -- I don’t -- if -- I mean, it wasn't the kind of hugging, kissing.</span> <span id="s432">My father never was much for hugging, kissing, my mother a little more.</span> <span id="s433">But there was a great respect and understanding, and affection.</span> <span id="s434">Anything else from that time?</span></p> <p><span id="s435">Q: Try to tell us a little bit about when your father took that shingle down, how -- at that point how was -- how were -- how was your family earning income for you to survive?</span></p> <p><span id="s436">A: Well, we had a lot of money, and that was not yet f -- that was only confiscated when we left.</span> <span id="s437">I think if -- I mean, when they confiscated it, that was that.</span> <span id="s438">But I know that financially until we left Germany, there was no hardship.</span> <span id="s439">At the big time, we had a cook and a maid and a nursemaid and all that stuff, which eventually we didn’t have any more because we didn’t want Nazi people in the house.</span> <span id="s440">We wanted -- our mansion was so lovely and loyal.</span> <span id="s441">But my grandmother, who was old, she lived in our building on a lower floor, in a small apartment, so my mother could supervise her.</span> <span id="s442">She had a nurse and a maid who made breakfast and lunch.</span> <span id="s443">Dinner was made upstairs and the maid brought it down.</span> <span id="s444">We didn't trust those two women, so we brought my grandmother up.</span> <span id="s445">You see, that’s how we noticed things, the office was upstairs, my grandmother was upstairs.</span> <span id="s446">The maid [indecipherable] this and that was gone.</span> <span id="s447">But it didn't hurt me, you know, it didn’t interfere with my everyday life.</span> <span id="s448">My parents could tell you everything, but I was coasting along, and they took the people to concentration camps, and smashed the windows, that I saw.</span> <span id="s449">Well -- ooh, I don’t want to rip -- excuse me.</span></p> <p><span id="s450">Q: Do you remember your parents discussing at all, other options f-f-for leaving, plans -- perhaps even -- perhaps an eventual plan to hide you and your sister?</span> <span id="s451">What kinds of things were talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: Me -- I remember, I knew that we were trying to get an affidavit.</span> <span id="s453">I also remember that my mother asked some relative who lived here already, who had come to visit, to find the name of my father’s cousin, which she said she couldn’t find.</span> <span id="s454">Then somebody else emigrated, she asked that man to sign some name and we got it in two weeks.</span> <span id="s455">My mother never forgot that woman, because she said if we had gotten it, we could have gotten out with money, we -- and if -- if it was up to that women, we would all have been killed.</span> <span id="s456">I mean, my mother, she was smart, she never told the lady that she hated her.</span> <span id="s457">But -- and the other man, the one who was not even related or anything, she always, whenever there was an occasion, there was a gift from us.</span> <span id="s458">She -- she said he saved our lives.</span> <span id="s459">Something else of my mother is I told you she was a chemist.</span> <span id="s460">She had, when things got wh -- cyanide.</span> <span id="s461">She said if they came for us she would have given us a lemonade with cyanide, we would have been dead without knowing it.</span> <span id="s462">She was not having her family taken to a camp.</span> <span id="s463">Took some doing, but we got out.</span></p> <p><span id="s464">Q: Why was the name of the cousin so important to the process of getting out?</span></p> <p><span id="s465">A: The name of what?</span> <span id="s466">Of --</span></p> <p><span id="s467">Q: Your father’s cousin, why was that name so important?</span></p> <p><span id="s468">A: Well, they were very wealthy people here, and that if -- they did give us the affidavit when we finally reached them.</span> <span id="s469">But here too, a year before we came, the husband had died.</span> <span id="s470">He was a very prominent man, who had helped a lot of refugee getting settled.</span> <span id="s471">He would arrange -- he was in real estate -- for instance one man, a young man, got a contract to do the hardware for building.</span> <span id="s472">If he had been alive he would have guided my father into some business, we would still have had money to work with.</span> <span id="s473">You know, in those years it was a depression, if you had a thousand dollars in your pocket, you had a lot, people earned 10 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s474">So by losing about two years, which also was a Polish quota, and the cousin who gave it to us was a widow and old, and she was sweet, she invited us for Thanksgiving [indecipherable] you know.</span></p> <p><span id="s475">Q: What was the name of the cousin that -- that was so important?</span> <span id="s476">Your father’s cousin?</span></p> <p><span id="s477">A: Mayer, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s478">Q: Zellner?</span></p> <p><span id="s479">A: Mayer, M-a -- I would rather you don’t mention the name though, because the children and grandchildren by now, I ga -- don’t know how much they are even involved, but they were very prominent people, and nice people.</span> <span id="s480">Maybe we were wrong, maybe we should have asked them for some more help.</span> <span id="s481">I know somebo -- my cousin just died a little while ago, she was in her 80’s.</span> <span id="s482">In -- just say we couldn’t get in, but don’t mention the name.</span></p> <p><span id="s483">Q: W-Was there a difference of opinion between your mother and father about whether or not it was really critical to leave quickly?</span> <span id="s484">Did they have the same viewpoint about leaving the country quickly?</span></p> <p><span id="s485">A: You mean, they both agreed on it?</span></p> <p><span id="s486">Q: I’m asking, yeah, did they have --</span></p> <p><span id="s487">A: Yeah, I didn’t quite follow that.</span></p> <p><span id="s488">Q: -- right [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s489">A: No, they agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s490">Q: They agreed.</span></p> <p><span id="s491">A: If anything, my mother was pushing my father.</span> <span id="s492">You see, she was younger and she realized that there was no more future.</span> <span id="s493">My father was reluctant about how to support his family -- which he never did here, I mean, my sister and I supported it, ineffectively, but -- but we [indecipherable] that after lunch.</span> <span id="s494">And so -- but my mother said the time has come before the November ’38, that we cannot stay.</span> <span id="s495">We’ve got to work on it, but it was very hard.</span> <span id="s496">We tried to get to Bolivia, we tried to get to Panama, and nobody wanted anything, only Cuba -- again, a lot of money per person, was willing to take us in.</span></p> <p><span id="s497">Q: Do you remember anything about the race laws that came into being in 1935?</span> <span id="s498">These would have been laws that would have prevented a -- a Jew from marrying a non-Jew, or th-those kinds of things?</span> <span id="s499">Do you remember hearing about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s500">A: It was ’35?</span> <span id="s501">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s502">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s503">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s504">A: I don’t remember much about that, I was 14.</span> <span id="s505">I do remember is the Reichstag [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s506">That was in ’33, when they burned the [indecipherable] the new Reichstag, and -- which was an absolute joke because the man whom they accused of doing it was stupid, and he couldn’t have done it with a match, that’s the kind of thing you need all kinds of flammables.</span> <span id="s507">The Hitl -- Hitler did it, but he --</span></p> <p><span id="s508">Q: This was a book burning?</span> <span id="s509">Which -- which burning was this?</span></p> <p><span id="s510">A: Well, Reichstag.</span> <span id="s511">That’s where in -- now in Berlin they are building it up where the [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s512">Q: Oh, oh.</span></p> <p><span id="s513">A: And right after Hitler took over, there was a fire.</span> <span id="s514">And I mean, this was a building like in Washington, you don’t -- one person doesn’t burn it down, and they didn’t have a bomb.</span> <span id="s515">It -- the one -- von Lupich was his name, he was addled.</span> <span id="s516">You could see.</span> <span id="s517">I mean, when he wa -- he couldn’t have lit the match.</span> <span id="s518">And they did it for propaganda, to show we have to fight the Commies, or whatever.</span> <span id="s519">Yes, I remember from the beginning, but I was 12.</span> <span id="s520">You know it -- you don’t remember these things.</span></p> <p><span id="s521">Q: Do you have any memories of book burnings in 1993?</span></p> <p><span id="s522">A: Not that I saw anything.</span> <span id="s523">I heard about thing, but I was much too busy with my own life.</span> <span id="s524">It was a sheltered life for me.</span> <span id="s525">My parents, of course, were involved, but this is optimistic.</span> <span id="s526">Before -- I’m trying to think what I could still tell you of before.</span> <span id="s527">And of course, my sister was four years younger, she knew even less.</span> <span id="s528">We were children, and we were being protected.</span> <span id="s529">What time is it?</span></p> <p><span id="s530">End of Tape One</span></p> <p><span id="s531">Beginning Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s532">Q: Can you tell us about Kristallnacht, that is in November ninth and 10th, 1938.</span></p> <p><span id="s533">A: Which year?</span></p> <p><span id="s534">Q: 1938, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s535">A: Yeah, ’38.</span></p> <p><span id="s536">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s537">A: Okay, then we start with in November, pogrom.</span> <span id="s538">That I can tell you a lot.</span> <span id="s539">It -- I remember that there was a news on the radio where some Polish kid had shot somebody at the German embassy in Paris, and that there was a big commotion.</span> <span id="s540">I had a bad cold and wasn’t going to school the next day.</span> <span id="s541">And I said, gee tomorrow they are all going to talk about it.</span> <span id="s542">When I come back the next day nobody will talk any more.</span> <span id="s543">Well, one time I was wrong.</span> <span id="s544">Well, the nec -- the day after when I went to school a friend of mine came running up the stairs, you can’t go to school, there’s a pogrom.</span> <span id="s545">It was not on the radio, but -- not yet.</span> <span id="s546">So I went back home, and one of my father’s sister was a widow.</span> <span id="s547">She lived in Breslau and she had visited her sister somewhere else.</span> <span id="s548">And my mother, as I said, she was a very forward looking person, has said to her sister-in-law, give me the keys to your apartment in case I have to hide my husband.</span> <span id="s549">So she and Father went to that apartment.</span> <span id="s550">There was no man there so they wouldn’t be looking for anybody, and then my mother came back.</span> <span id="s551">Two friends of my father came over and said they were going to drive to the Sudetenland.</span> <span id="s552">This was right after Chamberlain had made the Munich arrangement and given the Sudetenland to hit -- to Hitler.</span> <span id="s553">And these three men figured that the Nazi organization wasn’t set up yet.</span> <span id="s554">It was just two or three weeks later, so that’s where they drove.</span> <span id="s555">It was about four hours, maybe, three hours from Breslau.</span> <span id="s556">And one of the men [indecipherable] a priest and asked him for asylum.</span> <span id="s557">The priest said sure, you can -- anybody who is against Hitler can stay in my house.</span> <span id="s558">But the next morning he said, “I am not a favorite of the Nazi, they may search here, I’m going to take you somewhere else.”</span> <span id="s559">He took the three men to a nunnery.</span> <span id="s560">The nuns were very nice.</span> <span id="s561">Really.</span> <span id="s562">You know, honest people are nice, never mind what religion.</span> <span id="s563">My father and the two other men were there for maybe four days.</span> <span id="s564">Were very comfortable, good food.</span> <span id="s565">And as -- it was entertainment for the nuns, too.</span> <span id="s566">Then they heard that the action was over and they came back to Breslau.</span> <span id="s567">Did you take the receiver off again?</span> <span id="s568">No.</span> <span id="s569">Because [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s570">When they came back to Breslau they contacted my mother to find out if it was safe to come home.</span> <span id="s571">My -- the men were in the car from there, and my mother did something that she said was the hardest thing she ever did.</span> <span id="s572">When my father was gone a Gestapo man came, looked over the apartment, didn’t find my father, said, “Well, when he comes back have him report.”</span> <span id="s573">So my mother took all the papers for emigration and said to my father, “We are going to the Gestapo to report.”</span> <span id="s574">She made sure that she went to the wrong room.</span> <span id="s575">And there there was a decent guy, he said, “The aktion is over, go home.”</span> <span id="s576">And my father said, “Mark the record, I have reported as required.”</span> <span id="s577">So when they came home, my parents told this nice maid to talk to all the neighbors in the whole block, that my father has been released from the Gestapo.</span> <span id="s578">Otherwise somebody would have asked -- would have said, for brownie points, you know, he is here, take him.</span> <span id="s579">So this way, he got away from it.</span> <span id="s580">We also -- school was closed.</span> <span id="s581">I was in the Jewish school by that time.</span> <span id="s582">The windows of the Jewish stores were smashed.</span> <span id="s583">People were picked up if they looked Jewish and taken to concentration camps.</span> <span id="s584">So by that time we knew, never mind what, we had to get out.</span> <span id="s585">When school opened, all the teachers had been in the camp, and when they came back, they were so thin, and so young looking because many of them had beards, and they were shaven.</span> <span id="s586">We didn’t recognize them.</span> <span id="s587">And one man whose father was also -- I mean, one boy in my class, his father was also a prominent lawyer, very impressive looking, was taken to a camp.</span> <span id="s588">And when the boy came to school he said, you know this morning I woke up, there was a bum in my bedroom, and it was my father.</span> <span id="s589">He had just come from the camp, he wanted me to see him like that.</span> <span id="s590">I mean, it was such a horrible thing.</span> <span id="s591">I knew one man was arrested in the street, and so was his son, but they didn’t know about it, they met in the camp.</span> <span id="s592">The son had -- he came down with pneumonia, and the father was trying to help him as much as possible.</span> <span id="s593">They told the father he can go home.</span> <span id="s594">And the father said, I would like to stay til my son is out of danger.</span> <span id="s595">If you don’t go now, you cannot get out.</span> <span id="s596">So he left, he had a wife and an -- two daughter.</span> <span id="s597">And a week later they brought him the ashes, they brought in a -- what they call these things, they’re -- urn.</span></p> <p><span id="s598">Q: Urn.</span></p> <p><span id="s599">A: So these stories you heard all over.</span></p> <p><span id="s600">Q: What was the name of the camp close to Breslau that they were taking people --</span></p> <p><span id="s601">A: I think it was Buchenwald, but it could have been any of the others, Sachsenhausen, there were quite a few of them.</span> <span id="s602">And you didn’t know where they were.</span> <span id="s603">They couldn’t contact you.</span> <span id="s604">After awhile, especially those who had a paper for emigration, were sent home.</span> <span id="s605">So the emigration offices, of course, and the quota were oversubscribed.</span> <span id="s606">At that time, at the end of ’38, it was very hard to get out.</span> <span id="s607">One thing was strange.</span> <span id="s608">Another sister of my father, also a widow, was at home reading when the door was smashed open, two SA men came in, heil Hitler, heil Hitler.</span> <span id="s609">Who are you?</span> <span id="s610">And she stammered her name.</span> <span id="s611">Pardon me ma’am, excuse me, I’m so -- we are so sorry.</span> <span id="s612">Off they went.</span> <span id="s613">She couldn’t figure out what happened, but her name was Arianne, and they thought she told them that she was Irish.</span> <span id="s614">So that was some -- something funny, the only funny thing of the whole -- but in many cases, after the wa -- after that, the men left Germany, and left their wifes and children behind, because a man would have gone back to camp.</span> <span id="s615">The women were not quite so in danger.</span> <span id="s616">So the -- the -- the Saint Louis --</span></p> <p><span id="s617">Q: I-I’m just not clear on one thing.</span> <span id="s618">You describe that your father went away for several days and essentially hid, reported to the Gestapo, but then you mentioned that your father did go away to camp?</span></p> <p><span id="s619">A: No, he didn’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s620">Q: No, he did not.</span></p> <p><span id="s621">A: No --</span></p> <p><span id="s622">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s623">A: -- because we made sure that --</span></p> <p><span id="s624">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s625">A: -- everybody knew the Gestapo didn’t want him, thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s626">Q: C-Can you talk a little bit about that atmosphere in the house, those several days when your father was --</span></p> <p><span id="s627">A: Scared, very scared, because we didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s628">He couldn't telephone.</span> <span id="s629">I don’t know if they could tape phones at that time, but still and all, we had no idea.</span> <span id="s630">We were optimistic because, as I said, the Sudetenland was not integrated yet into Germany.</span> <span id="s631">But after he came back, and after the aktion was over, we never felt comfortable.</span> <span id="s632">Also, the smashed shop windows were not being repaired.</span> <span id="s633">The people either didn’t have the money, or they were in the camp.</span> <span id="s634">I mean, what could you do, so you walked along the street with the boarded houses, the synagogue had been burned as I told you.</span> <span id="s635">And everybody was trying to get out.</span> <span id="s636">It was not yet that they had to wear the Jewish star, that came later.</span> <span id="s637">Also, it was not yet where people couldn’t sit on benches in parks.</span> <span id="s638">That was after I was gone.</span> <span id="s639">But you knew that things were coming, nobody knew how horrible, but still and all.</span> <span id="s640">So Cuba had asked I don’t know how much money for visa.</span> <span id="s641">They thought they could make it a good business, and people would wait there til the American quota came up.</span> <span id="s642">And we had an ship, the Saint Louis, which was a luxury ship.</span> <span id="s643">She was scheduled to cruise from New York to Bermuda all summer long, back and forth.</span> <span id="s644">Well the -- figure, if we get the 900 Jews on this ship, and -- it’s a free ride.</span> <span id="s645">So we got on, and it was a beautiful ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s646">Q: I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the preparations to go, how did your parents hear about the -- the ship ride?</span></p> <p><span id="s647">A: Well, first of all, my father was in touch with the travel agent.</span> <span id="s648">Any ship in a port, you know.</span> <span id="s649">But -- so that’s how he knew.</span> <span id="s650">We were -- th-the scheduled ship was two weeks later.</span> <span id="s651">They had one in April and one later in June.</span> <span id="s652">Every month there was a regular ship, but this one left on the 13th of May, and the travel agent said, I can get you on it.</span> <span id="s653">The preparations, you could not take your own things with you without getting permission.</span> <span id="s654">Permission manager had to list everything you had, and what you paid for it.</span> <span id="s655">Some things my parents bought after they married, you had to put an approximate amount down, and pay the thing over again, as an exit visa.</span> <span id="s656">When you packed, there were the Gestapo in the house, with a list that you have sent, and watched what you took.</span> <span id="s657">And some peoples tried to smuggle jewelry also.</span> <span id="s658">Well, that was the end of it, if they s -- if he saw it.</span> <span id="s659">We did not.</span> <span id="s660">We packed and that big, fat guy was standing there, but he was reasonable.</span> <span id="s661">I mean, he was not [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s662">And we put everything into a lift van that was on the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s663">However, when we couldn't land, they shipped the lift back to Germany, and from England we wanted it out, it went to Rotterdam, it was bombed.</span> <span id="s664">That’s why I have no pictures.</span> <span id="s665">Everything was gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s666">Q: Can you tell us what you actually chose to put in there?</span> <span id="s667">Your mother chose?</span> <span id="s668">What -- what were your parents taking?</span> <span id="s669">And you?</span></p> <p><span id="s670">A: You mean reparation?</span></p> <p><span id="s671">Q: No, what items did you take?</span> <span id="s672">What items did you pack in the trunks to go on the Saint Louis?</span></p> <p><span id="s673">A: Some furniture, I think.</span> <span id="s674">And some -- I mean, winter clothes, because we went to Havana, we didn’t expect to use them until we came to the States.</span> <span id="s675">So we had -- you see, people couldn’t take the money out, so they bought expensive clothes that would hopefully last for years with whatever money they had.</span> <span id="s676">My father had so much money that he were permitted to take, I don’t know, maybe five percent out of the country, which also went to Cuba.</span> <span id="s677">Cuba sent it back to Germany.</span> <span id="s678">What did we need it for?</span> <span id="s679">We eventually got it to England, but because it came as German money to England, we couldn’t take it out when we came here.</span> <span id="s680">Then we left, right and left.</span> <span id="s681">I mean, it wasn't only the Germans who were mean.</span> <span id="s682">The same thing happened -- I mean, Cuba was horrible, too.</span> <span id="s683">And the English could have let us take our money out.</span> <span id="s684">That didn’t come until years later.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: But wa -- were there things that your mother chose to take, hoping to be able to pass them down to you and your sister?</span> <span id="s686">Family items?</span></p> <p><span id="s687">A: No, there were -- that’s th -- I mean, we just wanted to get out.</span> <span id="s688">And we did take -- we couldn’t take jewelry out, you had to hand that in.</span> <span id="s689">My mother did something because she was a chemist, and she dissolved gold into shoe paste and we had a nice round little shoe paste, which also was lost.</span> <span id="s690">And I used to say that somebody may polish their shoes, they don’t shine.</span> <span id="s691">What doesn’t shine is gold.</span> <span id="s692">Who would know?</span> <span id="s693">Well, we tried, but it didn’t work out.</span> <span id="s694">My father put some diamonds into a hammer.</span> <span id="s695">It’s gone.</span> <span id="s696">We really only came here with 40 dollars a person, and we were happy about it.</span> <span id="s697">But we are not here yet.</span> <span id="s698">So we got on the ship, and we didn’t know it, we thought we were away from Germany, but the ship was still German country, I mean, you know, the nationality of the ship was the German.</span> <span id="s699">And the fireman, we found that out later, where the Gestapo keeping track of not only the passengers, but of the crew.</span> <span id="s700">They were scared, too.</span> <span id="s701">They had been told to be polite, but no contact with the passengers.</span> <span id="s702">The captain was not supposed to join the passengers, no captain’s table, or so.</span> <span id="s703">But we had a swimming pool, the food was good, and we -- we thought we were all right.</span></p> <p><span id="s704">Q: Can I actually have you just back up, because I would like you to tell me what it was like to travel from Breslau to Hamburg.</span> <span id="s705">How did you get there, were there any restrictions, were you aware of the Nazis?</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: Yeah, and what happened was my father had business to do with the man who was supposed to transfer our money in Berlin.</span> <span id="s707">So he and I left, while my mother and sister still worked with the [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s708">They were to come to Hamburg couple of days later.</span> <span id="s709">I know when we went to Berlin, my father went in the dining room, and Jews were not supposed to do that.</span> <span id="s710">I wouldn’t go with him.</span> <span id="s711">I was so scared.</span> <span id="s712">Nobody thought he was Jewish, as I told you, he didn't look it, he didn’t act it, but I was sitting in that stateroom, I couldn't wait for him to come back.</span> <span id="s713">I thought it was mean of him to put me through it, but he -- he was -- he was leaving.</span> <span id="s714">It could have messed it up completely.</span> <span id="s715">But we got to Berlin and he went to that banker, and one of my father’s brother lived there with his wife, and we went over to say good-bye.</span> <span id="s716">And a friend of mine I had gone to school with was in Berlin wa -- I told you, where you learn English and she wa -- became a correspondent in English, French and Spanish.</span> <span id="s717">She was very knowledgeable.</span> <span id="s718">So she came by to say good-bye.</span> <span id="s719">I never saw her again.</span> <span id="s720">They went to Bolivia and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s721">But -- so we spent the afternoon and when my father saw on the timetable that there was a train leaving for Hamburg, he says, might as well.</span> <span id="s722">That was funny.</span> <span id="s723">We had two rooms, because my mother was coming, my sister was coming, and we walked around in Hamburg, I don’t know if you know it, very famous red light district.</span> <span id="s724">But it was -- I mean, people were drunk there, it was more like a Coney Island.</span> <span id="s725">And I was walking with my father, I was 18, and we were f -- a woman came over to my father.</span> <span id="s726">And he laughed and he waved her off.</span> <span id="s727">How can she come up here when I am there?</span> <span id="s728">That was funny.</span> <span id="s729">So, he spent the night, the next morning we went to meet my mother and sister, and we waited.</span> <span id="s730">We were fo -- I’m trying to remember, I think we came over there on Monday, and the ship left on Friday the 13th.</span> <span id="s731">So we were there -- there for a night, with a Hamburg, and ni -- they have -- I don’t know if you have heard of that, the [indecipherable] canal, just like Lincoln tunnel.</span> <span id="s732">I don’t know from where it goes to where, but some very nice guy walked us through and showed it to us.</span> <span id="s733">And I was so impressed that you can walk under the water under the river.</span> <span id="s734">I had no idea that I was going to go to the [indecipherable] through the Lincoln tunnel every damn day for many years.</span> <span id="s735">And another thing, my father wanted to give us a treat.</span> <span id="s736">And there was a Tierpark.</span> <span id="s737">That is not a zoo, but [indecipherable] for the wild animal.</span> <span id="s738">They caught them, kept them and sent them to where this circle zoo.</span> <span id="s739">And I hated it.</span> <span id="s740">It was smelling like all out.</span> <span id="s741">I have never gone to a zoo again.</span> <span id="s742">But it’s still out there, but not me.</span> <span id="s743">So then they said we should report on that, and there I can show you pictures, maybe we do that later.</span> <span id="s744">[indecipherable] get too interrupted.</span> <span id="s745">When we were up on the gangway with 59 people [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s746">And we had the room for the four of us.</span> <span id="s747">My parents had the lower berth and my sister and I, because there was no more room, it was full up, we were lucky we got on, very -- we didn’t know how luc -- lucky.</span> <span id="s748">And we were -- and we had a table for ourselves, the four of us, and Friday evening the band started to play -- you wouldn’t know -- you -- you don’t speak German, do you?</span> <span id="s749">One of -- that was you play when you go, good-bye, and the ship pulled out.</span></p> <p><span id="s750">Q: What was the name of the song?</span></p> <p><span id="s751">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: The name of the song?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I don’t know how to translate it.</span> <span id="s754">[speaks German here].</span> <span id="s755">Do I have to leave the city, you know?</span> <span id="s756">Well, some people wanted to come back, but not on our ship.</span> <span id="s757">It’s so -- it was very pretty, and we had entertainment in the evening, everything was nice, and everybody was optimistic.</span> <span id="s758">One thing happened on the trip out.</span> <span id="s759">There was a man overboard and the international law is, if there is a man overboard, a ship has to stop for two hours and search.</span> <span id="s760">He was a refugee from Russia, he worked in the kitchen as a dishwasher, and he got so depressed he couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s761">His brother was there too, and they had to put him into an isolation cell for the rest of the trip, which was rather depressing, I mean, that -- where the refugees have [indecipherable] before in over two hours.</span> <span id="s762">But, was okay.</span> <span id="s763">We were scheduled to arrive in Havana on Monday, but the captain had heard that there could be problem.</span> <span id="s764">So he traveled as fast as he could, he figured once we are there, we are there.</span> <span id="s765">We arrived on Saturday.</span></p> <p><span id="s766">Q: Before that, just a few things.</span> <span id="s767">A-A-As you boarded, what kinds of things were your parents saying?</span> <span id="s768">What was the -- the feeling of your parents about what you were doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s769">A: You mean in -- on the time on the ship of it -- no.</span></p> <p><span id="s770">Q: Just when you finally got on the ship, you had boarded, you were leaving Germany.</span></p> <p><span id="s771">A: Yeah, we were happy.</span> <span id="s772">Well, I mean there was laughing and we were -- there were a lot of people we knew, it was very social.</span> <span id="s773">The whole two weeks were very social and cheerful, and I know I was very seasick in the Bay of Biscayne.</span> <span id="s774">I couldn't get out of my bed.</span> <span id="s775">But it was a very normal, nice trip.</span> <span id="s776">Of course, they were worried.</span></p> <p><span id="s777">Q: Oh, you --</span></p> <p><span id="s778">A: How -- how would we live?</span></p> <p><span id="s779">Q: Bu-But what was it like, the change from several months before, Jewish shops were smashed, and people were being sent off to concentration camp.</span> <span id="s780">And then you’re leaving Germany, and you’re on this really lovely ship.</span> <span id="s781">I mean --</span></p> <p><span id="s782">A: It was a relief time.</span> <span id="s783">We thought we were out of it, which we were not.</span> <span id="s784">We found that out.</span> <span id="s785">Well, we thought we were free to go.</span> <span id="s786">And there were many people who have come from concentration camps right on the ship.</span> <span id="s787">And they, of course, were happy.</span> <span id="s788">The trip out, you have to imagine like any other cruise now.</span> <span id="s789">The crew -- the crew was helpful.</span> <span id="s790">You got your bouillon, you got your this, you got your that.</span> <span id="s791">Suddenly you were the way it used to be 15 years before.</span> <span id="s792">When we came to Cuba on Saturday, they said it was weekend, we were too soon, they were not prepared to land that.</span> <span id="s793">We believed it.</span> <span id="s794">Not very smart, but anyway.</span> <span id="s795">We were very near to the Havana, and you probably studied that, people who were in Havana already went on little boats that cruised around the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s796">Sometimes it was a parent, husband, and the other one, they’re on the ship, they would holler up, we would holler down.</span> <span id="s797">And they would say, be calm, you’ll all get down, be calm.</span> <span id="s798">We didn’t -- we didn’t know what it meant.</span> <span id="s799">I mean, we wouldn’t fall down the gangway, would we?</span> <span id="s800">But until Monday, we accepted the situation.</span> <span id="s801">When we didn’t get down on Monday, it -- we became suspicious.</span> <span id="s802">And then the American Jewish Joint swang into action.</span> <span id="s803">They tried to bribe the Cuban government with, I think, I don’t remember how much, 2,000 dollars for each passenger, an awful lot of money.</span> <span id="s804">But there were two thing that were against the Cuban giving in.</span> <span id="s805">One was, there was a quite a good connection with the Nazi.</span> <span id="s806">There were a lot of them up in Cuba, and they thought of [indecipherable] down.</span> <span id="s807">Also the one who had signed our visa was in disgrace, for no particular reason, we took too much money, so did everybody else.</span> <span id="s808">So they were very stubborn about it.</span> <span id="s809">One day, [indecipherable] two of us sitting on deck when a man came running from the bathroom, his wrists slashed, bleeding all over, jumping overboard into the harbor.</span> <span id="s810">He was from Breslau, I knew him and the children very well.</span> <span id="s811">The harbor police fished him out.</span> <span id="s812">One of the sailors went after him to save him, which really was tremendous.</span> <span id="s813">He went to Havana into the hospital.</span> <span id="s814">They would not allow his wife or children to join him.</span> <span id="s815">They had to go back to England.</span> <span id="s816">We lived near where we did, at the hospital when he was well, a month later came too.</span></p> <p><span id="s817">Q: Could you -- did you see that happen?</span> <span id="s818">Like, can you tell us a little bit more of what --</span></p> <p><span id="s819">A: I was there, everybody saw it, of course.</span> <span id="s820">And he was a very upset man, I mean, he had a hard -- he was scared.</span> <span id="s821">He had been in the camp, and he wasn’t having any.</span> <span id="s822">So that was a pretty grim thing.</span> <span id="s823">The captain, who had been very aloof, been told to be aloof, invited the wife and children to have all their meals upstairs in his room, because he wanted to protect them.</span> <span id="s824">You know, people would have been nice, but then you are worry.</span> <span id="s825">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s826">Q: The wife of the man who jumped overboard?</span></p> <p><span id="s827">A: Th-The wife and the children.</span> <span id="s828">I mean, they could have let the family go, couldn’t they?</span> <span id="s829">That was [indecipherable] the next, the mean thing.</span> <span id="s830">So we were sitting there, and we were told -- I think that was the first of June if I remember right, that we had to go out of the three mile zone so we would be out of Cuban water, and then they could start negotiation.</span> <span id="s831">So that’s what we did.</span> <span id="s832">It was a beautiful day, the ship was standing there, water, air, everything was very lovely.</span> <span id="s833">And we are waiting, and at night everybody woke up because the ship was running full steam ahead.</span> <span id="s834">And everybody thought they were in Europe already, you know, we -- something was put over, we were sitting there in daytime and rushing where at night?</span> <span id="s835">So the passenger -- I don’t know if riot is too much of a word, but they all ran into the lounge, demanded the captain.</span></p> <p><span id="s836">Q: In the middle of the night?</span></p> <p><span id="s837">A: They demanded to see the captain to find out what on earth was going on.</span> <span id="s838">Screaming, shouting, and I was so scared of -- the people, you know, they came down the stairs, up the stairs.</span> <span id="s839">Well, you couldn’t blame them.</span> <span id="s840">And the captain explained that there were negotiation between us and San Domingo, and another part of Cuba, and I don’t know what, and he was heading for a spot that was equidistant, so when the solution came we wouldn’t lose any more time.</span> <span id="s841">And di -- at that time the captain felt that about a half a dozen men would be a liaison between the passenger and him.</span> <span id="s842">My father was one of them, so he was very busy.</span> <span id="s843">We were cruising around, and came very close to Miami, I remember the palm trees, it looked so pretty.</span> <span id="s844">But at that time Miami wasn’t what it’s now, that was much later.</span> <span id="s845">We thought maybe we could get there, but the Coast Guard came with guns, so we left.</span> <span id="s846">And -- what I said to you before, some of the women, my mother signed a letter to Mrs. Roosevelt, whether she could help.</span> <span id="s847">Didn’t work.</span> <span id="s848">Understand that is in the Holocaust in Washington, may not be on display any more.</span> <span id="s849">So we were cruising around and there -- we got all kinds of telegrams, don’t worry, you’ll get off the -- eh -- and they -- forever they said you will not have to go back to Germany, that was the repeat all the time, which of course nobody believed any more.</span> <span id="s850">But one interesting thing was the crew, who had been told not to be friends with anybody, got very upset.</span> <span id="s851">Whenever there was a meeting there were two or three in the back to report to the others.</span> <span id="s852">And they said, what’s going on in Germany?</span> <span id="s853">We are on the ocean, we don’t know.</span> <span id="s854">One of the sailors got involved with a Jewish girl.</span> <span id="s855">And the [indecipherable] the Gestapo knew very well, so he killed himself.</span> <span id="s856">They found him hanging in his cabin.</span> <span id="s857">So they were really taking their life in their hand to be sympathetic to us.</span> <span id="s858">And the -- the captain told my father, I don’t know if other people knew it -- later on I read it in books.</span> <span id="s859">He said, if we have to go into the English channel without a chance to go anywhere but Germany, he would [indecipherable] the ship at the coast o -- coast of England, and then we would be shipwrecked and they would have to take us in, and to hell with the ship.</span> <span id="s860">It was some thing.</span> <span id="s861">I mean, that man was unbelievable.</span> <span id="s862">Luckily, by the time we got into the channel, the Jewish Joint had convinced England, Belgium, France and Holland to take in 200-some people.</span> <span id="s863">We landed in Amsterdam -- not land, I mean we berth -- berthed in a -- and Mr. Tropper -- and his name should be honored.</span> <span id="s864">He had -- was the one who really did everything from the Jewish Joint.</span> <span id="s865">He came up with representatives of the four countries, and one of the little girls came and said she was sorry she couldn’t give him flowers, but she thanked him for ret -- saving all our lives.</span> <span id="s866">That woman, as a matter of fact, is quite active in talking about the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s867">So when they made up lists, my sister and I helped, for the passengers who traveled together, but didn’t have the same name, like a couple with a mother-in-law, because they shouldn’t be split up.</span> <span id="s868">The four countries had certain requests.</span> <span id="s869">I know Holland wanted single men because they had [indecipherable] could take care it better there, and they expected a war.</span> <span id="s870">They could have a few more soldiers.</span> <span id="s871">I don’t know what Belgium wanted, France.</span> <span id="s872">The lucky ones were England because a year later Hitler had run over the other countries, and many of the Saint Louis people were killed.</span> <span id="s873">And we -- he -- something funny happened, we -- our first and -- was it Antwerp?</span> <span id="s874">I’m not sure, we didn’t get off there.</span> <span id="s875">And there was a big ship in the back of us, going to Chile, and somebody called my name.</span> <span id="s876">Was a girl from my school, she was on her way to Chile I was coming back from Cuba, and a -- a -- you know, these little things are so -- they illuminate how crazy everything was.</span> <span id="s877">Then they announced on the intercom certain names that were going to Holland.</span> <span id="s878">Belgium first, and then the others went to Holland.</span> <span id="s879">They were -- they’re only half of it.</span> <span id="s880">And we, who went to England and France, we are put on a freighter, to --</span></p> <p><span id="s881">Q: Now before we go that, I want to go back over a few si --</span></p> <p><span id="s882">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s883">Q: -- some things about the -- the trip.</span> <span id="s884">Can you tell us more about what people were saying on the ship as they began to realize that you wouldn’t get into Cuba?</span> <span id="s885">This is when you’re still in Cuba.</span> <span id="s886">What were people talking about?</span></p> <p><span id="s887">A: Well, people -- I really should have gone into that.</span> <span id="s888">People were planning to go overboard.</span> <span id="s889">And they hope that the young people could swim for two hours, and if they couldn’t, the next one would go, to save the life of the other.</span> <span id="s890">That’s why the captain of the committee had a -- a watch on deck at night.</span> <span id="s891">Nobody was allowed out any more, some levelheaded people.</span> <span id="s892">You must remember that there were some people on the ship with the shaven head, directly from the camp.</span> <span id="s893">They were not taking any chances to go to Germany, they’d rather drown.</span> <span id="s894">If in -- last few days -- well, if what I think about, we left June first, we landed, I think, on June 19.</span> <span id="s895">There aren’t this -- must have been about two weeks that -- the last week was really terrible.</span> <span id="s896">You just didn’t kn -- and you were so helpless, what could you do?</span> <span id="s897">We have telegrams, and all up the [indecipherable] wasn’t.</span> <span id="s898">Nobody believed it any more.</span> <span id="s899">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s900">Q: What was -- what was your father saying at that point?</span></p> <p><span id="s901">A: My father didn't talk about it.</span> <span id="s902">He was with the captain, and I mean, these men did only public announcement.</span> <span id="s903">What he said to my mother, I don’t know.</span> <span id="s904">But they were not going to spread rumor one way or another.</span> <span id="s905">They had bulletins, and that was that.</span> <span id="s906">I mean, probably the way it was when the Cuban missile was here with Kennedy, they didn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s907">They did what they could.</span> <span id="s908">So -- but I don’t know one thing, when we landed in England my father came down with pneumonia because so many days and nights he had been working.</span> <span id="s909">He was completely exhausted.</span> <span id="s910">He had been with the captain, he had been with the other committee member, and trying to do what they could.</span></p> <p><span id="s911">Q: What -- did your parents have any plan for -- for you, if -- if you were going to have to go back to Germany?</span> <span id="s912">Did your mother talk about it at all?</span></p> <p><span id="s913">A: No.</span> <span id="s914">It was impossible to think to go back to Germany, because what probably would have been happening, we would have taken off the ship into a camp, and be killed.</span> <span id="s915">I don’t know if my mother still had cyanamid -- cyanamid -- cyanide in her pocket, that’s quite possible that she would have given us a lemonade and we would have dropped dead.</span></p> <p><span id="s916">Q: A-At this point did you know what was going on in the camps?</span></p> <p><span id="s917">A: Oh, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s918">Q: You did.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">A: We had -- we didn’t know ev -- the crematoriums were not yet, but people died whether -- right and left.</span> <span id="s920">They were beaten, they were shot, they were God knows what.</span> <span id="s921">That much we knew, not the full extent.</span> <span id="s922">That came much later.</span> <span id="s923">But we knew it was a death sentence.</span> <span id="s924">Coming back to Germany was inconceivable.</span> <span id="s925">And of course the -- that’s why the -- why had that -- where I spoke the cruelty of the other countries.</span> <span id="s926">I mean, what 900 people.</span> <span id="s927">They could have been saved, and they were, but wa -- some people -- some of the Saint Louis people are very bitter, even now.</span> <span id="s928">I am not, mostly because I was lucky to get out.</span> <span id="s929">But I know that Roosevelt was under great pressure.</span> <span id="s930">He could not go ahead and do it, it was the depression.</span> <span id="s931">So [indecipherable] he managed to defeat Hitler.</span> <span id="s932">If he had been -- this was ’39, if he had been defeated in 1940, you know what -- oh, that new book, that [indecipherable] -- you’ve heard of the book now, yeah?</span> <span id="s933">That we should have let Hitler go ahead and we would have been very happy here.</span> <span id="s934">So that feeling was much stronger then.</span></p> <p><span id="s935">Q: But when you were outside of Miami, and you could see Miami, what were your feelings about the United States as a young woman?</span></p> <p><span id="s936">A: I don’t think I thought much about it.</span> <span id="s937">I said, I wish they would let us in, but nobody else did either.</span> <span id="s938">You know, there wasn’t a much of a difference between all the country, I just hoped we would get somewhere.</span> <span id="s939">I wasn’t particularly interested in going to America.</span> <span id="s940">I was interesting to staying alive.</span> <span id="s941">And eventually then I knew my number would be up, the quota --</span></p> <p><span id="s942">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">A: -- if I managed to survive it.</span></p> <p><span id="s944">Q: You talk about being interested in staying alive, I mean, do you remember feeling that your l -- that this really was a life or death s -- death issue?</span></p> <p><span id="s945">A: I knew that.</span> <span id="s946">I just couldn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s947">You knew the same thing when we were in England and the bombs came down.</span> <span id="s948">You -- you just -- your whole concept -- I think soldiers in war time too, they are afraid, but they just -- oh, excuse me.</span> <span id="s949">The enormity does not hit you until after.</span> <span id="s950">I don’t know if you’ve ever been in any danger, you do what you have to do and then afterwards you collapse.</span> <span id="s951">Then it hits you how close you were to catastrophe.</span> <span id="s952">And that’s the way it was on the ship.</span> <span id="s953">I remember I annoyed some people.</span> <span id="s954">I said very innocently, I dreamed last night that we had the Christmas party on board.</span> <span id="s955">And that was in June.</span> <span id="s956">Nobody liked my smart [indecipherable] remark, but I didn’t even think.</span> <span id="s957">But I was still about 18 -- yeah, 18 in ’39.</span> <span id="s958">So -- so there we were on a little freighter, we were about 400 people still, and the Saint Louis took off for America, for the cruises.</span> <span id="s959">And the crew lined up on deck, and said good luck to the Jews, which was something.</span> <span id="s960">And they told us, we are so glad we don’t have to go back to Hamburg, we are going to New York and we cruise to Bermuda, and in the fall when we come back to Germany, everything will be forgotten.</span> <span id="s961">Been not forgotten in 60 year.</span></p> <p><span id="s962">Q: Ha -- ha -- ha -- what wa -- they were sort of shouting to you?</span> <span id="s963">The crew members were sort of shouting to you good-bye?</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: A-A-And th -- was it in German?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: In German, [indecipherable] in Juden.</span> <span id="s967">It was them saying -- I mean, they really were in danger, those sailors, and so -- but they got so involved in that, what was a -- well, we were on the ship for six weeks, but the commotion was for three.</span> <span id="s968">And if you keep hearing it and hearing it, how frightened people are of Germany, you wonder what country is that.</span> <span id="s969">Maybe that’s the way the black people felt in the south.</span> <span id="s970">You know, when -- when they was no -- no help.</span> <span id="s971">You are trapped, especially on a ship.</span> <span id="s972">And also there was a question about food, and [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s973">The food was sufficient, but the last few days they didn’t give us so many choices.</span> <span id="s974">In the beginning it was a first class ship, you could choose from six entrees.</span> <span id="s975">In the end you had either fish or meat.</span> <span id="s976">It was enough, but no waste.</span></p> <p><span id="s977">Q: Did you get to know any crew members?</span> <span id="s978">Can you talk a little bit about that?</span></p> <p><span id="s979">A: I had no personal relection with the -- personal connection with them.</span> <span id="s980">They were pleasant, but I kept away from them, I was afraid of them.</span> <span id="s981">By the time I realized that they really were very helpful, we were gone.</span> <span id="s982">So then we went on a freighter first to France, where 250 people got off, and the freighter had very few cabins.</span> <span id="s983">Most of all that in where the freight used to be, there were bunk beds maybe three, four high, you had to climb up.</span> <span id="s984">And you could just roll out of bed and have breakfast because the tables were there, too.</span> <span id="s985">A few cabins were reserved for my parents and the other men from the committee.</span> <span id="s986">I feel appreciation for they had done.</span> <span id="s987">But the rest of what there was, one freight room for men, and one for women.</span> <span id="s988">You had to climb down the ladder to get in, and we were mean.</span> <span id="s989">When you sit downstairs and people come down the ladder, you see their legs first.</span> <span id="s990">And we had bets up to the knee, what legs are coming down, except one woman, she had ankles like that.</span> <span id="s991">No bets on her.</span> <span id="s992">You know, and we -- with all the commotion, we kids had some fun.</span> <span id="s993">Never -- as a matter of fact on the ship I was walking around with one guy, he was very friendly.</span> <span id="s994">And I was friends with another guy.</span> <span id="s995">And one day when I was walking with one on deck, the other one came and said hello.</span> <span id="s996">And it turns out they were brothers.</span> <span id="s997">I didn’t know that.</span> <span id="s998">There I was flirting with two, and it was all very nice.</span></p> <p><span id="s999">Q: C-Can you tell us a little bit more about the captain?</span></p> <p><span id="s1000">A: The cap --</span></p> <p><span id="s1001">Q: O -- of -- of the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1002">This is Gustav Schroeder.</span></p> <p><span id="s1003">A: Well, the captain was -- let me start with the end.</span> <span id="s1004">After the war he was called for the Nuremberg Trial, and my father then [indecipherable] this man wasn’t a Nazi, he saved a thousand people.</span> <span id="s1005">And he was acquitted.</span> <span id="s1006">My father and he correspond until my father died, and the captain died soon afterward.</span> <span id="s1007">He was a poet.</span> <span id="s1008">He had a son in Hamburg who was -- I think he had infantile paralysis.</span> <span id="s1009">And he was very fond of his son and whenever the ship came in or out, he would play -- the band would play the son’s favorite song, I don’t remember which it was.</span> <span id="s1010">So he was unbelievable with what he did.</span> <span id="s1011">And he -- of course the higher people, the Gestapo had him -- tried to intimidate him, but he was -- but you say, how did he learn how to stand up for thing?</span> <span id="s1012">It was a decent, honest person.</span> <span id="s1013">I don’t know what religion it [indecipherable] and I don’t care.</span> <span id="s1014">There are people that are -- it shows you the picture in the book, a little book that he wrote in German and sent to my father.</span> <span id="s1015">He went back to New York then, with the ship.</span></p> <p><span id="s1016">Q: Wh-What did he do?</span> <span id="s1017">You talked about -- can you tell us some about what -- what was so special about him, what did he do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1018">A: He saved us.</span> <span id="s1019">I mean, when they told him to go back, he didn’t.</span> <span id="s1020">He knew it would cost him his whatever they call the stuff that the captains have.</span> <span id="s1021">He knew he would be cashiered.</span> <span id="s1022">He wasn’t because he had to go back to New York.</span> <span id="s1023">He just didn’t obey order.</span> <span id="s1024">And we didn’t know all the things he did, we just knew we -- he helped us survive.</span></p> <p><span id="s1025">Q: S-So, during the time when it was unclear what was going to happen to the passengers, he disobeyed orders to go back to Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1026">A: The oren -- he only was going to [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1027">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1028">A: We knew it meant Germany unless somebody else [indecipherable] us before.</span> <span id="s1029">He doodled and dawdled around, he stalled everything.</span> <span id="s1030">And as I said, he was prepared to [indecipherable] the ship so we would not have to land in Germany.</span> <span id="s1031">And that is just as much as any captain can do f-for his ship, and for his passenger.</span> <span id="s1032">He said to my father he was scared stiff, and my father said, me, too.</span> <span id="s1033">But this wasn’t necessary.</span></p> <p><span id="s1034">Q: What else did your father say about him when he met with him?</span></p> <p><span id="s1035">A: He didn’t talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1036">Q: Okay.</span></p> <p><span id="s1037">A: I mean, you know, as a lawyer, he was used to keeping secrets.</span> <span id="s1038">He may have told my mother, but he sure wasn’t going to tell his blabber daughters.</span> <span id="s1039">He wouldn’t take the chance.</span> <span id="s1040">But he talked to her a real -- I don’t know.</span></p> <p><span id="s1041">Q: C-Can you just describe what the scene was like on the ship?</span> <span id="s1042">When it was clear you actually had turned around towards your -- I mean, what did it look like, what were people doing?</span></p> <p><span id="s1043">A: That -- that was at night when it’s -- we didn’t see it, we just felt it.</span> <span id="s1044">And that was, if anything, even worse.</span> <span id="s1045">I remember they demanded that the ship turn around because they were afraid the passengers were going to Europe.</span> <span id="s1046">So the ship turned and turned and turned.</span> <span id="s1047">And we could see by the sun that it was a full turn.</span> <span id="s1048">So we were being cheated.</span> <span id="s1049">And that’s when they really screamed.</span> <span id="s1050">Oh, it was a -- a riot.</span> <span id="s1051">But the captain calmed them down, convinced them that he was on our side, which was the greatest thing he could do.</span> <span id="s1052">But that of course, was right in the books for the Gestapo.</span></p> <p><span id="s1053">Q: The spies would have been writing that, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1054">A: They kept track of everything.</span></p> <p><span id="s1055">Q: But what kinds of things were people saying, once it really sunk in that you were going back?</span></p> <p><span id="s1056">A: What could they say?</span> <span id="s1057">We don’t want to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1058">Q: Right.</span></p> <p><span id="s1059">A: You see, you don’t know -- I don’t want to criticize your question, but you have no idea how -- what do you think people said in the death camps?</span> <span id="s1060">They couldn’t say anything.</span> <span id="s1061">You were just living from minute to minute.</span> <span id="s1062">They would say there is a new notice on the bulletin, everybody would run and look at it and not believe it.</span> <span id="s1063">They would say -- I don’t think it’s [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1064">We were supposed to go -- it was at San Domingo, I -- there was the -- they said maybe if they go to a different harbor in hav -- in Cuba, they will let us get into the dec -- back door.</span> <span id="s1065">[indecipherable] But everybody said, oh I don’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1066">And especially people who have small children, they were very frightened.</span> <span id="s1067">I mean, everybody was.</span> <span id="s1068">So that was that part.</span> <span id="s1069">When we came to England, and as I said, we were the lucky one, because the other -- by July ‘40, Hitler had run over the whole thing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Di-Did your parents choose England, or -- or was that just luck?</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: No, no, as I said, each country had requirement.</span> <span id="s1072">My father was working with the representative, and I know the Belgian representative wanted us to come to Belgium, but my father said no.</span> <span id="s1073">He had a choice, because he was [indecipherable] he said, with the war coming, we go to England.</span> <span id="s1074">He knew what he was doing.</span> <span id="s1075">As a matter of fact, I didn’t know it at that time, but my brother-in-law’s parents were also on the Saint Louis, and they went to Belgium.</span> <span id="s1076">They were underground for four years, living in a little room -- in a little room what faced the cemetery so nobody saw the window.</span> <span id="s1077">People brought them food, and from ’40 to ’46 or ’45, they lived underground.</span> <span id="s1078">Their son was here already, he was in the army, and the -- in ’46 they met again here, and he met my sister, I think two months later married.</span></p> <p><span id="s1079">End of Tape Two</span></p> <p><span id="s1080">Beginning Tape Three</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: Can -- going back a little bit to the Saint Louis, you had mentioned that you were afraid of some of the crew members.</span> <span id="s1082">Did you have any -- any bad experiences with them, overhearing them say anything, or treating you or others in a certain way?</span></p> <p><span id="s1083">A: Not that I remember.</span> <span id="s1084">I may not have been involved with it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1085">Q: Did you hear about anything like that?</span> <span id="s1086">A: Not at the time.</span> <span id="s1087">Afterwards I learned a lot of thing, but at the time you just went along.</span></p> <p><span id="s1088">Q: Did you know the young girl who dated the crew member, who fell in love with the crew member?</span></p> <p><span id="s1089">A: I can’t say, no.</span></p> <p><span id="s1090">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1091">A: You know, the whole thing is like a blur.</span> <span id="s1092">You lived one day and you wondered, as I said.</span> <span id="s1093">You lived for the bulletin, and you hope th-that what anybody said didn’t mean anything.</span> <span id="s1094">You just didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1095">I know that the bulletins were in English and in German because my father say people misunderstand the English one, they don’t know enough.</span> <span id="s1096">Now there was one bulletin, there is still hope it -- to land in Europe.</span> <span id="s1097">That still was not a negative.</span> <span id="s1098">So my father translated it to there is hope to la -- I mean, in German without [indecipherable] you know, with the flavor of this [indecipherable] because they looked like eh -- so that was -- that was all we did, watch what every -- we got telegrams maybe three, four times a day from Europe Jewish community, from American community.</span> <span id="s1099">They collected an awful lot of money, which they had been prepared to give to Cuba.</span> <span id="s1100">And what nobody could understand, why the Cuban didn’t just take it.</span> <span id="s1101">but it was a matter of principle.</span> <span id="s1102">I think they were afraid of the Nazis, of the Hitler people there, because there was a very large underground in Cuba.</span> <span id="s1103">And they were afraid if they displeased them, it would topple their government.</span> <span id="s1104">You know how governments get toppled.</span></p> <p><span id="s1105">Q: Going forward now, we’ve looked at -- at some of this material, but that you -- you and your family are headed towards England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">A: Into what?</span></p> <p><span id="s1107">Q: Towards Britain, towards England.</span> <span id="s1108">You got back to Europe and then you were selected, essentially, to go to England.</span></p> <p><span id="s1109">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1110">Q: So -- and you began to tell me about that sh -- that -- that ride to England.</span> <span id="s1111">Wh-What was it like when you docked there, and where did you dock?</span></p> <p><span id="s1112">A: Well, when we got to England, we had no chance to do anything, they did for us.</span> <span id="s1113">There was -- they called it the Rowan house, that took care of refugee, they ar -- are -- it’s when we got off the ship we were given a number by one of the -- I guess, social worker.</span> <span id="s1114">She said, this is the number of your train car, and this is the number of the bus that will meet you in London.</span> <span id="s1115">So that’s what we did, and the bus took us to a little pension, you know a little hotel, mostly students were there, and we had a room arranged for by the Rowan house for one week.</span> <span id="s1116">And my father [indecipherable] got sick.</span> <span id="s1117">My mother asked if we could stay longer, they said no.</span> <span id="s1118">They probably thought we were just telling them.</span> <span id="s1119">In the meantime we found out that my uncle from Breslau had arrived in London, and we found out where he was.</span> <span id="s1120">And we went -- he was in what you call a brownstone, I don’t know what they have in Washington, here in New York they have the refurnished brownstone houses, and the -- the rooms are rented out to people, each room -- not apartment.</span> <span id="s1121">And he and his wife and son had one room, and here -- the landlady gave my parents a room, but she had no other space, she said she would in two weeks, and my sister and I were in another building that belonged to her, under the roof.</span> <span id="s1122">It was slanted attic and there we were, and what impressed me was, in Havana, where in daylight, it was pitch dark and in 15 minutes was bright sunshine.</span> <span id="s1123">That was near the equator.</span> <span id="s1124">In England, dawn and dusk were [indecipherable] especially during the war when they had daylight saving, you could read at 11 o’clock.</span> <span id="s1125">I like that.</span> <span id="s1126">So there we were in England, and after a month, I got a job doing millinery work.</span> <span id="s1127">I put labels into the hat, by appointment to her majesty the queen.</span> <span id="s1128">I’m sure she never wore my hat.</span> <span id="s1129">I wasn’t very good at it.</span> <span id="s1130">And then came the war, September ’39 [indecipherable] arrived in June.</span> <span id="s1131">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1132">By August we knew.</span> <span id="s1133">I went sightseeing on Saturday after work, but most of the things were buried already for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s1134">Children were taken away from London.</span> <span id="s1135">Things were getting ready, but not as ready as they should have.</span> <span id="s1136">When the war started, I was working in that millinery, and one of the girls said, did you know that trouble had started?</span> <span id="s1137">And I said, trouble, does that mean war?</span> <span id="s1138">She says, yes.</span> <span id="s1139">So in those let -- last few days the ambassadors went back and forth, but then it was war.</span> <span id="s1140">They called it the blitzkrieg, they thought the Germans would come like this, which didn’t happen, and they made fun of it and called it the sitzkrieg, they were sitting.</span> <span id="s1141">But by April -- my factory kicked me out, they weren’t busy any more and me he could do without.</span> <span id="s1142">And in the spring, of course, Hitler ran over Belgium and everything.</span> <span id="s1143">And at that time, the English were afraid that among the refugees there would be Nazis hiding as refugee, and all -- most of the men were put into camps, my father, and everybody.</span> <span id="s1144">So he was -- I think it was the Isle of Mann where he was, from June, July, August, September, three month.</span> <span id="s1145">In the meantime the blitz had started.</span> <span id="s1146">Every night the bombs came down when it got dark until it got daylight.</span> <span id="s1147">And of course as the la -- nights got longer, the bombs went.</span> <span id="s1148">We -- I know we were -- one time we were standing in the basement, sitting there, and the house was shaking, and I was thinking, I hope the ceiling will stay up.</span> <span id="s1149">If the ceiling stays up we’ll be alright.</span> <span id="s1150">Then, after the all clear, you went around looking what houses weren’t there.</span> <span id="s1151">And my father came back in September, and he managed to get passage for us to come to the State, which was very hard to get.</span> <span id="s1152">I mean, the ships were being sunk, and they needed ships.</span> <span id="s1153">So we went to Liverpool and went on board.</span> <span id="s1154">Blackout.</span> <span id="s1155">You couldn’t go on deck with [indecipherable] doors, because you know, you couldn’t even smoke on deck because a light carries very far in the ocean.</span> <span id="s1156">We had air raid alarms.</span> <span id="s1157">Mostly they were just tests, but sometimes you could hear planes, and you didn’t really know where, what.</span> <span id="s1158">So we went -- I think it took about more than two weeks.</span> <span id="s1159">There were three groups of people on the ship.</span> <span id="s1160">Children with their mothers or their nannies, that came to Canada for safekeeping.</span> <span id="s1161">And some refugees, and a whole batch of young men who just came on board.</span> <span id="s1162">No paper, no nothing.</span> <span id="s1163">Well, what we find out, we were full -- I think two full crews for ships, which Roosevelt had promised Churchill cash and carry.</span> <span id="s1164">They picked up the ships in New York and take them back to England.</span> <span id="s1165">So, I remember one thing, everything was blackout and no -- no identification.</span> <span id="s1166">And when we were near Halifax, there was a fog and an old English man said, well, when the king and queen came to Halifax, they were befogged too, so it’s all right.</span> <span id="s1167">And I was standing on deck with some guy and we saw the captain come out.</span> <span id="s1168">We hadn’t seen him before, because I mean, it was a heck of a job getting the ship over.</span> <span id="s1169">And he was looking up and saluting, and we saw it was the Union Jack wave, and that meant we were in Canadian waters, and we’d done it.</span> <span id="s1170">Now that moment I will never forget, because on that ship, you [indecipherable] you never got undressed.</span> <span id="s1171">You had your lifebelt, you had your winter coat, and your boots.</span> <span id="s1172">You had to have the winter coat in case you went into a boat.</span> <span id="s1173">You had to be able to throw it off in case you went into the water.</span> <span id="s1174">Same thing with the shoes.</span> <span id="s1175">I mean, that was another scary ride.</span> <span id="s1176">I didn’t take a cruise until years later.</span> <span id="s1177">But we were in Halifax, we -- they took on foo -- food, and oil.</span> <span id="s1178">And then we sailed down to New York.</span> <span id="s1179">I didn’t see the Statue of Liberty.</span> <span id="s1180">We had to be showing our papers downstairs, and when we got off, there was a man from the HIAS.</span> <span id="s1181">I don’t know if you know that [indecipherable] on Esther Place, I think it’s still there.</span> <span id="s1182">They would take newcomers in who had nobody to meet them.</span> <span id="s1183">Most of them had some relatives, we didn’t.</span> <span id="s1184">So he took us down to the HIAS, and that was really scary, I was scared.</span> <span id="s1185">We were sitting there, they told us to wait.</span> <span id="s1186">It was it -- two days before Thanksgiving.</span> <span id="s1187">And the two men came over from Vienna.</span> <span id="s1188">And my parent -- my sister and one of the guys went out one door for a little walk, and I went out another door with that guy who was very scruvy looking.</span> <span id="s1189">Unshaven.</span> <span id="s1190">He walked me around and around.</span> <span id="s1191">I said, I want to go back.</span> <span id="s1192">He wanted to sh -- he wanted to show me something.</span> <span id="s1193">I was say, gee whiz, I can’t even tell the cops where I am.</span> <span id="s1194">I didn’t have an address, what was going on?</span> <span id="s1195">But he wanted to show me Woolworth.</span> <span id="s1196">In those days, for one dollar, you could buy candies, and stocking, and stationery, everything was a dime or 15 cents.</span> <span id="s1197">I was overwhelmed.</span> <span id="s1198">Then he took me back.</span> <span id="s1199">But it -- it’s very uncomfortable.</span> <span id="s1200">So we were in the -- that was Tuesday we arrived, Wednesday we went down to Times Square where the Jewish organizations were.</span> <span id="s1201">I was very disappointed.</span> <span id="s1202">Times Square in daylight was very scruffy, even then.</span> <span id="s1203">And the woman who took our particulars said we should come back on Monday because tomorrow is Thanksgiving, we won’t work, and Friday we don’t work.</span> <span id="s1204">What was Thanksgiving, we didn’t know.</span> <span id="s1205">So she gave an -- an appointment for Monday.</span> <span id="s1206">And I -- my sister and I, we went back to the HIAS, and my parents went to see that cousin, and -- who invited us for Thanksgiving dinner next day.</span> <span id="s1207">There were all kinds of family there, a big to-do.</span> <span id="s1208">I don’t know if you know -- your -- “Life With Father”?</span> <span id="s1209">You don’t know the play?</span> <span id="s1210">That was new at the time.</span> <span id="s1211">A whole string of redheads, Irish.</span> <span id="s1212">And when we came in, they said, the Irish fam -- “Life With Father”.</span> <span id="s1213">We didn’t know what it was all about.</span> <span id="s1214">So we met a cousin of mine and he took us out, and he said he had a friend who was in the employment agency of the [indecipherable] and we should go there, and she introduced us, we had coffee with her, and she said we should come on Monday and see if we could get a job.</span> <span id="s1215">And we did.</span> <span id="s1216">So we were there on Tuesday, on Monday we had a job.</span> <span id="s1217">It was a -- two Viennese men were making gloves for the Army and Navy.</span> <span id="s1218">And my sister sat on a little machine and made all those fingers.</span> <span id="s1219">You had to make, I think 10 dozen pairs.</span> <span id="s1220">You didn’t believe it.</span> <span id="s1221">It was piecework.</span> <span id="s1222">And we were still in the HIAS because we -- everybody told us to leave New York.</span> <span id="s1223">They said it would be better in a small town, a small community would take care of us.</span> <span id="s1224">My sister and I, we sat there and my sister, she was a tough noodle, she sat next to the fastest person and matched.</span> <span id="s1225">She became the fastest one in the group.</span> <span id="s1226">I wasn’t bad, either.</span> <span id="s1227">So in those days, the minimum was 10 dollars a week.</span> <span id="s1228">And she and I each made 18.</span> <span id="s1229">That was a lot.</span> <span id="s1230">And my -- we took work home for my mother to finish.</span> <span id="s1231">We came home with big bags of gloves, and she finished it and we took them back.</span> <span id="s1232">I mean, she didn't work all night, it’s the next day.</span> <span id="s1233">And so she earned some money.</span> <span id="s1234">My father had all kinds of funny jobs in the beginning.</span> <span id="s1235">He was working for a dental lab, delivering the false teeth.</span> <span id="s1236">That’s for the lawyer.</span> <span id="s1237">But he was really terrific, he did whatever came, and after awhile he got a job as a bookkeeper, where he stayed the rest of the time.</span> <span id="s1238">So between 18 and 18 and maybe my mother eight, my father maybe 12, that was, in those time, livable.</span> <span id="s1239">But of course, we bought yesterday’s bread, was cheaper.</span> <span id="s1240">I went to my first movie after one year, on my birthday somebody took me.</span> <span id="s1241">A date was an ice cream soda with two straws.</span> <span id="s1242">I mean, it took doing.</span> <span id="s1243">And at first I could not go to school because I was war work, so you had to work long hours.</span> <span id="s1244">And once they did -- somebody told the Army and Navy, knitted gloves are no good, they wanted a -- what we made were liv -- knitted gloves with leather palm.</span> <span id="s1245">But they wanted leather gloves with lining.</span> <span id="s1246">All the soldiers in the ar -- [indecipherable] said ours are better, we have a better grip.</span> <span id="s1247">But, government.</span> <span id="s1248">So we didn't have government work any more, we made gloves for skiing, and that gave me a chance to go to school.</span> <span id="s1249">And I went -- I don’t know if you know it, on Lexington Ave. in [indecipherable] is part of City College, the Brandeis Institute, that’s for business.</span> <span id="s1250">I didn’t take credit, but I learned.</span> <span id="s1251">You know, auditor.</span> <span id="s1252">And when I thought I was ready, I started in an office, very much at the bottom.</span> <span id="s1253">I worked my way up, and my sister got married, and my father died in ’56.</span> <span id="s1254">He died on the last day when he retired, he didn’t come home any more.</span> <span id="s1255">He collapsed in the subway.</span> <span id="s1256">We didn’t know where he was.</span> <span id="s1257">But eventually I co -- went to the police and declared him missing, and they found him in the Roosevelt hospital, he died the next day.</span> <span id="s1258">That’s where that doctor was who thought he was a Nazi.</span> <span id="s1259">So that’s how it went.</span></p> <p><span id="s1260">Q: Why did that doctor think your father was a Nazi?</span></p> <p><span id="s1261">A: The doctor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1262">Q: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1263">A: He thought Father was a Nazi because he didn’t look Jewish, we -- we had an accent, he had those student -- what they call a smisser, I don’t know if there is such a word.</span></p> <p><span id="s1264">Q: Scars?</span></p> <p><span id="s1265">A: Scars, from sabers, you know, fenc -- much --</span></p> <p><span id="s1266">Q: Fencing.</span></p> <p><span id="s1267">A: I don’t know what -- if they do it even here, not any more.</span> <span id="s1268">Not in the -- not for fraternity.</span> <span id="s1269">It was like an -- being in -- before you joined it, not hazing, it was more a courage thing.</span> <span id="s1270">Maybe you could even call it hazing.</span> <span id="s1271">So they thought he was a German Nazi.</span> <span id="s1272">And then he was so nice.</span> <span id="s1273">When he found out that we were Jewish, you know, he was -- this was shortly after the war, and maybe he had family in Germany, you know, and he didn’t fee -- he was a good doctor, but he had no warmth, and it was so funny how suddenly he was helpful, and -- you know, there’s a difference between being correct, and being nice.</span> <span id="s1274">So then my mother and I, we moved down here, because she had a heart condition at Washington Heights -- I don’t know if you know [indecipherable] Heights -- it was hard for her to walk.</span> <span id="s1275">And my sister, she got engaged the day she met her husband, and they got married six weeks later.</span> <span id="s1276">And all that about a month after her pa -- his parents came.</span> <span id="s1277">I don’t know if his parents were very happy that he suddenly had a bride and a baby a year later.</span> <span id="s1278">He was a chemist.</span></p> <p><span id="s1279">Q: Can I get you to talk some about faith?</span> <span id="s1280">Over, for instance, the period when your family was on the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1281">Were you going to services?</span></p> <p><span id="s1282">A: Yeah [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s1283">Q: And what kind of prayers was your father praying with you, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1284">A: It was a com -- I mean, the -- in the lounge there were prayer, for Friday night and Saturday.</span> <span id="s1285">Not specifically only for the Saint Louis, but I mean, we were there on the Jewish holiday, right, Shavuot, in May that would have been.</span> <span id="s1286">So they had their routine prayers, but not particular one.</span> <span id="s1287">And you know, that reminds me of something else which really doesn’t belong in here.</span> <span id="s1288">When I was on a cruise to Alaska, they had Friday night service conducted by a priest.</span> <span id="s1289">Was he ever careful.</span> <span id="s1290">He was a lovely guy.</span> <span id="s1291">It was the Fourth of July, which made it easy for him to preach, because Fourth of July is no religion.</span> <span id="s1292">And one man who was knowledgeable Jewish, he said the Jewish prayer.</span> <span id="s1293">He knew -- the priest also knew some Hebrew.</span> <span id="s1294">It was quite an experience, because he conducted masses every day for the Catholic people on board.</span> <span id="s1295">So, it was nice</span></p> <p><span id="s1296">Q: What -- when you look back at -- at the time, what do you think enabled your family to stay together that was unusual in that time?</span> <span id="s1297">What was it that enabled your mother and father to keep going on and keep finding solutions?</span></p> <p><span id="s1298">A: I don’t think it was religion that kept my father and mother on.</span> <span id="s1299">They were Jewish, and conscious Jews, but I don’t think, at least I never remember that we had a prayer meeting.</span> <span id="s1300">There may have been Orthodox people on board who had their meetings in their cabin, but we were medium religious, even when we were here.</span> <span id="s1301">I mean, I now am what they call every day Jew, for the three holidays, I’m a member of the synagogue, but I don’t go often.</span> <span id="s1302">If I had children I think I would have been more conscientious about teaching.</span> <span id="s1303">But we were not that religious.</span> <span id="s1304">There were many people who didn’t even know they were Jewish until Hitler told them.</span> <span id="s1305">They were so assimilated that it was a great shock for them.</span> <span id="s1306">It was not for us, we knew we were Jewish.</span> <span id="s1307">But I know -- I have one friend, she and her husband came from family who, as I said, they never knew they were Jewish until they got kicked out.</span> <span id="s1308">They had a little son.</span> <span id="s1309">When he was 12, he was wanted to be Bar Mitzvah.</span> <span id="s1310">And they thought he wanted the party, he -- but he wanted, so for a whole year he had his dad take him to classes, and then there was a Bar Mitzvah with a lot of people who’d never been in a temple [indecipherable] and that little guy got it.</span> <span id="s1311">You know, religion is a very changeable thing.</span> <span id="s1312">I’ve seen people who were not religious, and their children married very religious, and the other way around.</span> <span id="s1313">It -- I don’t know how religious you are, whether you are an organized religion that makes you do certain things certain days.</span> <span id="s1314">And I know, for instance, the Orthodox Jewish religion -- and there were these Orthodox Jews on the ship, they have to do things that way, whether it’s kosher, whether it’s Shabbat, it’s a very -- I don’t want to say constricting, because the people who do it don’t feel it’s constricting.</span> <span id="s1315">I do.</span> <span id="s1316">You know they -- their whole life is built around it.</span> <span id="s1317">My family and I never were.</span> <span id="s1318">My nephew is married to a non-Jewish girl who is very lovely.</span> <span id="s1319">She knows more than he does by now.</span> <span id="s1320">So i -- I always feel everybody should marry everybody else so they can’t get mad at each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s1321">Q: H-H-How -- if it was not religion then, what do you think gave your mother and father the strength to keep going on, and to keep pushing the family overseas?</span></p> <p><span id="s1322">A: The necessity, we didn't have a choice.</span></p> <p><span id="s1323">Q: Mm-hm.</span></p> <p><span id="s1324">A: I mean, what could they have done?</span> <span id="s1325">And my grandmother stayed in Germany, there was nothing she -- they could do.</span> <span id="s1326">My mother always felt very bad, but she said she had -- she owed more to her husband and two young children.</span> <span id="s1327">It’s -- they provided for her and there was that -- that nice lady was there, but if they had been very religious they would have taken her along, and we would all have gone into trauma.</span> <span id="s1328">Religion was not -- you will f -- you know, many people became very religious once they were in the camp.</span> <span id="s1329">And I always feared the -- it’s a prayer that they say in memory of those who died, and I always think that ma -- prayer is wrong.</span> <span id="s1330">It says for those who died as martyrs for being Jewish.</span> <span id="s1331">I feel it’s much sadder those who died who never knew they were Jewish, who really were just told, you are Jewish and you drop dead.</span> <span id="s1332">The ones who were Jewish and religious as you say, probably had an easier time.</span> <span id="s1333">Th-That’s what I think, I may be wrong.</span> <span id="s1334">Gee, I feel like on a Freudian couch.</span> <span id="s1335">But it’s interesting to think about things that you usually don’t.</span></p> <p><span id="s1336">Q: Have you ever gone back to Breslau?</span> <span id="s1337">A: Over my dead body.</span> <span id="s1338">I once was in Germany for two days, I couldn’t breathe.</span> <span id="s1339">It was -- now it would be different because a different generation.</span> <span id="s1340">When I was there, I was very tense.</span> <span id="s1341">I knew I couldn’t blame everybody.</span> <span id="s1342">And one man I know my age went to Breslau and he gave a long report on it.</span> <span id="s1343">I could hardly read it.</span> <span id="s1344">It turns my stomach.</span> <span id="s1345">When I was in Germany, the young people didn’t care anyway, and the old people said how come you speak German so well.</span> <span id="s1346">I was with a tour from here.</span> <span id="s1347">And of course they figured it out because I spoke German well, and I didn’t know what a mark looked like, you know, the German money.</span> <span id="s1348">And one day we were in Heidelberg.</span> <span id="s1349">Have you been there?</span> <span id="s1350">And in Heidelberg we were not allowed to have our tour guide, but a local woman to show us around.</span> <span id="s1351">And she of course had my number.</span> <span id="s1352">And she was my age, and I knew she must have been a young Nazi because at that age, she was 13, I mean, she didn’t have a choice.</span> <span id="s1353">She came over to me, she asked me how I was doing, what I was going, how I had lived in America.</span> <span id="s1354">It was very nice.</span> <span id="s1355">And I don’t know if you’ve heard of it, in Heidelberg, that’s where the students are.</span> <span id="s1356">They have an enormous -- a beer keg, and they open the keg and everybody gets a glass.</span> <span id="s1357">And she calls me to open the keg.</span> <span id="s1358">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1359">And I was thinking, gee whiz, I don’t know what she did when she was 18.</span> <span id="s1360">People are people, all kinds.</span> <span id="s1361">But I was glad when I was out of the country.</span> <span id="s1362">The older ones looked at me -- not this woman, but others, suspicious.</span> <span id="s1363">I don’t think they liked me to come back.</span> <span id="s1364">But it was part of the tour or I wouldn’t have gone.</span></p> <p><span id="s1365">Q: Did your family ever apply for any reparations?</span> <span id="s1366">Did your family apply for reparations?</span></p> <p><span id="s1367">A: Oh yes, but we -- we [indecipherable] wrong side.</span> <span id="s1368">Breslau became Polish, so we did not get the German, the f -- restitution, the full one.</span> <span id="s1369">If people for instance who were on the German part of Berlin got three times as much as the one on the other part of Berlin.</span> <span id="s1370">So we never got all that much.</span> <span id="s1371">We got some for my lost education, but nothing terrible dramatic.</span> <span id="s1372">I had to earn my money.</span></p> <p><span id="s1373">Q: And in your family, your -- your -- your sister’s children, and perhaps they even have children, how much do they know about the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s1374">A: Tom -- Tom is very interested, and he pushed me into all that, and --</span></p> <p><span id="s1375">Q: Tom is your nephew?</span></p> <p><span id="s1376">A: Yeah, that my sister’s son, the older one.</span> <span id="s1377">You didn’t talk to him.</span> <span id="s1378">I think -- what did I -- so many people talked to him.</span> <span id="s1379">He was the one, the man -- you --</span></p> <p><span id="s1380">Q: It doesn’t matter, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s1381">A: -- on the Saint Louis, you n -- oh my -- Scott.</span> <span id="s1382">You know Scott?</span> <span id="s1383">[indecipherable].</span> <span id="s1384">Well, you are not really the Saint Louis part, you are the other -- well, he -- Tom is very interested, and he want me to dictate -- maybe from this [indecipherable] something.</span> <span id="s1385">Ken is not.</span> <span id="s1386">Yeah, he is younger, six years younger, makes a big different.</span> <span id="s1387">And his whole -- he has a wife, three children.</span> <span id="s1388">He is still interested, but Tom always says, I want it for Ken children.</span> <span id="s1389">I don’t even know if they’d be interested.</span> <span id="s1390">You know, this is ancient history for them.</span> <span id="s1391">And another few years who will be left who lived through it?</span> <span id="s1392">I am almost the youngest refugee.</span> <span id="s1393">Anybody later was foreign born.</span> <span id="s1394">Anybody who was six, seven years old when they came over here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1395">Q: Is there anything else you’d like to add?</span> <span id="s1396">Is there anything else you’d like to add?</span></p> <p><span id="s1397">A: I’ll probably remember in my bathtub later.</span> <span id="s1398">That’s an old story, isn’t it, when you want -- after the party you remember what you want to say, but I don’t think so.</span> <span id="s1399">I --</span></p> <p><span id="s1400">Q: I think it would be good if we could stop now and then we’ll show some photographs.</span></p> <p><span id="s1401">A: Okay.</span> <span id="s1402">Okay.</span> <span id="s1403">Am I on the tele -- these are my parent --</span></p> <p><span id="s1404">Q: I’m -- I’m sorry, I’m sorry, hang on --</span></p> <p><span id="s1405">A: Okay?</span> <span id="s1406">These are my mother and father in the good old times, in the 30’s, before all the disasters happened.</span> <span id="s1407">They look happy, they look more prosperous than later.</span> <span id="s1408">They look also as if they weighed more than they did in later years when all the worries were so hard on them.</span> <span id="s1409">I like these two pictures.</span> <span id="s1410">Okay, this is a picture of the Saint Louis when she left Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1411">I think the skyline is the ham -- from Hamburg.</span> <span id="s1412">And the little tugboats are kicking the ship off to a good voyage.</span> <span id="s1413">This is a picture that the ship photographer took of the people as they got on.</span> <span id="s1414">My father is walking ahead with a hand full of paper to document our exit.</span> <span id="s1415">I am the second one, looking a little suspicious, and my sister follows me, looking where she is walking.</span> <span id="s1416">I presume my mother was take -- coming behind us and didn’t get in the picture any more.</span> <span id="s1417">Was in -- in May 30, 1939.</span> <span id="s1418">This is a picture taken on the Saint Louis.</span> <span id="s1419">I’m pretty sure that it was taken on the way out, because we would never have looked that nice on the way back, when we were worried.</span> <span id="s1420">My mother’s the first one, I’m behind my father, then my sister is standing on my father’s other side.</span> <span id="s1421">And it’s just one of the nicest pictures of the trip, when we were still thinking we were happy.</span> <span id="s1422">This is a picture of the committee that the captain had [indecipherable] to act as a liaison between the very upset passengers and the captain, who tried to keep the boat steady.</span> <span id="s1423">I do not know all the name.</span> <span id="s1424">My father is the one in the center with the bow tie.</span> <span id="s1425">I do know all the men, but not their names.</span> <span id="s1426">I’m trying to -- maybe they are on the back?</span> <span id="s1427">Back of the picture?</span> <span id="s1428">Goodman, Weiss, Manasser, Zellner, Joseph, Housedorf, Vendick.</span></p> <p><span id="s1429">Q: Okay.</span> <span id="s1430">You can read it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1431">A: Oh, without?</span> <span id="s1432">Okay.</span> <span id="s1433">The name of the men who were the committee was the first one, Goodman, the fi -- on the left, Weiss, Manasser, my father, Zellner, Joseph, Housedorf and Vendick.</span> <span id="s1434">There are two, four, six, seven.</span> <span id="s1435">One of the men, I should be nasty enough to say, got on the committee because he argued about everything.</span> <span id="s1436">Anything the committee du -- did, he disliked, so they put him on.</span> <span id="s1437">This is Havana, which at that time was a beautiful city, from what we could see, and we were very close.</span> <span id="s1438">You see the little boat in the front.</span> <span id="s1439">Relatives of the passenger would hire these boats, they would leave Havana and go around the ship two or three times, screaming up to their relatives, everybody was hollering for everybody, reassuring us, which didn’t work, and we would ask question, what could be done, but we never got an answer because there was no answer.</span> <span id="s1440">Then on June first, the ships were not allowed to come any more, and we knew we had to leave.</span></p> <p><span
