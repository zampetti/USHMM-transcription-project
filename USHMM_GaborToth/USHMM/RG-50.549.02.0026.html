Okay, even though, in the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did with you, we got a pretty good sense of your Holocaust era experiences, let’s go back to before the war and just pick up on some things and clarify some things that -- that -- that we could get some more detail on, before going on to post-war experiences.</span> <span id="s16">And the first thing that I wanted to ask you about

life.</span> <span id="s24">My father was working as -- in the Jewish kaheela -- that’s like a federation or so -- so-social worker, there.</span> <span id="s25">My mother was a housewife and we were normal children and when we started school, we went to -- to -- we didn’t go to public schools, they didn’t accept -- we went to private elementary school.</span> <span id="s26">Th-They didn’t -- elementary was compulsory, but high school wasn’t and they didn’t expect too -- a-accepted too many Jews to the public high schools.</span> <span id="s27">And my sister and myself went to private, Hebrew speaking schools, because my father was a Zionist.</span> <span id="s28">And, I hear --</span></p> <p><span id="s29">Q: What was your -- what was your sister’s name?</span></p> <p><span

very close.</span> <span id="s36">We -- especially during the war, we kept very, very close, because that’s all we had.</span> <span id="s37">And because, the rest -- we had a lot of relatives, cousins and my mother had another brother in Lithuania, but it -- between Poland and Lithuania, there was a conflict and we couldn’t see each other.</span> <span id="s38">But, during the war, in -- when they opened the borders, we met my uncle and my mother saw hi -- her brother for the first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s39">Q: Can you say a little bit more about your relationships in your family, before the war.</span> <span id="s40">Were -- What -- Did you -- and you -- you had a sister and your mother and your father.</span> <span id="s41">Were you particularly close with -- with --

company.</span> <span id="s49">We had a lot of relatives.</span> <span id="s50">My father didn’t have any relatives in -- in Vilno, where I was born, because he was born in Poland and he had a sister in Poland, in Zamusht.</span> <span id="s51">And th-the rest of his family were in the Soviet Union, that we never met them, we never saw them and I don’t know them up to -- up to date, even.</span> <span id="s52">And -- But we were very close with the other relatives, with the cousins and aunts.</span> <span id="s53">Specially cousins, because we didn’t have any aunts.</span></p> <p><span

that --</span></p> <p><span id="s57">A: Well, I had -- three of my mother’s brothers, they came in early 19 oh si -- between 1906 and 19 oh -- and 1910 or somewhere around there, they came to the United States, three of her brothers.</span> <span id="s58">Then, in 1920, before they closed the borders, the -- the immigration to the United States, he -- they brought over my grandparents, their gran -- my grandparents, my grandmother and grandfather, two sister -- two aunts and an uncle.</span> <span id="s59">And this uncle lived for awhile i-in Canada and then he moved to Syracuse, he got married and he lived in Syracuse, New York.</span> <span id="s60">And my uncles lived here, in the United States.</span> <span id="s61">I never knew them until I came to the United States.</span> <span id="s62">When I came here, in 1949, my grandfather wasn’t alive any more, but my grandmother was still alive and my two aunts and -- and three uncles.</span> <span id="s63">One uncle died in 1941 and I never knew him.</span></p> <p><span id="s64">Q: Why did your family come to the US?</span> <span id="s65">Did they have some understanding of what was going ha -- going to happen?</span></p> <p><span id="s66">A: I don’t -- they -- they were in Lithuania some and the situation was very bad there and it was right with the Soviet Union and before the first World War, and life wasn’t good in Europe.</span> <span id="s67">And they decided, the three brothers -- the three older brothers, decided to come to the United States, and the rest stayed.</span> <span id="s68">They couldn’t afford at the time to come and they stayed in Europe.</span> <span id="s69">And when the other families came -- the rest of the family, my mother was pregnant with me, and she go -- just got married and they couldn’t come to the United States.</span> <span id="s70">And my uncle from -- from Lithuania, couldn’t make it either.</span> <span id="s71">They didn’t get a visa or something.</span> <span id="s72">I don’t remember exactly what it was.</span> <span id="s73">There was another brother in the Soviet Union, but we don’t know what happened to him.</span></p> <p><span id="s74">Q: What were your parents names?</span></p> <p><span id="s75">A: My father’s name was Israel and my mother’s name was Chasia, a -- C-h-a-s-i-a.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Q: And her maiden name?</span></p> <p><span id="s77">A: Her na -- maiden name was Schusta, but here in the United States, they changed -- changed to Schuman.</span></p> <p><span id="s78">Q: So, was it co -- I mean your -- your family, it seems that almost your entire family had an interest in coming to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s79">A: They -- My father wasn’t interested.</span> <span id="s80">My father was a Zionist, he’s always wanted to go to the Israel.</span> <span id="s81">And during the war -- in 1939, when the wor -- war broke out, he got a certificate for three people to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s82">But we were four people.</span> <span id="s83">Whom do you leave?</span> <span id="s84">Then he gave up his certificate to somebody else and we stayed home and they were perished, my parents, and -- my mother died in the ghetto and my father was burned alive in Estonia.</span></p> <p><span id="s85">Q: Back in -- Back to the war time.</span> <span id="s86">There was just one thing I -- a question I had about the -- after Lithuania was -- after Vilna became part of Lithuania and you described in the videotaped interview how the non-Jewish children who you used to play with, all of a sudden were pointing out the Jews -- the Jews and -- and -- and -- and after the German occupation, they were pointing out the Jews and that these Jews were then being --</span></p> <p><span id="s87">A: Being taken away, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s88">Q: -- taken away.</span> <span id="s89">Was that shocking to you?</span> <span id="s90">Did you have close relationships with your towns non-Jewish townspeople before [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s91">A: Yeah, we were very close.</span> <span id="s92">We used to play -- we -- we lived together.</span> <span id="s93">We -- It -- We did -- there was a Jewish section, too, but the ghetto was later.</span> <span id="s94">But we lived in the section that it was mixed, non-Jews and Jews.</span> <span id="s95">The majority were non-Jews and we lived very quietly with them.</span> <span id="s96">We played with them in the yard, and out on the street.</span> <span id="s97">You know how kids play after school.</span> <span id="s98">And we never talked about it, but when the da -- Germans came, I guess that it was entirely different.</span> <span id="s99">They used to sell a Jew for a pound of salt, a pound of sugar, of -- a pack of cigarettes, they used to point out the Jew.</span> <span id="s100">And the Germans, with the help of the Ukrainian police, and Lithuanian police, used to come in and take them away.</span> <span id="s101">It was entirely different.</span> <span id="s102">We didn’t -- we’d never expected that, but look, life changes.</span> <span id="s103">You can see it now, how countries change.</span> <span id="s104">It’s still going on, they -- they still didn’t learn from the fir -- the second World War and it’s still going on in Bosnia and previous Czechoslovakia and in th-the African countries, they kill each other.</span> <span id="s105">For what?</span> <span id="s106">For a piece of land?</span> <span id="s107">Does it pay to kill people?</span> <span id="s108">Does it pay to -- to starve little kids, what is their fault?</span> <span id="s109">It hurts very much when you see those things on television.</span></p> <p><span id="s110">Q: I’d like to talk more about that later, but just keeping with the pre-war or the war time --</span></p> <p><span id="s111">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Q: If -- I’d like to get a sense of your -- you’re a young woman at the ti -- at the time that the war began, what were your dreams and hopes at that time for yourself?</span> <span id="s113">What did you imagine for your future?</span></p> <p><span id="s114">A: Well, I’ll tell you, we went -- when the war broke out, I was 17 years old.</span> <span id="s115">I didn’t finish high school, I was in the lith -- last year of high school.</span> <span id="s116">And then I -- we were planning -- our parents planning to send me to the university, but they didn’t accept Jews into the university in Poland.</span> <span id="s117">They accepted a very small amount.</span> <span id="s118">Then all the -- practically the majority of the Jews who went to college, went to other countries.</span> <span id="s119">Went to England, it was -- a lot of went to France, to Italy, to Germans -- to Germany you couldn’t go.</span> <span id="s120">But before the war -- bef -- in -- ba -- in the early 30’s, in the 20’s, the -- a lot of Jewish people went to -- to Germany to ca -- to the universities.</span> <span id="s121">And -- But, didn’t turn out this way and we did the best we could and that --</span></p> <p><span id="s122">Q: Did you want to go to school -- to university, to study something?</span></p> <p><span id="s123">A: I think I did wanted to do something, but I -- I -- I didn’t know myself what I wanted to do yet.</span> <span id="s124">Because we were in a turmoil, we didn’t know what’s what, what’s going to be, because in ‘38, a-already, the anti-Semitism was very high in Poland and they were t-talking about the war, what’s going on and Hitler was taking Czechoslovakia at the time.</span> <span id="s125">And we were expected to be taken by the Germans also.</span> <span id="s126">And, when the bro -- when Germany attacked on September first, th-the Jews -- the -- Poland, it didn’t last long.</span> <span id="s127">In 17 days, Po-Poland was defeated.</span> <span id="s128">And that was the end of our lives.</span></p> <p><span id="s129">Q: So, really, your -- your own development as a young woman, imagining your future was very much interrupted even before the war started --</span></p> <p><span id="s130">A: Before the war, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s131">Q: -- that you-your -- your mind was --</span></p> <p><span id="s132">A: We didn’t know what to expect of our lives.</span> <span id="s133">We lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s134">Cause we didn’t know what’s going to be next.</span> <span id="s135">And in Poland, anti-Semitism was very, very high at the time.</span> <span id="s136">They were killing Jews, used to beat us up for -- without any reason, specially before Christmas or before Passover.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">Q: Were you beat up, personally?</span></p> <p><span id="s138">A: No, na -- not me, but especially they used to beat up boys ma --the most.</span> <span id="s139">But once in awhile, when we used to go to school, they used to call us, “Dirty Jew, where are you going?”</span> <span id="s140">Because they knew we are Jews, because we were going to school and they were going to school, but we had uniform -- we had to wear uniforms to s -- when we were in Europe.</span> <span id="s141">And we had numbers and they knew that th-this and this is the Jewish -- we were Jews.</span> <span id="s142">Here are some pictures from high school, the uniform.</span></p> <p><span id="s143">Q: I also wanted to ask about the Vilna ghetto.</span></p> <p><span id="s144">A: Vilna -- Vilna ghetto, yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">Q: You mention -- you told in your first interview how you had -- how it happened that you and your other -- other members of your community were gathered together and put into this -- this ghetto, after -- after the pogrom at -- at [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s146">A: The ghet -- Right before the Jewish holidays, about a month before the Jewish holidays, e-everything -- it ha -- they used to kill and -- or round up Jews, but they tried to do right before the Jewish holidays.</span> <span id="s147">And they decided to make a ghetto in the -- in Vilno.</span> <span id="s148">There was a section in the city where a lot of poor Jews lived.</span> <span id="s149">The syn -- The biggest synagogue was there.</span> <span id="s150">The Jewish home for the aged, the Jewish hospital was there and the orphanage -- Jewish orpha-orphanage was there.</span> <span id="s151">And one night they came in in -- in this place and they took out all the Jews from this -- this part of the -- of the city and they drove them to a place, Ponari.</span> <span id="s152">And we heard some screaming during the night and yelling and -- but we weren’t allowed to look out to the window what was going on.</span> <span id="s153">Those who did, they were shot.</span> <span id="s154">And -- But the next day our neighbors told us what happened, that they took away all the Jews from there and they drove them to Ponari.</span> <span id="s155">And we -- And couple weeks later, they round up all the Jews from the city and around the city, suburbs and they put us all in this place and surrounded us with walls and a gate.</span> <span id="s156">And we lived two to three families in a two room apartment.</span> <span id="s157">We didn’t have any bathrooms, we had to go outhou -- outhouses.</span> <span id="s158">One kitchen for two families, three families, can you imagine?</span> <span id="s159">And -- But we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s160">We lived -- my mother, when we got into the ghetto, she took sick and she was in the hospital.</span> <span id="s161">We took her to the hospital.</span> <span id="s162">She died on October first, in the -- in the hospital.</span> <span id="s163">We were right there and my father worked in the Jewish Judenrat, in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s164">He was still working from -- from before and he was still working there.</span></p> <p><span id="s165">Q: What was his role with the Judenrat?</span></p> <p><span id="s166">A: Whatever they gave him to work, but he -- he -- he used to work in the social department -- Social Services department.</span></p> <p><span id="s167">Q: Did you know much about what his activities were?</span></p> <p><span id="s168">A: No, no.</span> <span id="s169">I know that he took care of poor Jews and some Jewish soldiers, from before the war in Poland, they used to help them out.</span> <span id="s170">Before the holidays, they used to give them packages, food -- and for Passover, they used to make them the seder, you know, they used to -- the special holiday supper.</span> <span id="s171">And the -- they used to help out a lot that -- for Jewish people.</span></p> <p><span id="s172">Q: Did you all live together, you and your father and your sister in the same apartment?</span></p> <p><span id="s173">A: Yes, we lived in a four room apartment.</span> <span id="s174">It’s a -- a -- the -- a dining room, living room, one room.</span> <span id="s175">Two bedrooms and a kitchen.</span> <span id="s176">A kitchen was counted as a room.</span> <span id="s177">We ha -- We a -- We were lucky to have a bathroom and a bathtub in our house.</span> <span id="s178">We had to use coal or wood to warm our houses [inaudible] oven -- in the ovens, but we were lucky we had this.</span></p> <p><span id="s179">Q: What did you do on a day to day basis?</span> <span id="s180">What was your day like in the ghetto?</span></p> <p><span id="s181">A: Well, I was already 17 - 18 years old, something.</span> <span id="s182">And I didn’t go to school.</span> <span id="s183">Of course, there -- th-there were -- had schools for younger children.</span> <span id="s184">I was working in a store and selling some hot water or selling some other things in the store I worked for awhile.</span> <span id="s185">And -- And that’s all.</span> <span id="s186">My father had a suppl -- helped us out.</span> <span id="s187">My sister didn’t do anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s188">Q: She wasn’t in school?</span></p> <p><span id="s189">A: No, this -- the younger kids were in school.</span> <span id="s190">And one day when the ger -- the Lithuanian and Ukrainian police came and took away all the kids from school.</span> <span id="s191">Those kids never said -- had a chance to say goodbye to the parents.</span> <span id="s192">We were -- never saw them again.</span> <span id="s193">We used to have a theater once in awhile and they had our own police, our own fire department in the ghetto.</span> <span id="s194">We had concerts.</span> <span id="s195">Some people had good voices, they used to put up a concert to entertain, not to make life miserable, a little bit cheerful.</span> <span id="s196">We were hoping that someday maybe, maybe we will survive that.</span> <span id="s197">Cause we couldn’t believe that Germany, the most so-sophisticated, the most wonderful c-country before the war, before Hitler came, was Germany.</span> <span id="s198">And this should -- could happen, they could do those things.</span></p> <p><span id="s199">Q: Did you have any knowledge of the resistance movement in the Vilna ghetto --</span></p> <p><span id="s200">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s201">Q: -- or contacts with?</span></p> <p><span id="s202">A: I didn’t have any contact, but I -- I heard about them.</span> <span id="s203">There were a lot of -- a lot of young people.</span> <span id="s204">During the night they used to sneak out and they used to go.</span> <span id="s205">I didn’t, because I didn’t want to leave my father and my sister.</span> <span id="s206">And there were a lot of young people.</span> <span id="s207">The head of the -- this was Aba Kovner, maybe you heard about him.</span> <span id="s208">He was the head.</span> <span id="s209">He died a couple years ago, in Israel.</span> <span id="s210">He went to the same school that I went, a few years -- he was a few years older than I was.</span> <span id="s211">And there were quite a few young people who went out of the -- of the ghetto and went to the woods.</span> <span id="s212">They resist -- and they resisted.</span> <span id="s213">They were fighting.</span> <span id="s214">But it wasn’t easy for them either, because the Poles were fighting Germans and they fight -- wer f -- and -- and they were fighting the Jews, too.</span> <span id="s215">They were killing Jews also.</span> <span id="s216">The Poles, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians.</span> <span id="s217">Wherever they could find a Jew, they used to kill a Jew.</span></p> <p><span id="s218">Q: Was there a discussion in your house, in your family about that -- the contradiction, the difficulty in -- the difficult decision of resistance versus trying to get -- do the best that you could under the circumstances?</span></p> <p><span id="s219">A: No-Not that I can remember.</span> <span id="s220">I can’t remember, to tell you -- tell you the truth.</span> <span id="s221">Maybe my father was talking to some other friends between them, you know, but I can’t remem --</span></p> <p><span id="s222">Q: And -- we’re jumping around a li -- a little here, but still, just thinking of -- of filling in some of the gaps from the first interview, since you do talk about your -- how the -- well, I wanted you to -- to talk about the day that you -- that -- or the time that the ghetto was liquidated, that that order came in and that you were separated from your father and you and your sister went --</span></p> <p><span id="s223">A: Yeah.</span></p> <p><span id="s224">Q: -- towards Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s225">Do you remember the moment of separating from your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s226">A: A day before, it was right before the high holidays, a day before, they o -- they announced over the loudspeakers that we sh -- that all the Jews from the ghetto should be concentrated in front of the gates and will be resettled.</span> <span id="s227">We can take only what we can carry with us.</span> <span id="s228">We all segregated, it was the -- it wasn’t a nice day, it was a rainy day, cold, Septe -- in the September.</span> <span id="s229">It was a rainy day.</span> <span id="s230">And the next day, we’re all segrega -- we’re all -- we’re there at the gates, all went together.</span> <span id="s231">We were holding hands together.</span> <span id="s232">And we were driven to a field.</span> <span id="s233">They took away the men -- sa -- when we came, the first thing we saw, three people hanging in front of us.</span> <span id="s234">Two young men and a young woman, I can s-s-still see them in front of me.</span> <span id="s235">And they told us, in case somebody has in mind to run away, will be caught and killed in front of us, or hanged in front of us.</span> <span id="s236">They took away the men separately, a different part of the field and women and children somewhere else.</span> <span id="s237">It was a miserable, cold night.</span> <span id="s238">We said goodbye to our father and he said to -- kissed us both, wished us good luck.</span> <span id="s239">And that’s -- and we went to the field and he went to his side.</span> <span id="s240">He was taken to Estonia and there they burned them alive.</span> <span id="s241">Put logs -- people and logs and burned them alive.</span> <span id="s242">Quite a few years ago, we were in Israel and in a kibbutz, Lachaima agetta ot, there is a s-survivor’s kibbutz.</span> <span id="s243">All this -- a lot of the s-survivors live there.</span> <span id="s244">And there is a museum about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s245">And we were walking around.</span> <span id="s246">Our daughter and her husband and two children were with us.</span> <span id="s247">And we were walking around there, we were looking and I saw pictures from this concentration camp.</span> <span id="s248">And we saw how the men were lying on the logs.</span> <span id="s249">And at this -- on this side were handwritten, beautifully, beautifully handwritten, their names and their number, and I found my father’s name there.</span> <span id="s250">My t -- My daughter had a camera, she took a picture of that.</span> <span id="s251">And --</span></p> <p><span id="s252">Q: What was the name of the camp where your father was killed?</span></p> <p><span id="s253">A: Klooga, I think.</span> <span id="s254">In Estonia.</span> <span id="s255">And we were sitting the whole night in this field.</span> <span id="s256">It was a miserable, miserable cold night, rainy night.</span> <span id="s257">Whenever a child cried, they -- one of the soldiers used to take away the child from the mother and take it for their feet and tear them in half like this and throw them back to the mother.</span> <span id="s258">And some mother, from fright, used to kill their own children.</span> <span id="s259">Didn’t know what to do.</span> <span id="s260">They’d kill -- some mother killed their own children, in fright.</span> <span id="s261">This was going on like that, the whole night.</span> <span id="s262">And the next morning, we had to stay in line and be sorted.</span> <span id="s263">I was lucky enough, with my sister, we went to the right.</span> <span id="s264">And some other of my cousins went to the left.</span> <span id="s265">We never saw them again.</span> <span id="s266">I don’t know where they went, to Majdan -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</span></p> <p><span id="s267">Q: This is tape number one, side B, of an interview with Rochelle Slivka.</span></p> <p><span id="s268">A: And then we were sorted and we were put on -- on the cattle cars, 100 women to a car, without food, without bathrooms, without water.</span> <span id="s269">And taken to the -- and driven to the concentration camp in Latvia, Kaiserwald.</span> <span id="s270">Some women tried to escape, they tried to sneak out through the windows -- th-the small windows.</span> <span id="s271">Whoever -- some got killed, some got shot.</span> <span id="s272">Nobody survived, whoever tried to run away.</span></p> <p><span id="s273">Q: When you said a little earlier -- you were talking about your father and -- and how h -- how he had been burned alive at this camp, did you -- when did you learn about this?</span></p> <p><span id="s274">A: I learned in the -- before they liquidated -- i-in -- I think in Stutthof, I learned.</span> <span id="s275">I met a women there who was in this camp, but she survived somehow.</span> <span id="s276">Or sh -- I don’t know how she did and she -- she told me.</span> <span id="s277">She knew my father and she told me about it.</span> <span id="s278">That’s how I knew.</span> <span id="s279">In Stutthof.</span></p> <p><span id="s280">Q: Had you -- Did that -- I -- You described how much your -- your outlook was disrupted from very early o-on, before the war even started, but after you heard about the death of your father, did that change your -- your outlook?</span> <span id="s281">Had you -- Had you been hopeful, or were you still hopeful at all?</span> <span id="s282">Did you think there were --</span></p> <p><span id="s283">A: I -- We lived from day to day.</span> <span id="s284">We didn’t know what’s going to be tomorrow.</span> <span id="s285">We stuck together.</span> <span id="s286">This -- My sister and myself.</span> <span id="s287">We met a girlfriend of ours, she used to be our neighbor, years, years ago.</span> <span id="s288">And she didn’t have anybody.</span> <span id="s289">She came over to us and she says, “I am alone.</span> <span id="s290">I would like you -- to be a third sister to you.</span> <span id="s291">You -- Maybe it will help me to -- to overcome some things.”</span> <span id="s292">I says, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s293">We said, “Sure.”</span> <span id="s294">And we all stuck together.</span> <span id="s295">And we all liberated together.</span> <span id="s296">And -- And we lived from life to li -- from day to day and we were ho -- I -- I was still hoping that maybe someday I’ll survive and I’ll be able to tell the world what was happening.</span> <span id="s297">And not to let that happen again to anybody.</span> <span id="s298">Doesn’t matter if you’re a Jew or a -- a Pole or a Gypsy or a f -- whoever you are, we are all human being.</span> <span id="s299">Doesn’t matter the color, you are green or blue or white or gr -- or black.</span> <span id="s300">We are human beings.</span> <span id="s301">And treat everybody like a human being.</span> <span id="s302">At the time we didn’t know about the gay people, you know, we were -- it wasn’t so popular at the time and we didn’t -- we were young enough not to know about those things.</span> <span id="s303">But, we are all people.</span> <span id="s304">It’s their lives, it’s up to them how they live.</span> <span id="s305">And it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s306">Some women couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s307">They used to sneak out during the night to the barb -- electrified wires and touch the wires and kill themself.</span> <span id="s308">And some -- We were like animals.</span> <span id="s309">We were happy that somebody died in front -- near us.</span> <span id="s310">We could have their clothes, their rags to cover out feet, not to be -- we didn’t have any shoes, to keep warm.</span> <span id="s311">We were like animals.</span> <span id="s312">The Germans treated us like animals.</span> <span id="s313">They treated their dogs better than us.</span> <span id="s314">It wasn’t easy.</span></p> <p><span id="s315">Q: And then -- You describe in your other -- in your first interview of course, how you went from Kaiserwald to Stutthof and then there was a -- a forced march.</span></p> <p><span id="s316">A: [indecipherable] long march, yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s317">Q: Let’s go ahead to -- to the time that you were liberated and you described seeing a truck full of Russian --</span></p> <p><span id="s318">A: Russian soldiers.</span></p> <p><span id="s319">Q: -- soldiers coming along.</span> <span id="s320">C-Can -- Can you go into that moment and recall what you were feeling then or what the atmosphere was on that day?</span></p> <p><span id="s321">A: I’ll tell you, as far as I can remember, we were so numb, that when they told us the war is over in this part of Germany and we can go wherever we want -- we want to go, we couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s322">We were skeletons.</span> <span id="s323">We had the fr-frostbitten feet, frostbitten hands.</span> <span id="s324">We couldn’t do anything.</span> <span id="s325">And they saw that we can’t do anything and they send in a truck and they took us into a village and where we came into the village, they let us loose.</span> <span id="s326">Nobody was in the village, because it -- the Germans went back -- th -- retreated with the other ger -- with the German army, they didn’t want to fall into the Russians.</span> <span id="s327">And we were like animals.</span> <span id="s328">We grabbed anything, whatever we could find to eat.</span> <span id="s329">We grabbed any -- any clothes, whatever we could find and some women overate and some died from overeating, because they couldn’t take it any more.</span> <span id="s330">Our stomachs couldn’t take.</span> <span id="s331">We were sick there for awhile, but after awhile we got better.</span> <span id="s332">We had to wash ourselves in kerosene every day, to get rid of the lice and change our -- burn our clothes.</span> <span id="s333">And after a couple of months later, my sister, myself, decided to go back to the city of Vilno.</span> <span id="s334">I didn’t want to go back to Vilno, because I didn’t know -- I knew that nobody’s alive, but my sister insisted to go back.</span> <span id="s335">When we came on the bo -- to the border between Poland -- it’s Soviet Union then -- and Poland -- Lithuania was under the Soviet Union, and -- and Poland -- we met some people who are coming out from -- from Russia there, they told us, “Don’t go, it’s no -- the situation is no good and it’s very bad,” and everything.</span> <span id="s336">I decided I wouldn’t go, but my sister insisted she wants to go and she wants -- maybe she can get from our Polish neighbors, some clothes, or furniture, whatever we left with them.</span> <span id="s337">We left a lot of things wi -- you know, a household, you had a lot of things in the house.</span> <span id="s338">And when she came to their houses, they didn’t give her back anything, they threw her out.</span> <span id="s339">And I -- meantime, I registered in the Jewish paper, in Poland there, in Bialystok.</span> <span id="s340">And I put an ad in the paper that I’m looking for my relatives in Boston, by the name of Schuman.</span> <span id="s341">I didn’t remember my aunt’s na -- last names.</span> <span id="s342">And my grandmother used to li -- read the Jewish paper every day and she found my name and she notified all the children that I am alive.</span> <span id="s343">And a couple weeks later, I received a letter from one of my uncles, who lived in Pittsfield, Maine here.</span> <span id="s344">He was the only Jew there.</span> <span id="s345">And he encouraged me to go to west Germany and from there, they’ll -- to the American zone, and from there they’ll try to bring me to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s346">Q: What was his name, your uncle?</span></p> <p><span id="s347">A: Schuman, Joseph Schuman.</span> <span id="s348">He was -- He was very close to Margaret Chase-Smith, if you remember Margaret Chase.</span> <span id="s349">It’s before your time.</span> <span id="s350">She was a senator here, in the United -- here, in Maine.</span> <span id="s351">A Republican.</span></p> <p><span id="s352">Q: Did you feel any sense -- any shift -- did you feel that you had been liberated?</span></p> <p><span id="s353">A: I felt I was liberated.</span> <span id="s354">I felt I -- I -- I was guilty that I was liberated and the rest of the family not -- nobody survived.</span> <span id="s355">I felt very guilty.</span> <span id="s356">I -- I had problems with that.</span> <span id="s357">But I couldn’t help anything.</span> <span id="s358">They had to be like that and specially with my sister left and I was all alone.</span> <span id="s359">And I went -- and I wrote back to my uncle that I am -- he wanted to know if I am this and this, the same -- the same Rochelle Blerchman, my first name was, at the time.</span> <span id="s360">And I wrote him exactly my mother’s name, my father’s name and th-that I remembered my grandfa-father’s name, my grandmother’s name.</span> <span id="s361">And I remembered the -- some other uncle’s names.</span> <span id="s362">And I identified myself who I was and I wrote him about what happened to us.</span> <span id="s363">And -- And then we tried -- I tried with other groups to go back from Poland to Germany.</span> <span id="s364">It wasn’t easy, but we went back to -- we had to cross the borders illegally.</span> <span id="s365">And we went to Czechoslovakia, from Czechoslovakia, we went to west Germany.</span> <span id="s366">There, I took sick And I was in the hospital, in the sanitorium for awhile.</span> <span id="s367">And I got in touch with my uncles again and they helped me.</span> <span id="s368">My aunts used to send me clothes, they send me cigarettes, I started to smoke.</span> <span id="s369">And they send me to sell it -- you know, they didn’t know that I smoked or not, but they send me cigarettes.</span> <span id="s370">They couldn’t send me any money, but they send me clo -- a lot of clothes.</span> <span id="s371">And th-they send me a lot of stuff.</span> <span id="s372">Some canned goods.</span></p> <p><span id="s373">Q: How did it happen that you and your sister separated?</span> <span id="s374">She wanted to go to Vilna?</span></p> <p><span id="s375">A: She wanted to go back to Vilno, to get from the Po -- from the Poles.</span> <span id="s376">They didn’t give her back anything, they threw her out of the house.</span> <span id="s377">And at the time, after while, they closed the border between Poland and -- and the Soviet Union, she couldn’t get out any more, and we lost contact all together.</span> <span id="s378">We didn’t hear from each other for -- for a long, long time, unti -- from 1946-’47 -- ‘46, ‘45-’46, until hit -- Stalin died.</span> <span id="s379">After Stalin died, I wrote a letter to Vilno, to the Jewish Community Center and I asked them that I’m looking for a sister by the name and this and this name.</span> <span id="s380">And -- And I’d -- can’t find her address, will they please try to look up to find her?</span> <span id="s381">And they did find her and they gave her my address and si -- we started to write each other.</span> <span id="s382">And at the time, she wa -- got married a-and she had a child and I encouraged her to get out of there.</span> <span id="s383">I couldn’t tell her get out of pol -- to go -- get out of Russia.</span> <span id="s384">I used to say, “Go to visit Aunt Pauline” -- that Poland, “and from there, you’ll go to see Uncle Israel” -- to -- to go to Israel.</span> <span id="s385">And when she came to Poland, I spo -- I called her on the pay station and she had to go to the post office there and she waited for my call.</span> <span id="s386">I wrote her when I -- when I’ll call her.</span> <span id="s387">It’s the first time I got in contact with her by talking to her.</span> <span id="s388">And believe me, it was a very hard time, because I started to mix in English words, and -- and it was our ho -- but we talked, a little bit.</span> <span id="s389">And from then on, she went -- she went to Israel.</span> <span id="s390">She didn’t want to come back here, she didn’t want to go anywhere else any more.</span> <span id="s391">So she said she had enough.</span> <span id="s392">She wants to go to Israel and settle there, her husband, too.</span> <span id="s393">And they went to Israel and she lives there now.</span> <span id="s394">Her husband -- about five years ago, he was killed in a car accident.</span> <span id="s395">And she has two daughters, grandchildren.</span> <span id="s396">She lives in Israel.</span></p> <p><span id="s397">Q: Are you still very close?</span></p> <p><span id="s398">A: Oh yeah, we s -- we talk to each other on the telephone.</span> <span id="s399">And whenever we go to Israel, we see each other very often.</span></p> <p><span id="s400">Q: Do you go to Israel --</span></p> <p><span id="s401">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s402">Q: -- fairly often?</span></p> <p><span id="s403">A: Yeah, we go practically every year, sometimes twice a year -- we used to, because we have that -- we have a daughter there and we have si -- four grandchildren.</span> <span id="s404">Don’t have any choice, have to go to see.</span> <span id="s405">And the last time we were there, last January, our grandson was bar mitzvah there, we went there.</span> <span id="s406">And this year, we’re not going, because our grandson, in Louisiana, in January, is going to be bar mitzvah, then we are bringing them here.</span> <span id="s407">I don’t know if my older granddaughter will be able to come.</span> <span id="s408">She is registered to go to the army and I don’t know if they’ll let her out or not, but they’ll try to and they’re coming to the bar mitzvah for two weeks.</span> <span id="s409">And we’re looking forward to see them again.</span> <span id="s410">We are going to Florida the 11th and then we’re -- for Thanksgiving, we’re going to New Orleans, to our daughter.</span> <span id="s411">Usually they used to come to Florida for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but this year their daughter is going to DisneyWorld, or she’s going to New York, I don’t know, with a group from school, then she won’t be back on time, then we decided we’ll go for Thanksgiving there and for Christmas vacation, they’ll come, probably, to port -- to Florida, to visit us.</span></p> <p><span id="s412">Q: You travel around a lot, it sounds like.</span></p> <p><span id="s413">A: Not an -- not as much as we used to.</span> <span id="s414">You’re getting older, you don’t have the strength any more.</span> <span id="s415">We used to drive to Florida.</span> <span id="s416">We used to drive to -- to New Orleans all the time, but it’s getting harder.</span> <span id="s417">We used to change drivers all the time.</span> <span id="s418">Couple hours my husband will drive, I’ll -- will drive an hour or so.</span> <span id="s419">Used to take time, but we do the best we can, try the best we can and that’s all, to live a normal life.</span> <span id="s420">Believe me, it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s421">When I came to this country, I didn’t know anybody, didn’t know my relatives.</span> <span id="s422">They did -- They were very, very good to me, specially my aunt in Brookline, Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s423">She opened her house for me.</span> <span id="s424">She was like a mother to me.</span> <span id="s425">And her children -- when I came to this, they were sitting and waiting on the stairs for me to come.</span> <span id="s426">I came by boat and the parents went to pick me up.</span> <span id="s427">And my cousin, he says, “Oh, I have another sister to beat up.</span> <span id="s428">You will be my cookie.”</span> <span id="s429">He used to -- He didn’t call me by my name, he called me ‘Cookie’.</span> <span id="s430">He was a very nice boy.</span> <span id="s431">Then graduated, got married, moved to Chicago.</span> <span id="s432">But unfortunately, he died very young, of cancer.</span> <span id="s433">They didn’t diagnosed him right.</span> <span id="s434">He was 51 years old when he died, cancer.</span> <span id="s435">But I’m -- We’re still close with his wife.</span> <span id="s436">She remarried, but we are close.</span> <span id="s437">They are cousins.</span></p> <p><span id="s438">Q: You lived in Germany before you came to the United States.</span></p> <p><span id="s439">A: Well, we -- I lived -- I was in the sanitorium for a couple of year -- for -- for awhile.</span> <span id="s440">After I got better, I got a letter from one of my uncles from Dover, New Hampshire, I had a-an uncle, too.</span> <span id="s441">And he told me that his son -- he was a doctor, he was in the same hospital where I was, in the army there.</span> <span id="s442">When I went -- When I got the letter, I went to look for him and -- and a day before, he left for the United States.</span> <span id="s443">The letter came a day too late.</span> <span id="s444">Anyway, after I got better, I decided to go back to school.</span> <span id="s445">I learned a profession, nursing.</span> <span id="s446">I liked always, nursing.</span> <span id="s447">And after I graduated the nursing, I worked in a -- in Landsberg, in Germany, in a DP hospital.</span></p> <p><span id="s448">Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about what it was like to be in school again?</span> <span id="s449">Was this a --</span></p> <p><span id="s450">A: It --</span></p> <p><span id="s451">Q: I-In Germany, especially.</span></p> <p><span id="s452">A: I-I-It -- It wasn’t too bad.</span> <span id="s453">It -- We took courses.</span> <span id="s454">They taught us how to give injections, how to -- I don’t remember exactly how -- how exactly it was.</span> <span id="s455">My memory’s not as good as it used to be.</span> <span id="s456">And I -- But I took up and I worked in the hospital there, in Landsberg, in a DP hospital.</span> <span id="s457">And then after awhile, I went -- moved to M-Munich and I worked in a office there, because it was -- and from there, they -- I got an affidavit from one of my uncles that he is taking all the full responsibility of me, that I won’t be a burden to the United States and to come to the United States.</span> <span id="s458">When I come to the United States on affidavit th-they sent me, I was interviewed by the CIA.</span> <span id="s459">Everything went fine.</span> <span id="s460">They told me in a couple of weeks, they’ll call me to go to the doctors and from there, I’ll go to the -- to -- will be sent to Bremen and from there, I’ll go to the United States.</span> <span id="s461">I was waiting and waiting and waiting and I never -- they never called me.</span> <span id="s462">I went to ask what was happening, why -- they told me I was crossed off the list that I’m in the United States already.</span> <span id="s463">Somebody else probably bribed somebody, they sent away somebody else.</span> <span id="s464">Anyway, they didn’t like that, because they were afraid that the -- that I’ll make a -- sue them or something.</span> <span id="s465">Then they told me that -- the next day to go through some doctors and in a couple of days, there was a transport going to Bremenhoffen -- to brem -- to -- and from there, I’ll go to the United States.</span> <span id="s466">And when I came to Bremenhoffen, the j -- American consul couldn’t make up his mind if I am a Polish citizen or a Lithuanian citizen.</span> <span id="s467">Then I had to stay there again, for weeks -- for six weeks and waited.</span> <span id="s468">I got tired and I didn’t feel like staying in the barracks any more.</span> <span id="s469">People were going away and I -- every day some other people used to come.</span> <span id="s470">Then I sent a telegram to one of my uncles -- to my uncle in Pittsfield, that if I can’t go to the United States, I’ll turn around and I’ll go back to Israel.</span> <span id="s471">Two days later, I get a call from the Joint Distribution in Bremenhoffen, that the next day, two boats are going to the United States, one to Boston, one to New York and I’ll be ba -- I’ll be on the boat to Boston.</span> <span id="s472">Sure enough, the next day, the -- th-the next few days I went on the boat -- to the boat to Boston.</span> <span id="s473">They asked me, “Are you going to Massachusetts?”</span> <span id="s474">I says, “No, I’m not going to Massachusetts, I’m going to Boston.”</span> <span id="s475">I didn’t know the difference.</span> <span id="s476">How would I know where -- I saw on the map Boston here, and Portland here -- I had an aunt here in Portland -- and I saw por -- this was Portland, Oregon.</span> <span id="s477">I didn’t know Portland, Maine or por -- Boston, Massachusetts or anything.</span> <span id="s478">I says, “Oh, my God, they live so far away from each other.”</span> <span id="s479">That -- I had an aunt here in Portland, Maine, around the corner.</span></p> <p><span id="s480">Q: Before you -- we get on the ship

id="s506">A: I-It was -- We were trying to get to normal, to -- like, to be like normal people, but it wasn’t easy.</span> <span id="s507">There were a lot of sick people.</span> <span id="s508">They’re all DP’s, Displaced Persons.</span> <span id="s509">That was a only for Displaced Person’s hospital.</span> <span id="s510">And it wasn’t easy, but we did the best we could, we tried to do the -- help th -- each other, the patients and the nurses and everybody.</span> <span id="s511">And it wasn’t easy, because we were all mixed up.</span> <span id="s512">We didn’t know what’s what, what’s -- if -- if it’s the right thing, or the -- not the right thing or what.</span> <span id="s513">People were on the boat and we were going on the -- on the boat.</span> <span id="s514">They said, oh, they are lucky, they are going to relatives and they will be so good, and this and that and they were telling how wonderful and everything.</span> <span id="s515">I didn’t say anything, because I didn’t know my relatives.</span> <span id="s516">I’d -- couldn’t say if they will be good to me or not good to me.</span> <span id="s517">I -- I couldn’t say.</span> <span

it turn out that my relatives were very, very, very good to me.</span> <span id="s522">My cousins, my aunts, my uncles were very good to me.</span> <span id="s523">And I was in contact for awhile with the other refugees when -- with whom I came to -- they were very disappointed.</span> <span id="s524">The relatives weren’t good.</span></p> <p><span id="s525">Q: Can you say more about that?</span>

what to do.</span> <span id="s534">I didn’t know -- I -- I -- I couldn’t picture anything, I couldn’t see.</span> <span id="s535">If it’s true or not, I couldn’t -- I couldn’t realize that.</span> <span id="s536">But came -- they took me off the boat and I went to -- went through all the thing -- you know, they ask me what I have with me and if I am sick or not sick.</span> <span id="s537">You know, if -- all -- all kind of questions [indecipherable] went by.</span> <span id="s538">Everything was fine.</span> <span id="s539">They took me to the -- to their house -- my aunt in Brookline and I lived there for awhile.</span> <span id="s540">In the summer, I used to come to Portland, to Maine.</span> <span id="s541">I had an aunt and uncle here.</span> <span id="s542">My -- My uncles used to come to visit me and take them to their houses.</span> <span id="s543">My uncle [indecipherable], he was a rich man, but other ones weren’t too rich, but they made a living, they had -- but I’m still close with my cousins from port -- and my aunt from -- from Massachusetts.</span> <span id="s544">My uncle -- she is still alive, he is not.</span> <span id="s545">And one son died and then one daughter, she sta -- still is -- 65 years old now, she had a stroke and she is in a home, she can’t talk.</span> <span id="s546">And it’s hard when we go to see her.</span> <span id="s547">Every time we go to Boston, we go to visit her, she’s in a home -- nurs -- in a nursing home.</span> <span id="s548">64 years old, that’s a young woman.</span></p> <p><span id="s549">End of Tape One, Side B

id="s555">Even I see now a -- a waterbed, I get seasick, nevermind now a boat.</span> <span id="s556">I’m afraid to go on a boat.</span> <span id="s557">I get seasick.</span> <span id="s558">There is a restaurant here, u-up -- on a boat, on the water and I -- it was a long time I didn’t go there.</span> <span id="s559">I was afraid to go there.</span> <span id="s560">But I went, couple times and it wasn’t bad, it was all right.</span> <span id="s561">Because it’s standing, you know, it’s not moving around.</span> <span id="s562">But if I si -- I -- even when I see a sa -- a -- a waterbed, I

to a hotel there and I asked her where this and that.</span> <span id="s594">It was entirely different, very, very run down.</span> <span id="s595">And after dinner, my husband and my daughter took a walk.</span> <span id="s596">I knew where the -- the hotel was, because it was o-on -- on the main street.</span> <span id="s597">And we went, looked around and looked around.</span> <span id="s598">I didn’t recognized a lot of things, but after awhile, everything came back to me.</span> <span id="s599">I saw my father’s -- where my father’s office was, but there wasn’t a building any more.</span> <span id="s600">Then there was a park.</span> <span id="s601">Then mise -- where I si -- lived, the street was all blocked up and yi -- broken up.</span> <span id="s602">The house where we lived, it was not there any more.</span> <span id="s603">They warned us not to go too late, it’s too dangerous to go at night.</span> <span id="s604">Then we came back right to the -- back to the -- but the next morning, right in the morning, right after breakfast, we went to look ta -- look around.</span> <span id="s605">And I went -- where I went -- where I used -- where -- went to the street, to the school where I went to school, to the high school.</span> <span id="s606">There -- There was the Jewish Community Center there, there wasn’t a school.</span> <span id="s607">But it was very run down.</span> <span id="s608">The streets -- it was run down, it -- and then we went t-to si -- the st-street where I was born, the houses.</span> <span id="s609">It -- It looked horrible.</span> <span id="s610">It hurt very, very much.</span> <span id="s611">We -- We had a guide th-that was my brother-in-law’s nephew, he still lives in Lithuan -- in Vilnius and he took us around everywhere.</span> <span id="s612">He had a car, because he worked for a oil company.</span></p> <p><span id="s613">Q: Is he Jewish?</span></p> <p><span id="s614">A: He is Jewish, but he was married to a non-Jew.</span> <span id="s615">And he lived there and he took us around, i-in places.</span> <span id="s616">We went to Ponari, it was very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s617">I was so -- we were there for two days.</span> <span id="s618">I was very sick.</span> <span id="s619">The ghetto where I was -- the ghetto -- where the ghetto was, it’s so broken up, it’s so horrible.</span> <span id="s620">I saw the

synagogue -- the main synagogue wasn’t there any more, it bombed.</span> <span id="s628">There is another synagogue, but it was b-boarded up.</span> <span id="s629">Was in bad condition, but I understand there is -- they’re going to rebuild, fix it up.</span> <span id="s630">We wanted to go to the cemetery where my mother was buried, but they told us there isn’t a cemetery there any more, there’s a park.</span> <span id="s631">But there is coming a man, th -- head from the Jewish Community Center says to me -- told me, there is coming a man -- he didn’t tell me the name and he didn’t tell me from where, he is coming and he is going to put -- put up a big monument.</span> <span id="s632">They found some tombstones.</span> <span id="s633">[indecipherable] tombstones and another monument right there, near the -- near the park now, they’ll put up that it was a cemetery and all the Jews -- some Jews were buried there, who lived from before the -- before the war.</span> <span id="s634">It was a very, very, very emotional.</span> <span id="s635">Very e -- I -- I was sick for -- for weeks afterwards.</span> <span id="s636">And -- And we hope -- our older daughter from New -- New Orleans was with us.</span> <span id="s637">We want our other daughter to come with us next time.</span> <span id="s638">We hope to go maybe next summer, to take our other daughter from Israel and maybe my two granddaughters.</span></p> <p><span id="s639">Q: Did it have a big effect on your daughter, to see that?</span></p> <p><span id="s640">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s641">But -- And I wanted

<span id="s644">They don’t s -- I don’t speak Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s645">They -- A lot of the people, they speak Russian.</span> <span id="s646">They don’t want to speak Polish any more.</span> <span id="s647">There a lo -- There was a Polish city, Vilno.</span> <span id="s648">They speak Russian.</span> <span id="s649">Some of them.</span> <span id="s650">they speak Lithuanian.</span> <span id="s651">I don’t know how to speak Lithuanian, because it was a hard language and I didn’t learn, even.</span> <span id="s652">They wa -- in Vilno for a couple of months only, then the Soviet Union took over again.</span> <span id="s653">And, it was very emotional, but it was worthwhile going and I would like to go again, to show my other daughter.</span></p> <p><span id="s654">Q: But you didn’t -- I gather you didn’t feel that it was -- that it was really home, that --</span></p> <p><span id="s655">A: Not at home.</span> <span id="s656">I felt very cold there.</span> <span id="s657">It was in ma -- i-it was in July, I think.</span> <span id="s658">June or July.</span> <span id="s659">June, I think.</span> <span id="s660">Anyway, it was a cold, it -- it’s -- I -- I felt very uncomfortable there.</span> <span id="s661">I -- I -- I was amazed how it looked.</span> <span id="s662">It was such a beautiful city.</span> <span id="s663">It was a cultural city.</span> <span id="s664">It had a university.</span> <span id="s665">It had high schools, it had private high schools.</span> <span id="s666">It had a Polish pa -- to -- Jewish Polish high schools.</span> <span id="s667">A hebe -- two Hebrew high schools, a Yiddish high school.</span> <span id="s668">Had a Russian high school.</span> <span id="s669">I-It was a very cultural city.</span> <span id="s670">It has a seminar for teachers.</span> <span id="s671">A-A-And now it was nothing.</span> <span id="s672">It was hurting very much.</span> <span id="s673">It was -- this -- the main street, it was such a beautiful street, called Mitskaveetcha at the time.</span> <span id="s674">I don’t know -- I don’t remember how it’s called now.</span> <span id="s675">And when we were in the hotel -- I knew there was a hotel, but this wasn’t the hotel I -- and I asked her, I said, “Ther-There was a hotel in here, but I don’t think this is the hotel, sh -- a-and -- there was,” -- she says, “No, this was a high school.</span> <span id="s676">My father owned the high school, it was a Russian high school.”</span> <span id="s677">This secretary told.</span> <span id="s678">I-It -- You know, it’s -- it hurt, a lot of things, you know, how it felt.</span> <span id="s679">But, we did the best we could.</span> <span id="s680">And we came back, stayed in Poland another day and we came ho -- came home.</span> <span id="s681">And I’ll tell you one thing, as soon we came to -- back to -- to the United States, I said thank God.</span></p> <p><span id="s682">Q: So you feel -- Do you feel at home here?</span></p> <p><span id="s683">A: Yes.</span> <span id="s684">That’s my home.</span></p> <p><span id="s685">Q: Did -- How long did it take you to feel that this was your home?</span></p> <p><span id="s686">A: After I came, I started -- I did my best to make up my mind this is my home.</span> <span id="s687">It is my home, because I lived in Poland only for se -- for 17 years.</span> <span id="s688">I was born, then I was in the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s689">And since 1949, I am here.</span> <span id="s690">This is my home.</span> <span id="s691">It’s the longest time there ever I -- I lived, that the United State, that’s my home, my country.</span></p> <p><span id="s692">Q: But you made up your mind even soon after you arrived here that that’s -- that this was where your home was going to be?</span></p> <p><span id="s693">A: Yeah, yeah.</span> <span id="s694">I didn’t think about anywhere else.</span></p> <p><span id="s695">Q: How -- So your fa -- you lived in -- in Massachusetts then, for --</span></p> <p><span id="s696">A: I lived in -- from 1949 until 1953, we lived -- I lived in Massachu -- in Boston.</span> <span id="s697">In -- I lived with my aunt and uncle until 1952 -- until I was married.</span> <span id="s698">I was ma -- I met my husband in 1951, on a blind date.</span> <span id="s699">The kids ask me, after I si -- and finish speaki -- an ta -- and telling them about my troubles and all my life history, they says, “Where did you meet your husband?”</span> <span id="s700">I tell them on a blind date.</span> <span id="s701">They laugh.</span> <span id="s702">They can’t believe that older people had th-the blind dates.</span> <span id="s703">Anyway, on a blind date and in 1952, we were married.</span> <span id="s704">And we lived in Boston for awhile and then we -- he got a job here, as an accountant.</span></p> <p><span id="s705">Q: Who set you up in -- on your blind date, with --</span></p> <p><span id="s706">A: My sister-in-law’s aunt, at the time.</span> <span id="s707">She -- I knew her from Germany [indecipherable].</span> <span id="s708">I had -- My girlfriend’s mother-in-law and she, they were in the hospital together.</span> <span id="s709">This -- Bed to bed, they were lying there.</span> <span id="s710">And I used to go to visit my girl -- with my girlfriend.</span> <span id="s711">Then I met her there and when she came to the United States, and me -- I saw her a couple times and then she introduced me to Jerry.</span></p> <p><span id="s712">Q: Do you remember anything about that first date?</span> <span id="s713">What you talked about?</span></p> <p><span id="s714">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s715">Q: Did you talk together in your early days about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p> <p><span id="s716">A: No.</span></p> <p><span id="s717">Q: Did you know that about each other?</span></p> <p><span id="s718">A: No.</span> <span id="s719">I started to talk about the Holocaust, in -- when they showed the first time, the movie “Holocaust”.</span> <span id="s720">After that, they called me -- a girl -- a -- a friend of ours, ca -- they called her, she should speak about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s721">She says she never was in the Holocaust, but she knows somebody who speaks ab -- who was in the Holocaust, I never spoke at the time.</span> <span id="s722">And she says, “I’ll call her and I’ll ask her if she could talk to you.”</span> <span id="s723">She called me, I said, “Fine.”</span> <span id="s724">It was, I think, in 1978, or something like that.</span> <span id="s725">And when I came to the school, the principal says to me, “You talk as long as you can, because there won’t be any questions.”</span> <span id="s726">I says, “I’ll talk as much as I can.”</span> <span id="s727">And that -- When I fin -- First of all, when I was talking, it was so quiet, you could hear a fly go by.</span> <span id="s728">Th-The girl -- The kids were sitting like this.</span> <span id="s729">And then I says, “I’ll take some questions,” and I’ll -- I answered as m-many as I could questions.</span> <span id="s730">If I had more time -- I had 250 kids at the time.</span> <span id="s731">If I had more time, they would ask me more questions, because I had to wait another half an hour or so -- another session, 250 kids to talk about -- to talk about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s732">Kids came over to touch me, if I am real.</span> <span id="s733">And since then, I’m talking -- didn’t stop talking yet.</span></p> <p><span id="s734">Q: I -- I imagine it would have been very difficult to talk that first time.</span></p> <p><span id="s735">A: It is -- It was.</span> <span id="s736">I was shaking like this.</span> <span id="s737">But, I got used to it.</span> <span id="s738">I talk -- It hurts, it -- everything comes in front of me, but I told you, I used to get a cigarette.</span> <span id="s739">Now, I don’t smoke.</span> <span id="s740">But still, I do my best.</span> <span id="s741">I talk to schools, I talk to teachers.</span> <span id="s742">In Bates College, they have every year some teacher’s conventions.</span> <span id="s743">I talk to them -- I talk to -- teach them about the Holocaust.</span> <span id="s744">And I spoke a few years ago, in Caribou, for 900 students.</span> <span id="s745">High school and university and wherever they ask me, I go.</span></p> <p><span id="s746">Q: Why did it happen that you didn’t talk until the late 1970’s?</span> <span id="s747">Were you not ready, or were people not interested?</span></p> <p><span id="s748">A: They never asked me.</span> <span id="s749">I don’t think they -- they -- they kn-knew about.</span> <span id="s750">They knew about the Holocaust, but they never were interested, I guess, until they saw on television and they st -- de-decided to teach the kids, to let them know what was going on.</span> <span id="s751">Not to happen -- what the hatred means.</span></p> <p><span id="s752">Q: Was it difficult for you, those years of not talking about it?</span></p> <p><span id="s753">A: I didn’t think about it.</span> <span id="s754">I did -- never thought about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s755">Q: So, your family didn’t -- didn’t ask you about it, either?</span></p> <p><span id="s756">A: They u-used to ask me a question here, a question there, but they weren’t interested so much.</span> <span id="s757">The people weren’t interested in the beginning.</span> <span id="s758">Now, they are more interested than it used to be.</span> <span id="s759">Especially -- you know who are interested?</span> <span id="s760">Junior high school kids.</span> <span id="s761">They are more interested than the high school kids.</span> <span id="s762">They ask a lot of questions.</span> <span id="s763">High school kids are afraid to ask in case it’s the wrong question, the other kids will laugh at him.</span> <span id="s764">They will make fun of him -- of them.</span> <span id="s765">But the junior high, they don’t give a damn.</span> <span id="s766">They ask -- whatever it comes in -- in their mind, they ask.</span> <span id="s767">I do my best I can and I try.</span> <span id="s768">Spoke to churches, spoke to university.</span></p> <p><span id="s769">Q: So you said that during those years before you started speaking, that your experiences weren’t so much on your mind.</span> <span id="s770">What was on your mind?</span> <span id="s771">What was important to you then?</span></p> <p><span id="s772">A: Life, from day to day, to bring up the kids.</span> <span id="s773">I was busy with the children.</span> <span id="s774">They were small.</span> <span id="s775">And I’m a -- I was a housewife.</span> <span id="s776">And that’s all.</span> <span id="s777">And then, after they went into school, last year I spoke to -- in -- in the -- in a high school where my kids went and the teachers kno -- knew my kids.</span></p> <p><span id="s778">Q: What -- What did you want your children to learn?</span> <span id="s779">Did you have ideas about them -- something that was -- you

<p><span id="s899">A: No.</span> <span id="s900">No, I did not.</span> <span id="s901">Stutthof, at the time, we didn’t have enough time.</span> <span id="s902">We had only for 12 days -- and not even 12 -- yeah, about 12, maybe -- maybe 10 -- fo -- I think for eight days now.</span> <span id="s903">And we want -- we had to cover everything.</span> <span id="s904">We didn’t have the time, but I hope when next time we’ll go, I would like to go to Stutthof, to see the concentration camp.</span> <span id="s905">Kaiserwald is in a different country all together.</span> <span id="s906">It’s in

<p><span id="s913">A: The first time we were in Israel, in 1965, we went to Israel for the summer.</span> <span id="s914">And in 1963, my sister and her two children came to the United States.</span> <span id="s915">And we didn’t see each other for 18 years.</span> <span id="s916">We didn’t recognize each other, but we went to the boat to New York to pick her up, but we had a cousin who lived in New York and she was in Israel before and she met her.</span> <span id="s917">Then she came with us to the boat and she pointed out who sh -- who is that, and she stayed with us for the whole summer.</span> <span id="s918">And in 1965, we were -- the child -- Je-Jerry couldn’t go away for the whole summer, but th-the children and me went for the summer and he came there for three weeks, he had the vacation.</span></p> <p><span id="s919">Q: What was it like to see your sister again after 18 years?</span></p> <p><span id="s920">A: It was very emotional and it was -- it was hard, it -- we had a lot to talk, we talked about old times and -- and the time in -- in the Soviet Union how she was and she told me a story.</span> <span id="s921">My f-father had he-her -- his mother -- my grandmother, and he had some brothers and sisters in the Soviet Union and they were all intermarried.</span> <span id="s922">And one brother was coming back from the war and he stopped in Vilna to look for -- for Blechman family and he saw my sister.</span> <span id="s923">It’s my br -- my father’s brother.</span> <span id="s924">And then she went to this -- to Leningrad, at the time, the sain -- it’s Saint Petersburg now, to see them and they were very cold, they were afraid to talk to her, because they ask where I was, and she told them that I am in the United States, they were very afraid.</span> <span id="s925">Because Stalin’s times, it was different.</span> <span id="s926">And they -- they were -- they didn’t let her go even to see the grandmother, because they were afraid.</span> <span id="s927">And sh -- we never heard from them.</span> <span id="s928">I don’t know what happened to them.</span></p> <p><span id="s929">Q: When you went to Israel then, did you -- were -- you were visiting your sister?</span></p> <p><span id="s930">A: My sister, and we had some relatives there.</span> <span id="s931">My grandmother’s nephews and a few nephews who came from Germany.</span> <span id="s932">My grandmother was from Germany.</span> <span id="s933">My -- And her nephews came -- Ute aleamae -- I don’t know if you heard about it, that -- that they brought some children in from Germany to Israel and they came -- they were in Israel and I went to see them for the first time.</span> <span id="s934">It was emotional, you know, to see your relatives for the first time, you never knew them and all the rest perished in concentration camps.</span> <span id="s935">But, it was a nice reunion.</span></p> <p><span id="s936">Q: Was that when you went to the kibbutz, where you found out about your father?</span></p> <p><span id="s937">A: Not this time.</span> <span id="s938">It was about three years ago, when we went there to our granddaughter’s bat mitzvah, in -- she’s now 16, going to be 17.</span> <span id="s939">She’s -- It was about thr -- four years ago, three or four years ago, we went to Israel in -- during the summer, the whole family.</span> <span id="s940">The -- From Louisiana the kids and -- and we -- we went to Israel for the bat mitzvah, my granddaughter’s bat mitzvah.</span> <span id="s941">And while we were there, we went to the kibbutz, Lachaima agetta ot.</span> <span id="s942">And then when I saw the pictures.</span></p> <p><span id="s943">Q: Was that -- Did you -- Had your sister known about those pictures?</span></p> <p><span id="s944">A: Pictures?</span> <span id="s945">Yeah, she knew that, yeah.</span> <span id="s946">But she doesn’t talk about it.</span> <span id="s947">My sister doesn’t talk about her experiences, nothing about.</span> <span id="s948">Her children didn’t know anything about her.</span> <span id="s949">Nothing.</span> <span id="s950">And the first time they found out, one f -- her -- one of -- her younger daughter, after she finished the army, she came to the United States on a visit and she came to visit u-u-us.</span> <span id="s951">And we were sitting and talking and she asked me, “Can you tell us about your family and how it was in the concentration camps, because my mother doesn’t want to talk about anything.”</span> <span id="s952">I told her a lot of things.</span> <span id="s953">She says, “I wish our mother told us about everything, we would understand her better.”</span> <span id="s954">And she still doesn’t want to talk about it.</span> <span id="s955">Sometimes I tell her about -- is -- i-is -- you know, it comes out, to talk about.</span> <span id="s956">She doesn’t want to talk about.</span> <span id="s957">There are a lot of newcomers in this country, they don’t want to talk about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s958">Q: What do you think made you different f-from them?</span></p> <p><span id="s959">A: I don’t know.</span> <span id="s960">You know, a mother can have 10 children and every child is different.</span></p> <p><span id="s961">Q: I’m imagining you seeing your sister after 18 years and you spent the war together being so close, I mean, you were the closest thing --</span></p> <p><span id="s962">A: [indecipherable]</span></p> <p><span id="s963">Q: -- people -- person you had was each other.</span></p> <p><span id="s964">A: Yeah, that’s right.</span></p> <p><span id="s965">Q: And was it really -- was it hard for you to not talk to her over those years?</span></p> <p><span id="s966">A: It was hard.</span> <span id="s967">I was always thinking about her, where is she, if she’s still alive, if -- I knew -- I knew she was in Vilno, but I didn’t know where and what, what she was doing, what -- what happening, I -- n-nothing, because when Stalin was in power, you couldn’t get in touch with them.</span> <span id="s968">We couldn’t -- We didn’t know anything what was going on there.</span> <span id="s969">And -- And after Stalin died, I got in touch with her and then I -- I started to be after her to get out of there.</span> <span id="s970">I told you, go to see Aunt Pauline and then Uncle Israel.</span> <span id="s971">And that’s how they went.</span></p> <p><span id="s972">Q: And when you finally saw her, did you talk together about -- what did you talk about, what --</span></p> <p><span id="s973">A: About life in Israel, about the life -- about the children and that -- sh-she wouldn’t want to talk anything about the concentration camps, nothing.</span> <span id="s974">She wouldn’t want to -- she didn’t want to mention, like -- like it never happened to her.</span></p> <p><span id="s975">Q: About the children and -- in your first interview, you mentioned that it was hard for you when your children were born.</span></p> <p><span id="s976">A: It was very hard.</span> <span id="s977">I didn’t know how to deal with that.</span> <span id="s978">And I had problems, you know, nerves, depression.</span> <span id="s979">And -- But, got -- But, we managed and we did the best we could and thank God my children are wonderful.</span> <span id="s980">Never were on drugs.</span> <span id="s981">Never were into alcohol.</span> <span id="s982">Never smoked.</span> <span id="s983">Turn out all right.</span> <span id="s984">The older one graduated high school.</span> <span id="s985">She wasn’t the best student, but sh-she had a lot of personality -- the fat one.</span> <span id="s986">And she was accepted in Leslie College, in Massachusetts, teacher’s college.</span> <span id="s987">She was even accepted in New York, Stern’s College, too.</span> <span id="s988">That’s a -- But she didn’t want to go there.</span> <span id="s989">She wanted to go to Leslie College.</span> <span id="s990">And she went to Leslie College and she was a -- a student, a regular.</span> <span id="s991">But the last year in the schoo -- in college, she made the Dean’s list and she was one of the best students graduated.</span> <span id="s992">And she’s teaching and then she went -- teaching grammar school, she wanted.</span> <span id="s993">And then she

asked the principal to put their kids in her class, she was such a good teacher.</span> <span id="s995">She has -- She’s a very good -- she has a lot of personality.</span> <span id="s996">She is a very good -- she’s only too fat.</span> <span id="s997">You can’t do anything about it.</span> <span id="s998">Tried, but we can’t do anything.</span> <span id="s999">And my younger daughter, graduate -- she always was a good student, she always wanted to compete with somebody.</span> <span id="s1000">And she always competed with another girl and they always fought with each other because of that.</span> <span id="s1001">But when they went to college, one went to Clark and she went to Brandeis, then they became very good friends.</span> <span id="s1002">And th -- since then, they are very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s1003">She is in Israel, my daughter and she -- the other one is in New York so-somewhere.</span> <span id="s1004">She’s divorced now, bitter divorce.</span>

know what she wanted from her life.</span> <span id="s1007">She worked for a year in a pharmacy store, CVS in Boston.</span> <span id="s1008">And then she decided to go to Israel to see what’s what.</span> <span id="s1009">She wanted to go in the beginning to law school or journalism.</span> <span id="s1010">She couldn’t make up her mind, to go to Arizona, to go to California, to go further away from -- from here.</span> <span id="s1011">Then she decided she’ll go to see what’s going on in Israel.</span> <span id="s1012">She went to Israel, she liked it there and she was teaching English as a foreign language, but she didn’t like teaching.</span> <span id="s1013">Sh-She couldn’t take it.</span> <span id="s1014">And she met her husband there.</span> <span id="s1015">They got married and she’s working now with Anglo-Saxons refugees.</span> <span id="s1016">And she likes it very much and they like her, too.</span></p> <p><span id="s1017">Q: Had you ever wanted to live in Israel yourself.</span> <span id="s1018">Your fa -- You said your father was a Zionist, right?</span></p> <p><span id="s1019">A: Yes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1020">Q: And did you ever have Zionist

don’t like the government there now, what’s going on there.</span> <span id="s1029">I would wish they would make peace, but it’s not up to me.</span> <span id="s1030">I can’t say anything, I can’t

id="s1055">A: In the -- In the beginning, when I moved here, I didn’t like it.</span> <span id="s1056">I was -- we didn’t have a car, we didn’t have a television.</span> <span id="s1057">We were sitting and wa -- listening to the radio, evenings.</span> <span id="s1058">We couldn’t go anywhere.</span> <span id="s1059">And it was a -- it was -- it wasn’t easy and I didn’t know anybody.</span> <span id="s1060">Excuse me.</span> <span id="s1061">And life wasn’t easy here.</span> <span id="s1062">My husband was working, he was making a living.</span> <span id="s1063">I had, at the time, one child.</span> <span id="s1064">I was pregnant -- I had started to be -- then I became pregnant with my other child and -- and I didn’t like it here, because they were very snobby here in the beginning, the Jewish co-community.</span> <span id="s1065">If you’re not born in Portland, you’re a stranger.</span> <span id="s1066">Not only in the Jewish si -- in the -- in general, in the general community it’s like that.</span> <span id="s1067">But after awhile, after my daughter started to go to school -- my older one, I became active in PTA.</span> <span id="s1068">I became active in the Haddassah organization and then I started to make friends and -- and since then, I wouldn’t want to move anywhere else.</span> <span id="s1069">I love it here.</span></p> <p><span id="s1070">Q: Do you have friends or interactions in the non-Jewish community as well here, or has that --</span></p> <p><span id="s1071">A: Oh yeah, we have friends.</span> <span id="s1072">I have neighbors here, wonderful neighbors.</span> <span id="s1073">She’s cr -- She’s Catholic and she goes to church twice a day and she prays for me every time.</span> <span id="s1074">And we are very good friends, now I’m joking only.</span> <span id="s1075">And across the street I have neighbors, too, very, very good friends.</span> <span id="s1076">And there were another friends here, too.</span> <span id="s1077">They moved away, but we are still friends.</span> <span id="s1078">We send each other Christmas cards.</span> <span id="s1079">We have non-Jewish friends, too.</span> <span id="s1080">We are active in the Jewish community, try to do as much as we can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1081">Q: What do you do?</span></p> <p><span id="s1082">A: Not -- Not as much as now, because I -- in the beginning, when we didn’t go away to Florida, I used to do volunteer work at the Jewish home for the aged.</span> <span id="s1083">Used to go every -- once a week.</span> <span id="s1084">Now it’s seeders, I don’t go too often -- I -- I don’t go now, because in the winter we are not here and this year I didn’t feel good, I had some problems, I did-didn’t go.</span> <span id="s1085">And then a lot of Russians came into this count -- into this city.</span> <span id="s1086">We were busy with the Russian Jews and Jerry was busy with Russian -- with Poles, not -- not even Jewish Poles, Polish people.</span> <span id="s1087">And the -- I wasn’t busy with them because he -- he was their interpreter, but they used to come to the house, we used to talk with them.</span> <span id="s1088">I came back to me to pol -- to talk Polish again.</span> <span id="s1089">What I forgot, it came back.</span> <span id="s1090">And we were busy with volunteer work.</span> <span id="s1091">He used to [indecipherable] volunteer -- he’ll talk to you about it.</span></p> <p><span id="s1092">Q: So you don’t live here year round then?</span></p> <p><span id="s1093">A: No, we go to Florida in -- in November.</span> <span id="s1094">We are going November 11th this year.</span> <span id="s1095">And we will come back probably by April 15th or some like that.</span> <span id="s1096">Cause my husband is busy with his flowers -- with the garden.</span></p> <p><span id="s1097">Q: I was wondering, before I knew that, whether it was difficult for you to be in a place with such cold winters, after what you experienced during the war and the coldness.</span></p> <p><span id="s1098">A: It’s cold -- It was cold, I had problems with my feet because they were -- they are frostbitten.</span> <span id="s1099">And before it gets cold, I get -- it hurts and then when it’s -- in the spring, the frost -- it defrosts and it hurts too, but I do the best I can, I can’t do anything else.</span></p> <p><span id="s1100">Q: Is it difficult emotionally to be in a cold place?</span></p> <p><span id="s1101">A: No, not -- no -- when I was here, I got used to it, I th -- and I used to be in -- before, in Poland the same -- the same climate was practically, Poland.</span> <span id="s1102">Win-Winter, spring, summer, fall, like here.</span> <span id="s1103">I was used to it, but now I don’t like too much cold, I got used to the warm weather -- to Florida.</span> <span id="s1104">But, if I would have to stay here, I would stay here, and that’s all.</span> <span id="s1105">Do the best I can and that’s that.</span></p> <p><span id="s1106">Q: I wanted to go back to something that I m-missed asking you before and that was just in -- in the immediate years, right following the war, when you’re sp -- you’re spending those years in Germany, were you -- what was your predominant feeling at the time?</span> <span id="s1107">Were you just trying to get the -- get things done so you could come to the US?</span> <span id="s1108">Did you feel -- or did you feel angry, were you emotional?</span> <span id="s1109">Did you have desire for revenge?</span> <span id="s1110">What -- What was going on inside of you?</span></p> <p><span id="s1111">A: No, revenge I wouldn’t say, but I -- I was angry, very angry.</span> <span id="s1112">I didn’t like -- you know, I didn’t like to live in Germany.</span> <span id="s1113">I -- Especially, I ha -- I had the anger, the resentment of the older people.</span> <span id="s1114">The young people, I didn’t have anything against them and I still don’t, because it’s not their fault what happened.</span> <span id="s1115">And I am su -- and they have a lot of problems now to accept what had happened in Germany, what their fathers or grandfathers did.</span> <span id="s1116">And I don’t have anything against them.</span> <span id="s1117">I am mellowing a lot.</span> <span id="s1118">But still, when I see a -- the -- the st -- the -- hotencrites -- I don’t know how to say in po -- in the --</span></p> <p><span id="s1119">Q: Swastika?</span></p> <p><span id="s1120">A: Swastika, yeah, the swastika or I hear about what’s anti-Semitism, I shiver.</span> <span id="s1121">Sa -- well, the skinheads in Germany, something.</span> <span id="s1122">They have a lot of them there.</span> <span id="s1123">And I read of some -- I don’t know why, but I still read about those -- I got a magazine from Wiesenthal get it and I -- sometimes I see on television we see -- we see things.</span> <span id="s1124">It hurts very, very much, but I don’t have anything against the young people.</span> <span id="s1125">I wouldn’t go to Germany anyway.</span> <span id="s1126">I wouldn’t -- I try not to buy German stuff.</span> <span id="s1127">I’d rather buy American stuff than German or Japanese or any.</span> <span id="s1128">Like to buy American stuff, made in America.</span> <span id="s1129">But sometimes I don’t have any choice in clothes.</span></p> <p><span id="s1130">Q: So was there a point where you and your husband started talking about your experiences and you -- it sounded like in the beginning, you really didn’t know about your --</span></p> <p><span id="s1131">A: In the beginning, after we met and after we were courting each other and we were -- we talked about it.</span> <span id="s1132">I told him where I was and what happened in my family.</span> <span id="s1133">He sac -- told me about his family and we talked about it, yes.</span> <span id="s1134">And when -- then, when I talked to my children about it, too, when they became older enough -- old enough, te -- 12 years old, about this age.</span> <span id="s1135">You can’t talk too early to them.</span> <span id="s1136">Then I spoke to them about -- told them about my experiences and where I was and about my parents, about the ki -- all of my life.</span> <span id="s1137">And encouraged them to read books about the Holocaust and encouraged them to see, if -- if there was a movie about it, to let them know what was going on -- I tried to.</span></p> <p><span id="s1138">Q: Was it important to you to marry a Holocaust survivor?</span></p> <p><span id="s1139">A: No.</span> <span id="s1140">Didn’t -- Didn’t matter to me.</span> <span id="s1141">Only a decent, honest person.</span> <span id="s1142">You take a chance anyway.</span> <span id="s1143">You never know.</span> <span id="s1144">In the beginning, they’re the best and later in life, some people change.</span> <span id="s1145">And -- but I am lucky.</span></p> <p><span id="s1146">Q: And when you talked about having children and the difficulty, did you -- do you think that the -- did that have to do with having lost your own parents?</span> <span id="s1147">What was the -- do you know what -- do you have a sense of what the cause was of your nerves and the trouble that you had?</span></p> <p><span id="s1148">A: Yes, I knew the -- the Holocaust had a lot to do to my nerves and depression.</span> <span id="s1149">I had a lot of problems depression.</span> <span id="s1150">Sometimes I used to drive the car and used to say, “Oh, I wish I would get in an accident, get killed.”</span> <span id="s1151">For no reason at all.</span> <span id="s1152">I was -- I was happy.</span> <span id="s1153">I had children fine, they were very good children, didn’t have any problems with them.</span> <span id="s1154">My husband made a good living, but depression and nerves.</span> <span id="s1155">But, I’m getting over it.</span> <span id="s1156">I still have depressions, but I -- I try my best to get over it and -- and handle this as much as I can.</span></p> <p><span id="s1157">Q: Which reminds me, I meant to ask about your -- you were talking about how you felt about Germans back then.</span> <span id="s1158">How do you feel now about Germans and Germany?</span></p> <p><span id="s1159">A: I would -- I told you -- I wouldn’t go to Germany, it doesn’t appeal to me at all.</span> <span id="s1160">And I don't have anything against the young people, nothing.</span> <span id="s1161">It’s not their fault.</span> <span id="s1162">They’re -- have a hard time to en -- adjust themselves, some of them.</span> <span id="s1163">And that’s that.</span> <span id="s1164">And the older people are getting older, or they’re getting out of this world.</span> <span id="s1165">But, they have a -- they have problems too, to get through all these things, Germans.</span> <span id="s1166">I’m not mad at them now.</span> <span id="s1167">I don’t wish them anything bad.</span> <span id="s1168">[inaudible]</span></p> <p><span id="s1169">Q: What did it take to -- did it take time to get over the anger, or --</span></p> <p><span id="s1170">A: It took time, yes, took time, but you get over this after so many years, slow, slowly.</span></p> <p><span id="s1171">Q: Is there anything that you do regularly to memorialize your parents, or any kind of thing that you have in your daily life?</span></p> <p><span id="s1172">A: Well, I think about them.</span> <span id="s1173">I sometimes look at pictures and think about them.</span> <span id="s1174">And -- And that’s -- what else can memorialize -- burn a candle for a memorial [inaudible].</span> <span id="s1175">And I go to the synagogue for the high holidays only.</span> <span id="s1176">You can be a good Jew without that.</span> <span id="s1177">Don’t have to go -- to be too religious.</span> <span id="s1178">I keep a kosher home, because I started -- my grandpar -- my grandmother and my aunts and uncles all kept kosher and they liked it and I wanted them -- they were so good to me and I wanted them to come to eat in my hou -- End of Tape Two, Side B
