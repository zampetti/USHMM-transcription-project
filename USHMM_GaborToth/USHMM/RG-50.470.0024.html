you came into Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s4">NICK WHITE: I recall it was on April the 29th, 1945.</span> <span id="s5">When units of the sixth corps, the third, the 45th, and the 36th division, part of the seventh army, c- c- captured, or over- over- overrun the Dachau camp where they had taken so many of the Jewish people.</span> <span id="s6">But anyway the first thing as we come into the camp, uh, a man by the name of Engelhart from Detroit, Michigan was, was the with me, and uh the reason that we were able to get some pictures because he was a professional photographer and so anytime he could catch, he was able to find German film or German cameras, that was an excellent opportunity to get pictures.</span> <span id="s7">But anyway we went into this camp, I said, as I said before, shortly after, after daylight.</span> <span id="s8">And the first thing that we encountered was, there was a, there was a moat that was surrounding part of the camp anyway, and we were surprised at the number of dead SS soldiers that were uh, we were seeing as we come into the camp, and the reason why there were so many of them, some of them were floating in the moat and some of them were laying alongside in the streets and the reason why there were so many of them was because these were not the ordinary German soldiers.</span> <span id="s9">These men were trained SS troopers who had been indoctrinated down through the years that the Jewish race was an offense to them and for they had one thought in mind, that was the el-, annihilation of the Jewish race.</span> <span id="s10">So as I said, these were liber- um group of men so, in other words, an ordinary German soldier, when they would be surrounded, would immediately surrender.</span> <span id="s11">But these men fought hard because they didn't want these, this terrible uh truth to get, be revealed of what had taken or Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s12">Wentworth

prisoners taken and so they were strewn pretty much all over the camp.</span> <span id="s16">But I, one thing I do remember, uh, al- one of the streets, just adjacent to this moat, there was a um, the body of a German soldier, and standing beside him was a police dog.</span> <span id="s17">And that dog didn't pay any attention whatever to us.</span> <span id="s18">He just stared straight ahead, he act like he didn't even see us, and yet here again was, this dog had been trained to look upon those people as a threat to him, and so, whenever his master was, his life was taken, he come up with no reason for being there.</span> <span id="s19">And so he just set like a statue, and I thought, what a shame that this dog had given up his whatever he had, his personality, was missing, as a normal, my son has a dog out on the farm, and when I go to visit him...</span></p> <p><span id="s20">SWB: Let's stop for a minute...</span></p> <p><span id="s21">[CUT] SWB: Why don't we back up and start with you just walking into the camp and try to just take yourself back in time, and tell me what it was like.</span></p> <p><span id="s22">NICK WHITE: Well I, as I look on it now, but it's of course fifty years ago, but um, as I, as I said about what I seen on this dog was a parallel to what the German officers, the relationship they had with the Jewish people was that there was a threat and they should be removed, and so this dog had been taught that very thing, and when his trainer or owner was no longer able to give him instructions, he became as of no use to himself, and so I thought this was a dark dark day in history, even for a German police dog.</span> <span id="s23">But from there we Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

poultry building that we might see down in Missouri, uh, perhaps a hundred feet long and maybe twenty-five feet wide.</span></p> <p><span id="s28">But as we went into this first barracks, we were overrun almost by about 25 or 30 of these inmates, who came and hugged us and tried to show us the gratitude they had for us being there liberating them.</span> <span id="s29">Actually we did not reli- liberate them, it was the infantry units themselves that liberated these people but anyway, they were so overwhelmed with emotion that they tried every way they could to show us appreciation but I remember this young man, his name was, we called him Bud, he and I both had some caramels and I had some K ration biscuits, and we started to distribute them among these soldiers.</span> <span id="s30">Or rather, these camp inmates.</span> <span id="s31">And um, the net result was all, we almost started a riot, because they fought like animals, trying to re- to ris- to get anything that looked like food.</span> <span id="s32">And I, this man and I have discussed that since then and we have never encountered such a atmosphere of complete um desolation of the, of mankind.</span> <span id="s33">And then I recall that in these, in this um building itself, it was made like shelves that went clear to the ceiling and they would be just maybe two feet wide and two feet square, and these went the full length of the building, and these people would climb up and slide into these slots, I guess, I guess you could call them, and not a blanket, not any kind of bed clothes at all.</span> <span id="s34">Nothing but pure wood.</span> <span id="s35">And there they slept at night, and no, no ventilation, and no sanitary, um, equipment that they would need.</span> <span id="s36">But that, uh, what bothered me the most, was out of these 25 or 30, there was 6 or 8 that just stared at the walls.</span> <span id="s37">I mean, there was not one bit of a feeling of or any kind of a expression of um who they were or what they were doing there.</span> <span id="s38">They just stared at the walls and I've often Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for

able to recover from that traumatic experience that they had been through.</span> <span id="s42">And so, that left me sad to say the least.</span> <span id="s43">I hope many of them recovered from that, but I have talked to doctors, they said, with the amount of trauma then been experienced, they may have never recovered.</span> <span id="s44">But we spoke to one of them who could speak English, and we asked him where are you going, and he said I'm going home.</span> <span id="s45">And so from there we went into the gas chamber and as we looked around the corridor of it, there was a, uh, nozzles of gas and the thing that, that um, I-I wanted to share with you that these people that were in the barracks were required to work as long as they could possibly work.</span> <span id="s46">When they were no longer able to work, they went out into the mines, into the fields, and harvest the grain and repaired railroads and repaired highways, whatever damage the American bombers were causing from day to day.</span> <span id="s47">That's where these people were out working.</span> <span id="s48">Yet they were so thin, I don't see how they could possibly work, but they were.</span> <span id="s49">When they could no longer work, then they were taken into the gas chamber, and they were told, remove their clothing, that they were going to get a shower.</span> <span id="s50">And instead of a shower, they were gassed by the hundreds.</span> <span id="s51">From the gas chamber, which was adjacent to the uh, mor- uh, crema- crematorium itself, was, we opened into a large corridor, a room, and there was...</span></p> <p><span id="s52">[CAMERA RELOAD]</span></p> <p><span id="s53">[CR#2] SWB: Okay, let's just back up to where you went in and saw the crematoria and the gas chambers, and just walk your way in and tell me what you saw.</span></p> <p><span id="s54">Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s55">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s56">2/10/95 Int.</span> <span id="s57">NICK WHITE Page 5 NICK WHITE: As we looked into the gas chamber, we had been told that there weren't any [clears throat] there weren't such as thing as nozzles, and yet it was not a water or a spray nozzle, but it was a nozzle made especially for gas to put these, to exterminate these people in a, quickly as possible.</span> <span id="s58">And so the net result was that they were um as-as-as soon as they were gassed then they were taken into this large room where they were piled high, and uh, it looked like they had just been taken and just grabbed by the legs and throw up in a, a large pile, and I- and I-I would estimate there were probably several thousand bodies in this area.</span> <span id="s59">And there was eight furnaces that were going full blast and these, for instance, were tended by um, several of the inmates who were garbed in the prison clothing, so we knew they also were inmates, and um I often wondered what a traumatic experience for these people to burn some of their own people, day by day, and is it any wonder that some of them had lost their whole sense of being, their personality seemed to have disappeared from them.</span></p> <p><span id="s60">SWB: What else did you see in that room with the bodies, describe the pile of bodies to me again.</span></p> <p><span id="s61">NICK WHITE: The pile of bodies, you have to, you'd had to been there or seen a picture to ex- appreciate how much these poor people had suffered before they were gassed even.</span></p> <p><span id="s62">It- it's just, it's untold the suffering that they must have had to endure even before that, uh, it's- it's just beyond any imagination what they had suffered, and so, I, as we went into this large area where this, these bodies were piled high, there was a sense of complete, uh, death, it seemed like its very atmosphere was death, and um, I've Working

never forgotten that and the odor was unbelievable, it was almost more than you could endure to be there, and yet these, these men that were tending these furnaces had to be there day and night.</span> <span id="s66">And uh, when we come into the camp, they were dyings, 500 a day, in the barrackses, in the barracks, themselves.</span> <span id="s67">And there were 33,000 people here.</span></p> <p><span id="s68">But as we [clears throat] when we left the crematorium then, and went outside, not very far away from this building, was a large, or a high fence, enclosed wire, with had been uh charged with electricity, but the, the gate had been opened, so, as we went out, we opened up this gate again, and there we found 39 open box cars, and so we climbed up to see what was there, and there we beheld, dozens, I mean dozens of dozens of people who had been brought in from who knows where, all over Europe maybe, and there they were allowed to be on that uh siding for perhaps several days.</span> <span id="s69">Some of them had froze to death, some of them had died from ex- um , starvation, and some had been uh gunned down by the, by the German guards when the Americans were approaching.</span> <span id="s70">And this is something I will never forget as long as I live, to see this, the very um, the very purpose of this whole, uh, camp was the destruction of the Israel people.</span></p> <p><span id="s71">SWB: Can you tell me about any interaction with individual prisoners that you might have had, did they smile?</span></p> <p><span id="s72">NICK WHITE: There was absolutely a smile on no one.</span> <span id="s73">It was nothing but death, even in those who were, who were uh able to speak with us.</span> <span id="s74">Their, their eyes were, had sunk clear back into their heads, and you, as-as-as I said, you had to be there to really understand how much these people had suffered.</span> <span id="s75">And I recall as we were there by that row of railroad cars, several of these had, that had been released, Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s76">Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ.</span> <span id="s77">2/10/95 Int.</span> <span id="s78">NICK WHITE Page 7 there was a garbage dump there, and I saw them pick up that garbage by the handfuls and eat it.</span> <span id="s79">I mean that was, they were starved to that point, where they would eat anything.</span></p> <p><span id="s80">SWB: Tell me about the pile of bodies and the one that was</span></p> <p><span id="s81">out of place.</span></p> <p><span id="s82">NICK WHITE: The, the picture that I have shows this, on one of the piles, probably maybe a thousand bodies in this particular pile, but the thing that was the most uh hard to understand, these people were able to get hold, ahold of the camp commander, and beat him to death, and then they tossed him up on the top of these poor people who had been gassed there shortly before that.</span></p> <p><span id="s83">SWB: Tell me what you knew when you arrived there.</span> <span id="s84">Had you been, did you know what to expect, tell me about your very</span></p> <p><span id="s85">first sensation.</span></p> <p><span id="s86">NICK WHITE: We had never been given any idea what it might be like.</span> <span id="s87">But only that the name Dachau, smelt, s-s- told us that it was something out of the ordinary, and that's the reason why we took advantage to go and visit that so early, so soon after it had been taken by the units of the seventh</span></p>

that perhaps we had these caramels and these um K-ration biscuits, maybe we could share some of them with them.</span> <span id="s99">And uh as we tried to uh pass them out to each one individual, all of a sudden we just, we could see we were causing nearly a riot, which we might uh, put ourself in jeopardy to be a part of.</span> <span id="s100">And so we um hastened to um to remove ourself from</span></p> <p><span id="s101">the area.</span></p> <p><span id="s102">SWB: Did the inmates make any sounds?</span> <span id="s103">Did they call out to you, do you remember?</span></p> <p><span id="s104">NICK WHITE: No, I don't recall, only this one man, we asked him, cause we were, we were concerned about, what are these people going to do.</span> <span id="s105">They're starving now, and um what are they going to, and no doubt many of them were hundreds of miles from their homeland, and yet this man said, I'm going home when we asked him where are you going, he said I'm going home, and yet, and, and then, as we went out of the camp, the roads were just packed with people, um, trying to get away from the camp as fast as they possibly could, to go anywhere but to be out of Dachau.</span></p> <p><span id="s106">SWB: Okay, thank you.</span></p> <p><span id="s107">[CUT] Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span id="s108">Wentworth

what was going on.</span></p> <p><span id="s111">What were the people doing, leaving going out the gates?</span></p> <p><span id="s112">Describe that to me.</span></p> <p><span id="s113">NICK WHITE: Well, as I remember, they was, there was thousands of them just aimlessly walking around the camp.</span></p> <p><span id="s114">They didn't seem to have anything in mind where they were going.</span> <span id="s115">Some of them were out on the highways, some of them were just standing out on the highways, some of them were movng south towards Munich.</span> <span id="s116">But most of them were aimlessly walking around the camp, uh, most of them, uh, had no where, no way to get to where they would like to go without walking, and most of them were unable to walk, because of their physical condition.</span> <span id="s117">Even those that we saw in the barracks, they were so thin, you could reach around their waist with two hands, I mean that's how thin they were and it was amazing to me that they could still walk.</span> <span id="s118">That was the amazing thing, that these had, those people had the ability to get up and walk, after suffering so much.</span></p> <p><span

come into the um crematorium uh itself, uh when we saw that, this tremendous body of people who had been, had endured so much and we could even see like they were still suffering on their faces, it seemed to carry on after they died, the horror that they had, uh, experienced.</span></p> <p><span id="s122">It was still on their faces, just as I talked about that police dog, all of a sudden he had no reason to be there.</span></p> <p><span id="s123">SWB: Tell me about how the inmates were still burning the Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.</span></p> <p><span

id="s127">bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s128">NICK WHITE: I, as I, we know that the German SS troops were all dead, so I don't know what may- motivated th- I think it was just because th-they didn't have any other reason to do it, but to go ahead and do something that was to be done.</span> <span id="s129">I don't think they even thought about it anymore, it just become mechanical to them, well they couldn't have kept doing it.</span> <span id="s130">Uh, that's the way it looked to me.</span> <span id="s131">Uh, them, I don't know why, what would motivate them, no one was standing over them with a gun anymore, but they were still pu- they would ta- they had ropes and they would drag them over to the furnaces.</span> <span id="s132">And it appeared there was a grate underneath where the ashes fell through and then they would pull this grate this back out and then pile the two more bodies on them.</span> <span id="s133">In one of the camps uh adjacent to this, which is in Poland, they were burning 4000 bodies a day.</span></p> <p><span id="s134">Well I have no idea how many they were burning here but we know there was at least 500 dying a day plus what they were destroying in the gas chamber.</span></p> <p><span id="s135">SWB: Tell me again about the pile of bodies and tell me that the, tell me the difference between the bodies and the commandant who was on top of the bodies.</span></p> <p><span id="s136">NICK WHITE: Uh, when we, when we saw that, and I guess I can use the term fat man, cause that's what he was, and when you, when you compared body with those poor people who were nothing but skin and bones, you thought, boy what, what a price that man paid for being a part of that.</span></p> <p><span id="s137">SWB: Describe to me the inmates and what they were

looked like it was, it was, they were so dirty you couldn't hardly see the color of them but, but they were supposed to have been white at one time.</span> <span id="s142">And uh the men, and I might add, there were no women in, and no children in this, in Dachau, they were all men, and most of them middle aged, even to maybe in the twenties, but none that were very old, but I would believe they were in no more than 40 at the most, and yet they were unshaven and uh, uh p-p- the, you can't describe how thin they were without seeing them.</span> <span id="s143">Uh, I guess there's no other way to describe it.</span> <span id="s144">You'd had to seen it to understand what they had endured.</span></p> <p><span id="s145">SWB: In your military career had you seen death before.</span></p> <p><span id="s146">NICK WHITE: Yes, but it seemed like before this there had been some, maybe a purpose to be gained by giving a life, we as Americans felt we were fulfilling a tremendous responsibility, and the American soldier laid his life on the line.</span> <span id="s147">But when you go into a camp, there's absolutely no purpose for that, that is of any value to mankind.</span>
